I am accompanied by my colleagues Mr. Michael Sheahan and Mr. Tim Drea.<\/p> <p>  Over the past two years, a number of reports emerged in the media alleging malpractice with regard to integrity issues in Irish horse racing.  These reports naturally raised concerns in an industry that is hugely valuable to the rural economy.  On foot of these reports, the committee invited officials from this Department and executives from HRI, the IHRB and the Irish Racehorse Trainers Association to a series of meetings in July 2021 to discuss anti-doping processes and systems in horse racing.<\/p><p>Following these meetings, this committee issued a report in November 2021 entitled Horse Racing in Ireland, which included 11 recommendations.  The Department welcomes the report, as do HRI and the IHRB.  We thank members for the considerable work invested in it and note that the report is broadly positive in content. <\/p><p> Along with the other bodies, the Department was heartened to see the regime of testing and anti-doping measures receive a favourable analysis in the independent review of the IHRB equine anti-doping programme conducted by Dr. Craig Suann.  He was broadly satisfied that the IHRB processes \"at least match international best practice in most respects\" and that the body \"has made significant advances in recent years\".<\/p><p> The recommendations in the joint committee's report have been carefully considered by the relevant bodies in parallel with those made by Dr. Suann in his report.  The Department will continue to work with other relevant stakeholders to ensure the highest standards of integrity and welfare are maintained.  The people of Ireland will not support horse racing if it is seen to be tainted with integrity concerns.  Efforts to counteract the issue of drug taking in any sport, including horse racing, are part of ongoing integrity development processes.<\/p><p> With regard to the organisation of horse racing, HRI is a commercial State body established under the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001.  It is responsible for the overall administration, promotion and development of the horse racing industry.  It falls under the aegis of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  As of 1 January 2018, the IHRB has been the statutory regulatory body for all horse racing in Ireland.  Its role is provided for in the Horse Racing Ireland Act 2016 and subsequent statutory instruments.  However, the body itself remains a private entity.  The Horse Racing Ireland Act 2016 provides for a funding mechanism under which the costs of integrity services provided by the IHRB are guaranteed by HRI annually.  With regard to Exchequer funding for horse racing, section 12 of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001 provides for Exchequer support to given to the horse and greyhound racing industries through the horse and greyhound racing fund.  Some &euro;88 million was allocated to the fund in budget 2022, of which &euro;70.4 million was allocated to HRI.<\/p><p> As to the Department&rsquo;s role in regulation, the Department is the principal regulator of the agrifood sector while the IHRB regulates horse racing, as I have outlined.  There are compliance issues that are of interest to both regulatory bodies.  These specifically relate to the use and supply of illegal substances in racing and the inappropriate use and supply of veterinary medicines for use in equines.  Animal welfare is another such issue.  Certain areas where the Department has regulatory responsibilities may involve prosecution through the courts.  In these cases, Department-authorised officers lead or advise on investigations, prepare prosecution files and liaise with the Chief State Solicitor's office or the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions to see cases through the court system. <\/p><p> In August 2020, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine formally signed a memorandum of understanding between his Department and the IHRB providing for officers of the IHRB to be given powers as authorised officers by the Minister under section 10 of the Animal Remedies Act 1993, as amended, thus enhancing the IHRB&rsquo;s investigative powers with regard to the use of animal remedies.  This memorandum aims to advance the already collaborative working arrangements between the Department and the IHRB to improve the oversight, investigative and enforcement powers of the horse racing industry to support animal welfare and to strengthen domestic and international confidence in its brand.  While it extends the powers of the IHRB officers, the memorandum of understanding does not alter the criteria or sanctioning process of the IHRB.  Related prosecutions will remain at the discretion of the Department.<\/p><p> On the response to the committee&rsquo;s report on horse racing, the committee will have received a letter from the Minister earlier this week setting out the observations of the Department, HRI and the IHRB to the recommendations in the committee&rsquo;s report and providing an update on actions or activities undertaken.  I thank members for their attention.  My colleagues and I are available to provide any further clarifications and to take any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022060100002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Caroline Ball","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654038000,"counter":8,"content":"<p>On behalf of the IHRB, I thank the Chair and members of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine for their invitation to appear before it.  I am the interim chief executive of the IHRB and the head of licensing and legal and compliance.  I am joined by my colleague, Dr. Lynn Hillyer, the head of anti-doping and chief veterinary officer for the IHRB, and Mr. Martin O&rsquo;Donnell, chairman of the IHRB board of directors.<\/p> <p>  The IHRB was delighted to accept the committee&rsquo;s invitation to attend today and to take up the opportunity to discuss the committee&rsquo;s report and highlight the steps we are taking to respond to its recommendations.  At the outset, I acknowledge the interest of the members of the committee in the work we do to regulate horse racing in Ireland.  I welcome the committee&rsquo;s willingness to include this issue in its work programme last year and the publication of its comprehensive report last November.  Following the publication of the committee&rsquo;s report, we reviewed the recommendations made by the committee.  We continue to endeavour to build these into our actions.<\/p> <p>  The Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board CLG is a company set up by the Turf Club and Irish National Hunt Steeplechase Committee to carry out the functions assigned to the racing regulatory body under the Horse Racing Ireland Act 2016.  The IHRB is responsible for regulating the integrity of Irish racing including equine doping control.  It carries out its functions through a team of highly trained professional racing officials and administrative staff in addition to dedicated and experienced voluntary race day stewards and committee members.  The IHRB operates under a service level agreement with Horse Racing Ireland with regard to the provision of integrity services.  The Horse Racing Ireland Act 2016 provides that HRI is responsible for guaranteeing funding to the IHRB to carry out its functions through an integrity services budget, which is agreed annually.<\/p> <p>  The IHRB recently announced the appointment of Darragh O&rsquo;Loughlin as incoming CEO.  His appointment will effect from 29 June next.  Mr. O'Loughlin has an exceptional combination of regulatory expertise and long experience in sectoral development and advocacy from his roles as secretary general of the Irish Pharmacy Union and as a member of the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, the pharmacy regulator.  I am sure that members of the committee will have the opportunity to meet with Mr. O'Loughlin following his appointment.<\/p> <p>  In response to the committee report&rsquo;s recommendation that an independent review be carried out by an international expert to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s procedures match best international practice, in January 2022, the IHRB requested that Dr. Craig Suann undertake a review of the organisation&rsquo;s equine anti-doping programme.  In terms of achieving the necessary level of independence and the appropriate level of expertise and experience, Dr. Suann was, in our opinion, ideal.  He is an Australia-based, globally recognised expert.  He is the former chief veterinary officer for New South Wales and his collaborative work with the Australian Racing Forensic Laboratory has been instrumental in ensuring the first-time detection of several prohibited substances.  Dr. Suann undertook a comprehensive and detailed review of the IHRB&rsquo;s equine anti-doping programme.  His report concluded that he was satisfied that it \"at least match international best practice in most respects and has made significant advances in recent years.\"  Dr. Suann made a number of recommendations \"with the intention of enhancing the robustness of the programme&rsquo;s processes and outcomes\".  We refer the members of the committee to Dr. Suann&rsquo;s report.<\/p> <p>  The IHRB&rsquo;s equine anti-doping programme, led by Dr. Hillyer, has developed into a sophisticated and extensive risk-based and intelligence-led strategy in which it is not just the numbers of samples which matter, but from what horse they are taken and where and when they are taken.  In recent years, the IHRB has undertaken a range of initiatives designed to make significant progress in modernising our systems.  The IHRB has increased testing capabilities and is the first racing authority to routinely take hair samples at race meetings as well as in out-of-competition testing.  Similarly, the appointment of IHRB staff as authorised officers has greatly enhanced the investigation capabilities of the organisation.  This is considered to be a world-leading and groundbreaking initiative.  It effectively means we now have access to any thoroughbred, anywhere, at any time.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Suann&rsquo;s report, undertaken as a direct response by the IHRB to the committee&rsquo;s recommendation, demonstrates that our equine anti-doping programme is fit for purpose and operates to the best international standards.  The IHRB is currently reviewing the recommendations made by Dr. Suann to see where our programme can be strengthened.<\/p> <p>  The installation of CCTV cameras at Irish racecourses is a priority for the IHRB and the prominence of this issue in the report is evidence of its importance to the committee.  The IHRB has sought to progress this project to the installation phase as quickly as possible and had hoped to have the installation completed prior to the commencement of the 2022 season.  The project has been delayed as a result of the complexity of the procurement process and legal correspondence received in relation to that process which extended the standstill period to 28 January 2022.  The extension of the standstill period postponed the conclusion of the procurement phase and, as a result, delayed the commencement of the installation phase.  We regret that the original timeline for the project has had to be adjusted but this has been unavoidable under the circumstances.  The project is now progressing to the installation phase with the framework agreement signed on 29 March.  Site surveys have also been completed by Clardex Systems and a project manager is now in place to conduct the oversight of the project directly.  A timeline for the installation work is being agreed with each individual racecourse, taking into consideration the race day schedules that exist.  The project is planned to be completed by autumn this year.  As the installation phase commences, we will compete the committee updated as to the progress being made.<\/p><p> The IHRB recognises the importance of having a board which reflects the industry and wider Irish society while considering the role of the IHRB as the regulator of the sport.  We understand the importance this was given by the committee in its reports and want to assure the committee that we are committed to achieving the objective of 40% gender balance at board level, in line with Government guidelines, and recognise the benefit independent members with relevant skillsets can bring to the organisation.  Since the committee&rsquo;s report, we have been working on the process to allow for the appointment of two independent directors to the board.  These positions have now been advertised and the recruitment process is under way.<\/p><p> The IHRB is the regulatory body for all horse racing on the island of Ireland.  As an organisation, we are very proud of our historic roots stretching back more than 200 years and of the level of voluntary support we get from people and communities across the island.  Historically, the senior stewards and directors of the IHRB are nominated from the cohort of volunteers who dedicate significant time to the sport and have experience as stewards at race day and point-to-points.  We want to continue to retain that support at local level and benefit from the vast experience that our volunteers provide but to do this in a way that complies with the highest standards of governance underpinned by legislation.<\/p><p> The Horse Racing Ireland Act 2016 sets out the IHRB&rsquo;s functions, provides for the funding mechanism under which the costs of integrity services are guaranteed by HRI and requires that the annual financial statements of the IHRB be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General, submitted to the Minister and laid before the Oireachtas.  The IHRB also complies with the code of practice for governance of State bodies.<\/p><p> Following a process of public procurement in 2018, LGC Laboratories was selected to provide laboratory services and sample analysis for the IHRB.  Working with LGC, the organisation has been able to reduce the cost per unit of samples and increase the number of samples that can be taken.  From 1 January 2022 to the end of April 2022, a total of 2,009 samples have been taken, of which 66% were taken on the racecourse and at point-to-points and 34% were taken as part of the out-of-competition programme.  In the same period in 2021, 968 samples were taken, of which 930 were taken on the racecourse and 38 were out-of-competition testing.  Of the 2,009 samples taken so far in 2022, four have returned an adverse analytical finding, which is 0.2%.  There have been 40 disciplinary hearings held by the IHRB so far this year, nine of which related to adverse analytical findings.<\/p><p> In carrying out its anti-doping testing programme, the IHRB applies a risk analysis and intelligence-based strategy to its selection of premises and horses for testing.  The focus is to obtain the right sample from the right horse at the right time.  The appointment of IHRB officials as authorised officers under the Animal Remedies Act enables the IHRB to access thoroughbreds at any time at any venue, even when they are not on licensed premises.  Between January and June 2021, 18 premises were inspected by the IHRB&rsquo;s authorised officers.  This number rose to 141 by the end of the year, after the organisation was able to reactivate inspections following Covid-19 restrictions.  The IHRB has had a much stronger start to 2022, with 87 premises already inspected so far this year, seven of which were unlicensed.<\/p><p> The IHRB understands the need for confidentiality in such cases to guarantee success.  The inspections are unannounced, with a specific process in operation to ensure that only those who need to know where the team is going know.  This is restricted to the head of anti-doping in the first instance, with the lead investigating officer being informed the evening before and the rest of the team informed only at rendezvous on the morning of the inspection.<\/p><p> The IHRB has a top-class equine anti-doping team, headed up by Dr. Hillyer, which meets international best practice, having made significant advances in recent years, as highlighted by Dr. Suann&rsquo;s report.  This team works alongside and is supported by colleagues who are highly skilled and experienced in their field, and passionate about their roles in horse racing.  The organisation will continue to work to implement the recommendations of Dr. Suann&rsquo;s review of the equine anti-doping programme and this committee&rsquo;s report on horse racing in Ireland.<\/p><p> I again thank the Chair and members of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine for giving us the opportunity to address them regarding the progress we have made in implementing the recommendations made by this committee.  The IHRB looks forward to working with this committee in the future and will endeavour to keep the committee and its members updated of the progress we make as we continue to strengthen our anti-doping programme.  We would be pleased to engage with any questions or issues that members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022060100002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Cliodhna Guy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654038000,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I am representing Horse Racing Ireland, HRI, and Suzanne Eade, who, as members know, appears before this committee in a few weeks' time.  I thank the committee for this opportunity to update it on the progress we have made since we met last July.<\/p> <p>  HRI is a commercial State body under the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Our mission is to administer, promote and develop horse racing and breeding on the island of Ireland.  HRI manages many elements of horse racing day-to-day, such as registration of horses, race planning and programming, entries and declarations, prize money and owner accounts.  We assist in the provision of certain specialist services to racing, for example, the modernisation of starting stalls procedures and world-leading photo-finish equipment and personnel are niche areas of excellence in what we do.  We have also set about improving the racing infrastructure through a capital investment programme which has seen great improvements in racecourse facilities for spectators, workers and horses.<\/p> <p>  At our foundation in 2001, the role of an independent regulator was specifically called out and the IHRB fulfils that role.  We have a good working relationship with the IHRB and its officers, who set and enforce the rules of racing.  Both HRI and IHRB work to an annual budget determined, as with all budgetary matters, through an annual allocation from which all our responsibilities are accounted for.<\/p> <p>  We are here today principally to focus on the findings of this committee from its deliberations last year and to report to it on our progress with implementation of those recommendations.  We are satisfied that progress has been made on all fronts.   The recently published Suann report on anti-doping was reassuring, stating how our standards match or surpass the best practices worldwide, and we are always seeking to improve upon that strong position.  This conclusion broadly matched the positive endorsement that this committee&rsquo;s report conveyed in November 2021.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the specific findings of the committee, much of it will be covered by my colleagues in the IHRB.  One area which attracted much comment last year was the provision of CCTV cameras in stable yards and the committee&rsquo;s recommendation that it be expedited.  If I may focus on this for a moment, it is fair to point out that this objective will be delivered on as soon as is possible.  The delivery has been slower than originally anticipated.  We have control systems on all our expenditure.  The complexity of the specification was partly due to each stable yard across 25 different racecourses being very different.  The procurement process was competitive and robust.  These controls are important.  We have a contractor in place, work has commenced and it will be completed by the end of the year.  This project demonstrates how we work collaboratively with racecourses and the regulator to achieve our mutual objective of world-leading horse racing with the highest standards of integrity.<\/p> <p>  We do not stand still, particularly in the context of the high reputation our racing enjoys.  The integrity of the racing results, which impacts directly on the value of our racehorses, their care and well-being, and also the value of our betting product, is reliant on trust.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022060100002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Osborne"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":11,"content":"<p>At the beginning, I said that Senator Mullen was substituting for Senator Boyhan.  That is not the case and Senator Boyhan is attending as a full member of the committee.  I want to clarify that for the record.<\/p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for their opening statements.  This is a hugely important industry for our country and its integrity is paramount.  As a committee, we felt last year it was important, due to comments that were being made in the media, that we would devote time to it and, as was said, we issued a comprehensive report on the industry.  To respond to one of the points made today, I am disappointed that the CCTV footage has not progressed faster because I believe it is very important.<\/p> <p>  Ms Guy&rsquo;s statement noted that the IHRB inspected a number of premises and that some were unlicensed.  She might clarify how unlicensed premises exist and why these premises are unlicensed when there are thoroughbred horses on the premises.<\/p><p>Does the IHRB distinguish between going to a licensed premises as against an unlicensed premises?<\/p><p>Another bugbear of mine is the registration of thoroughbreds and horses.  When the IHRB goes to a premises to do testing, unless there is an accurate live register of the animals there how can it be sure its testing is comprehensive of all the thoroughbreds in that ownership?  An inspector comes to the farm in the case of bovine tests.  Whether it is ten, 50 or 100 animals, they all have to be there and accounted for on the day.  Where stands the thoroughbred industry and horse racing in general, not just thoroughbreds?  I have a bee in my bonnet about the number of horses that are not microchipped, although most of them are not thoroughbreds.  It is a discussion we have had with the Department in other forums and it comes up a lot when we talk about welfare of horses.  In many cases, when there are welfare issues, the horses are not microchipped.  They are not thoroughbreds, however, and I accept fully that the microchipping of thoroughbreds is 100% comprehensive.<\/p><p> I know other members want to come in.

It was a default to enter as authorised officers.<\/p> <p>  On the point about how we can ensure we adequately test or examine all the animals on the premises, the Chairman is right that without a full traceability database that is challenging.  What we do to mitigate the risks in the spheres of anti-doping and welfare is examine and inspect every animal we can on the premises.  If we expect there to be a horse that is not present, we go and find that animal, as far as we possibly can.  We know what to expect in respect of horses returned in training.

As we discussed at our most recent visit to the committee, we always talk about how good our cattle traceability system is and to a lesser extent, how good our sheep and pig systems are.  The horse system, while it has come a long way, is not at the same stage as the AIM system for cattle.  Having said that, we should acknowledge that we have come a long way from where we started our journey to trace horses.  The Department became involved in horse traceability in 2012.  In that year, we introduced a central database for the first time.  In 2013 or 2014, the change of ownership legislation was introduced.  In 2014, EU legislation, and Irish legislation thereafter, considerably strengthened the identification of horses because it included the need for them to be microchipped and so on.<\/p> <p>  We mentioned at the most recent meeting we had with the committee that we were planning an equine census.  That census happened in November 2021.  There will be a further equine census in November 2022 because there were some issues with the technology and so on in last year's census.  We are moving towards more real-time information about where horses are at any time.  There are particular difficulties with tracking horses compared to cattle because as part of the training and breeding processes, horses move considerably more often.  We are moving in that direction but it is unrealistic to say we could introduce that recommendation immediately.  The census was an important step on that journey and there will be a follow-on census in November this year which we hope will build on that progress.  There are plans to give people access to the equivalent on an AIM database that will allow horse owners to update their profile in real time, similar to the process in respect of cattle.  It will take a bit of time but significant progress is being made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022060100002#G00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Sheahan"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":131,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Sheahan.

Our starting point for all of these interactions is to consider what is in the best interests of Irish horse racing.  The committee has made a number of recommendations and observations, and arrived at conclusions, following consultation with all the players in the sector and the general public.  The reason we did so - and took so much time in doing so - is because there is a lot of public unease and distrust relating to whether the systems in place are robust, fair and, above all, independent.

Perhaps Mr. Drea will speak for the Department's team.  For us, it is a question of going through our normal risk register of all our licensed premises.

Others, where we are satisfied there are no breaches of rules or issues, would be inspected less regularly.  That is the baseline.  There are other factors on top of that.  If there is a welfare concern or we have intelligence about an animal or welfare compromise, that premises would go to the top of the list immediately.  That inspection is then carried out as immediately as is possible.  If we have intelligence about doping, medication or animal remedies, it will depend on what it is.

It is not just a question of \"Oh well, that is very nice and we will carry on\".  As my colleague has said, that investigation is initiated immediately on hearing any warning bells coming from the laboratory.  What we have done, particularly in the last few years, is to focus all of our effort, attention and time on that phase of events.  It can involve extended out-of-competition testing, repeat visits, and collaboration with colleagues in the Department.  All sorts of stuff happens.  I am happy that this is as good and as sharp as it can be.  I would be first in the queue to say that I would love the rest of the process to be quicker.

Very briefly, the training started with an assessment and an introduction last year.  Each of the panel of 12 were assessed in order for their suitability to go onto the authorised officer panel in the first place.  There was training that was kicked off by the Department in the areas of legislation, animal remedies, processes such as statement taking and witness organisation, and those types of matters.  We then really got into the job itself last year.  The first inspections were carried out after 21 May when our warrant cards were issued.  We have done a combination of on-the-job training and supports and training as needs have become identified.  With regard to sessions and how we get together as a team, we have done the inevitable Zoom training, which had to happen because of remote methods being needed.  We have got together in the room  at our offices where we have pulled out vat loads of medicines to go through.  Again, we have collaborated with colleagues in the Department as to what gaps we need to fill.  Particular and specific medicines training is being delivered by an external provider.  The list goes on.  I would be very happy to provide a more detailed list if the committee is interested in what is being done.<\/p> <p>  The next key date on the horizon is actually happening in the middle of this month where we will get together with colleagues and authorised offices in the Department, and also colleagues working in the greyhound sector, to compare and contrast and look at how we are doing things.  We will receive joint training together.  That sort of synergy and collaboration is really important as part of our support to our team.<\/p> <p>  Each of the members of our team have come with different skill sets, as I have already gone through earlier. There has been specific bespoke training for certain individuals on, for example, how to use some digital equipment we have, on specific medicines, and on prescriptions for the non-vets.  It has not been a one-size-fits-all.  We have tried very hard to listen to the feedback from the team and support them on an individual basis, as well as doing the generic obligatory training.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022060100002#N00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Lynn Hillyer"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":222,"content":"<p>Could we get a look at that authorised officer manual?

We will literally ring on the doorbell, unless there is a very good reason not to, which I already went into earlier.  We will explain our presence.  Normally, we would telephone the trainer or the person responsible first off.  We will enter and introduce ourselves and present warrant cards, go through why we are there and explain very clearly what it is we need to do.  I can honestly say that I have not had any resistance on any of the inspections that I have been on.  I have had nothing but collaboration and co-operation from licensees and from non-licensees.  Given that this was totally new for non-licensees last year we did try to work with the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders Association, ITBA to put out a question-and-answer session as to what to expect and we have tried to be very transparent about what we do.  Even so, it was new.  I have actually been very impressed and pleasantly surprised by how the vast majority of people are actually the opposite and say \"We are very pleased to see you\", or words to that effect.  I am sure there are some who would rather we were not there but they certainly never say that or obstruct us, or cause any issue that has caused us to have to escalate matters.<\/p> <p>  As I said earlier the manual itself was intended and written as a training aid.  It is an internal document.  There are sections in there that are sensitive in terms of regulatory information.  There are no secrets in there, however.  We have had discussions with others in the Department about how we can share this information without compromising the operations that we do.  I would like to find a way of doing that, even if we can just share the headlines of some of the sections in order that people can see what is in there, but perhaps some of the detail might need to come out.

I thank our guests from the IHRB for being so forthright.<\/p> <p>  I have a question for the Department.  Passports come up every time we bring officials from the Department before us in the context of animal welfare.  Deputy Martin Browne touched on the issue.  Lower down the food chain in the horse industry, when we move into sports horse territory where horses may not necessarily be as valuable, and especially in the area of leisure horses, there is significant concern about the policing and monitoring of passports.  I am not sure which of the officials were at a previous hearing at which I referred to one owner who contacted me having checked the register and found that 24 horses were registered to him.  Although he only had six horses at the time, the register indicated he owned 24 horses.  When he checked, several of the horses were dead and a number had been exported but no effort had been made to update the register.<\/p> <p>  I appreciate Mr. Sheahan's point on the length of time it is taking to get us to where we are with cattle.  At the same time, I can go into SuperValu in Longford and see what farm my striploin has come from.  It is not many years since we had the horsemeat scandal in the UK.  It is an issue for the integrity of the food chain.  In the context of the Department's commitment and priorities, how close are we to seeing a realistic effort to resolving the horse passport issue?  Will there be a statutory responsibility, not dissimilar to what we have for cattle, on horse owners to ensure they update the register?  They are certainly not doing that at the moment, especially in the leisure and sport horse sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022060100002#P02200","speaker":"1597"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654038000,"counter":283,"content":"<p>Regarding the Department's commitment, there is no question we are committed to it.  Maybe sometimes we beat ourselves up a bit too much about how bad things are, as the Deputy mentioned, going down the food chain.  I am certainly not trying to say things are perfect - far from it.  At the same time, it is fair to say things have improved a hell of a lot, certainly in the last ten years.  By way of example, members will all be familiar with Ballinasloe Horse Fair, which is the biggest of its kind.  It is for the sport horse and leisure horse sector.  We first got involved in the Ballinasloe fair 12 or 14 years ago.  There is a very good committee there and it is a very well-organised event that attracts considerable international attention.  We got involved with the committee and the Garda in relation to checkpoints for horses going to the fair.  I cannot remember off the top of my head what year we first got involved but it was probably 2006 or 2007.  In the first year, we accompanied garda&iacute; at checkpoints on all the entries into Ballinasloe.  At that stage, the number of horses with passports was probably 10% or something of that order.  In that first year, when we did the manned checkpoints, we took a very benign approach.  We asked people if they knew they were supposed to have a passport for their horse but allowed them to continue on.  However, we said we would be back again next year and told people they might be turned away.  We went back for a number of years subsequently and within the space of a short number of years, compliance levels at the Ballinasloe fair had gone from 10% to 99%.  Even at that fair and places like it, there was a realisation that things had changed and a passport was required.  Even from the point of view of selling a horse and whatever, anyone who does not have a passport when selling a horse will be more or less at nothing.  I am not trying to whitewash this or say every horse in the country is microchipped and passported.  Not all of them are and there are still problem areas.<\/p> <p>  I will give another measure of how much things have improved.  Everybody has noted that animal welfare is hugely important and it is one of the main issues we are here to talk about.  If we take the figures on the control of horses and the number of horses seized by local authorities over the years, they show that the numbers have decreased dramatically since the peak in 2013 and 2014.

Nobody is turning up in Ballinasloe at the time we have checkpoints without a passport or microchip.

The purpose of the Bill is to reform, modernise and consolidate consumer protection legislation by bringing existing provisions together in a single enactment while introducing enhanced consumer protection measures.  The Bill will give effect to the following three consumer rights directives: directive 2019\/770 on certain aspects concerning contracts for the supply of digital content and digital services; directive 2019\/771 on certain aspects concerning contracts for the sale of goods; and the main provisions of directive 2019\/2161 on the better enforcement and modernisation of Union consumer protection rules.<\/p> <p>  This Bill marks an important step forward in consumer protection as it has the safeguarding of consumer rights at its heart.  It will be good for traders in that it puts responsible behaviour on a legislative footing and evens the playing field for all, so that traders who do not treat customers fairly and honestly will be held accountable and will not gain an unfair competitive advantage.<\/p> <p>  Since publication, small errors have emerged, as well as places where more precision or clearer language should be used.  The vast majority of Government amendments put forward today are to address these technical issues.  It is important we deal with these grammatical, technical and clarifying amendments to ensure the legislation is as accurate and robust as it can be.  There are some slightly more substantive amendments being introduced and I will give further explanation of those as we reach them.<\/p> <p>  I indicated on Second Stage that I would bring forward certain amendments aimed at ensuring the powers of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, and the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, are sufficient for the additional functions they will have as a result of the Bill.  I also intend to bring a technical amendment on the definition of \"basic rate\" in relation to charges for communications by telephone to bring it into line with a ruling of the European Court of Justice.  As these amendments require further development, I put it on notice that I intend to bring them forward on Report Stage.<\/p> <p>  I also stated on Second Stage that I would bring forward an amendment to section 459 of the Companies Act 2014.  However, this amendment is still being finalised.  It is therefore my intention to bring forward this amendment on Report Stage.  The purpose of the amendment will be to clarify the role of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform when holding on trust the unclaimed properties of dissenting shareholders who have not sought to claim the properties in the seven years following an acquisition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022060100002#B00300","speaker":"1596"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":301,"content":"<p>As the Minister of State has outlined, there is a huge number of amendments, specifically 162, but many of them are technical, relating to small errors, typos, better wording, etc.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022060100002#B00400","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1654038000,"counter":302,"content":"<p>Section 1 agreed to.  <br \/><br \/>SECTION  2<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":303,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, and 8 to 18, inclusive, are related and may be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022060100002#B00600","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":304,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 15, line 5, after &ldquo;contract&rdquo; &rdquo; to insert &ldquo;(other than in Part 5)  <\/blockquote> <p>These amendments are straightforward.  They are technical amendments aimed at clarifying the meaning of &quot;sales contract&quot;.  The definition of that term in section 2(1) states it &quot;has the meaning assigned to it by <i>section 11(1)<\/i>&quot;.  However, while the main definition of sales contract is in section 11(1), section 10(1) states that the term includes:<\/p> <blockquote> \t(a) a contract concluded between one part-owner and another, and<br \/><br \/>(b) a contract for the sale of goods to be produced or manufactured by the trader, including goods made to the consumer&rsquo;s specifications. <\/blockquote> <p>As a result, the cross-reference to section 11(1) in the definition of &quot;sales contract&quot; in section 2(1) is too narrow.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 refer to minor technical changes.  Amendment No. 3 deletes the term &quot;or supply&quot; from section 2(4), which states: &quot;A reference in this Act to the sale or supply of goods includes a reference to the transfer of, or an undertaking to transfer, the ownership of those goods.&quot;  The reference to the supply of goods in the subsection is incorrect and should be deleted as the supply of goods is generally understood to encompass transactions, such as hire purchase agreements, under which ownership of the goods will not or may not be transferred.  Amendment No. 8 removes the provision in section 10 which states what a sales contract includes.  Amendment No. 9 makes a minor technical change.  Amendment No. 10 follows amendment No. 8 in that it transfers the provision which describes what a sales contract includes into section 11. <\/p><p>Section 12 is subject to a number of clarifying and technical amendments which will ensure accurate transposition of the sale of goods directive Article 3(3) and Article 10(3).  These amendments are not policy-driven.  Amendment No. 11 adds text to section 12(2)(a) to ensure the subsection clarifies that, in line with the requirements of the sale of goods directive, the digital content or digital services element of such contracts comes within the scope of Part 2.  Amendment No. 12 makes a technical change.  Amendment No. 13 is a minor technical amendment, necessary to clarify that the contracts referred to in section 12(2)(b) do not include contracts for the sale of goods with digital elements.  Amendment No. 14 is a typographical correction.  The purpose of amendment No. 15 is to delete section 12(2)(c), which obscures the fact that the contracts referred to are sales contracts, and to replace it with a new subsection (3), to make it clear that contracts for goods with digital elements are to be regarded as sales contracts, irrespective of whether the digital content or service is supplied by the trader or someone else and where the digital content or service is incorporated or interconnected in such a way that its absence would prevent the goods from functioning.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 16 substitutes the word &quot;single&quot; for &quot;sales&quot; to give correct effect to Article 10(3) of the sales directive.  Amendment No. 17 is related to these matters and inserts the word &quot;sales&quot; before the word &quot;contract&quot;.  Amendment No. 18 makes a further minor clarifying change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022060100002#B00700","speaker":"1596"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":305,"content":"<p>Under amendment No. 3, the word \"supply\" is being deleted.

Amendment No. 54 adds a new subsection (9) to underline that nothing in Part 3 will affect the right to terminate a contract under section 29(2), a new subsection proposed under amendment 31, and section 93(2), both of which cover mixed contracts.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 56 inserts a cross-reference to section 55 to ensure that Article 10 of the digital directive, to which section 57 gives effect, is fully transposed.  Amendment No. 57 gives consumers the right to all remedies arising from a lack of conformity with the contract, as opposed to only the first-tier remedies of short-term termination of the contract, repair or replacement.  Amendment No. 58 inserts a cross-reference to section 55 to ensure that Article 10 of the digital directive, to which section 57 gives full effect, is fully transposed.  Amendment No. 59 deletes superfluous language, as does amendment No. 66.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 67 makes a minor technical change.  Amendment No. 68 deletes superfluous language.  Amendment No. 69 corrects an incorrect cross-reference.  Amendment No. 71 inserts clarifying language to section 69(3) in respect of the obligations of traders.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 72, 74 and 75 change the wording of sections 71(1)(c), 71(1)(h) and 71(1)(i) so the cross-references match the section titles to which they refer.  Amendment No. 73 would insert a cross-reference inadvertently omitted during the drafting process.  Amendment No. 76 is a clarifying change to the wording referring to the meaning of \"alternative dispute resolution procedure\".  Amendment No. 77 corrects an incorrect cross-reference, as do amendments Nos. 78 and 79.  Amendments Nos. 80, 81 and 82 make minor technical changes.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 83 inserts clarifying language in section 88(6) to ensure consumers are liable for any loss or damage suffered by the trader as a result of the failure of the consumer to comply with the obligation under all of subsection (3) or fails to return the goods or material under a type of agreement referred to in subsection (5).  Amendment No. 84 is a minor technical change.  Amendment No. 85 corrects the inadvertent omission of a reference to a reduction in the price as a remedy for consumers.<\/p><p> Amendments Nos. 87, 88 and 89 change the wording of sections 94(1)(b), 94(1)(c) and 94(1)(d) so the cross-references match the section title to which they refer.  Amendment No. 90 inserts a cross-reference inadvertently omitted during the drafting process.  Amendment No. 91 is a clarifying change to the wording referring to the meaning of \"alternative dispute resolution procedure\".  Amendment No. 92 makes a minor technical change, as does amendment No. 93.  Amendments Nos. 94 and 97 are minor technical changes to ensure the application of Part 5 accurately transposes the consumer rights directive with regard to digital content.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 95 is another amendment that seeks to ensure the precise transposition of a directive provision.  Article 2 of the consumer rights directive defines a sales contract as any contract under which the trader transfers or undertakes to transfer the ownership of goods to the consumer and the consumer pays or undertakes to pay the price thereof, including any contract having as its object goods and services.  Amendment No. 96 corrects an incorrect cross-reference.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 98 would insert a new subsection (9) into section 97.  It is proposed the text for this section would be transferred from section 102 as the provisions fit more appropriately into the section setting out the application of Part 5.  Amendment No. 99 corrects an incorrect cross-reference.  Amendment No. 105 is a clarifying measure.  Amendment No. 106 corrects an incorrect cross-reference.  Amendment No. 109 ensures the full title of the Central Bank of Ireland is used consistently across the Bill.  Amendments No. 110, 111 and 112 make minor grammatical corrections.  Amendment No. 113 makes a minor grammatical correction to substitute \"a trader\" with \"the person\" to make the language consistent.  Amendment No. 114 makes a minor grammatical correction.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 115 makes a minor grammatical correction to substitute \"a trader\" with \"the person\" to make language consistent.  Amendment No. 116 makes a minor grammatical correction similar to amendment No. 115.  Amendment No. 117 makes a minor grammatical correction.  Amendment No. 118 again makes a minor grammatical correction to substitute \"a trader\" with \"the person\" to make the language consistent.  Amendment No. 119 makes another minor grammatical change.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 120 is a minor technical change to amendment No. 117 to provide for the summary proceedings under Part 4 to be taken by the Central Bank of Ireland.  Amendment No. 123 renumbers a subsection because of the addition of a new subsection with amendment No. 122.  Amendments Nos. 124, 125, 126, 127 and 128 all make minor grammatical corrections or correct an incorrect cross-reference.  Amendments Nos. 127 and 128 are the amendments in that group that correct an incorrect cross-reference.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 129 is a minor technical amendment to insert a right to terminate a hire-purchase agreement under section 73B(3).  Amendment No. 130 corrects an incorrect cross-reference.  Amendment No. 131 makes a minor grammatical correction.  Amendment No. 132 is a small technical amendment to insert the right to terminate a hire-purchase agreement under section 73B(3).  Amendment No. 133 makes a minor grammatical correction.  Amendment No. 134 corrects an incorrect cross-reference.  Amendment No. 135 is a small technical amendment to insert the right to terminate a hire-purchase agreement under section 73B(3).

Amendment No. 137 corrects an incorrect cross-reference.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 138 is a minor technical amendment that deletes the reference to a list of provisions and inserts reference to any section 73A to 73H in its place.  Amendment No. 139 deletes the list of provisions as mentioned in amendment No. 138.  Amendment No. 140 is a clarifying change to the wording referring to the meaning of \"alternative dispute resolution procedure\".  Amendment No. 141 makes a minor technical correction, as do amendments Nos. 150, 151, 152, 153 and 154.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 155 makes a minor technical correction to delete in paragraph 3 of Part 2 of Schedule 5 the words \"12 (determination of characteristics of subject matter of contract),\".\", whose inclusion is inappropriate and could be regarded as contrary to the unfair commercial terms directive.  Amendment No. 163 removes the reference to \"certain\" in regard to hire-purchase and consumer hire agreements from the Long Title.  The term is unnecessary and potentially misleading in that it suggests the amendments to the Consumer Credit Act 1995 may not apply to some types of agreements when that is not the case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022060100002#C05600","speaker":"1596","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":362,"content":"<p>There are many amendments in the group.

We are drowning in the detritus of planned obsolescence.  One need only visit a local civic amenity site on a Saturday morning to see piles of electronic waste or look at the number of mobile phones that we all have lying in drawers at home and that are beyond use.  The amendment is grounded in the idea that we protect the right to repair and ensure that we are part of the movement that fights back against the idea that global companies can build planned obsolescence into products.  By passing this amendment, we will fight back against the idea that we should be sold products by some of the world's largest companies knowing full well that they will only last a couple of years.  Having built in that obsolescence, we as consumers should have the right to repair the same products.  I am speaking specifically about smartphones and tablets, but we are also seeing it now in Kindles, coffee machines, large household appliances and the whole panoply of products that are sold to consumers.<\/p><p>The Minister of State will tell us that we should not be moving ahead of prospective EU legislation but, by accepting the amendment, there is an opportunity for him to be radical and for Ireland to become a leader in ensuring that we as consumers build in the right to repair the products sold to us as we see fit, that consumers are not penalised and that the same conglomerates do not go after entities that repurpose or refurbish iPhones or, to keep this generic, smartphones.<\/p><p>My amendment will not be accepted, so I am anticipating that I will be revisiting this matter on Report Stage.  In anticipation of the Minister of State's response, I will not be pressing the amendment, but I wish to keep it on the agenda.  We need to ensure that we fight back.  I am sick of the fact that if I purchase an iPhone, the software architecture of which allows the hardware to work with the Houses of the Oireachtas, email, WhatsApp and all of the other software that we need to survive in the modern world, that piece of kit will last less than five years or, if I am lucky, five years.  Processes and the software start slowing down after two years and the battery cannot be replaced.  There is no means by which someone can continue using the product for which he or she has shelled out considerable amounts of money.<\/p><p>People are sick of the fact that they are sitting on a mountain of this electronic detritus.  They are sick of the fact that phones are locked or bricked, to use that term.  They want to buy products that are recyclable, repairable and designed to last longer, and that is essentially what this amendment, as long winded and all as it is, is about.<\/p><p>I see no reason to say anything else.  I wish to hear what the Minister of State has to say on my amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022060100002#E00500","speaker":"1514"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":373,"content":"<p>I will speak in support of the amendment and encourage the Minister of State to ensure that, if it is not accepted as Deputy Sherlock has indicated, we might see something on this matter on Report Stage.  No one in this room or participating remotely is hostile to the notion of a right to repair.  It is a good thing.  Built-in obsolescence is creating a mountain of waste.  People often repair their goods, for example, shoes.  If you get a hole in your jacket, you do not say that that is it and the jacket needs to go.  The right to repair, particularly where technology is concerned, is important.  I encourage the Minister of State to consider this matter before Report Stage and devise a suggestion of his own.  I would be minded to support Deputy Sherlock's amendment were it pressed, although it will not be.  Including a provision on the right to repair in this legislation would be progressive.  There is no harm in us leading on such issues.  We do not need to wait for the EU to direct us to do the right thing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022060100002#E00600","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":374,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for their contributions.  They are preaching to the converted.  My wife believes that I am the most frugal man to walk on shoe leathers.  The Deputies are pushing an open door with me where the right to repair is concerned.  I appreciate where they are coming from and I considered this amendment with an open mind when it was submitted.  I would make the point that the right to repair is part of one of the remedies to be enshrined in this legislation.<\/p> <p>  As Deputy Sherlock has pre-empted, this amendment is problematic.  That is because the sale of goods directive and the digital content directive are maximum harmonisation directives and, as such, I have no discretion in their implementation.  The purpose of maximum harmonisation directives is to ensure consistency across the whole of the EU and no member state can introduce new rights in their transposition that would put us out of step with other member states.<\/p> <p>  I wish to inform my colleagues of something, though.  They may already be aware of it but, if not, the European Commission's working party on consumer protection and information is considering a number of proposals to empower consumers to make sustainable consumption decisions.  Once such proposal has a particular emphasis of promoting repair and reuse and will consider harmonising certain aspects of consumer law, promoting repair as the primary remedy for consumers.  Another proposal under deliberation seeks to improve participation by consumers in the circular economy by providing better information on the durability and repairability of certain products.  This involves introducing several requirements, including providing consumers with information on the existence and length of a producer's commercial guarantee of durability for all types of good or on the absence of guarantees in the case of energy-using goods; providing information on the availability of free software updates for all goods with digital elements; and providing information on the repairability of products for all types of good.  This initiative also seeks to protect consumers against unfair commercial practices that prevent sustainable purchases, such as early obsolescence.<\/p> <p>  I would welcome further protection given to consumers around the repairability of electronic equipment and access to maintenance of said equipment.<\/p><p>My officials are actively participating in these working party discussions.  However, as I said, because of the fact that it is a maximum harmonisation, I am advised that there is no discretion in the implementation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022060100002#E00700","speaker":"1596","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":376,"content":"<p>I sometimes feel &ndash; I would have been accused of this in the past as a Minister of State &ndash; that we are perhaps hiding behind EU rules.  However, I think there is an opportunity within the amendment not to fall foul of EU rules, because we are merely giving an additional right to the consumer to have that which they have purchased in good faith to be repaired.  The amendment describes a particular element.  It reads: \"In relation to equipment with an electronic security lock or other security-related function, the manufacturer shall make available to the owner and to independent repair providers, on fair and reasonable terms and through secure data release systems where appropriate, any special documents, tools or parts needed to disable the lock or function, and to reset it, for the purposes of diagnosis, maintenance or repair of the equipment.\"<\/p> <p>I do not see how that is injurious to the rights of the manufacturer in terms of fair competition rules from an EU point of view or maximum harmonisation rules.  Again, I know the Minister of State is frankly not of a mind to accept the amendment.  If I understand the Minister of State correctly, he is sympathetic to what the amendment seeks to do.  However, at a time when we are talking about the circular economy - there is legislation before us on that very issue - I think people are just absolutely fed up with the idea of built-in obsolescence.  I think we have crossed the Rubicon of people&rsquo;s patience around it.  This amendment, in its own small way, seeks to push back against this rampant consumerism.  The Minister of State said he will repair and fix shoe leather and I am of a similar mind.  There is a strong movement around people not necessarily wanting the best, new or shiniest, but wanting to repair, reuse and recycle.

It also sets out the obligations of the consumer and trader in the event of a contract termination.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 31 replaces the current section 29(1) to clarify that the consumer has the right to obtain a proportionate reduction in the price as well as the right to terminate the contract.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 32 inserts, in line with the wording of the corresponding provision at section 93(4), &ldquo;objectively&rdquo; before &ldquo;determining&rdquo;.

The content of the previous paragraphs, subsections (2)(a) and (2)(b), have been transferred to a new subsection (3).<\/p><p>Amendment No. 61 makes a minor technical change.  Amendment No. 62 is a clarifying measure.  Amendment No. 63 is the most substantial change because it adds a new subsection (4) to include a provision on the obligations of the parties involved in the event of the termination of a mixed contract.  This will align this section with corresponding sections 21 and 29 in Part 2 of the Bill.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 64 makes a minor technical change.  This will give a more accurate account of the meaning of such a bundle in directive Directive (EU) 2018\/1972 on establishing the European electronic communications code.  Amendment No. 65 makes a minor technical change.  This will give a more accurate account of the meaning of such a bundle in Directive (EU) 2018\/1972 on establishing the European electronic code.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 86 is a technical change and inserts a provision in section 93 on the obligations of the parties in the event of the termination of a mixed contract.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022060100002#F02700","speaker":"1596"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1654038000,"counter":403,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1654038000,"counter":404,"content":"<p>SECTION 29<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":405,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 32:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 33, line 28, after &ldquo;In&rdquo;

Their purpose is to give full and accurate effect to Article 16 of the consumer rights directive, as amended by Article 4(12) of the better enforcement and modernisation directive.  These are small technical changes to clarify the section and do not reflect a policy change.  As some digital service contracts will involve the payment of a price by the consumer while others will not, Article 16(a) provides for different rules for the two forms of contract.  Sections 111(1)(a) to 111(1)(d) of the Bill deal with the application of Chapter 5 to service contracts.  The proposed amendments revise these subsections.  <\/p><p>Amendment No. 100 deletes the current section 111(1)(a) as it is unnecessary given that the provisions contained therein are already provided for in section 97(2)(b).  It replaces this with the text of the current section 111(1)(d).  This is because section 111(1)(d) gives effect to the first of the application provisions in Article 16 of the consumer rights directive.  It is therefore appropriate to transfer the text of section 111(1)(d) to section 111(1)(a).<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 101 and 102 amend section 111(1)(b) to ensure that Chapter 5 does not apply to digital service contracts after the digital service has been fully supplied if the contract does not place the consumer under an obligation to pay the price of the digital service.  This takes account of the fact that, for digital service contracts that do not place the consumer under an obligation to pay the price of a digital service, only the first part of Article 16(a) of the consumer rights directive applies.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 103 replaces the current sections 111(1)(c), 111(1)(e) and 111(1)(f).  The current text of section 111(1)(c) is deleted and replaced to provide that Chapter 5 does not apply to the digital service contract after the digital service has been fully supplied if the contract places the consumer under an obligation to pay the price of the service and supply of the digital service has begun with the consumer's prior expressed consent and acknowledgement that he or she will lose the right to cancel the contract once it has been fully performed by the trader.  This gives effect to both parts of Article 16(a) of the consumer rights directive.  A new section 111(1)(d) is to be inserted to provide that Chapter 5 does not apply to a contract for the supply of digital content not supplied on a tangible medium where the supply of the digital content has begun and the contract does not place the consumer under an obligation to pay the price of the digital content.  This change gives proper effect to Article 16(m) of the consumer rights directive.  <\/p><p>For digital content contracts that place the consumer under an obligation to pay the price of the digital content, Article 16(m) applies in full.  The new section 111(1)(e) provides accordingly that Chapter 5 does not apply to a contract for the supply of digital content not supplied on a tangible medium where the performance of the digital content has begun if the contract places the consumer under an obligation to pay, the consumer has provided prior express consent to the performance of the digital content beginning during the cancellation period and acknowledges that he or she thereby loses the right to cancel the contract and the trader has provided confirmation of the contract in accordance with section 105 or, as the case may be, section 109.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022060100002#H07400","speaker":"1596"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1654038000,"counter":622,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":623,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 101:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 88, line 9, to delete &ldquo;the consumer&mdash;&rdquo;

We have seen in the past, however, the practice whereby customers of long standing find themselves at a price disadvantage relative to new customers where one seeks to attract new customers to a service, whether a digital service, an online service or whatever else that service may be.  From a consumer rights point of view, it is a matter of ensuring, as I said, that loyal customers are not penalised more for renewing a subscription than the price offered to new customers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022060100002#J00900","speaker":"1514"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":645,"content":"<p>I fully accept where the Deputy is coming from.

When we looked at the insurance Bill, we found that it needed a market study because we do not want unintended consequences.  The practice of discounts is widely used by service providers as a way of attracting new customers.  It is an important competitive dynamic, which, among other things, has facilitated new entrants into the market, and we certainly do not want to risk that.  It took some market analysis to get to where we are with the insurance Bill to which I referred a minute ago.  We are unlikely to be able to do that type of policy deliberation and analysis before Report Stage.  I will certainly look at the matter again because I accept where the Deputy is coming from.

The proposed amendment relates to the handling of consumer complaints and seeks to insert four new sections into the Consumer Protection Act 2007.  The proposed section 66C refers to complaints in the context of subscribers who receive a service from traders where that contract is successively renewed or rolled over.  This definition is relatively broad and, as I said previously, there is a complex landscape here that involves multiple sectoral regulators, most of which already require traders to operate complaints handling processes and provide access to alternative dispute resolution services.  In many instances, this requirement is linked to their licensing agreements.  For example, ComReg provides a complaint handling service called ComReg Connects for broadband, home phone and mobile phone consumer complaints.  Service providers are required to have a code of practice for handling consumer complaints.  Their code should contain all the information customers need to make a complaint, including information on refunds where appropriate.  Service providers have ten working days to resolve complaints, after which time customers can request ComReg&rsquo;s assistance.  Customer complaints that remain unresolved for more than 40 working days can be escalated to ComReg&rsquo;s dispute resolution procedure and ComReg can then adjudicate.  While I see where the Deputy is coming from, I feel there is a duplication in this amendment.  Rather than enhancing the Bill, it would put an onus on another body, the CCPC, where the responsibility for this already rests with sectoral regulators such as ComReg or the CRU.  I do not intend to accept this amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022060100002#K03400","speaker":"1596"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":742,"content":"<p>The justification for the amendment is the lived experience of consumers who take out contracts, with broadband providers in particular.  Often, the consumer purchases a broadband product, such as fibre to the home or a copper line, that is advertised as providing 1 GB but it provides less than that and there are dropouts and blackouts in the service provision.  The consumer might pay &euro;80 for that.  I raised this on Second Stage.  I know there is a withholding arrangement built into the legislation in relation to moneys.  I fully accept that I may not be on the right track here so I have an open mind on this matter.  I am trying to ensure that, where the consumer goes through all the steps with the provider and where it is found that the trader did not adhere fully to the legislation, there is a stick built in whereby the provider will become guilty of an offence.  We have enough anecdotal evidence based on our own experiences as public representatives of services having failed people where there is a contract to supply.  I am open to correction on this but there do not appear to be sufficient penalties built in to ensure manners are put on the providers.  This amendment seeks to provide some remedy for the consumer, as well as some penalty for the provider.  Most people's experiences are positive and that is fully acknowledged.  Establishing a scheme that is unambiguous in its nature will provide a clear charter, for want of a better expression, to the consumer and the provider where there is an absolute understanding of the expectations on the provider or the trader.  That is where I am coming from.  ComReg is overloaded and is not resourced.  Let us call a spade a spade.  We know that so let us acknowledge that.  There are not enough personnel in ComReg and policing these issues has been a perennial problem.  People will be reluctant to withdraw a part of their payment for lack of a service if they do not feel there are enough protections built in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022060100002#K03500","speaker":"1514"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":743,"content":"<p>I would go back to the point that we are giving ComReg the same enforcement powers as the CCPC as part of this Bill.  This amendment is a duplication as it is asking the CCPC to do exactly what ComReg can do.  It will have new and enhanced enforcement powers similar to the CCPC as part of this Bill.  As the Deputy rightly alluded to, this Bill will for the first time give consumers the right to withhold payment for poor service.  However, there is quite clearly a dispute mechanism in place at the moment for broadband, home phone and mobile phone services and that rests with ComReg.  Consumers can make a complaint to the service provider and it has ten days to resolve the complaint.  Where that does not happen, they can refer the matter to ComReg and then there is a process by which it can intervene and escalate the problem.  Heretofore, ComReg did not have the same enforcement powers as the CCPC but it will after the enactment of this Bill.  Why would we give the CCPC a role in this while we are enhancing the powers of ComReg in order to do exactly what it can do?

It is very nice to be back in person after two years.  We value our engagements with the Oireachtas very highly.  These are important opportunities and an important part of our work.  The council is an independent body established under the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012.  Its mandate is to endorse and assess the official macroeconomic forecasts, assess the budgetary projections, assess compliance with the fiscal rules and assess the fiscal stance.  Our focus is on the overall fiscal stance, rather than on individual tax measures or spending items.<\/p> <p>  Yesterday, the council published its 22nd fiscal assessment report.  It is based on the Government&rsquo;s forecasts published in April in the stability programme update, SPU, 2022.  The Irish economy has continued to grow, despite the challenges.  Higher energy and food prices have taken inflation to the highest rate in a generation.  While this will slow growth in 2022, the economy is expected to continue to grow in the years ahead, helped by the high-pay and high-tax sectors.  Nevertheless, developments remain uneven across sectors and higher inflation impacts lower-income households far more than the average or wealthier households.  Risks and uncertainties are also high.  Inflation could remain higher for longer than the SPU assumes and there are downside risks to activity.  We also note with concern that the SPU only projects three years ahead to 2025.  This undermines a medium-term approach and good planning for budgetary policy.  The council strongly recommends a return to five-year-ahead forecasts as was committed to by the Department of Finance and confirmed by the Minister in the past.<\/p> <p>  The budget balance is being boosted by revenues from a faster-than-expected recovery from Covid-19 and continued growth in high-pay, high-tax sectors.  Over the medium term, the budget balance is set to reach a surplus in 2023 and to improve to a surplus of 2.7% of GNI* by 2025.  This should help to put Ireland&rsquo;s debt ratio on a steady downward path to reach 80% of GNI* by 2025, down from 106% of national income in 2021.  However, there are significant pressures on many spending areas.  Some of these are known, others have not been factored into the budgetary plans.  In terms of spending, we broadly know that, first, higher inflation creates significant spending pressures.  The council estimates that each one percentage point increase in inflation in the economy would create pressures on Government spending of approximately &euro;700 million just to stand still if pay, welfare, pensions and the costs of goods and services were fully adjusted to maintain their value in relative terms as prices increase.  We assess that the planned increases in current spending under the Government&rsquo;s 5% spending rule over 2023 to 2025 would not be sufficient if the Government opted to fully maintain existing supports and services in real terms, although for later years the shortfall is relatively small.<\/p><p>This implies that the Government will need to make choices between accommodating price pressures, other changes to spending plans and revenue-raising measures.  Second, there are likely to be temporary costs associated with the war in Ukraine.  Of the &euro;7 billion in contingencies for spending set out in budget 2022 back in October, &euro;2.5 billion remains unallocated.  This may be spent on humanitarian assistance for Ukrainian refugees but it could also be used for further temporary and targeted cost-of-living measures.  Third, the Government plans to ramp up public investment spending to almost 5% of national income by 2025 and keep it at this high level out to the end of the decade.  The increases should help to meet climate change and housing objectives but capacity constraints in the construction sector could see higher costs or lower output for a given price.  Poorer value for money and possible spending overruns could result and a high degree of diligence will be required.  Fourth, many countries are considering raising defence spending in the light of the war in Ukraine.  For Ireland, the report of the Commission on the Defence Forces establishes a range of different scenarios. <\/p><p> However, there are many areas where we are in the dark on the Government&rsquo;s plans.  The Government committed to halving Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse-gas emissions by 2030 but it has not factored in the full costs to the State of achieving this.  Estimates from Mr. John FitzGerald in 2021, in a very useful piece of analysis, put the cost at an additional 1.7% to 2.3% of GNI* on average over the years 2026 to 2030.  The Government has also not costed its planned major healthcare reforms under Sl&aacute;intecare beyond this year and there is no clarity on how much progress has been made to date in terms of the overall cost of the reforms.  The Government has also not responded to the Pensions Commission recommendations on how to address funding shortfalls in the pension system.  Annual spending on pensions is set to rise by about 1.5% to 2% of GNI* by 2030 amid a rapidly ageing population.  The upfront fiscal costs of auto enrolment also need to be built into future budgets, if implemented. <\/p><p> The Government faces a delicate balancing act between supporting the economy and vulnerable households in the face of higher inflation while not contributing to higher inflation through second-round effects.  Sticking to the 5% spending rule, as the Government commits to and as the council welcomes, should help with that objective and with facilitating the debt ratio falling at a steady pace from high levels.  Reducing the debt ratio in line with these plans would be appropriate to help build a buffer so that future shocks, particularly major downturns, could be cushioned by budgetary supports in a similar way to the response during the pandemic.  Following the rule would also help to ensure that spending increases do not lead to excessive stimulus to the economy at the current time and would help avoid the risk of second-round effects on wages and prices potentially destabilising the economy and the public finances.  However, sticking to the rule also highlights the difficult trade-offs that are involved.  The various spending pressures that we have discussed raise significant questions about how they will be accommodated within the Government's spending rule alongside existing policies.  Sticking to the rule could imply reductions in planned spending elsewhere or higher taxes. <\/p><p> In the background to all this, an ongoing concern of the council&rsquo;s is the growing over-reliance on corporation tax to fund everyday public services.  Corporation tax receipts represent nearly one in every four euro of tax revenue raised by the Exchequer and the top-ten paying companies account for more than half of those receipts, up from a quarter in 2008.  The Government does not currently have a strategy to reduce this over-reliance.  The council&rsquo;s assessment is that the Government should clearly show the impact of excess corporation tax receipts on the budget balance, as we do in this report and it should take measures to reduce its reliance on corporation tax.  The council has set out a way to achieve this by making contributions to the rainy day fund or running debt down.  The Exchequer has benefited significantly from corporation tax receipts in recent years which could be considered excess, that is, beyond what is explained by the performance of the domestic economy.  By using these excess receipts to fund ongoing expenditure, the Government has potentially opted not to set aside some &euro;22 billion in a rainy day fund or to reduce net debt by a substantial amount. <\/p><p> I thank members for their attention and look forward to their questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022060100002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":834,"content":"<p>Thank you Mr. Barnes.

First, in terms of the budgetary numbers and temporary measures, there is still space because there are still contingencies that are likely to be available this year, even within the existing budget.  Second, looking ahead, or taking this year and next year together, within the Government's spending rule there would be space to do that.  However, as we have highlighted, there are choices between how far we take measures to deal with the cost-of-living crisis as compared to other policy initiatives the Government might want to take.  The reality is that we are having to pay more for imports of energy and food and if we need to provide more help to some households, that is going to cost extra money.  That needs to be weighed against other potential alternatives.<\/p> <p>  The other way in which there is space, potentially, is that there is some room to do that without over-stimulating the economy.  What is good about targeted measures is that rather than just pumping money in across the board, they give it to those who really need it the most.  Lower income households spend around one third of their income on food and energy so this is a huge shock for people who do not have many savings to fall back on.  For wealthier households, it is a much lower share of their spending and of course, they are in a better starting position as well.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022060100002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":837,"content":"<p>It is good to hear that.

The report refers to about &euro;1 billion worth of interventions since the start of the year up to the publication of the Stability Programme Update, SPU, about 90% of which were untargeted.  According to the council, this means that substantial public resources are being transferred to individuals who already have high incomes and who are, therefore, just likely to increase their savings.

The Government can improve that trade off by directing more money towards those who need it most rather than spreading it out more equally.  There is a case for stronger targeting but it is obviously difficult.  Targeting is not an easy thing to do.  We know that poorer houses need to be targeted, as do rural households and older households but even within those groups, not everyone is treated the same.  There is a difficult mix and that is why we do not come down particularly strongly in any particular way, partly because it is not our mandate to look at the exact design of specific measures but also because we recognise it is a difficult thing for the Government to do.  It must make a number of judgments and trade-offs which is its job, rightly, and not our role.<\/p> <p>  It may be helpful to consider using either the welfare system or the tax system in more creative ways than they have been used in the past to make sure the money is going to those who need it most because that will strike the best balance.

To date, since the start of the year we have not seen an increase in core social welfare working-age payments.  In order to be in line with the average inflation rate that we are likely to see over the course of the year, predicted to be 6.2%, those rates would need to increase by &euro;7.50.

I will, however, make a couple of points in response.<\/p> <p>  A difficult judgment is being faced between temporary and permanent measures.  We do not know how long these price shocks will last.  We are aware that energy prices and food prices can be very volatile.  They may well go up and make the next winter very difficult in Europe.  On the other hand, they could also go down if things work out better than expected.  The Government must think about the balance between temporary measures where we make these once-off payments or time-limited payments, which is mostly what the Government has done, versus these permanent increases in welfare payments that would, essentially, be required to keep their real value over time but would need to reflect the fact that prices may fall.  This is the temporary versus permanent split the Government must think about.<\/p> <p>  The second point is the exact amounts.  It is a very difficult question.  Again, it depends on which instruments the Government wants to use, what combination it wants to use, and to what extent it wants to target.  The important part about targeting is that even just raising welfare rates in line with general inflation probably would not fully compensate the lower income groups who are spending a much higher share of their income and facing a much faster rate of increase than the general population.  That is an important point to bear in mind.  Ultimately, I believe the Government needs to co-ordinate across policies.  IFAC has also suggested co-ordination with the social partners on how the whole package will look.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the amount of fiscal space.  We believe that the Government's spending rule is actually providing useful guidance.  It is forcing the point that there is a choice between how much is ultimately spent on the permanent increases in welfare payments and other things.  We are not taking any view on how that choice should be made.  That is a democratic choice but it is forcing the right kinds of questions to be asked.<\/p> <p>  One very helpful aspect is that the Government seems to be interpreting the rule in terms of the level of spending.  In 2021 there was a big underspend.  If the Government was to lock in that underspend it would create more space to tackle the cost-of-living crisis.  That is one of the very live questions the Government faces.  It probably would not make a lot of sense to try to catch up on that underspend very quickly and then realise there is not enough money to deal with the cost of living.  This is one of the things that gives the Government a bit of marginal manoeuvre. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022060100002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":842,"content":"<p>Large parts of that underspend come in the area of health and recruitment in health, so not trying to catch up causes problems there and accentuates the problems we have.<\/p> <p>  I believe it was the Institute for Fiscal Studies in Britain that analysed Boris Johnson's measures and suggested that they shielded the most vulnerable by giving the types of payments that were made for those on social welfare payments of &pound;650, an additional &pound;150 for those on disability payments, along with a suite of other measures.

Obviously, there is a downside from lower activity but there is an upside from higher inflation.  This is one of the things that compensates it.  Some of those effects would wash out naturally, which means it would increase in line with the economy.  In a sense, therefore, there is not a huge gain there.  A big issue would be the indexation of the income tax system.  We have discussed this before.  The income tax system bands are set in cash terms.  If one keeps the bands fixed and there is inflation, or wage inflation, then more income is going to move into the higher bands and will be taxed more heavily.  Those effects are going to be bigger if wage inflation is higher.  There is a potential upside of something that would raise the average tax rate if those nominal bands were kept in the same place.  The programme for Government commits to indexation in some form.  The Government has factored into its plans a degree of partial indexation, but if one kept that currently planned degree of partial indexation it would not be enough to compensate for the wage inflation that is now expected.  As a consequence of that, one would now expect the average tax rate to increase if those amounts that are currently planned are kept there.  That would tend to improve the public finances as a whole and improve the budget balance, but the Government spending rule does not take revenue into account so it would not have any counterpart on the other side.  This is something we discussed in another box in the report.

Higher inflation is one of the things that could contribute to that.

We believe quite a bit of this is related to the strength of the high pay-high tax sectors in the economy.  There are reasons to believe that this may continue if those sectors continue to do well, but this is also a relatively recent phenomenon so it needs to be treated with some caution as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022060100002#C00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":848,"content":"<p>Are the factors that lead to this &euro;2 billion improvement outlined in table E-1: nominal compensation of employees; nominal personal consumption, which is in the negative territory; nominal building and construction, which as we know is also very high; and the inflation rate?

The impact of the inflation crisis has been uneven.  Would our guests go even further and say there are winners and losers in this situation?  It is not just that the impact is uneven.  Would it be fair comment that some people are being hammered while others are doing very well?  I would be interested to hear our guests' views on that question.  I note that corporate profits and net household wealth are up.  Somebody is doing well out of all of this and it is certainly not the majority of low- and middle-income households, who are being hit disproportionately hard, as our guests have alluded to.  Even the headline inflation rate does not take into account the hit that low- and middle-income families are taking.<\/p> <p>  I know IFAC does not get into policy suggestions but one possible approach to dealing with this situation is to insulate people's incomes against the impact of inflation and to do that, if I understood what our guests have said, would cost &euro;700 million.  Was that the relevant figure?  The problem is that &euro;700 million would take us over the 5% rule.  I am generally in favour of insulating people's incomes, wages and so on from the impact of inflation.  One approach could be to take money back from those who have benefited from this situation to insulate the losers fully and ensure there are no winners.  The Government's mantra is it cannot fully insulate people against the impacts of inflation.  That is the Government's view.  I do not think that is a statement of fact but is rather a statement of policy.  The Government has decided it is not going to insulate people fully from the impact of inflation because the cost would be too high and perhaps it would take us over the 5% rule.  The Government could do it if it wanted to.  That is a consideration.<\/p> <p>  Another consideration that is never debated is we should ensure there are no winners.  I am not asking our guests to advocate for that position but is it something we might consider as an option?  In the current circumstances, no excess profits should be made because that is not fair when the income of other people is being hit.  That would be a legitimate policy consideration.  Perhaps we might even cap profits.  We always talk about capping wages and a need to limit wage increases, social welfare increases and pension increases because the skies might fall on us if we let them rip.  The possibility we might cap profits, wealth and very high salaries is never considered.  As I said, I am not asking our guests to advocate for that position because I know IFAC does not advocate particular policy measures but is that a legitimate thing to consider in the range of options that is open to the Government?

IFAC does not take a view on distribution or those kinds of questions.  From the point of view of public finances, what is happening to different groups in society is very important because the State, through its policy, is committed to helping some people in society, the less well-off, but does not provide welfare to everyone.  That is the basic system.  It means that when a shock hits the less well-off, it will cost the Government more and that will have an impact on the public finances.  That is where it becomes something about which IFAC would think.<\/p> <p>  The prices of energy and food, which are largely imported goods, are high.  An economics textbook would state that is a situation that does not create winners and losers.  We are all losers in some ways because we are having to pay more to foreigners.  They gain but we do not gain anything from that situation.  There are probably exceptions but the general rule with regard to oil and energy price increases is that everyone is worse off.  However, we are not all worse off to the same degree.  It matters a lot more to people who have low savings and are struggling than it does to those with higher incomes.

However, it can aim to support some groups.  For example, if we were to compensate for the impact of this year's unexpected inflation on public sector pay, welfare rates and pensions, it would cost approximately &euro;2 billion - the &euro;700 million was for one percentage point of inflation, but we have seen a great deal more unexpected inflation than that - to compensate that group fully and no one else would get anything.  We can compensate the more vulnerable groups at a cost that is sustainable to society, particularly if we do not provide untargeted help to those who do not need it.<\/p><p> There is another point that is important to understand, and it is somewhat specific to Ireland.  We are suffering from higher energy and food prices like everyone else, but we are also benefiting - or, rather, some people are - from a favourable shock to digital and pharmaceutical activities and financial services.  Something we explored in the analytical note that was published last week by our economist, Mr. Kevin Timoney, is that wages in those sectors have been growing at a fast clip for a number of years and employment therein has increased a great deal.  People within Ireland who happen to work in those sectors or benefit from their spillovers are doing relatively well.

I refer to how we can address this aspect and how we can keep those supports in line with inflation.  Equally, we also have people who are working and contributing to society.  I refer to the cost of travelling to work for the many people with no access to public transport.

The cost of supporting the most vulnerable groups and households, including those with the lowest incomes and those with various challenges in their lives is going to increase and this is what the Government needs to manage.  So far, it has mostly focused on temporary measures that may be warranted because the increase in this regard that has brought about higher energy prices has been relatively recent.

That would not be a sustainable approach and it would not make sense.  The Government, as we have said, is facing this balancing act between protecting the economy and protecting those groups that are vulnerable and not putting a great deal more money into the economy when inflation is already high and demand is strong.  The best way of doing this is by targeting such protections at those who are the most vulnerable.  A big challenge politically is that a wide section of the population is under some pressure because of these energy and food prices.  It can be hard to target protections in this kind of environment, because some people will not benefit much or at all from Government measures if they are targeted.

I thank Mr. Barnes and all the witnesses for being here because this is an important engagement.  I thought it was ironic this morning, at a time when inflation stood at 8.2% in May and there is all this energy insecurity and fuel uncertainty in respect of cost and availability, that the news headlines focused on how we are going to achieve our climate action targets for 2030.  I refer to us being beaten into submission in the context where, whatever else might happen, it is necessary to achieve those targets at whatever cost that may entail.  People were being interviewed and giving their viewpoints on this subject in respect of the full enormity of what this endeavour is going to cost not yet having been realised.  I was thinking of someone having porridge, perhaps choking on hearing those comments this morning, and wondering if these headlines were really coming at this time.<\/p> <p>  I preface all I am saying by stating that I have as much, and maybe more, of a concern about the environment as anybody else.  I am not a climate change denier, but I am a realist.  I live in the real world of representing people, many of whom live in rural locations and must travel to work at enormous cost.  Their children must also be transported to schools.  These people are living in rural locations as they are perfectly entitled to do.  As I have always said, whether people are living in Blackrock, Ballinskelligs, Templenoe or here in any part of the centre of Dublin city, they are entitled to live where they and their families wish to be.<\/p><p> How sensible is it to be in the D&aacute;il one day imposing taxes upon taxes in the name of trying to reduce our carbon emissions while at the same time telling people they have to suck it up?  The Government is also saying we must introduce measures to take the bite out of this harsh financial reality and so far all it has come up with is a reduction in the price of fuel, which actually went up on the two nights previous to the deduction.  It went up more on the Sunday and Monday than it came down on the Tuesday.  There was also the famous &euro;200 in respect of electricity.  I can tell the Government that is well forgotten now because the prices people are paying on their fuel and energy bills are astronomical.  There are also issues around energy insecurity because the Government did not have the gumption to go ahead with an liquefied natural gas facility in the Shannon Estuary.  Any of the decisions it has taken so far have resulted in us being overly reliant on importing our energy from England and France.

That is a real worry.  The Taoiseach said yesterday we were in unprecedented times.  Due to the cut-off from Russian oil, we are going to have 90% less oil coming into the European Union than we would have had before.  The reality of that has not been thought through at all yet.

The core of the issue is that the climate transition is, even without the war in Ukraine, a very complicated and challenging undertaking.  As we have emphasised, it requires a huge re-engineering of our society in many ways.  It is not just about changing the energy mix.  It is a very deep change to the way the economy functions and the way society functions.  On top of that, there is the war in Ukraine.  In some ways, the war has had some of the same effects that meeting emissions targets would have had, in terms of having to change and move away from fossil fuels and things, but it is happening far more quickly and in a far more unstructured way than we had planned.  It underlines the fact that we ultimately need to take a steady approach towards tackling climate change but in the short run there may be some more urgent imperatives, which means some slightly different actions will have to be taken than would otherwise have been the case.<\/p> <p>  What the Deputy said also highlights some of the issues we will face with climate transition.  One issue is higher energy prices, which are today caused by Ukraine but may ultimately be caused by the phasing out of fossil fuels.  How we manage the social aspects of that is important.  Relatively wealthy households are probably in a better position to manage that transition than lower-income households, partly because they spend less of their money on food and energy but also because they have more savings.  They are in a much better position to deal with most problems.  We did not mention this in our earlier answer but the Government needs to start thinking about what the social implications of the climate transition will be in the long term and how it is going to manage that.  That is one of the big fiscal costs.  For example, the evaluation that was done in the Netherlands of the economic impact of their climate change package put a lot of emphasis on the fact the Government was going to have to compensate some groups in society or provide more help for them to transition.  For someone who is relatively wealthy, it may be not so difficult to manage investing in a heat pump and insulation but for someone on a much lower income, undertaking that kind of investment, which will pay back over quite a long period, is going to be much more challenging financially.  The Government has to think about the social implications of that.  Good planning, both on the climate side and with regard to the economic and social implications, will help make the transition as smooth and fair as it can be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022060100002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":894,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022060100002#G00500","speaker":"1487"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":895,"content":"<p>I, too, was trying to use the Internet but it was not working.

It is nice to meet them in person.  I have a few questions prepared but I am also interested in some things that arose during the discussion.  I am sure the witnesses are more aware of this than I am but I have noticed a particular issue in the media.  There is one thing that is thrown out there but you almost cannot discuss it.  Deputy Canney referred to wage increases and the impact they will have.  I have noticed that in a lot of commentary, both within the D&aacute;il and in the media, as soon as any kind of increase in wages is mentioned, people say wage prices will spiral and increase inflation.  I would be interested in the witnesses' views on the concept of the wage-price spiral.  Where do we need to be at in order for that to happen?  The factors causing inflation are energy prices and supply chain issues.  A few weeks or months back, there was a graph in the <i>Financial Times<\/i>which showed that since 2020, wages in the eurozone did not really increase so that has not been the cause of inflation.  I would be interested in the witnesses' views on that.  Sometimes we have a very closed conversation nationally on certain topics.  People are struggling.  I have my own views on the matter but I would be interested in what the witnesses have to say.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022060100002#G00600","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654038000,"counter":896,"content":"<p>It is a genuinely complicated question, partly because we have not had inflation like this for a generation.  Many things have changed in between.  We do not really know what it will be like in the current environment or how people will respond.  A lot of it ultimately comes down to human behaviour and expectations and things that are very hard to get to the bottom of.  There are two channels through which wages would be increasing.  As we have seen, since the onset of the pandemic there are labour shortages in some sectors.  That would naturally bid up the wages.  That is more like a conventional overheating but it is relative to some sectors, including construction and areas like that.  A special feature in the Irish case is that there are some sectors linked to the digital and pharmaceutical industries, which have very high wage growth for reasons that are totally unrelated.  It is really to do with global factors.  That is a permanent increase but it means the average wage rate does not mean very much because it is a combination of all sorts of different wage rates at totally different levels and with totally different growth rates.  It is a very hard thing to think about.<\/p><p>We have already produced a note on the matter, but it is something we are thinking about much harder because it is becoming a big reality for the Government.<\/p><p> When people set their wages, they may anticipate a level of inflation and want to be compensated for that.  The question is what level they anticipate.  If they think everyone else is going to raise their wages, and by consequence companies also raise their prices, they will ask for more.  We do not want to be in the environment where everybody is bidding up relative to everyone else because there will just be higher inflation.  That will not really achieve very much and it means there will be higher inflation just to stand still, in a sense.<\/p><p> A big question for Ireland is also what happens relative to other countries.  If other countries in the eurozone have the common currency, we need, in a way, to keep an eye on what is happening in those countries.  If they did not raise their wages very much and we raised ours by a lot, our relative prices would increase by a lot and we would lose competitiveness.  We also need to look at that fairly carefully.<\/p><p> In terms of what this means, as we said earlier, this is an energy price shock and it is imported goods that have increased so we cannot fully compensate that through wages for everyone.

Inflation was incredibly low in the pre-pandemic period, averaging 0.5% per year.  It was already starting to creep up through the end of the pandemic, partly because of a shift from services to goods, which put up some goods prices.  This was exemplified in construction.  We also saw labour shortages and as businesses reopened, some prices were going up.<\/p> <p>  The real driver to these sorts of levels can be clearly seen as the contribution of energy and, to a degree, food prices.  In the months ahead we can probably expect to see it showing more in other prices.  Other items that are not explicitly energy and food contain inputs from the energy sectors and we can see that in the euro area inflation, services are starting to play a bit more of a role.  These are services from areas that are very energy-intensive, such as transport.<\/p> <p>  The big question after that is what will happen next.  The Stability Programme Update 2022 assumes that oil and energy prices will stay at the same level and one would expect those components to disappear and inflation to come back, at some point, towards a more normal level.  The programme update assumes it will go back to approximately 2%, which is the ECB target, although we have not been there for a long time now.  There is much uncertainty around that, including how long the immediate knock-on effects will last.  It partly depends on policy as to whether inflation will really take off or we will get second-round effects, etc.  There is massive uncertainty, but what we see now is very clearly related to energy and food, essentially, along with rents and so on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022060100002#H01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":909,"content":"<p>A vote has been called.<\/p><p>I propose we suspend the meeting for 15 minutes.

There are obviously many risks around that and a lot of things could go wrong.  That could potentially lead to quite a difficult winter in Europe.  Ireland is not directly exposed to that as strongly as some other countries.  In particular, our industrial production is not as strongly dependent on that as industrial production is in some other countries.  However, that is a big risk to the European economy for next winter and, as a consequence, it is also a risk for the Irish economy.

Many things have changed in the economy over time, which is one of the things that makes it uncertain.  We are in some senses in uncharted waters.  A clear lesson is that trying to overdo the response and insulate ourselves from these shocks will lead to higher inflation and second-round effects.  How far those go depends on many things.<\/p> <p>  One thing that has changed significantly is the way monetary policy works.  We now have an independent central bank in the euro area, which one would expect to take this very seriously.  That is one of the reasons interest rates have increased: people expect the ECB to respond and it has indicated it will start to raise interest rates in the next couple of months.  That is different from the picture we had six months ago.  That is one of the forces one would expect to keep inflation down.  The higher it sees inflation going, the stronger it is likely to respond.  That is one reason it would be counterproductive to have excessive across-the-board wage increases.<\/p> <p>  There is a delicate balance for the Government to strike.  There is a legitimate case for protecting the economy in the short run and for helping lower income and more vulnerable households, but a balance has to be struck with not putting too much money into the economy or creating unsustainable wage and price expectations.  It is a difficult balance and there is no magic formula to do it.  In the early days of social partnership, Ireland was able to use different instruments together and co-ordinate different parts of the economy to achieve an outcome.  It is a different situation today but that process worked quite well.  Like many countries, we have not needed those processes to the same extent for a long time.  The question is, if we come back to them, how we will do it.  The Government has said it is having discussions with different bodies and that could be a good way of managing this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022060100002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":920,"content":"<p>Unfortunately, one of the slogans used to be \"We will put more money in people's pockets\".

We need to tackle all these things while maintaining the economy and public finances on a sustainable path.  The Government's 5% rule provides useful guidance in this context, keeping Government spending in line with the underlying potential of the economy.  The flip side of that is that choices have to be made between different things because we cannot keep putting money in the pocket without saying where it will come from.<\/p> <p>  On costs, this high-cost environment highlights the contribution of domestic factors to high inflation or the high cost of living.

An important message from that report is that tackling these problems earlier makes it less expensive and gives a better range of choices than tackling them later.  That is a case for addressing these issues in a timely way and that is why we highlighted the fact there is as yet no response to the Pensions Commission's proposals.  It is ultimately a political choice.  There are a number of options: raise the pension age, raise contributions or lower benefits.  Those are political choices and I am not taking a view between them.  Probably, given the size of the challenge, you need to do a combination of those things.  The Pensions Commission recommended eventually linking the retirement age to life expectancy, which would help to reduce costs, and fairly significant increases in PRSI contributions.  The Government has to decide which of those channels it will take.<\/p> <p>  There are two driving factors which are important.  One is the population.  People are living longer.  Life expectancy aged 65 is increasing quite a bit.  The time people can expect to spend in retirement is going up and we are having a more generous pension system.  That would stop if we started to index it as the Pensions Commission suggests, but we are making the pension system more generous as we go.  The other factor, which is less well understood, is that the number of people reaching retirement age will increase by 50% between now and 2050.  These big baby boom-type generations are reaching retirement.  That is where most of the cost increase is coming from.  That is why we probably need a combination of the two.  In the Pensions Commission proposals, the life expectancy increase deals with that piece and the tax part deals with the rest.  There may be a case for increasing the taxes earlier because those people are working now so the tax base is bigger than it will be in the future.

That is very important for the public finances.  The Government was running a deficit of more than 9% of national income during the pandemic, mostly due to temporary measures.  Now that those have unwound, the public finances are in much better shape.  That shows one can have big temporary stimuli without driving the public finances massively off track though, of course, we accumulated that amount of debt, rather than permanent measures.  That is why this distinction is also a little bit important with the cost-of-living measures.  Maybe energy prices fall at some point and temporary measures to smooth over that increase may be the appropriate thing to do.  With regard to the VAT cut for the hospitality sector, the council does not look at these kinds of specific measures.  Economists are often quite sceptical about those measures - how much they actually deliver and how much they reduce prices by, as compared to boosting the cash flow of those firms.  In some cases, as during the pandemic, cash flow was the issue, but we are now in a different situation.  We know the economy has recovered quite strongly.

It has changed essentially because the economy has recovered much faster.  High inflation tends to reduce that debt ratio.  The other big thing that has changed is the budget balance which now looks much healthier than we thought before.  That is what is putting it on this downward trajectory.  Another thing that has changed which goes in the other direction is that we have seen interest rates go up a lot.  At one point, Ireland was paying zero.  It is now more like 1.5%.  It is a big change at the margin.<\/p> <p>  In the short run, we are relatively well protected because Government debt has been issued at relatively long maturities and the Government is holding quite large cash balances.  That was done for precautionary reasons but it is actually quite a good idea because it has locked in low interest rates.  It has pre-funded that.  The strategy has arguably paid off.  Eventually, however, we will have to roll that debt over and we will go from the situation we will have in the next couple of years where interest costs will fall, because the debt we are issuing is still likely to be at lower interest rates than the debt it is replacing.  That dynamic will go into reverse in the medium term.  The debt outlook has changed quite a lot.  The change has been partly favourable and partly less favourable.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the trajectory, the concern is that debt is still at a relatively high level compared to many countries and compared to what it has been historically.  We have just discussed all the pressures on the cost of living and the risks.  If those risks were to materialise and there was to be a big global recession in which Ireland was be hit badly, we would be in a different situation.  However, in an SPU scenario where we come to growth and inflation comes back under control, the years ahead will actually be quite favourable.  Unemployment will be quite low, the economy will be growing quite fast in real terms and interest rates will still be very low.  I will borrow the phrase about fixing the roof while the sun is still shining.  Those will actually be quite good years.  They are not amazing years but they will be relatively good.  Reducing public debt is a very difficult exercise.  One wants to do it in relatively favourable circumstances such as that.  One does not want to be doing it in a position where the economy is growing much more slowly which, in the long run, may well be what happens in Ireland or where one has major economic problems.  It is very much about taking the opportunities.<\/p> <p>  The policy mistake of most advanced countries over past decades has been not to take the opportunities.  When a country comes out of a recession or a slowdown, there are always problems to deal with.  The country says it will do it, but not now.  The country understands it needs to do it, but it will not do it now.  One sees that the debt goes up during every crisis.  It stabilises after the crisis for a bit and then we have another crisis.  One is basically going up an escalator.  This is really happening because of the failure to take slightly courageous decisions in relatively good times in the economy to get debt down.  If we want to avoid being caught in this trap or being in a situation that is worse where one has to reduce debt against a difficult background, this is why we should make this plan.<\/p> <p>  Of course, if the economy were to go sour, we would need to look at it differently but that is basically the reason that remains a priority despite all of the other challenges.  That is why we think sticking to the 5% rule would be helpful in that context.  Of course, that imposes choices, but it imposes exactly the choices one should be making.  If we want better public services or if we want to fund climate change, how will we pay for it?  We should not think we will borrow.  There may be cases in which it may be reasonable to do so, but we should not just do that because we are reluctant to face up to the fact that we should just be paying more or finding some savings elsewhere.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022060100002#M00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":935,"content":"<p>That is a very helpful answer.

I question that.  I would have thought the lesson in the current situation is we need to invest rapidly in areas which are making us more vulnerable to this inflationary crisis - to insulate ourselves against it rather than thinking about saving up money against the rainy day further down the road.  We should throw enormous amounts of money at education, training and apprenticeships.  We should remove every barrier to educating and training, given that the greatest resource we have is the human beings who live here but who are wasted in their ability and talent to a very large degree because it is made so difficult for them.  Large numbers of people could be contributing but it is made difficult for them to realise their potential and make a contribution.<\/p> <p>  We are seeing it now with all these bottlenecks - I love these economic euphemisms - but we have a lack of apprentices, tradespeople and people trained in areas such as construction, health and education.  It would be far better to take these windfall revenues or what might turn out to be temporary revenues from a relatively small number of multinational companies and really funnel them into an area like that, because that would actually protect us.  Obviously, we need to invest in sustainable energy production in order that we become less vulnerable to international price shocks in that area.<\/p> <p>  We also need a focus on the diversification of Irish agriculture when we consider that food security is becoming an issue again.  We need to rapidly diversify Irish agriculture which would have a very positive environmental spin-off by reducing imports and therefore carbon footprint further down the road.  It would also insulate us to some degree against inflation that is dictated by international market pressures.  These are choices.  There will be a debate potentially about this rainy day fund.  I would be interested to hear Mr. Barnes's response.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the wage thing, the RT&Eacute; website has a headline to the effect that the Minister, Deputy McGrath, says there will be tough negotiations ahead over the public sector pay agreement.  The debate has already started with the suggestion that we cannot give these workers too much to compensate for inflation.  I ask Mr. Barnes to reiterate the figure that he gave, which might be helpful in our debate in the next while.  He mentioned &euro;2 billion for pensions wages and social welfare to keep pace with inflation.  I ask him to tell us what that is based on, because it is an interesting figure.<\/p> <p>  Is there not a danger that if we do not give workers, pensioners and social welfare recipients increases at least in line with inflation, we start to create the conditions for a possible recession as consumer demand begins to fall off?  We know a significant driver of Irish economic growth has been consumer demand.  If ordinary working people just cannot afford to spend and therefore fewer goods and services are purchased, is that not as big a danger?  I take Mr. Barnes's point about not giving money to people who really do not need it or who have benefited and deciding where those thresholds would be is a matter for a serious debate.  However, is there not a big danger that if we start imagining that there could be something really wrong with giving workers pay increases or giving people pension increases to deal with inflation, it could have an equally bad effect in terms of consumer demand?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022060100002#N00800","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654038000,"counter":944,"content":"<p>The Deputy made two very important points.

Depending on how they are done, all these can, in principle, be helpful to the public finances.  They are also relevant to the public finances for other reasons.  The Government should naturally be thinking about that and the democratic process needs to take a view on it.<\/p> <p>  There may be a case that under certain conditions, some of this could be financed from some of these excess receipts.  However, there are a number of caveats to that.  The case would need to be made very carefully if the Government were planning to do that.  One of those caveats is that many of these things actually involve recurrent spending.  In education spending, for example, there is a new generation every time.<\/p><p>One is locking in recurrent spending and there may also be current expenditure that is related to the capital part.  Funding recurrent spending from a volatile source of revenue that we might lose is risky.  That risk must be carefully considered.<\/p><p> Another point is the overall amount of money put into the economy.  One of the reasons for not putting so much of the corporation tax money into the economy is that it is essentially coming from the outside and is being pumped into the economy.  In an environment where there are risks of inflation and overheating, that is a constraint on how much you can put in.  If it is funded through taxation there is an offset somewhere, in that someone has less money to spend.  If, however, you are just funnelling in external money, that is a recipe for overheating, which may not be sustainable if the tax revenues are not sustainable.  In short, definitely the investment is a source of future prosperity or at least it should be if it is done properly.  How that interacts with the rainy day fund must be very carefully considered with these kinds of receipts because there are risks involved.<\/p><p> On the second part, in terms of wage inflation I wish be clear about the figure that I gave.  It was a figure of approximately &euro;2 billion for operating for the unexpected inflation.  It is the difference between what was projected in the budget and in the stability programme update, SPU.  Inflation has actually been a bit stronger than that so the actual number would be a bit higher.  The number actually includes the State pension, public sector pay, welfare rates and payments on goods and services.  About half of that would be public sector pay.  Of the remaining, one quarter of the title would be pensions.  The welfare and the other parts are actually relatively small compared to that.  This is one of the cases for targeting the number of welfare recipients relative to the size of the economy.  Relative to the population, it is a relatively well-defined group.  That is purely the figures part.<\/p><p> On the economics, the Deputy is right.  This is one of the reasons why we say that when the Government strikes the balance, the reasons for the extra cost of living supports are partly for very vulnerable people or people on low income in general, but it is also to support the economy.  Most people's wages have not gone up in response to the inflation we have seen.  Mostly this is because we do not have a lot of choice as to whether we purchase fuel or food.  When people are having to make choices between that and other things, the other things are the ones that are domestically produced.  For example, people might go out less and they would spend less on all sorts of other domestic activities.  This is why it will slow consumption in the domestic economy.  There is some case to have some increase in wages because of that reason.  Increasing in line with the full value of those pressures for everyone is not a desirable policy because one would be helping everyone, and yet the economy as a whole is being negatively impacted by these higher import prices.  Not everyone can be fully compensated.  That is obviously a very extreme case.  The question is: within that, who is the Government going to compensate and by how much?  There is no simple answer to that.  This judgment must be reached by the political process and by society more widely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022060100002#N00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":946,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Barnes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022060100002#O00200","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":947,"content":"<p>Is everyone happy?

We are joined today by a number of officials from our Department, including Tom&aacute;s &Oacute; Ruairc and Ms Martina Mannion, assistant secretaries general, and by Ms Anne Murray, Ms Mary Cregg and Mr. Neville Kenny, principal officers.<\/p> <p>  I will speak first about the review of out-of-school provision report.  Out-of-school services are typically a provision of education, outside of the mainstream school setting, for children and young people who have encountered difficulties staying in mainstream education.  This sector has expanded over time and most often as a response to a local need.  For these students, out-of-school education provision is generally the final option within the education system, when all other supports, options and pathways have been tried and have not proved successful in maintaining their engagement with mainstream education.<\/p> <p>  The Department committed, as part of the Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, plan, to review the current provision of out-of-school education to inform future supports in this area.   The aim was to research current provision, to identify how best the sector should be served, and to make recommendations for future policy development.  This review encompasses the out-of-school education sector in general, nationwide, and is not specific to any one particular setting.<\/p> <p>  The report, which was just published on 12 May, acknowledges the need for out-of-school provision for a small number of students, for whom the mainstream school system faces challenges in meeting their diverse and individualised needs.  It also acknowledges that education provision for students, both in school and out of school, is best delivered by ensuring the voice of the child or young person is at its heart.<\/p> <p>  The next steps will involve the establishment of a working group to consider and work through the recommendations.  It is important to state that this is very much a first step in providing a policy platform for the out-of-school sector.  The working group will be tasked with considering the recommendations of the review of out-of-school education provision, and, critically, engaging with relevant stakeholders as part of this process.  The recommendations allow for consideration of possible approaches and funding models to be developed.  The working group is tasked with developing criteria for structure, governance and level of education provision, including scoping out costs associated with the implementation of the recommendations.  I am keen to progress this work and can assure the committee that these students will be supported.<\/p> <p>  I will turn now to the second issue the committee referred to in its invitation, namely, education and supports for Ukrainian students.  First, I want to highlight the fantastic work that our schools have done in welcoming so many children and young people from Ukraine into their communities over the last three months.  As I visited schools around the country, I witnessed first hand this exceptional effort by all members of our school communities from principals, teachers, special needs assistants, SNAs, staff, students, families to their wider communities.<\/p> <p>  I want to assure the committee that meeting the educational needs of children and young people from Ukraine is a priority for me, as Minister, and for my officials.  We are determined to continue our support for those huge efforts we are seeing from our school communities on the ground.  Members will appreciate the scale of the response needed, given that well over 30,000 people have arrived in Ireland from Ukraine since the beginning of this war.  Figures show that just under 6,000 children from Ukraine have now enrolled in schools in every county across the State.  To date, approximately 4,000 children from Ukraine have enrolled in primary schools, while almost 1,900 have enrolled in our post-primary schools.<\/p><p>From the early days of the crisis, the Department has moved quickly to respond appropriately.  This is why, in the early phase, we moved to establish regional education and language teams, REALT, across the country to co-ordinate school enrolment for Ukrainian families.<br\/><br\/>The primary role of REALT is to build on existing regional education support structures and the initial focus is on assisting families in securing school places when they are ready to engage with the school system.  REALT will also support schools in the area to meet the needs of these children as they emerge, to advise and support the Department in developing new capacity where required, and to co-ordinate the provision of education services to schools and families across their defined areas.<br\/><br\/>The Department is aware, through the work of the REALT co-ordinators and inspectors on the ground, that some Ukrainian pupils are accessing Ukrainian curricular material - for example, through the all-Ukraine online school, which is supported by the ministry of education and science of Ukraine.  I would like to thank those schools which have facilitated a pragmatic approach for these pupils.<br\/><br\/>The issue of appropriate language supports is an important one.  All children in the education system are provided with the supports they require to fulfil their potential.  The allocation of specialist resources to schools takes account of the needs of pupils, including where appropriate, English as an additional language, EAL, needs.  Figures show that 724 primary and 194 post-primary schools have applied for, and are now receiving, EAL teaching resources.<br\/><br\/>The Department and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science have collaborated, in conjunction with SOLAS and ETBI and in wider consultation with other management bodies and stakeholders to agree the recruitment of additional capacity for ESOL tutors, that is, English for speakers of other languages, in every ETB.  This capacity will be flexibly deployed into post-primary schools, adult education centres, or wherever intensive English language development classes need to be facilitated for Ukrainian adults and post-primary age students.  This resource will be available to Ukrainian children and young people over the summer period.<br\/><br\/>I thank the committee for the invitation to attend today and to provide an update on the review of out-of-school provision<i><\/i>report and on the actions being taken to support the educational needs of students arriving in Ireland from Ukraine.<br\/><br\/>I now invite the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, to address the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022060100002#A00200","speaker":"1582","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":960,"content":"<p>I am pleased to be here today to provide an update to the committee on education and supports for Ukrainian students, particularly with regard to special educational needs.  My Department is committed to providing every support possible to all those fleeing war in Ukraine and seeking protection in Ireland including those with special needs.  The Minister, Deputy Foley, has outlined the important work of the regional education and language teams, REALT.  The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, is a critical member of each of these regional teams in supporting families to access the educational supports they need.  NCSE staff are spending time with these families as they adjust to new school placements across the country.  While the most appropriate place for children is in the most inclusive environment in a mainstream setting, where there are known complex needs, the NCSE will work with families to get the right setting for these children.  The NCSE special education needs organisers, SENOs, are linking with other relevant State agencies, including the education welfare services and the HSE.  In addition, officials in my Department are working closely with the HSE disability services so that there is a joined up response and flow of information.<\/p> <p>  One of the key supports we can offer to children arriving from other countries is English language supports.  These supports are available generally in schools which have a large number of children for whom English or Irish is not their first language.  It has been of particular importance recently to support the large number of children from Ukraine enrolled in our schools.  I am pleased to say an allocation of English language support hours is provided to schools which have recently enrolled Ukrainian pupils.<\/p> <p>  The Minister, Deputy Foley, and I were delighted to announce this year&rsquo;s summer programme.  It is anticipated that it will support up to 48,000 children with special educational needs and children at most risk of educational disadvantage, which is a huge priority for this Government.  For the 2022 programme, the inclusion programme at primary and post-primary levels offers an opportunity for schools to address the needs of migrant students, such as addressing English language skills and integration.  This includes students who have recently arrived in Ireland from Ukraine.  This is a key part of the offering and I can confirm that it includes English as an additional language support.<\/p> <p>  Finally, it is also important to mention that I recently visited the Muslim school in Clonskeagh at the invitation of the school principal, John McDonnell, and the CEO of the Islamic Cultural Centre for Ireland, Ahmed Hasain.  In a gesture that truly illustrates the meaning of community spirit, the Islamic Cultural Centre of Ireland is willing to offer up to four classrooms to the Muslim national school to facilitate newly arriving children and young people from Ukraine, irrespective of their religion.<\/p> <p>  I take this opportunity to acknowledge the great work done by our schools and communities to welcome children and young people from Ukraine, as well as their families.  Once again, Chair, I thank the committee for the invitation to attend today to provide an update on the important work that is being done to support learners from Ukraine with special educational needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022060100002#B00200","speaker":"1472"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":961,"content":"<p>Thank you very much.

We have all been very impressed with the Cork Life Centre, in particular.  It has been in front of the committee and we have met the representatives on a number of occasions.  I do not think there was one member of the committee who was not incredibly impressed by the service it provides.  I met Mr. Don O' Leary yesterday and he was anxious that there would be some light at the end of tunnel in terms of what the centre is trying to do.  The Minister, Deputy Foley' presentation speaks again of a review.  Unfortunately, for people in the Cork Life Centre, that is not going to give them an awful lot of comfort.<\/p> <p>  I am intrigued by the phrase \"out-of-school provision\" and not \"alternative education\".  When dealing with the Department of Education, you always have to be very cognisant of the fact that it knows language very well.  The Department knows language very well, so the choice of the phrase \"out-of-school provision\" is a deliberate one.  It gives a connotation of something that is odd or unusual.  It has negative connotations in terms of what the provision does, that is, it is out-of-school rather than being part of the educational provision by the State.<\/p> <p>  Will the Minister speak specifically on the Cork Life Centre?  What support will be provided to ensure those young people can continue?  Can I ask specifically about this phrase \"out-of-school provision\" which the Department has chosen to use?  Does the Minister agree that it does not really fit well with those who are working in alternative education?  For those who attend services such as the Cork Life Centre, it is school and it is their educational experience.  They are being provided with an alternative to what many people might consider the mainstream, but it is not \"out-of-school\".  I have an issue with that phraseology.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022060100002#B00400","speaker":"1551"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":963,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  In the first instance, I take the Deputy's point in terms of language.  This report was a report about out-of-school provision which was put in place in late 2017.  That is the report we are here to discuss.  However, I take the Deputy's point.  It is important to note that in the report there is an acknowledgement of the need for the provision of education types, whatever name or title we want to give them, for a particular group of students whose needs are not met in the mainstream education setting.  It is very important that acknowledgement exists within this report.  That is the first stepping stone forward.<\/p> <p>  At the end of the day what we want to ensure is that the maximum number of our students feel their needs are being met in education, and I know Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in would share this view.  Where that is not possible in one particular type of education, then we will support their opportunities in the type of education that meets their needs.  The provision of a different type of education from mainstream education is acknowledged here.  High level recommendations are made here.  The recommendations include the need to secure that type of provision for the students and the need to find a starting point, so that we can be clear in terms of how provision of that nature will work, be funded and how there will be consistency across different centres or providers.<\/p> <p>  On the Cork Life Centre specifically - and I acknowledge the work of the Cork Life Centre and of all the other centres - this report is not specific to any one centre.

I urge the Minister to do whatever is necessary to get that over the line and get the deal that will ensure the centre continues.  This saga has been going on for three years, at least, in its latest iteration, and longer than that in different guises.<\/p> <p>  Another thing surprised me.  I was not an education spokesperson when this report was commissioned.  I did not realise until it was published that this did not include the national Youthreach programme, which to me is peculiar.  It is the largest, by a distance, provider of \"out-of-school education\", which is the phrase in the report, or of alternative education.  I know it is saying that the Minister, Deputy Harris's, Department will be represented on the implementation group but it is not clear how there is a single unified vision here for alternative education.  This report, which has some good and some bad aspects, does not take the Youthreach picture into account.  That is surprising.  The report is done but it is about how we ensure it is all tied together and there is a unified vision because Youthreach does invaluable work.  It could be described as further education but I am not sure it naturally belongs in that Department.  There is an argument it might better belong in this Department.  Be that as it may, will the Minister comment on why Youthreach was not included?  How do we ensure there is a coherence to it all in the end?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022060100002#C00800","speaker":"1460"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":972,"content":"<p>It is my understanding, although it predates both of us in that respect, that the review of Youthreach was ongoing at the time the ESRI report was published.

I acknowledge the work and role of the centre and that there has been long-standing engagement between it and the Department.  The priority now is to look at all provision of all centres and ensure there is sustainability from a funding point of view.  That is one of the tasks, the Deputy will see from the report, that the working group will focus on, as well as that there is consistency in the curriculum that is provided for.  The working group will be charged with all of that function to ensure the issues that have heretofore challenged in this area are smoothed over or worked through in consultation and in collaboration.<\/p> <p>  The bottom line is, as the report acknowledges, that there is a place for this type of education.  We have consistently said and I acknowledge that everybody here has recognised that no one size necessarily suits every student.  That is clear here, so a different approach is being taken.

When we first met the young people of Cork Life Centre, they described the arrangement as a safety net, a safe space.  Education is not for all young people and, as the Minister said, one shoe does not fit all.  Our education system has to be able to work with young people where they are at.  As said, Cork Life Centre works with young people up to the age of 18.  This should be included in the review.<\/p><p> To move on a little from the report, I wish to refer to supports for Ukrainian refugees.

The core objective is to ensure educational provision that meets the needs of students and young people who, for whatever reason, cannot have those needs met at present in mainstream education.  The objective is to ensure cohesion and financial sustainability regarding provision.

Like previous speakers, I believe we have debated this issue for a good while.  The report was instigated in 2017 and I suppose it must be welcomed that it is now being published.  At least we know where we are at.  Many of us were waiting eagerly for the report.  When I got a chance to read it a couple of weeks ago, my initial reaction was that it was a stepping stone, as the Minister said.  Considering that it was commissioned in 2017 and it is now 2022, when will we get to the destination?  For five long years, the organisations have waited, unsure of their funding from year to year.  I concede that we have provided funding for Cork Life Centre more than ever before in the past few years.  That must be acknowledged, as must the additional hours given, but at the same time the report refers to a sustainable model.  All the models and centres are different.  As Senator Flynn said, there is no one size that fits all, and that must be acknowledged.  The majority of people running the centres just want to know the resources they have and the contractual status of their teaching staff.  We are all speaking about Cork Life Centre.  A sizeable proportion of the staff there are qualified teachers and some of them have a masters degree.  They are not being paid at the same rate as their equivalents in mainstream education.

Our understanding is that many children from Ukraine with very complex needs are being supported in countries very close to Ukraine probably because of the travel and that a country like Ireland is so far away.  Officials in the Department of Education are in close contact with the HSE.  It has confirmed that the number of adults and children with disabilities arriving here is quite small.  My understanding is that only about seven or eight children from Ukraine are in special classes or special schools.  That is not to say there will not be more.<\/p> <p>  The approach at the moment is that children should be facilitated in local settings and that they should not be assessed in the very first instance.  We want to get them settled first of all.  That is based on a psychological first-aid model.  It is better to do that given that they can be so traumatised coming from a war-torn country.  Obviously, the NCSE has the information and they would be put into a specialised setting if that is needed.  The special educational needs organiser, SENO, meets parents with the aid of an interpreter.  The NCSE has also translated about 56 different documents into Russian and Ukrainian to help with the language barrier.  The NCSE so is engaging on an ongoing basis where children with autism or any type of additional need are identified.<\/p> <p>  They are part of the regional education and language teams, REALT, that the Minister, Deputy Foley, mentioned.  They know where the children are and they support them through that.  They are obviously in touch with the education welfare service and the Tusla education support service, TESS.  The National Educational Psychological Service helps with psychological supports.<\/p> <p>  The other part of the response relates to summer provision.  We hope the Ukrainians will avail the dedicated inclusion programmes this summer.  Evidence would suggest that particularly for younger children an activity-based environment is better than learning the language.  It is the best way for them to integrate in that way.  Considerable good work is being done for Ukrainians.  They are fully supported and if they need more special education teaching, SET, support - obviously the language comes under that as well - they can be given that.  They can also be given more special needs assistance, SNA, support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022060100002#E01900","speaker":"1472"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":1005,"content":"<p>Provision for the younger children will come under the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.

Those communities came out of the traumatic period of the pandemic and all the challenges that had to be overcome in that regard and are now embracing the new challenge of thousands of children without English as a first language falling into their care.  Those children are suffering from all sorts of trauma as a result of what they have witnessed and where they have come from as they settle into a new environment.  They have concerns about their family members at home.  The teaching profession and those who work in schools, including SNAs, secretaries, caretakers and boards of management, have stepped up to welcome those thousands of students to their schools.  We totally accept it was never going to be perfect.  There were always going to be teething problems.  However, there are a number of issues.  It has come to my notice, for example, that in certain circumstances a child may be in a school for a number of weeks and with very short notice, the student and his or her family may be relocated to another part of the country.  A number of families were going to schools in my constituency and with short notice were moved to Youghal.  I understand these things have to happen and that in an emergency scenario not everything is going to be done perfectly.  Will the Minister speak to how such situations are communicated and managed?  How is a school informed of those sorts of situations?<\/p> <p>  A particular young person in the neighbouring constituency of Fingal has special educational needs and is utilising the available resources in a school setting.  The change of location for that young person is going to be even more challenging as they move from one setting to another.  What communications are the different agencies having about the individual needs of children when they are being moved from one part of the country to another?  What kind of communication takes place with the school and the education partners?  Does special educational need come into that discussion?  We previously thought that the child and the family may be moved elsewhere.  Should we reconsider that?<\/p> <p>  I hope my next point does not come across as unfair but I feel strongly about this issue, as the Minister will be aware.  A Ukrainian child who is now trying to access a secondary school place will be disadvantaged by the fact that certain schools retain 25% of their intake for the children and grandchildren of past pupils.  A Ukrainian is very unlikely to have a parent or grandparent who attended a secondary school in a locality in Ireland.

It is a remarkable achievement that 30,000 people who have arrived into the country in recent weeks are being accommodated with respect not only to accommodation but also in wider society, including our schools.  There is unprecedented demand but all of society is stepping up in response.  It means some accommodation is available on a more short-term basis than others.  We are liaising clearly with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  We know where we have more or less capacity.  The priority of the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth is to provide accommodation first.  That is its primary consideration.  Up to this point, the Department of Education has been able to provide for education in areas in which the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth has found accommodation.  It is a challenge and there is no doubt about that but we liaise closely with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked specifically about children with special educational needs and the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, has articulated a response on that point.  I will invite her to come in on that point but she has referenced the numbers involved and the fact that we are managing our way through that situation.  The important point is that we must find a place to accommodate all children who require it within the school setting.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also spoke about admission policies in schools.  As I said to him earlier, we know we have capacity within our schools to meet the needs of the students as they arrive and we are doing that.  We also know that our invocation of the capacity of schools in terms of their admission is in very limited circumstances.  The important thing here is that every child has access to a place.  That is what we are intending to achieve.  I have also outlined to the Deputy that it is my intention to gather data to measure how that admissions policy is working, the impact it is having and the available opportunities, going forward.  That notwithstanding, it is important to remember that we are talking about children and young people from Ukraine.  We are currently meeting their needs and the schools on the ground, full credit to them, are providing the accommodation and places for them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022060100002#F00300","speaker":"1582"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":1009,"content":"<p>The Deputy referred to a child in a particular school in Fingal.

I acknowledge the excellent work being done by schools, by REALT and by school communities.  I also acknowledge the Department has been under very severe pressure on this.  I am sure not everything is perfect but significant work is going on.  I acknowledge the work of the Department in ensuring these children who are coming from a very grim situation are getting an education.  I commend it on that.<\/p> <p>  We have talked a little about additional educational needs.  The numbers in that regard are small but, generally speaking, when it comes to additional needs, we can be sure the vast majority of children coming to Ireland will have suffered a fairly severe trauma.  Some of the impacts of that may take time to play out and it may take time before these children feel they are in a position to articulate that trauma.  Are we looking at the budget for additional counsellors within schools, or additional therapeutic supports or anything like that?  It is not just about the child.  Schools themselves may not have the skills to help or be able to respond to a child's needs in a trauma-informed way.  That can be very challenging.<\/p> <p>  I can see where we are at with the numbers but at some stage in the midst of this, the Taoiseach talked about potentially 200,000 Ukrainians, or at least in excess of 100,000, coming here.  It is probably not possible to have a picture in the long term but what has the pattern been for the past month or two?  Is there any way of having a projection of the capacity that will be needed within the next 12 months?  Is that possible at all?<\/p> <p>  I will briefly pick up on a point Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in made on the case of the children in the northside of Dublin who ended up being brought down to Youghal.  In addition to all the points made about settling in, a practical consideration is that some of those children had bought a uniform and so on.  It might be worth putting out the message that for a while, until there is a clearer picture about where these children will end up, there should be flexibility regarding things such as uniform.<\/p> <p>  I will make a specific point about secondary schools.  Ukrainian children who are coming towards the end of secondary school are in a very challenging place because the learning is of a much higher order.  Even the English language support would generally be of a different nature, because people who might require additional support would usually have some, whereas some of these Ukrainian children might have none at all.  Are some of them being integrated remotely with Ukrainian education?  What way can they be supported?  Is it worth those children sitting the leaving certificate or should they be sitting Ukrainian exams?  I have no answers to that myself; I am just asking the question.<\/p> <p>  The Minister engaged previously with the Ukrainian Minister of Education and Science, Serhiy Shkarlet.  I engaged with him myself during an online event.  One of the matters I brought up with him was that if there are Ukrainian teachers here, one of the challenges may be Garda vetting.  I ask for an update on how that is going.  Even with the best will in the world, I am sure the Ukrainian police are under very severe pressure, as is the rest of civil society. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022060100002#G00600","speaker":"1460"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":1022,"content":"<p>On future projected numbers, I reiterate we are clear of our capacity in having a potential 25,000 places at primary school and 20,000 at post-primary.  REALT, which has been an invaluable resource to us, and I acknowledge the work of the 16 ETBs in leading that, is liaising very closely with the planning and building unit to manage our projected enrolments.  References were made to families still coming over the summer.  REALT will have access to the capacity limits and otherwise that are available to the planning and building unit.  That will be a useful resource for them as we source places for students as they arrive over the summer to be ready for September.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the children and young people who come with particular traumatic experiences, to be fair, and I have met many of the students, it is very difficult, especially with the younger ones, to know exactly what they have seen and what their little minds are processing.  I acknowledge the work of our National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, psychologists on the ground.  Significant work is being done by NEPS on programmes for schools and webinars, in particular its great emphasis on a psychosocial response in our schools.  Ensuring that the school environment for children and young people is safe and calm, and a place of connectedness for them, is a point consistently raised with me.<\/p><p>I want to acknowledge that work and any additional supports, and that is not just the supports from a NEPS point of view but across the board.  The Department has not been found wanting in making those supports available.  In terms of the leaving certificate, the Deputy raised a very good point that many of the students who come here are probably in the upper senior cycle.  I want to acknowledge that some of them - just over a 1,000 of them - continue to engage with the online Ukrainian system of education.  Again, I want to salute the schools that have made this possible for those who want to do it.  Many others are very happy to move into different year groups.  The inspectorate is working very closely with the schools in helping them to identify what year groups at the senior level, as raised by the Deputy, are appropriate to the students.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022060100002#G00700","speaker":"1582","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":1024,"content":"<p>Is the Department looking at exam centres for people to do Ukrainian exams?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022060100002#H00200","speaker":"1460"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":1025,"content":"<p>That is a fair point on the Ukrainian exams.

I wish to note my frustration that we are having a truncated meeting of 45 minutes.  I pushed for this session.  We are talking about an issue that affects 6,000 children and, by extension, our entire school community.  I do not think 45 minutes is enough to cover the huge number of questions I have.<\/p> <p>  I thank the Ministers for their presentations and for passing along the briefing notes.  They raise a large number of questions for me.  The Russians invaded Ukraine on 24 February, so we are approaching 100 days since that happened.  I said from the start that we would have to think about how we were going to approach this to try to ensure we got the best educational outcomes for the children we knew were going to arrive on our shores.  I cannot help but feel we have just defaulted to folding them into our regular school community.  If we had considered all factors and decided that was the best approach, that would be fine.  I am not sure I see the evidence of considering all of the factors.  I accept as in Maslow's hierarchy of needs that we needed to get these children accommodated.  We needed to make them feel safe and secure within our schools but I think we need to be thinking beyond that as well.<\/p> <p>  I note in the briefing note that even when we talk about curriculum, it states explicitly that in the immediate term that we are focusing on ensuring that school places can be secured for students from Ukraine and that in the medium to longer term, the Department is seeking advice from the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment regarding the model of curriculum provision.  We are still not at the point where we are considering specific curricular needs.  That is going to be complex in terms of planning because the children are going to present as complex in the first place.  Obviously, they are coming from a very different cultural and social background but also they are arriving with very complex emotional needs which will have been caused by their trauma.  We also need to be thinking about how long these children are going to be staying with us and making educational decisions around that.<\/p> <p>  I will begin with some questions because I have a large number of questions.  There are organisations that have experience in planning for the educational needs of displaced people.  UNICEF would be one of the organisations that jumps out in the first instance.  Have we engaged with it?  Have we spoken to people who have expertise and experience in these contexts?  It will not be the exact same context because an Irish primary school is a million miles removed from a Syrian displaced persons camp, for example.  Surely there are lessons to be learned from that.<\/p> <p>  If we have engaged with the Ukrainian education minister, what is it we have learned in terms of what they are hoping for in education not just here in Ireland but across Europe?  My third question is on whether we have engaged with education ministers across Europe.  Many of these people will arrive first in Poland or Moldova and will then arrive in Ireland and will remain mobile, as has been mentioned, even within our school communities.  They may arrive into Dublin or Waterford.  Tramore is a good example.  Many people were accommodated there first.  The schools have done an outstanding job in terms of folding them into the school community but how long with they be in Tramore?  We do not know.  Have we given any consideration to trying to standardise a curriculum?<\/p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire referred to school uniforms.  What about school books?  As they move from one school to another, are they going to be accommodated?  How many of these children who finished school in Tramore, Youghal, Dublin or wherever in June, will be in that same school in September?  Are we modelling for that?  I have probably 1 million more questions but I will leave it at that for the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022060100002#H00500","speaker":"1617"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":1028,"content":"<p>In the first instance, I want to acknowledge that there is considerable experience in this country too, which should not be underestimated, of dealing with students and families who have been displaced from different countries and of welcoming them into our schools.

There is already support available for migrant children and that has been integrated into the summer programme.  By the time the summer provision is over we should have a fair idea as to how many Ukrainian children have participated in it.  At the moment, they are in the process of enrolling and registering to do it.<\/p> <p>  There will be qualified teachers graduating this summer who should be able to help in terms of trying to get the participation up and making sure that we have enough staff.  Undergraduate students who have registered with the Teaching Council should also be able to support summer provision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022060100002#L00700","speaker":"1472"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":1045,"content":"<p>We have also made other provisions in terms of accessibility for the schools.

I very much welcome what the Minister and Minister of State said about the importance of the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, teams and the educational psychologists that are there to support these children.  As the Minister noted in her opening statement, more than 30,000 people have come here from Ukraine, including more than 6,000 children.  As I understand it, there are approximately 4,000 Ukrainian children in primary school and the remainder are in secondary school.  <\/p> <p>  The Regional Education and Language Teams, REALTs, are important in terms of securing school places.  I ask the Minister and Minister of State to comment on whether there have been challenges in that regard.  An update provided on 13 May by way of a press release from the Department shows that in my area of Roscommon and Galway, there were 208 children at primary school and 94 at post primary in the Galway area, while Roscommon had lower numbers, with 64 at primary school and just nine at secondary level.  Have there been challenges around school capacity?  I am very aware of schools in my area where there would be challenges, particularly in some urban settings.  How is it working in the more rural schools?<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State mentioned that the NCSE personnel are a crucial part of the teams that are being rolled out from the ETBs.  How is that working from the perspective of the Special Education Needs Organisers, SENOs, and the NCSE?  Have there been any challenges in accessing places?   I am very appreciative of the fact that St. Teresa's Special School in Ballinasloe got funding for additional accommodation.  How do we ensure we have adequate capacity? <\/p> <p>  The Minister also mentioned educational welfare services, working with the HSE disability services and English language supports, which are absolutely crucial.  We are focusing here on children who are under 18 but I have a query based on meeting a lot of Ukrainian families who have been living here for decades and whose grandparents are now coming here.  They are bringing their older family members here from Ukraine.  Is there any English language support or training through ESOL tutors being offered through the ETBs to them?  I accept that this is a little outside the remit of the Department and the primary and post-primary sectors.  <\/p> <p>  I have one other question for the Minister relating to senior cycle students and career guidance teachers.  A lot of support is being provided to schools through the REALTs to help students but what about the career guidance teachers and the options for Ukrainian senior level students?  Of particular interest is the Further Education and Training Course Hub, FETCH, whereby students can attend local ETBs and do not have to travel, which keeps costs low for students.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022060100002#L01000","speaker":"1654"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":1048,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Dolan.  In reference to the two points she raised, the REALTs have been an invaluable source for working through and finding pathways forward for us in this current situation.  I acknowledge their effectiveness and the manner in which they are operating.  There are 16 REALTS operating out of the ETBs, with a variety of supports, whether it is NEPS or the linking in with community response or whatever else.  The idea is to make access to school places as seamless as possible for children and families.<\/p> <p>  The Senator referred to the challenges.  Capacity is always a forefront challenge in terms of finding suitable places for the students but I acknowledge that the schools have met those challenges.  It has been a priority for the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to find the accommodation.  We know we have specific capacity in certain areas but the REALT has the ability to look at all schools within an area.  While there may not be capacity in one or two schools, there could be capacity in a third or fourth school and the REALT will make the necessary provision in terms of transport or whatever access is required for pupils to get to school.  This has been an invaluable opportunity for us to make it as seamless as possible for the schools and especially the families concerned.<\/p> <p>  On English language supports for adults, as the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, said, we are placing particular emphasis on language supports in schools, whether EAL or ESOL, which is made available to the post-primary children.  ESOL will also be made available to families, particularly adults, and those opportunities will be available in the summer months.  There is capacity in ESOL but online recruitment is under way for additional tutors to take up positions.  It will be beneficial to families that they will be almost like a community response to English language access.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022060100002#M00100","speaker":"1582"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":1049,"content":"<p>I apologise for interrupting but I would like to hear a response from the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022060100002#M00200","speaker":"1654"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":1050,"content":"<p>On SENOs and special educational needs, the NCSE is part of the REALT and the REALT co-ordinators are engaging extensively with schools, families and housing bodies to ensure any child with an additional need receives appropriate education.<\/p> <p>  We are talking about 6,000 children.  If we take the average that 1% of children require special classes and a further 1% need to go to special schools, we will have approximately 60 children in each category.  As I stated, we only have seven or eight Ukrainian children in special classes and special schools because we are not assessing them at this time.  The advice is not to assess children when they are coming from war-torn countries but to take the psychological first-aid approach first.  NEPS is there to support and as the enrolments proceed over the summer, we will get a better idea of how many children we have.

I thank in particular school principals and teachers and, of course, the other children in the classes who have made our guests welcome.<\/p> <p>  I will ask about some particular areas, one of which is the summer programme as there has been comment and queries on it.  I welcome the extra funding and support for the programme and the decision to provide special capacity for those who have been displaced.  Having spoken to teachers and SNAs, I have a concern about the uptake of professionals to be able to roll out the programme.  While it is welcome that the principal does not have to be present, the fact that there has to be a named teacher from each school can be a problem.  I understand from SNAs that payment for last year's programme was not made until January of this year.  There seems to be a reluctance to take up those positions again.  We need to get that right.<\/p> <p>  The home-school liaison scheme is one of the best programmes in the education system.  It has provided substantial support to families and children.  Has consideration been given to providing extra home-school liaison teachers to schools with high numbers of Ukrainians?  I am thinking of the trauma the children and their parents - it is mainly the mums who are here - have gone through.  The connection with the school and community the home-school liaison programme provides is very important.<\/p> <p>  While most schools have co-operated and tried to ensure that children have places, we are aware of schools that do not have places.  I know of a small number of Ukrainian families who have not secured a school place in the community in which they have been placed.  I am speaking specifically of Newbridge.  The closest school available is in Halverstown.  That has been suggested but transport has not been put in place.  The young boy in question has been in Ireland for two months now and has not had an opportunity to access education, which concerns me.  We need to ensure school transport is in place, particularly in September when the new school year starts.<\/p> <p>  On plans to support intensive English language learning, we do not know how long the students will be here, although we all hope the war will end soon.  There will be a need to rebuild Ukraine.  What plans are in place to provide for examinations in Ukrainian and offer intensive English language teaching, particularly for older students who are taking their other subjects through English?<\/p> <p>  The Minister stated that 49 people had registered with the Teaching Council.

That should provide for faster and more streamlined payments to staff.<\/p> <p>  It is important to stress when we are talking about this year's summer provision that extensive consultation was done last year through the inspectorate with advocacy groups and education stakeholders.  We introduced a number of measures to encourage schools to participate.  All 4,000 schools can participate.  I hope the double pay for staff will be an incentive.  We appreciate, of course, that staff have been under considerable stress with Covid, and are now dealing with Ukrainian children coming into schools.  We have tried to listen to any concerns that staff had previously and reflect those in the new measures.  As the Minister indicated, there is an overseer, better preparation times and faster payments for staff.  We eased the administrative burden on schools and given greater guidance materials.  There is flexibility regarding when schools run the programme, giving them autonomy in that regard.  We have also provided for the recruitment of final-year students who are graduating this summer, undergraduates and newly-qualified teachers.  We hope that will help as well.<\/p><p>That centralised application process should make a difference.  Schools may engage substitute staff and special needs assistants from another school if they are not available in their own school.  I hope those measures will make a difference.

More than 918 of our schools have applied for additional resources there either in terms of EAL hours or additional teaching hours.  As I referenced, we have the English to speakers of other languages, ESOL, tutors coming on stream, specifically working with senior cycle and post-primary students and wider families.  We also have initiatives like the \"Say Yes to Languages\" programme in our schools, which again will support communication among children and young people.<\/p> <p>  On the specific point around registration, we have had 48 or 49 who have applied to be registered from a teaching perspective.  It is worth noting that some of those applications have been general rather than specific to an area where they might have a qualification.  That demands another investigation by the Teaching Council as to what area they might be best suited to.  There is a body of work to be done, as well as reference vetting and all of that.  It is absolutely the objective and the intention that this would be streamlined as quickly as possible.  This would be a rich addition to our schools and we are determined to do it.  We must ensure as well that the accreditation would be for the area and appropriate.<\/p> <p>  There was a specific question on transport and school accommodation being made available.  As the committee has already referenced, we have more than 6,000 students and by the time the next numbers come out, we will probably have in excess of those 6,000 students placed in our schools.  For a variety of reasons, students present at different times.  Some, on arrival, immediately want to go into a school setting and for other reasons, others may wish to take some time, as is absolutely appropriate.  Every child's needs must be individualised.  I am not sure of the circumstances referenced by the Senator but it is quite an achievement by the schools and regional education and language teams, REALTs, to ensure we have more than 6,000 students placed.  There is also an absolute determination from the Department that where accommodation is required in terms of school transport, it is provided, whether that is on a bus route or another route to get them to school.  That is the first time the matter has been raised with me and I am interested if the Senator wishes to share the detail.  There has been a general acceptance that there has been an excellent job on the ground by the schools and REALTs.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, has dealt with the question of summer provision very well, including the aspects and consultation we have had to ensure it is more appealing for people to become involved in administration or working through it.  We will continue that engagement going forward and where there are opportunities to reimagine it or do it differently, both the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, and I are totally committed to doing it.  Our singular and sole objective is to ensure the maximum number of children get the opportunity to avail of summer provision.  We are very appreciative of the schools and staff currently in a position to do it but maybe there could be opportunities for others if we did things differently or in other ways.

This is a broadly positive conversation about provision for Ukrainian children and I acknowledge the flexibility that the Department has shown on the back of a very difficult period with Covid-19 and facing into another difficult period in accommodating children from Ukraine.  The Minister and Minister of State should be commended on the work they have done, along with school communities, teachers and principals who have worked in every corner of the country.<\/p> <p>  My question has been answered, somewhat, in that it concerns the integration aims that the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, and the Minister, Deputy Foley, touched on with the REALTs.  At this stage of the discussion, there could be more very specific questions, notwithstanding the reference by the Minister, Deputy Foley, to the period where some children may need to adjust to our life in Ireland before attending school.  Is the Department aware of any children not attending school after a certain period has elapsed?  Is there a mechanism to ensure students are either participating in Ukrainian online schooling or in an Irish classroom?<\/p> <p>  The measures announced by the Government very recently regarding Citywest poses a question.  If we put that many Ukrainian families into such a large facility, with over 700 rooms, will it put too much pressure on schools in that community?  Related to Senator O'Loughlin's question and the response of the Minister, Deputy Foley, is the question of whether we are confident in the transport systems in place for those children to be bussed to the school to which they have been allocated or which they have selected, depending on availability?  Ensuring the children have seamless access to education is critical.<\/p> <p>  My final question relates to the number of students in Ireland accessing online learning.  Do we have a breakdown of that for primary and secondary levels?  Is it concentrated in the students' equivalent of the leaving certificate.  I note the Minister mentioned that it was suspended.

Like the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, and their officials, we are working tirelessly to enact the view of the Irish people and that of the Government to the effect that we must, and we will, be unequivocal in welcoming people fleeing Ukraine.  It is our collective determination to deliver on our obligations to support access to education, social income and accommodation.  Of course this is challenging.  There are no two ways about it, but we are legally obliged to respond and, more importantly, we are morally required to do the right thing.<\/p> <p>  I am very proud to see that this approach is widely reflected throughout our society and in the education sector.  I am also pleased to say that we remain united with our fellow European Union member states in our condemnation of and revulsion at Putin&rsquo;s war in Ukraine.  On 18 March, alongside our European partners, I signed a statement on behalf of Ireland condemning Russia's aggression against Ukraine.  The key aim of this statement was to signal support for higher education students and staff in Ukraine and to suspend Russia&rsquo;s rights of representation on all structures and activities of the European higher education area.<\/p> <p>  In March, I asked Commissioner Mariya Gabriel, who has responsibility for innovation, research, culture, education and youth to convene a special Education Council meeting in order that we might adopt a common approach and response across all member states on the continuance of access to education.  I am very glad this meeting took place.  We had a very useful discussion, and it allowed for a clear and united message to be sent to Russia that EU member states are united in their stance on Russia&rsquo;s illegal, immoral and unjustified war.  The Ukrainian Minister also took part in that meeting.  The picture of destruction of education infrastructure in Ukraine provides a further imperative for me and for us to respond as generously as possible to the plight of Ukrainian students now residing in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Sadly, the numbers fleeing the destruction and violence visited on their homeland continue to grow, and facilitating the significant numbers of people arriving is challenging, not least for the education sector.  I would like to put on record with this committee my appreciation for all working in the sector and working with us to address these challenges throughout the period.  The Irish higher education sector has been open and generous in its response to the crisis.  The sector has worked constructively with my Department to facilitate the further studies of those arriving from Ukraine.<\/p> <p>  In line with the European Council decision of 4 March, the Government has committed to ensuring access to the labour market and to the education system to qualified persons on the same basis as citizens of Ireland.  My officials have written to the Irish University Association, IUA, and the Technological Higher Education Association, THEA, confirming that qualified persons, people from Ukraine residing here, should be treated as Irish students - not international students - in terms of fees.<\/p> <p>  Furthermore, my officials are examining how these students may be further supported, including financially, to facilitate their continuing education in Ireland.  I plan to bring a memorandum to Government to agree additional supports for Ukrainian students within the next few weeks.  I am happy to share some initial proposals with colleagues and this will confirm that Ukrainian students will not pay international fees.  We will also provide student supports, which will be equal to the SUSI grant scheme.  This memorandum to Government will also ensure that displaced Ukrainians living in Ireland can access our post-leaving certificate courses for free.  Crucially, additional funds will be made available for mental health services in order to ensure that  adequate services are available to Ukrainian students.  This memorandum will be considered by Government shortly and I will then be happy to share more details with the committee.<\/p> <p>  Colleagues may also know that we have tried to co-ordinate the response across the higher education sector.  We have established a national student and researcher helpdesk for Ukrainian students, researchers and higher education staff.  This has been operational since last month.  It is hosted in Maynooth University, and I thank the university for that.  It involves all universities and higher education institutions across the State.  They have seconded individuals from admissions offices, career guidance support and other areas.  It is now a single point of contact for all displaced students who are seeking access to higher education.  This will guide applicants through the documentation required to support their continued access to higher education, and the helpdesk will then be able to direct students to a local college equipped to meet their individual educational needs.<\/p> <p>  In agreeing to fund this helpdesk, I am aware that it is very well staffed by admissions and research advisers, who are the best-placed people to give advice to students and researchers.  I am happy to tell the committee that since its establishment, the helpdesk has dealt with more than 500 queries.  This number is expected to grow over the summer months.  I would encourage colleagues here - and anyone watching these proceedings - who receive calls or emails from students looking for assistance to direct them to the national helpdesk.  This is where they will be able to meet with the experts who will be able to look at the individual circumstances and guide them on what is best in the context of the continuation of their education.<\/p> <p>  I will be honest with the committee and state that one of the biggest challenges we are facing in my Department is the issue of English language supports.  English language supports are, obviously, essential to people arriving from Ukraine.  The 16 ETBs are offering ESOL courses right across the country in response to demand presenting locally.  I am happy to share with this committee details of each ETB contact person.  Again, there is a specific contact point within each ETB for the provision of English language courses.  Ukrainians wishing to learn English or to improve their English, can contact their local ETB for an assessment of their English language competency in reading, writing, speaking and listening.  The ETBs will identify appropriate language and additional learning supports.  Of course, this service is free of charge.  In some ETBs such as in Kerry, Limerick and Clare, ESOL provision is delivered on an outreach basis in the centres and in the accommodation facilities where Ukrainians are living.  This has the benefit of enabling their participation around childcare in a familiar setting but also has the function of providing information and orientation, not only in terms of their education and training options but also in accessing local services.<\/p> <p>  The ETBs are also exploring the possibility of continuing professional development courses over the summer months to upskill or retrain Ukrainian teachers to provide tutoring services.  I saw this work very well in Clare recently where a Ukrainian teacher is now upskilled to teach English to other Ukrainian people.  They are also reviewing the possible use of e-college for this provision.  Following a survey of ETB staff, Education and Training Boards Ireland ran a webinar on the topic of psychological first aid.  This is important.  We must remember that these staff are dealing with people who have fed from a war zone and with people who may be presenting with trauma.<\/p> <p>  We need to make sure that we continue to beef up the provision of English language support.  I am being honest with the committee - and it is important that we are honest here - that when I go around the country I hear a variation in the intensity of English language supports.  It is provided everywhere and is provided in every ETB.  We are in the business of now trying to recruit and train more people so that adults in particular can get that intense level of English language they may require.<\/p><p>I have met some Ukrainians who are very grateful for the English language training being provided but who tell me they could do with more classes more regularly.  We are working through that.  As colleagues will know, the level of English language competency required to participate in higher education is different from that provided by the ETBs.  With that in mind, a working group comprising representatives from the higher education sector has been established to support the acquisition of English language competency for academic purposes.  Proposals designed to support Ukrainian students for the coming academic year will be submitted to my Department imminently.<br\/><br\/>Many people ask me what is to happen in the case of Ukrainian students who have not yet accessed higher education.  I refer here to the equivalent of our leaving certificate students.  These students have not done a leaving certificate or the Ukrainian equivalent.  It has always been clear to me that Ukraine is very keen to maintain its connection with its student population.  The Ukrainian Minister has made that clear to me and to my European counterparts.  To help maintain this link, Ireland has committed to hosting sessions of this year&rsquo;s Ukrainian higher education entrance examinations.  I am pleased to inform the committee of this.  It is quite a significant development.  There will be three exams.  There will be one exam for entrance into higher education, the national multi-subject test, and two entrance exams for master's level: the master's test for educational competence for admission into master&rsquo;s degrees and the master&rsquo;s comprehensive test for admission into a speciality subject.  The examinations will be taken online in a dedicated testing centre and my officials are working with the IUA and THEA to source the necessary staff, testing centres and equipment.  As of 30 May, only a few days ago, my Department has been made aware of 229 students who wish to take the undergraduate test<b><\/b>in July.<br\/><br\/>There is an ongoing commitment to provide every support possible for Ukrainian citizens who are seeking the recognition of their qualifications.  As I am sure is also the case for colleagues, I meet many people from Ukraine who are living in Ireland and who are very keen to work.  They want to get back working.  Many of them are highly skilled and highly qualified.  My Department is responsible for the implementation of the EU directive on professional qualifications and, in that regard, we provide critical support to the work of the appropriate competent authorities by sharing best practice material supplied by the European Commission.  This includes working with and supporting these authorities as they implement the recently published Commission recommendation on the recognition of qualifications for people fleeing Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine.  <br\/><br\/>Where professions are regulated, such as the professions of doctor, nurse and teacher, the decision to recognise qualifications rests with the relevant national independent regulator or competent authority.  For example, if a person wishes to practise as a doctor, he or she will need to engage with the Medical Council, while those wishing to practise as nurses will need to engage with the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland.  Ireland has more than 45 such authorities covering a very wide range of professions from surgeons to security door personnel.  Many of these authorities have already reached out to engage with the Ukrainian community and have published dedicated material on their websites to support Ukrainians.  My Department is continuing to work with our national competent authorities, their parent Departments, the European Commission and other member states on this issue.  Through the National Academic Recognition Information Centre, NARIC, Ireland, a service hosted and operated by QQI, advice can be readily obtained on the academic recognition of foreign qualifications.  I direct colleagues to that service, which is free of charge, fully online and available in a wide range of languages spoken by Ukrainians.  I am very pleased to say that, in addition, SOLAS has scheduled the first of two Ukrainian language Safe Pass programmes with an approved Ukrainian interpreter used to help with delivery.  Fourteen people from Ukraine have been granted the Safe Pass to date.  As members will know, the pass is required for people who wish to work on a construction site.  We have made sure that training is provided in a wide range of languages used by people from Ukraine.<br\/><br\/>I will also update the committee on another matter, which I am sure we will get into during questions.  We are working to ensure that Irish students who were studying in Ukraine can continue their studies here.  Approximately 60 Irish medical and dental students were forced to abandon their studies.  In the interests of time, perhaps we can come back to that through members' questions rather than dealing with it now.<br\/><br\/>As the Chair will know, we are also working on making student accommodation available on a short-term basis during the summer period.  It is not a long-term solution nor can it be but it may provide a little bit of breathing space as our housing authorities and local authorities work to put longer-term arrangements in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022060100002#O01100","speaker":"1624","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":1076,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for coming before us this evening.  He was very comprehensive in his account of the services and supports available to Ukrainian students.  I was somewhat heartened to hear about the mental health supports he has announced, although the details are yet to be agreed.  In particular, the psychological supports he very briefly referenced will be key to ensuring that students from Ukraine have the opportunity to complete their studies.<\/p> <p>  The Minister referenced online learning with regard to entrance examinations for third level for Ukrainian students in Ireland.  It is fantastic to know that the Ukrainian authorities are in a position to facilitate that.  Will there be academic supports available for those students in Ireland?  Online learning is obviously one component.  Will academic supports be made available to students who are continuing their studies online, perhaps through the ETB supports the Minister mentioned?<\/p> <p>  The Minister touched on transport needs.  Perhaps he might like to provide a little more information.  What supports are being provided for students who are accommodated in a facility in or around a major city while attending a university or third level institution and by what means?  The Minister has not actually provided the number of third level students.  He might do so.  Are there already students enrolled or is that something we can expect in September and thereafter?<\/p> <p>  The Minister mentioned the assistance with student accommodation.  If these students are being treated like Irish students and their families are being accommodated in hotels or reception facilities, they will clearly need transport or student accommodation.  Will the Minister drill into that a wee bit?<\/p> <p>  My final point is on the recognition of qualifications and what I would refer to as language support or additional support in the classroom at primary and secondary level, although that might not be the right term at third level.  The Minister referenced the importance of English language training and additional modules of education for those wishing to enter the Irish workforce.  Is it the intention of the Department or the universities and third level institutions to absorb academic teachers and third level lecturers into the third level system to support students?  There are 6,000 primary and secondary students.  I believe 1,500 are secondary students.  I did not quite catch the total number but I believe three are doing the leaving certificate.  It is absolutely amazing that they would do that after only a few weeks in Ireland.  What will happen to them and what supports will be made available if they enter third level education given the precarious or temporary nature of their accommodation?  Will the Minister respond to those questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022060100002#P00200","speaker":"1562"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":1077,"content":"<p>The Minister has two minutes and 20 seconds.

We have to recognise that every student is going to be in a different scenario.  That is the beauty - if I can call it that - of this national line and contact point.  Students can come in have a conversation, say that they were a third-year engineering student, to take a random example, and ask where they fit in the education system, what their options are and what are the local colleges.  Crucially, they may want to continue their link with their Ukrainian university online but use a given university's library and attend some tutorials or lectures there.  We are very much in the business of facilitating that.  At the start, Ukrainian students and ourselves, when we got individual queries, would have to navigate the higher education system and go to the local university.  We are now trying to put in place a bespoke plan for each individual student as to what is best for him or her.  It is more straightforward with some programmes than with others.  Where people are with their medical studies in Ukraine may be very different from where medical students would be at the same stage in Ireland.  We are very eager to provide any support for Ukrainian students, including those who are learning online.  They may wish to become full-time students in an Irish university, and that is no problem.  They may wish to continue to study with their Ukrainian universities but to access some lectures, tutorials or facilities.  That is also facilitated.<\/p> <p>  With regard to transport and accommodation needs, what we might generally call financial needs and supports, without getting ahead of the Government decision, I will say that I have been working very intensely at a European level with my colleague, Mr. Ian McKenna here, to try to use the Erasmus scheme to support students because it provides at least the SUSI level of support.<\/p><p>I will not get ahead of the Government decision, but I have been working intensely at European level, with my colleague Mr. McKenna, to try to use the Erasmus scheme to support students because it provides at least the SUSI level of support.  If we can register all Ukrainian students at whatever level they are at, be it postgraduate or undergraduate, as Erasmus students, not only here in Ireland but throughout the European Union, we can actually provide them with a significant level of support through that initiative.  I commend Commissioner Gabriel on her work on that.<\/p><p> I will share with the committee some figures I received before coming to this meeting.  The national student and researcher helpline has received 535 unique inquiries so far.  I will provide a breakdown of where each student is at in his or her studies.  Some 266 of them are undergraduates, 40 are postgraduates and 25 are researchers.  I can also provide a geographical breakdown of where those queries are coming from.<\/p><p> I should have said that staff are included in the same way as students.  The beauty of the Erasmus programme is that it is for staff and students.  It is our intention to provide opportunities for any higher education member of staff from Ukraine who is in Ireland to work in our institutions.  Ukrainian teachers working at primary or secondary level, as was referenced, could really benefit.  I think we will see the same there.  They can also register under the Erasmus scheme for staff.  I will pick up the recognition of qualifications in the next round.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022060100002#P00400","speaker":"1624","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":1080,"content":"<p>If there are any outstanding replies, the clerk will send them to the members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022060100002#Q00200","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":1081,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for a comprehensive opening statement and the briefing document which contained considerable extra information.  My first question may lie outside the Department's remit.  The Minister said there are 64 full-time Ukrainian students in Ireland and 229 applying for this undergraduate test.  However, the figures opening the Minister's briefing document suggest approximately 3,000 Ukrainian people.  I am accounting for 300 people participating in third level education, which would only be approximately 10% of the 3,000 figure.  Do we know what the remaining 90% are doing?  Are they in the International Protection Accommodation Service, IPAS?<\/p> <p>  It strikes me that the English language skills training course is an extremely valuable capacity to build within the ETB sector.  Is that available to non-Ukrainians, as well as Ukrainians?  I know there has been an uptake in IPAS applications, as people arrive in from Ukraine.  One will always have people who are English language learners.  I know from being a language learner and a language teacher that when trying to learn a second language, it is better to be in a mixed language background.  Two Ukrainians sitting beside each other in a language setting will tend to speak Ukrainian to one another rather than English, as they are supposed to do.<\/p> <p>  What the Minister said about the Erasmus scheme was very interesting.  It answered a question that I have about how we would fund people coming into third level.  There was also reference to the MSCA4Ukraine funding, which is a &euro;25 million direct-aid package as part of the EU response.  Will the Minister tell me how that will work?  It sounds very promising.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022060100002#Q00300","speaker":"1617"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":1082,"content":"<p>I will send the clerk to the committee a detailed note on MSCA4Ukraine.  It will be done through the Irish Universities Association.  I will get Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh more detail on that.  My best answer on the difference in the figures, about which the Deputy is right, is that the larger figure is the number of people who we know fall within an age group that may well be in third level education or likely to access it.  That compares and contrasts with the number who have come forward so far.  This is a world of anecdote but I have been in many parts of the country recently and have been talking to people from Ukraine.  For many people who have fled a war zone, the priorities are shelter, food, family and safety.  Only as people begin to settle more in our country will they begin think about what is next.  That is why I indicated in my opening statement that I expect the number to grow and for that to converge more in the weeks and months ahead, especially over the summer period, as we begin the new academic year.  We are certainly seeing the number of calls to the central point tick up in a way that suggests that is probably the case.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the English language, anyone who arrives here through section 60 is covered.  There is a broader point, which is not for today because I will not have time to answer, about some of the very good things we are doing in welcoming to our country people who have fled war zones.  Perhaps we can learn from that more broadly.  I am thinking of people from Afghanistan as an example.  I met a very good organisation today called Open Door.  It works with people from marginalised groups, beyond just displaced people from Ukraine.

That position is not unique to Ireland.  It is a good proposal and it has been agreed at a European level.  The funding will come through the Erasmus+ programme.  We have been asked through the European Commissioner that the money that was due to have been spent later in the programme, in 2027 or so, will be front-loaded to earlier.  I think that is sensible.

Approximately 50% of them are in areas like medicine and computer science.  That does not mean that because a person wants to study medicine at first, second or third year that they will automatically slot into a place in medicine at first, second or third year.  There is therefore a matching exercise under way by this office as to where the person would fit within the Irish higher education system.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of places, the number is a small fraction of the overall number of places that we will have available.

That is where that stands.  It is a mix of public and private.  The figure is approximately 2,000 in the higher education institutions, which are college owned.  The figure is approximately 2,000 or 2,500 in the private sector.  We are very clear that student accommodation is student accommodation.  This is welcome in the short term but it cannot be a medium-term solution, for obvious reasons.  However, it can be a release valve or breathing space while other solutions are put in place.  Any of the higher education institution combinations that are being contracted or offered are specifically for that summer period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022060100002#R00800","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":1100,"content":"<p>I want to address the point of the 60 medical students who are returning to Ireland.

There is a group of 60 Irish medical and dental students who were forced to abandon their studies in Ukraine for their safety.  My officials - and I thank Mr. Ian McKenna and his team - have been liaising with the deans of the medical schools in Ireland.  Those deans are currently undertaking an assessment of the medical schools in Ukraine.  They are trying to match where the students were with their medical education in Ukraine with the equivalent in the Irish education system.  As I have suggested, a key element of this process is understanding the alignment between the Ukrainian programme and the Irish systems of medical and dentistry education.  Where issues arise regarding the accreditation by the professional bodies, this will allow us to see how we can best facilitate those who fled in continuing their studies.  However, to be clear, we maintain our commitment to ensuring that they can continue their studies.  We have written to them or are about to write to them.  We have written to them directly as recently as last week.  My Department has been painstakingly making sure that we keep in regular contact with them and that we keep them informed.  We wrote to them, as my note says, as recently as last Friday.

As members have already said, I welcome everything the Department has done to support Ukrainian people coming into the country.  It is the right thing to do.  I give credit to the Department for that.<\/p> <p>  Without repeating questions or going into the numbers, I will focus on the point that this situation will evolve.  This time next year, we will have a different conversation about the numbers of, for example, mature students from Ukraine who are going into third level education.  I raise the issue of people with learning difficulties going into higher education.  I understand that at the moment there is not a high number of these people in third level education, and I accept that.  However, I am sure that people at any age can get diagnosed with dyslexia.  Are there supports for people from Ukraine who have learning difficulties?  On the issue of pathways, because I am sure there are different levels of economic inequality in Ukraine just like there are here in Ireland, are there pathways in place for these students to go to colleges, in terms of QQI levels, colleges etc.?  My question is probably for this time next year.  However, even if we only had ten people going to college, it would be important that we would meet their needs.  This is especially the case for people with learning difficulties.  I am sure that is tough when English is not your first language, as well having a learning difficulty.  <\/p> <p>  I would be interested to know about interpreters.  Sitting here, I do not even know what kind of interpreters there are for people who are deaf, for example.  How will we deal with this?  I know that I have raised many questions, many of which will need to be addressed next year, rather than here and now.  However, I would be interested to know where we are with people with learning disabilities and what supports have been put in place for third level.  Those are my questions.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022060100002#R01200","speaker":"1657"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":1103,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.  Her analysis is right and honest.  This is a situation that will evolve, as the Senator noted.  We are at the early stages, from the point of view of our sector.<\/p><p>The first thing you need when you arrive in a new country having fled war is not higher education, but accommodation, food, safety, checking in with your family, learning the English language in the community, and getting your kid into school.  These are the immediate needs.  The front-line response that my Department has been involved in is English language provision in the community.  That is going well but it is under a great deal of demand.  We need to beef it up and do more.  The Senator is right, in that this issue will undoubtedly grow, if that is the right phrase, over the next 12 months.<\/p><p> Regarding a student from Ukraine with a learning disability - the Senator referenced dyslexia - or additional educational needs, I will give two answers.  That student will have the same access as an Irish citizen to the range of supports that are in place.  Any support that is in place for an Irish student with a disability in college - we will be announcing more policy on this matter tomorrow - will be available to Ukrainian students.  They will be treated no differently and will not miss out on any of those supports.  We have a fund for students with disabilities that works well in our colleges.  In fact, people often tell me that the level of support in higher education compares well to other sectors of society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022060100002#R01300","speaker":"1624","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":1105,"content":"<p>I am sorry, but perhaps I was not clear.

In the memo that I am bringing to the Cabinet, probably within the next two weeks, there will be specific funding for additional psychological support services for students from Ukraine.  I will reflect on what the Senator has said about whether there is a need to do more.  As a country, we have shown that we will not allow money to be a barrier to providing the necessary supports.  I am satisfied that, between the fund for students with disabilities, the student assistance fund, the Erasmus+ scheme and the psychological supports, which will entail additional money, we will be able to meet the aim of ensuring that everyone can continue in education regardless of additional needs.<\/p> <p>  The Senator and I both referenced the English language.  There is a difference between providing the English language for someone who wants to continue in academic studies and general English language provision.  We have a working group, which will conclude shortly, on what we need to do for the student, who could be at an advanced stage of his or her studies, for example, a masters, and needs the English language in an academic setting.  The committee can expect proposals from my Department on this matter shortly.

It is a traumatic situation for the people coming to Ireland from Ukraine.  We discussed this matter with the Minister, Deputy Foley, and the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan.  It is excellent to see what is being put in place to support these people.<\/p> <p>  The Minister, Deputy Harris, spoke about trying to identify the numbers.  We know of 6,000 - 4,000 going into primary school and approximately 2,000 going into secondary school.  The number doing the leaving certificate has been mentioned.  I understand that approximately 250 students have stated that they would like to sit the Ukrainian entrance exams in Ireland.  It is phenomenal that we are able to host those exams, so I wish to pay tribute to the Department, THEA, the IUA and the universities that are supporting that.<\/p> <p>  Even though they are more for the other Department, the Minister might have some thoughts on questions that I asked in our previous session.  I raised some interesting questions about the secondary school career guidance teacher's role in respect of Ukrainian students.  I do not know how many of the 2,000 are at senior cycle level.  As the Minister mentioned, the role of ETBs is important.  There are colleges of education in many towns around Ireland.  The breakdown of where these secondary level students are shows that there are more than 250 in County Galway, for example.  How can we deliver courses where the costs are lower, the students do not have to travel and they can do pre-nursing courses or other early study courses to reach level 5 while also doing their English language courses so that, in the following year, they will be able to engage with third level fully instead of all of the pressure being applied immediately?<\/p> <p>  The national student and researcher, NSR, help desk is fantastic.  It has dealt with more than 535 queries, which is amazing.  It can just be contacted via phone and email at the moment, though.  Does it have a web page yet or is one going to be set up?  Something with FAQs would be useful, particularly when everyone is googling and doing quick searches.<\/p> <p>  The Minister stated that students from Ukraine would be treated the same way as Irish students, they would not pay fees and SUSI supports would be available.  He also stated that post-leaving certificate, PLC, courses would be free for them.  That would be fantastic.<\/p> <p>  Regarding grants under the Marie Skodowska-Curie Actions, MCSA, the Minister referred to &euro;25 million in direct aid at European level to fund fellowships.  This is crucial.  There is such a level of education in Ukraine that we can only benefit.  When I had a chance to visit the Donamon F&aacute;ilte Centre in Roscommon, I met many young people from Ukraine who were chomping at the bit to give something back to the community.  Be it fellowships, competency courses or something done through the National Academic Recognition Information Centre, NARIC, that will be crucial.<\/p> <p>  The Minister referred to queries from approximately 25 researchers and he spoke about the specific English language competency for academics and researchers at that level.  In some science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, subjects, English is the international language.  Are specific sectors being considered?  University research teams can be very international.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022060100002#S00400","speaker":"1654"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":1108,"content":"<p>The Senator is right about career guidance.

I have visited quite a number of ETB centres in several counties over the past month and have been blown away by the level of work they are doing and the skills on show across the range of programmes that they offer.  With SOLAS and using translators, they provide Safe Pass classes.  They also provide access to cookery classes.  I met many women displaced from Ukraine who were teaching our learners about their national foods and exchanging ideas.  Nice intercultural work is happening.  The ETBs are also ramping up provision of English language teaching.  The further education and training, FET, colleges are playing a major part and the work is already happening.

There are probably around 500,000 people in third level education in Ireland and we are talking about 535 calls to the helpline.  I expect that number to grow and as Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh reminded us, slightly more than 3,000 people between the ages of 18 and 24 years have come from Ukraine.  From our point of view, it is very much about putting additional support in place.

I am an adjunct professor in finance in the school of business, Trinity College.  Previous to this, I was an associate professor in finance there.  My interest in this topic stems from research interests in the area of corporate tax, shadow banking and regulation of financial firms.<\/p> <p>  Revenue defines a section 110 firm as &ldquo;an Irish resident special purpose vehicle that holds and\/or manages 'qualifying assets'\".  Firms that have section 110 tax status are self-declared, that is to say a firm informs Revenue that it qualifies as a section 110 firm.<\/p> <p>  There are very valuable tax benefits to being a section 110 firm.  Interest paid abroad is tax-free while interest paid in Ireland is tax-deductible.  This is because interest payments may vary and become a distribution of profits and are treated as a dividend when paid abroad.  They are referred to as a form of hybrid finance.  Due to this tax treatment, section 110 firms were a very attractive form of finance for Russian-based firms.  Capital could be raised at interest rates that were relatively low given the risks of providing finance to Russian-based firms.  There was relatively little regulation, apart from a requirement to comply with the Companies Acts, and there were no restrictions on the use of funds raised.  Corporate profits, net of interest, are low or zero, hence corporate tax payments are also low or zero.  This is often described as \"tax neutrality\".<\/p> <p>  To keep within the time limit, I will skip to the section of my statement on the funds raised.  Total funds raised by Russian-connected section 110 firms amounted to &euro;118 billion for the period from 2005 to 2017.  A further &euro;17 billion was raised on the Dublin Euronext market in the period from 2018 to 2021.<\/p> <p>  I will move on to the assets of Russian firms in Ireland.  Table 2 in my written submission shows a very partial inventory of Russian-connected assets located in Ireland.  A full inventory would be very useful because the number of Russian firms and individuals subject to sanctions, including the freezing of assets, is likely to be extended.  In addition, assets may be not just frozen, but confiscated.  The European Commission has published a draft directive on criminalising the evasion of restrictive measures and has also published a draft directive on asset recovery and confiscation from criminal activities.  <\/p> <p>  Table 2 shows that Russian-connected section 110 firms comprise the largest component of Russian-owned assets in Ireland.  The next largest component is made up of Russian aircraft leasing firms.  The value of these assets in 2020 is likely to be far larger than the &euro;5.4 billion shown in table 2 as 15 of the 20 firms identified, although active, have not filed accounts.  All of these firms are subject to tax at 12.5%, unlike section 110 firms, and account for around 85% of aircraft leased assets in Ireland.  Even though they are similar to section 110 firms, the Central Bank collects no records or data on these firms.<\/p> <p>  I will now address the issue of holding companies.  The use of holding companies in Ireland by Russian-connected companies has changed over time.  A former US expert on organized crime in the former Soviet Union gave evidence to the US House Committee on Financial Services that identified Ireland as a major location for wealth leaving Russia in the post-Soviet period.  A search of Companies Registration Office records for directors of companies with a Russian address, for example, an address in Moscow, shows several hundred companies incorporated in Ireland in the period from 1992 to 1996.  Most of these firms were dissolved without filing accounts.  One estimate is that 50% of the total financial wealth of Russia is held offshore. This wealth is most likely held by incorporated entities and holding companies.  A report published by Chatham House states that incorporated entities and trusts are also used to layer ownership through chains of ownership in financial centres such as Ireland, the Netherlands, Malta and Cyprus. The purpose, of course, is to hide the source and ownership of assets.<\/p> <p>  I will skip to my comments on establishing ownership and sanctions.  In order to impose sanctions, Governments rely on professional firms such as corporate service providers, CSPs, to correctly identify the ultimate ownership of a company.  A CSP may, for example, believe that the ultimate owner is located in the Cayman Islands, whereas in fact the Cayman Islands firm is a subsidiary of the ultimate owner, resident in the State of Belize.  Even if the ultimate owner was correctly identified at the date of incorporation, ownership may subsequently change at any point along the chain.  Similar issues arise in respect of money laundering.  Reliance on a \"know your client\", KYC, process can lead to difficulties in identifying the owner of cash.<\/p> <p>  I will skip to my final remarks, which are on the future of section 110 firms.  Post the Ukraine war, the use of section 110 firms may decline due to increased regulation at an EU level and restrictions on the global movement of financial flows.  Section 110 firms may be regarded as tax neutral in Ireland but they can result in large tax losses in countries which receive interest payments.  For this reason, the use of hybrid finance has resulted in a number of EU anti-tax avoidance measures, for example, interest limitation rules.  The proposed EU directive on shell companies is also likely to impose restrictions on firms that have no fixed assets or employees.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022060100002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Jim Stewart"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":1143,"content":"<p>I call on Senator Higgins.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022060100002#A00400","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":1144,"content":"<p>I am having a little bit of a technical issue with my computer.

I thank Dr. Stewart for coming before the committee.  I know this is something he has been focused on for quite some time.  It really came into the spotlight in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.  There was then a lot of talk of financial and economic sanctions and, as a result, the spotlight was turned on the role of the International Financial Services Centre, IFSC, as one of the main finance hubs for Russian State-owned and oligarch-controlled companies.  It is thanks to Dr. Stewart's work that we are fully aware of this situation so I really thank him for coming before the committee.  The collapse of the Soviet Union resulted in a lot of capital flight and offshore financial centres such as the IFSC were absolutely key to this.  Some estimates suggest that approximately 50% of Russian wealth is held offshore.<\/p><p>I have a number of questions.  In 2018, <i>The Sunday Business Post<\/i>carried a story on its front page that cited Dr. Stewart's research.  It noted how Russian-connected companies funnelled billions through the IFSC.  Following this, the former deputy governor of the Central Bank, Stefan Gerlach, said Irish politicians were &quot;mindlessly in favour&quot; of the growth of the IFSC.  He went on to say that they did not recognise the risks involved in the facilitation of massive influxes of cash to companies such as Russian banks and oil giants.<\/p><p>He also said they were much too positive about the benefits of the IFSC, such as employment for lawyers and accountants.  Does Dr. Stewart share this view and, if so, is that mentality out of step with the efforts currently being undertaken at European level like the forthcoming EU shell company directive?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022060100002#A00600","speaker":"1579","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654038000,"counter":1147,"content":"<p>It is difficult to know what the issues are with section 110 companies and indeed other aspects of the operation of the IFSC.

It is difficult to trade off various points that employment will be affected and certainly the IFSC employs people but there are also certain activities that are not very productive for Ireland or indeed for the EU generally.  You can certainly say there could be much greater regulation but there are issues with regulation because Ireland is a small country and the IFSC is very large.

On the back of that, is Dr. Stewart aware of any regulatory action taken by the Central Bank in the wake of this to tighten up the regulation of these firms, when this issue was highlighted four years ago?

Huge amounts of wealth have left Russia in recent years through Estonia, Latvia and other countries.  Some of the funds, though not all of it by any means, has flowed back to Russia to help with the financing of Russian firms.  That is kind of new and section 110 tax status has given particular advantages to Russian firms in the sense of lowering the cost of capital, lowering the risk of investing in Russia and hence making it easier for firms like the Russian railways company to raise large amounts of money using section 110 status.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022060100002#B00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Jim Stewart"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":1152,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Stewart.

This State introduced its register of beneficial ownership as part of the EU's fifth anti-money laundering directive.  However, as has been noted by Transparency International it permits the use of legal trustees to list themselves as beneficial owners when we know they are not the beneficiary but rather acting on behalf of them.  It also only requires those with a shareholding of over 25% to record their ownership.  In a company with four owners with an equal shareholding of 25%, none of them would be recorded as beneficial owners.  This being the case does Dr. Stewart believe this State's register of beneficial ownership is fit for purpose?  Do we need to lower the ownership thresholds?  Should we allow trustees to be recorded as beneficial owners?  We know some of these Russian-connected companies did not merely use trust ownership structures.  Some even used charitable trust ownership structures and from what we can see these companies are not exactly the Red Cross, so does he think that is appropriate?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022060100002#B00900","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654038000,"counter":1155,"content":"<p>Hiding the beneficial owner applies not just to the IFSC but to lots of other regimes as well.

This seems to be a recognition of the fact these supposedly independent section 110 firms are in fact part of a group structure and they are fairly tightly controlled.

A number of the issues I was going to raise have been raised by Deputy Farrell but I will follow up on a few points.  I am interested in the issue of double non-taxation.  Perhaps Dr. Stewart could comment further on that point in the context of the conversation around the effective tax rate.  There is a push on the idea of an international effective tax rate.  It was out of step with proper processes in the past but perhaps Dr. Stewart could comment further in the current context where there is meant to be that push towards a global effective tax rate.<\/p> <p>  Are section 110 vehicles onshore entities?  They are marketed as such but seem to meet the criteria the IMF has set out for offshore financial centres.  The IMF describes those as countries or jurisdictions providing financial services to non-residents on a scale that is incommensurate with the size and financing of the domestic economy.  That is important because, as was touched on, there is a danger of their distorting the measurement of our financial economy.  Should section 110 vehicles be recognised as offshore in that context?  If they are being treated as onshore but do not touch the real domestic economy in any meaningful way, that will throw off our foreign direct investment, FDI, figures.  Perhaps Dr. Stewart would comment on that onshore or offshore piece.<\/p> <p>  I am also interested in the beneficial ownership piece.  The following is related to but does not touch directly on section 110.  Investment limited partnership legislation went through approximately a year and a half ago.  What was particularly notable was that it seemed for that particular form of company the legislation increased the powers of non-beneficial ownership while diminishing liabilities.  One was not considered to be a beneficial owner unless one hit the 25% threshold, yet one was allowed to sit on the board, make decisions and engineer hiring, which one would not have been allowed to do in the past.  How is control measured?  We only have the blunt measures around the 25% ownership and the control of 25% of voting when there are other mechanisms for control such as, for example, seats on boards.  I would love for Dr. Stewart to elaborate further on the case he mentioned because this issue extends beyond the question of Russian assets.  There are also questions around parent companies and group companies, and the control a group may exercise on a charitable trust that comes under that group even though the trust is registered as a charity.  Are we monitoring control effectively and in the right ways?  Do the beneficial ownership rules, the 25% rules and even the 25% voting rights rules evade the proper monitoring of control?<\/p> <p>  How section 110 companies lend their money seems to be one of the main mechanisms over which there is little monitoring.  There seems to be little monitoring of what section 110 companies do with their money in respect of things such as loans.  This is not my normal area to expertise but we know that in the past a sanctioned company was able to receive loans through a section 110 structure.  Will Dr. Stewart comment in respect of loans from a section 110 company to another entity?<\/p> <p>  Dr. Stewart touched in his opening statement on the aircraft leasing sector.  That is an interesting sector which requires much more scrutiny.  I am a member of the Joint Committee on Environment, Climate and Communications and, in an area that is slightly related, I am aware that one of the major beneficiaries of financial subsidy from the State is jet kerosene.  Some &euro;600 million goes to jet kerosene tax relief every year.  That is an enormous subsidy for fossil fuels and public moneys are forgone in tax in that sector.<\/p><p>Given that the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action is considering this matter, I am very interested in the scrutiny of aircraft leasing structures and those company structures.  Dr. Stewart touched on the issue briefly and I would appreciate hearing more.  He will be able to take the more useful questions from my questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022060100002#C00700","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654038000,"counter":1165,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for asking very interesting but rather challenging questions.  She is right that the issue of beneficial ownership is very difficult, particularly the supposed ownership by a charitable trust or a trust.  This is a legal fiction because the firm is tightly controlled.  It might be tightly controlled by the trust deeds.  It can be described as an orphan structure as it has no parent or subsidiaries that try to restrict it in what it may do.  Nevertheless, I have noticed that lots of the section 110 aircraft leasing firms have a financial deficit.  For 2020, out of the 171 firms examined, 23% had a financial deficit of 10% or more.  How do they continue to operate if they are effectively insolvent?  It is understood that the control company will step in to provide funds to the firm.  The problem is that there is a legal fiction that such firms are independent.  They are actually part of a group and the group advises a way of efficiently financing the firms in an equitable and cheap way.<\/p> <p>  There is an issue about raising funds and then the purpose for which they are used.  That is a serious issue, particularly for the Russian-financed firms, where funds were raised and used for military expenditure by certain banks in the IFSC.  We do not know how much, but we know it was a certain amount.  Again, that is a problem with the use of funds by section 110 companies.  How can one police what happens to the funds?  Are the funds used in a way that is compatible with Irish laws and international laws?<\/p> <p>  There are huge issues with the financing of these firms and how they are structured.  The structure of firms' assets is constantly changing.  Finance constantly evolves in terms of tax incentives and market conditions.  One must be constantly vigilant as to how these firms raise funds and how they are being used.  It is a problem that there are too many tax incentives - in section 110 about aircraft leasing and in other areas.  It is difficult to justify these tax incentives given the costs of the tax reliefs not so much to Ireland - they might be tax neutral in Ireland - but to other countries, which they cost a lot in terms of tax reliefs and a lack of taxable income.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022060100002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Jim Stewart"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":1166,"content":"<p>On the tracking of parent companies, Dr. Stewart mentioned group structures and the control mechanism.

For example, the OECD has grappled with this issue and has failed to come up with a reasonable definition of a tax jurisdiction so Bermuda, the Cayman Islands and other jurisdictions are not regarded as tax havens.  It is difficult to tackle these issues.  One needs more of an EU-wide regulatory system to examine these issues, and let us remember that we must compete with Luxembourg and other financial centres.  It is often the case that a tax change in Ireland is justified by the argument that it happens in Luxembourg or it helps us to compete with other tax centres such as Malta and Cyprus.

Actual charities are subject to quite onerous and rigorous regulation.  Do we need to rigorously re-examine what constitutes a charitable trust?  How does the term \"charitable trust\" relate to registered charities and their activities in Ireland or elsewhere?  What type of relationship should a parent group have with a charitable trust within its group in terms of how the assets of a charitable trust may be used by a group structure and how liabilities are dealt with?

From the point of view of marketing and selling various financial products, it might be easier to sell them if they are marketed as being onshore but, in fact, for tax and other reasons they are effectively offshore.<\/p><p>Most of the activities in the IFSC are offshore.  They have nothing to do with the Irish domestic economy and for that reason they are not subject to regulation or there is minimal regulation by the Central Bank.  The distinction between offshore and onshore with regard to IFSC activities is minimal.  I do not understand why one would wish to make a distinction.<\/p><p> With regard to charitable trusts, it is quite obvious that section 110 companies are not charities in the way the Society of St. Vincent de Paul or other charities are.  Corporate law has evolved to allow companies to be termed charitable trusts and to be taxed and regulated as charitable trusts when they are not, in fact, charitable trusts.  The Charities Regulator certainly does not look at section 110 firms, yet they have the legal status of being a charity.  I suspect the reason for that is to try to protect the assets.  If it is a charitable trust and if other parts of the firm go into liquidation, the trust keeps its assets intact.  They cannot be touched by other creditors.  The problem is that if the assets of the charitable trust fall below the debt that has been raised to fund those assets, then it becomes effectively insolvent.  For example, a number of the aircraft leasing firms may become insolvent or suffer large losses because of the Russian action in respect of aircraft leasing firms from Ireland to Russia.  It is a thing that puzzles me.  How is it that charitable trusts have become such a key component of corporate finance and how have they become integrated into company law and used alongside companies that are subject to the Companies Acts?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022060100002#D01000","nonspeaker":"Dr. Jim Stewart","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":1175,"content":"<p>There was a military manufacturer in the UK a few years ago that had a section 110 company in Ireland, if I recall correctly, that was registered as a charitable trust but it was very much a subsidiary of the military manufacturer.

This is in contrast to the national statistical agency which defines one's location as the country of residence, where one is incorporated.  That is why there is such a large gap between US estimates of profits of US firms in Ireland and the Revenue Commissioners' estimates.  The US would say that if one's profits are made in Bermuda and the company is owned in Ireland, the profits are attributable to Ireland, whereas the Revenue Commissioners would say the profits are attributable to Bermuda.

If firms locate in the IFSC because of an array of products that are used here including section 110 financing, for example, will it affect their decision to locate here?  Given that they employ very few people and that there are many other ways of financing a firm, maybe some activities would move to other financial sectors but I do not see any inherent problem if section 110 companies close down.  We need to remember that most of the employment provided through section 110 firms must be indirect.  It is law firms, corporate services agencies and accounting firms providing services to these companies.  I do not believe any single law firm or accounting firm is dependent solely on auditing section 110 accounts.  It must be a fraction of such firms' income.  Some corporate services firms may be more dependent but the vast majority are dealing with companies other than section 110 companies.<\/p> <p>  The number of companies in Ireland which have no assets or employees, shell companies, is vastly larger than section 110 firms.  The Central Bank defines shadow banking as being equivalent to section 110.  This is not true.

It is likely that there are many thousands of shell companies in Ireland given that definition of no fixed assets and no employees.  However, they may be doing useful commercial tasks, particularly holding assets or patents, or buying and selling property.  These sorts of activities tend to shade into the shadow banking sector.

They are not remote from bankruptcy in the sense that if their assets fall in value, the debt owners are subject to liability.  A write-down in assets is associated with a write-down of debt.  In that sense they are not bankruptcy remote, but in some sectors they are.  If an aircraft falls out of the sky, for example, who is liable?  Is it the insurance company that is asked to cough up?  Who actually pays for this?

These regulations are being made pursuant to the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005.  The Act provides for the protection of the public by promoting high standards of professional conduct, education, training and competence through statutory registration of the health and social care professionals designated under the Act.  Regulation under the Act is primarily by way of registration of practitioners and the statutory protection of professional titles.  The use of protected titles is restricted to practitioners granted registration under the Act.  Registrants must comply with a code of professional conduct and ethics and are subject to fitness to practise rules similar to those applying to nurses, midwives and doctors.  The structure of the system of statutory regulation comprises registration boards for the professions, a committee structure to deal with disciplinary matters, and the Health and Social Care Professionals Council with overall responsibility for the regulatory system.  These bodies and the executive are collectively known as CORU.  The Act prohibits a person whose name is not on the register from using the title of a designated profession and provides that CORU may initiate a criminal prosecution summarily to enforce the prohibition on a designated title's misuse.<\/p> <p>  When the podiatrists' register completes its two-year transitional period on 31 March 2023, the title of \"podiatrist\" will be protected.  The Podiatrists Registration Board contacted the Department in 2019 requesting that the title of \"chiropodist\" also be protected as a variant of podiatrist.  The registration board's view is that the public cannot be adequately protected without protection of this title.  In its correspondence to the Department, the registration board set out a number of reasons for its view.  It stated that many members of the public, particularly the older generation, still use the title \"chiropodist\", and it is concerned that some of those who will choose to use that title may not have the correct skills to treat patients.  If the title \"chiropodist\" is not protected in the State, there will be practitioners who may take advantage of this and choose not to register with the regulator but continue to use the title.<\/p><p>The registration board highlighted that the HSE still uses the title chiropodist for some of its podiatric staff and grading system.  Therefore, the terms continue to be used interchangeably even in the professional field.  This only adds to the likelihood that the public could unwittingly use the services of an unqualified professional.  The fact that a high percentage of these professionals are in private practice raises the risk to the public in this regard.  In short, if the title of chiropodist remains unprotected then those practitioners who do not want to submit to the oversight of a regulator could legally continue to practise using the title and the public could unwittingly continue to use their services.  The Health and Social Care Professionals Council would have no powers to initiate a prosecution against the practitioners.<br\/><br\/>The Department sought the view of one of the main professional bodies - the Society of Chiropodists and Podiatrists.  The society welcomed the protection of the title chiropodist as a variant of podiatrist and agreed that the two titles are used interchangeably by the public.  It highlighted that the term chiropodist is the original term but the English-speaking world has moved towards the term &quot;podiatry&quot; in the recent past.  The view of the professional regulation unit is, therefore, that the variant title of &quot;chiropodist&quot; should be prescribed in order to protect the public and ensure that its use is restricted to qualified professionals registered with the Podiatrists Registration Board.<br\/><br\/>Section 95(3) of the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 provides that the Minister for Health &quot;After consulting the registration board of any designated profession ... and any organisations that he or she considers appropriate, the Minister may, by regulation, prescribe one or more than one title that is a variant of the title specified in that section for the profession&quot;.  <br\/><br\/>Section 95(7) provides that:<\/p><blockquote>\tA regulation may be made under <i>subsection (3)<\/i>only if&mdash;  \t(<i>a<\/i>) a draft of the proposed regulation has been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, and<br \/><br \/>(<i>b<\/i>) a resolution approving the draft has been passed by each House.  <\/blockquote><p>The Podiatrists Registration Board opened its register on 31 March 2021 and the transitional period for existing practitioners to register will end on 31 March 2023.  Once the transitional period ends the title &quot;podiatrist&quot; will become a protected title.  Subject to the approval of the Houses, it is proposed that these regulations will come into effect as soon as possible, which will allow the title &quot;chiropodist&quot; to be protected\u00a0as soon as the transitional period ends.<br\/><br\/>I thank everyone for their attention and I am happy to take questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022060100002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Alessandra Fantini","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":1281,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Fantini and open up the debate to questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022060100002#B00200","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":1282,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Fantini for her presentation and the delegation is very welcome.

The Hepatitis C Partnership is a national network of stakeholders working towards the elimination of hepatitis C in Ireland.  It is our mission to end suffering, illness and death associated with hepatitis C.  We want to ensure that everyone has access to life saving treatment for hepatitis C.  Our members represent the statutory as well as the community and voluntary sectors with patient involvement at its centre.<br\/><br\/>Hepatitis C is an infection of the liver caused by the hepatitis C virus.  If left untreated, it can cause permanent damage to the liver over many years.  Most people become infected with the hepatitis C virus by sharing needles or other equipment used to prepare and inject drugs.  From 2004 to 2019, 15,700 people in Ireland were diagnosed with hepatitis C.  Each year, 600 to 700 people find out they have hepatitis C.  There could be as many as 30,000 people in Ireland living with the virus.  To date, more than 5,000 patients have been treated with highly effective direct acting antiretrovirals, DAA&rsquo;s, for hepatitis C.  Many of these people were treated successfully.With a cure rate of approximately 96%, these highly effective drugs with minimal side effects transformed hepatitis C virus care globally. <br\/><br\/>Reflecting on the scale and impact of medical advancements as a utility of quality-of-life improvements for people living with hepatitis C we had an opportunity in the later part of 2021 to provide a platform for a range of stakeholders to share their insights and experiences across the hepatitis C care cascade, that is, testing, diagnosis, linkage to care, and living hepatitis C-free.  There are opportunities for growth as well as models of success across the provision of community care.  The report has outlines some key issues.  We have provided the committee with a more detailed written submission and here we will focus on three of them: first, understanding the challenge region by region; second, building pathways to support elimination in a sustainable way; and, third, driving hepatitis C elimination.<br\/><br\/>Understanding the challenge of addressing hepatitis C on a regional basis allows for the creation of community-based models of care with specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and timely, SMART, objectives for each county.  A named mode of delivery linked to the wider network provides opportunities for knowledge sharing and nuanced approaches.The national hepatitis C treatment programme, NHCTP, has already done a significant amount of work on a strategic plan, which is currently being reviewed by the relevant Government stakeholders.  The national and regional implementation plans should be developed in a manner consistent with the overall strategic plan.<br\/><br\/>The first recommendation is to establish regional needs with regional experts and identify any specific challenges in different regional areas considering at-risk cohorts, likely burden of disease, accessibility, and resource needs across the cascade of care.  The second recommendation is to set national and regional implementation plans and assign ownership to a named role for delivery, both regionally and nationally, and set SMART objectives for implementation.<br\/><br\/>I now turn to the second theme of building pathways to support elimination in a sustainable way.  There is an inequality in access to hepatitis C care as it is largely dependent on where you live and your characteristics as a patient.  Every effort should be made to create a policy framework that is driven by the need to test and treat as flexibly and locally as possible, to realise Sl&aacute;intecare&rsquo;s vision for equality in the context of liver care.  This system should be tailored for specific regional needs but generally built around a flexible hub-and-spoke model with a strong patient-centred ethos, recognising that many people living with hep C may have experienced significant trauma in their lives.<br\/><br\/>On the third recommendation to unblock existing policy barriers and set policy to enable elimination, we should remove the requirement that patients need to be engaged with opioid substitution treatment to be treated in the community by their GPs and broaden the range of testing opportunities by enabling a diverse range of community testing initiatives.<br\/><br\/>On the fourth recommendation that we should build a community-based, nurse- and peer-led system to drive elimination, we want to use existing hospital-based consultant-led services in each regional area as hubs and existing community services such as opiate substitute treatment, OST, clinics and GP-led services as spokes.  Recognising the pressures that hospital and community professionals are under, support should be flexible and <i>ad hoc<\/i>, and it should leverage online tools, such as teleconferencing and emails, as a preference.  It should include paid peer workers with relevant lived experience to provide community-based testing, and patient support across the cascade, learning from the positive experience of the model in place at the Mater hospital in Dublin.<br\/><br\/>The fifth recommendation involves ensuring utility beyond hepatitis C.  We must ensure that the system has a role in addressing longer-term liver care in Ireland after the initial push to eliminate hepatitis C.  When a suitable system is in place to drive hepatitis C elimination, we need to help people access it.  Some people who are treated for Hepatitis C will have ongoing liver-care needs, will continue to be exposed to risk factors post-treatment, or will have other issues in their lives around which they seek support.  The drive to eliminate Hepatitis C should be seen as an opportunity to link people to formal systems of care.<br\/><br\/>The sixth recommendation is to find the missing thousands.  We want to ensure widespread and sustained public health promotion campaigns targeted at the missing thousands who are currently living with undiagnosed hepatitis C in our communities.<\/p><p>These campaigns should include a strong peer-led outreach component and can focus on the positive impact of addressing hepatitis C in the community.<\/p><p> Finally, recommendation 7 is focused on supporting good longer-term outcomes.  People who access treatment and require additional inputs, such as around housing, employment, education or psychosocial support, should be helped to access those supports as needed as part of the recovery capital approach.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for its invitation to attend today's session, and its attention to these important issues.

I am a project worker with the Hepatitis C Partnership.  Briefly, this is the story of my lived experience.<\/p> <p>  I first got my bloods tested in the late 1990s.  I was not even thinking about hepatitis C at that time.  It was not on my radar at all.  To be honest, I only got tested because there was mass testing at the addiction services, which I attended and which I am thankful for today.  I had no idea that I would get a positive result for what was at the time a lifelong illness.  After the initial anger and shock, I put it to the back of my mind.  I did not take much heed of it for a while.  The way I was told was that I had not got HIV; I had only got hepatitis C.  The information I was given was that it was a slowly progressing illness and it would not affect me for ten or 20 years.<\/p> <p>  In the circumstances I was in at the time, there was huge stigma and a lack of information.  There was minimum support around getting diagnosed, living with it and protecting others.  I did not know anything about hepatitis C at the time.  All I knew was that you do not tell anyone you have it and you do not talk about it.  Seven or eight years passed before I began to think of addressing it.  I realised that the hepatitis C diagnosis I had been ignoring was not a good thing to have.  I suddenly felt as if there was an intruder in my body.  I was in a different chapter of my life then and I began to comprehend the severity of living with this potentially life-threatening illness.  I sought out information on the disease and its treatment.  My fears around passing it on to loved ones were in the forefront of my mind.  It was a dirty and uneasy feeling, and it began to haunt me.<\/p> <p>  One of the big issues with hepatitis C was that, initially, I did not have any symptoms and it was easy for me to put it to the back of my mind.  The realisation was simple.  Hepatitis C was attacking my body, whether I was showing signs or not.  I had begun to start thinking about my well-being and quality of life.  I started to appreciate life and I wanted to keep going down this positive path.  The stigma of hepatitis C is very difficult.  You do not look sick.  It can be easy to almost forget about it until something happens, which for me would be when I was brushing my teeth or if I had an accident and any cuts.  I would react badly and would not want anyone to come near me.  I felt contagious and like an outcast.<\/p> <p>  I began treatment with the first batch of direct-acting antiviral drugs, DAAs.  I successfully completed this treatment in 2014.  When I got my first negative sustained virologic response, SVR, which meant there was no virus present in my blood, I felt relieved.  It was hard to believe that it was actually over.  It was surreal.  I asked myself if it could be real that I was actually cured, and that I no longer felt infectious or a risk to others.  I did not realise at the time that I could use my lived experience as a positive tool to support others in similar circumstances.  In my current role within the Hepatitis C Partnership, and my previous role working directly to support individuals accessing treatment as an outreach peer worker, I drew upon these experiences to relate to individuals in an empathetic way to offer support and encouragement for others choosing treatment.<\/p> <p>  I thank the committee for its invitation to attend today's session and for the opportunity to share my lived experience.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022060100002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Lawrence Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":1347,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Murphy.

The issue is that certain populations that are prone to hepatitis C, such as people who use drugs, traditionally tend to avoid mainstream services.  For example, I had 40 people in my clinic for homeless people who needed treatment for hepatitis C.  I referred 40, but 23 missed their first appointment and 16 missed their second appointment and we ended up only getting three treated.  We set up a shared care programme with the Mater hospital - this was before GPs were being allowed to treat.  We brought the treatment to the clinic using a hepatitis C nurse and we actually got all those 40 people treated on site.<\/p> <p>  Since then, GPs have been allowed to prescribe and we are able to do that prescription ourselves.  It means that instead of referring people who come into hospital, as they are unlikely to get the hospital appointment letter in the first place, they do not keep regular lives and they do not tend to keep appointments, we can get them on the treatment then and there, get their bloods done, get their tests done and get the treatment prescribed in the pharmacy.

My understanding is that the situation within the prison system is similar.  For example, as I clarified with a colleague in the Prison Service yesterday, if a person is currently in a Dublin-based prison, there is availability of treatment and an effective programme.  As Dr. O'Carroll said, secondary care is not required and those undergoing treatment do not need to leave the prison system to attend hospital, unless they are particularly sick, which is rare.  In respect of Cork, it was announced last summer that the national hepatitis C programme would endeavour to introduce a programme there.  That has not worked for staffing and resource issues.  The provision of treatment in the prison setting is a fantastic opportunity.  It is something that could be considered when looking at the prevalence of hepatitis C and where case numbers are higher.

Having to travel for treatment also has an impact on people's lives.  There are quotes in the report from people on this.  If someone is travelling for treatment it is not a case of just getting on a bus outside their house and then getting off outside the hospital.  They are getting up at 5.30 in the morning to get a bus, then a train and then a taxi to get to the hospital and then come back again.  It is a multiplier effect in that regard.  The further people are from hospital-based care, the more difficult it is to access that.

One was the two-week rule whereby they would be seen by a specialist, and a rheumatologist in particular, within the first two weeks of seeking care.  That is not happening.  I have dealt with a lot of families over the last while and some of them have written to this committee.  One of the groups, Transfusion Positive, has lobbied the committee on this issue as well.  They are seeking access to audiology services, chiropody, physiotherapy, consultants, dental services, GP services and probably much more.

Within that model Mr. Keane spoke about, how does he envisage the HSE can be better equipped to deal with those services?  Are there capacity issues in some of these areas as well, specifically around some of those needs hepatitis C patients would have?  It is not just about the model; it is also about timely access.

The solution to that is we need to look to peers and we need to look to people with lived experience who can reach into those communities and connect with people and support them to access treatment.

As Mr. Keane rightly said, that was 2020, even though the programme asserted it again earlier this year.  The other one is international research done on modelling data.  Essentially, they look at things like incidences of disease, screening of disease, treatment rates and then from that they extrapolate what the outcome looks like.  To note something quite clear - and I am aware I am talking about the period under Covid - in 2020 the treatment programme treated 532 people.  Also in 2020, we had 326 new notifications of people becoming newly infected or newly tested.  My maths is not brilliant but I did it earlier and we cleared 206 people off the table, if you like.  If you look at the same figure for 2021 we took 179 off the rate.  You can compare that against the idea, which is well-researched in the absence of a full screening programme, which is not financially viable, that we know we have somewhere between 20,000 to 30,000 people living with untreated hepatitis C in Ireland today.  If we are looking at an elimination date of 2030 and you look at those figures - I know of course under Covid they would be higher - as you would be looking at us having eight years, you probably need to be treating a minimum of 3,000 people per year just to make that target.  Without it becoming a sort of he-said-she-said piece, if we look at how many notifications we get, how many we are treating and compare them against our understanding of the numbers here, then that gives us a slightly different picture than that we are on target.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022060100002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Nicola Perry"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":1409,"content":"<p>Okay.

There are examples of them having been dealt with in some locations and in certain circumstances but it is not consistent across the country.  I will give a couple of examples.  It is not consistently the case that medication is available through community pharmacies.  In some places it is still just coming through hospital pharmacies which is obviously a barrier to care for people.  Similarly, in Dublin we have very good examples of care.  We have nurses who do phlebotomy in the community, peers who can do testing in the community and link people very quickly to hospital care if they need it.  We can contrast that with experiences outside Dublin.  I spoke to some people where the situation was that a GP could test in the community but there was one test that needed to be done in a lab and the lab would only accept it if it had been signed off by the consultant.  That leads to a narrowing of the pipe where people must pass through a consultant's books in order to get tested.

As I said, we do not really see it now, especially since doing this report, as urban versus rural but more Dublin and everywhere else, to be perfectly honest.  It was a little more stark than we had realised before we started to do the research.<\/p> <p>  On the policy, the clinical guidelines for managing hepatitis C treatment are set by the clinical advisory group to the national hepatitis C treatment programme.  To be clear, we are a member of the national hepatitis C treatment programme as the general oversight but as we are not clinicians, we do not sit on the clinical advisory group.  They put a lot of policy and guidelines in place.  Some were led by international best practice and some clearly were to fit the context of Ireland today but we had a lot of people who were waiting for treatment back in say, 2014 to 2016.  The treatment landscape changed and became much easier to access and much more accessible.  Many of those people, as Deputy Cullinane mentioned earlier, were those who had been impacted by the infected blood products and who had been infected through haemophilia treatment.  They were treated quite quickly.  They had all been waiting for treatment.  The rest of the bulk of the people were those who had been infected through intravenous drug use, many of whom also were waiting and they were treated.  There was this huge bulk and much policy was built around intravenous drug use, which on one level makes complete sense because it is the bulk of the numbers but then it excludes people who do not fall into that category.

The current prediction is that it will probably be rolled out in the first quarter of 2023 because they need to look at some governance issues as to how that will work.

What people could do is to go to the website of the national treatment programme, which has a list of characteristics relating to people who might be at risk.  They could then take action based on that and follow the advice in respect of getting tested, as Ms Perry stated.  However, even if everybody in the country who needs to be tested did that and got tested, the system would struggle, for several reasons, to be able to link everybody in to treatment effectively.

I am not an expert on hepatitis C, but we have often heard about it through the years.  The prospect of eradicating any such condition is fantastic.  I have been enlightened by our guests opening statements and the debate thus far.  Ms Perry referred to collecting regional data and regional testing.  I ask her to talk us through that.  It seems to be a feature of healthcare.  Obviously, healthcare is broken down into regions.  Is there currently variance in terms of what is happening in different parts of Ireland?  Is there best and worst practice?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022060100002#M01200","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654038000,"counter":1465,"content":"<p>Absolutely, yes.  We should start from the point that there is good reason that the services tend to be centred in Dublin, aside from it being the capital.  My colleague, Mr. Keane, referred to five of the eight hepatology units in the country being in Dublin.  Clearly, that is part of the issue.  Second, there is the issue of what clinicians refer to as the burden of disease.  Approximately 70% of those who have hepatitis C - known or unknown - are based in the Dublin region or on the east coast.  That makes sense.<\/p> <p>  In the context of the regions, unless one has a clear understanding of how many people in a region need testing or care relating to their treatments, one does not know what resources need to be put into the regions.  Each of the regions is different.  Let us take the south east, for example.  It has a profile and a population but it does not look like what we have here in Dublin.  We would need to know, for example, whether another clinical nurse specialist is needed, or an additional consultant.  There are no consultants currently based in the south east.  One would have to know whether there is a need to employ a peer worker.  We need to know the numbers with which we are dealing.  There is no point throwing resources at an area unless one is clear about what is the burden of disease.   That is important not only for the individual being able to access treatment when it is needed, it is also important that we use those data to plan the services and what they will look like.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022060100002#M01300","nonspeaker":"Ms Nicola Perry"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":1466,"content":"<p>Ms Perry answered that question very well.  It has been eye-opening for me because I have spoken with addicts in Dublin, down by needle exchanges and methadone clinics.  I always assumed that those one may meet outside one of those centres are born-and-bred Dublin people but many are not.  Their addiction journey has taken them to the capital out of desperation and because the supports offered in Dublin are better.  There is no regional support network of any significance around Ireland.  One would often  meet people from my county of Clare, or from Offaly or Cork, outside those centres here in Dublin.  The accents are very different.  One would expect the guys and girls one meets there to be Dublin people but that is not the case.<\/p> <p>  As regards those who undergo testing, obviously a test captures a moment in time.  A person may test negative but have a positive test a few months later.  How well does all that feed into the process?  I ask that because I recently became aware of a person in my home county who had cancer - this is a different realm of healthcare - but is now going through a totally different treatment regime for a different health issue.  It was only when the family stated while he or she was being discharged that this poor unfortunate person had previously had cancer that the care team became aware that was the case.<\/p><p>It is unbelievable that at times in Ireland people have been tested or have had a diagnosis confirmed but that record does not necessarily travel with them.

Because of the nature of the disease, as we have debated this morning, it is the case that people sometimes do not know they have it or know they have it for a period of time, as Mr. Murphy said earlier, but because it is not symptomatic, they do not feel compelled to do anything about it.  It may also be the case that a patient is afraid of people's perceptions, including those of the medical professionals.  I do not think there is a breakdown.  A concerted effort needs to be made.  If I am sitting in Athlone this afternoon and there may be some reason for me to think I have become exposed to hepatitis C, there are a couple of things that need to happen.  I need to know that might be the case so I need to understand the risks involved.  We learned from the report that only 30% of medical professionals would agree that everyone who possibly needs to be tested has been.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022060100002#N01200","nonspeaker":"Ms Nicola Perry"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":1479,"content":"<p>I understand the pandemic has caused healthcare in general to fall behind.

The importance of the needle exchange programme in tackling drug addiction was stressed in local communities and by community leaders in the past to guard against the passing on of the HIV virus or the hepatitis virus.

The same thing is true of hepatitis C testing and treatment.  We need to be able to reach people where they are.  There are examples in Ireland of good practice in that regard, of peers going into community services, doing swab tests for hepatitis C and being able to link people in very quickly into services.  When people have not always had good experiences of healthcare, having peers being able to go in and speak to people is the best way best way of reaching people.  We have quotes in the report of people saying: \"I am coming from the same place you were.

In our experience, having talked to people, a couple of issues make it a challenge.  This disease has the potential to make people so ill and to be such a burden on the healthcare system in the long term, yet it can be cured relatively easily.  Nevertheless, if someone needs to travel long distances, that will affect his or her job, and if he or she is not working, he or she may not have the money to undertake the travel.<\/p> <p>  I can think of some real-life examples.  One woman who had two children under five years of age could not attend the hospital appointment because she did not have anyone to take them and there was no way she could bring them to Limerick from Dublin and back.  Another factor is that even if the person has money or does not have an issue with work, particularly for people who may have historically contracted the virus, he or she may experience discrimination or possible stigma about it.  How can such people explain to people where they are, where they are going or what the treatment is for if the individuals in their lives at that point are not aware of some aspect of their history or background?  It is not the same as getting a diagnosis of something that does not come along with any value judgments, such as becoming diabetic.

Dr. O'Carroll, who spoke earlier, is involved in several initiatives.  We have outreach models, a pathway of care, as I said, and an accessible treatment.  What we do not have is everybody who may be impacted included.  We do not have a general understanding of this disease among the population.  Usually, it is people who are individually affected who understand what this disease is.  Even when people do understand it, they often do not know there is a cure.  When we think that a cure has been available for some time, this situation is concerning.<\/p> <p>  What we have, and what the research showed us, is the commitment, passion and drive of professionals working in the hepatitis field.  Those are mainly in hospital settings but also in outreach endeavours.  They know what to do in respect of how to work this out once we identify the people affected through implementing our national screening guidelines.  We have an excellent document drawn up in 2017 on the means of implementation.  It is like a handbook for everyone out there regarding how we can work with, or not work with, who we screen.  It is a matter of finding out where those people are and letting them know.  I remember in Germany a few years back there was an amazing campaign undertaken on public transport in this regard.  It consisted, basically, of a poster with three questions on it.  It was along the lines of \"Have you done this, this and this?\".  If people had done those three things, then it was recommended that they go to the equivalent in Germany of their GP or medical health centre and ask for a test.  I refer to that kind of initiative.  <\/p> <p>  Our clinical approach and clinical responses, particularly in certain locations, are excellent.  It would be impossible to take away from them or from the hard work being done on this disease.  Is it something that is always at the forefront of minds?  No, it is not.  Does everyone who needs to know this disease may be a risk for them know that it is?  No, they do not.  We can take lessons from models abroad.  Australia and Canada have done fantastic work.  Again, populations may be different but the scenarios are similar.  <\/p> <p>  We have, however, what we need here.  Regarding what the Deputy mentioned earlier, we have the budget and the resources.  The problem we have may be some blocks.  If I am being really honest, some people may also just wonder why people cannot just take a treatment that is available and being provided and paid for.  As was mentioned and emphasised, the key is information.  This is about addressing a situation where people will not go and get a treatment if they do not know they have the disease or they do not know there is a cure for it.  There are nuances around hepatitis C, because of its core group, that are not relevant in other medical domains.  It is important that we do not ignore these aspects and that we ensure there is a context to how we respond and that this perspective is considered.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022060100002#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Nicola Perry"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":1524,"content":"<p>The recommendation then would be for people who are worried to get tested.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022060100002#Q00400","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654038000,"counter":1525,"content":"<p>Absolutely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022060100002#Q00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Nicola Perry"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":1526,"content":"<p>We will finish on that note.

We often discuss how it is extremely important in a functioning democracy to have those key components to allow for different views to be expressed and to allow for people to campaign and engage in the public policy process.  For a number of years, there has been an issue with regard to the definition of \"political purpose\", and how it impacts on civil society organisations.  They argue that it is too wide and that it interferes with and limits the legitimate work of NGOs and civil society groups.  They argue that the basic freedom of individuals and organisations in Ireland to raise funds and campaign on issues that affect them is constrained by the Electoral Act 1997 in ways that violate their constitutional rights and EU law on freedom of assembly and association.  Organisations such as the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, Amnesty International and others have stated that they are effectively banned from seeking funding for some of their work and can potentially be sanctioned for engaging in the public policy process.  There are examples of organisations being taken to court for accepting funding, being threatened with prosecution for raising funds to engage with the public policy process and being forced to limit or end their operations in particular specific areas entirely.  That is not healthy in a democracy.  It is worth noting that the civil society organisations make the point that they are only seeking to have these restrictions removed regarding their day-to-day campaigning work.  They are not seeking any changes with regard to the way they are governed with respect to elections or referendums.  They fully support being governed on those in the same way as anyone else engaging in them.  The amendment seeks to address those concerns.  I am happy to hear what the Minister of State has to say on how he wants to see those concerns addressed. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022060100002#A02700","speaker":"1550","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":1554,"content":"<p>We are taking amendments Nos. 65 to 68, inclusive, together.

Amendment No. 66 is perhaps a simplified way of trying to address the issue of cryptocurrencies.  It is very difficult to define a cryptocurrency.  The easiest way I could find to do it was to limit it to the two currencies that are operational on the island of Ireland.  That being said, I think the Government amendments are far superior.  I am happy to withdraw that particular amendment.  Equally, amendment No. 67 seeks to increase the limit of the fine to a level of &euro;50,000 for some of the breaches of the section 23 rules on donations.  The idea that foreign donations will be included our system is an attempt to take a more serious approach.  I am seeking to introduce a more severe penalty for breaches I think could have an inadvertent influence on our democracy, particularly in the case of corporate donations.  We have very strong corporate donation limits.  Compared to the British system, we are leagues ahead in terms of our ethical stance on this issue.  We know that politics is not always about the simple transaction.  It is also about building capacity.  Sometimes, building capacity increases the ability to operate across the island.  That is not about one political party.  It is about any political party that operates in both jurisdictions.  Both amendments are being subvented by the Government amendments.  I am happy to withdraw both of them.<\/p> <p>  I wish to speak to Deputy Cian O'Callaghan's amendment No. 65.  I believe Senator Ruane has done some work in the area.  I have met representatives of ICCL and have spoken in the D&aacute;il in favour of addressing the issues.  It is not as clear a line as is perhaps being put forward.  In essence, there is no ban on civil society groups raising funds, but if they are using the funds for political purposes or purposes that may be seen to be political, there is a limit.  It is the same limit that applies to any of us.  I understand that the same limits that apply to corporate donors also apply to those civil society organisations.  That can result in the drying up of a source of funds that would otherwise be available to such groups in other countries.  I can absolutely see the perspective of the groups.  It is very difficult.  There are campaigns that I would very much like to see receiving that kind of funding.  However, there are other campaigns, such as those from the far right in the US, in respect of which I would not like to see such funding drifting into our political system.  In the same way that we talked about online political advertising, there is a differentiation between the electoral periods and the capacity-building that is often done in advance of a referendum or an election.  There could be civil society groups operating in an overtly political way.  It does not happen in Ireland but it could happen.  Perhaps the Minister of State will accept Deputy O'Callaghan's amendment but I do not think he will.  I ask the Minister of State to look seriously at this area to see how we can resolve some of these day-to-day issues for the civil society groups.  However, if such groups use the funding to build capacity and use that capacity in a political way, they have to be subject to the same limits that apply to any other political activists or influencers during election periods.  That is the point I wish to make.  I am happy to withdraw my amendments.  I ask the Minister of State to consider Deputy O'Callaghan's amendment with the note of caution that I have added.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022060100002#B00400","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":1556,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 68 essentially seeks to achieve a similar aim as Deputy Cian O'Callaghan's amendment.

It has been openly talked about in the NGO sector and across society for quite a long time now.  Amendment No. 68 seeks to make a distinction between a donation to an NGO or civil society group during an election period and outside an election.  It seeks to do something broadly similar to what Deputy O'Callaghan is trying to achieve with his amendment.

I thank Deputy McAuliffe for withdrawing his amendments.  I am opposing amendments Nos. 65 and 68 on the grounds that, as stated on Second Stage of the Bill on 7 April last, the Government is committed to the electoral commission, when established, undertaking a comprehensive review of the Electoral Act 1997 with a view to making recommendations to address, among other matters, the concerns raised by civil society concerning the definition of \"political purposes\" and its impact on the fundraising activities of certain civil society organisations.  It is my belief that the proposed review could be completed within a relatively short timeframe following the electoral commission&rsquo;s establishment.  Furthermore, given the complex issues provided for in the Electoral Act 1997, it is considered that the carrying out of such a comprehensive review of the Act would deliver an independent, objective, clear and efficient outcome for all affected parties with regard to the entirety of the interrelated provisions in that Act.  Like other Deputies, I have met representatives of the ICCL on a number of occasions to discuss the issue, as well as those of the Coalition for Civil Society Freedom more recently.  There is no doubt that there is a difference of opinion on the issue in terms of trying to achieve the same objective.  That is what we want to do.  There is a concern on the part of the coalition, in respect of the timeline of the establishment of the commission and the review of the 1997 Act, that the review may not be delivered within the lifetime of this Government.  However, we have given a commitment that it will happen very quickly, once the commission is established.  We have given that commitment.  I give a political commitment that we want the issue to be resolved as soon as is practicable, once the commission is established.

Having some counterbalance to that from civil society and NGOs can be healthy in a democracy.  We should be aware that large sums and resources are employed by corporate interests all the time to influence political decisions.  We need to be mindful of that.

I fully support the spirit and intention of Deputy O'Callaghan's amendment.  We need to make sure that however this is resolved, it does not create opportunities for other interests to influence our electoral processes or referendums outside the election period.  One of my fears, even with the wording the ICCL originally proposed, was that it did not guard sufficiently against that.  That is the challenge now.  It always gets my back up a little when the threat of unintended consequences is used as a reason for inaction.  This is an issue that has to be resolved but it has to be resolved in a way that does not create other problems.  For example, one could imagine a situation, as happens in other jurisdictions, where all the conditions of this amendment were adequately adhered to but money from economic or political interests, which many of us would strongly oppose, could still be used to finance campaigning activity outside an election period.  That would not necessarily fall foul of any of the conditions in the amendment even though it would impact on the outcome of elections, referendums or even just the legislative process.  Finding that balance is quite tricky.  I support Deputy O'Callaghan on this issue.  We would like the Minister of State to come back to the committee because there is a desire on our side of the House to find a way to resolve this matter that is fair and equitable, and to tackle that imbalance that Deputy O'Callaghan rightly noted.  If the Minister of State was minded to do that, we might be able to get cross-party agreement on the fix for this.  I encourage that approach because I am not sure that what is on the table at the moment achieves that fix.  However, we do not have the advantage of the skills and draftspeople the Department has.

Online political advertising will be prohibited.&rdquo;.  <\/blockquote> <p>I promised yesterday during my contribution on amendment No. 32 that I would not repeat it at the same length today.  I do not want to fall out with the Minister of State on this issue.  Despite all the negotiations I have had with the Department, the contributions made here and during pre-legislative scrutiny and so on, there are a number of questions that have not been answered.  First, there has been no satisfactory explanation as to why we are treating different media outlets differently.  Radio and TV have a prohibition on political advertising and yet we have made a decision in this Bill to facilitate it for online platforms.  There is no explanation or rationale for why we have done that and there should be.  Second, we continue to limit the regulation to the period of the election and not outside it.  Third, we have heard a lot of discussion from the platforms about how they do not want Ireland to have a different set of regulations from other countries, but despite European directives we still do not have scrutiny or sight of that European legislation.<\/p><p>The best way of protecting our democracy is by not permitting online political advertising, in the same way we do for broadcast media, until we have a comprehensive response.  The Minister of State might say this amendment is using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.  Twitter says it does not allow political advertising and the amount of revenue Facebook gets from political advertising is a tiny fraction of the advertising market here in Ireland.  Banning political advertising online will not be a significant loss to those platforms but it would help to protect our market.  There is much discussion about what happens in online political advertising, and some people think other parties are better at it than others, but the real problem is that we do not know what is going on with a lot of the algorithms and microtargeting.  We need to have that level of trust in our democracy.  For all those reasons, I ask the Minister of State to consider accepting this very blunt amendment, and to withdraw sections 120, 121 and 122 from the Bill, in order to prohibit the use of online political advertising until the Minister and the commission can bring forward proposals that would satisfactorily regulate the space.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022060100002#C02500","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":1583,"content":"<p>I admire the Deputy's optimism.  I have a few comments.  First, we already have different rules on non-online advertising.  For example, we know we cannot buy radio time or TV time but we can buy newspaper time and in many cases local newspapers would go out of business if it was not for the regular political adverts that are placed by Members of the D&aacute;il, both inside and outside of election time.  Therefore, if there is to be a standardised rule then theoretically it should apply to everybody.  There would not be many Members of the D&aacute;il who would argue that we should not be allowed to advertise in local newspapers.  I am a firm believer that those adverts in local newspapers do not get you a single vote but they keep people in employment and keep newspapers up and running.  Those newspapers have an important function and that is why many of us continue those advertisements.<\/p> <p>  I want to ask the Deputy proposing the amendment to consider the following issue: online advertising is cheap and the ability of people to boost Facebook posts, which could often be organic content rather than sophisticated ads, is something that gives small, non-party and small party candidates access to a way of promoting their work that they otherwise would not have.  I am not in favour of an outright ban on online advertising.  I fully agree with Deputy McAuliffe that the weakness of the regulation of online advertising and platforms is evident in this Bill.  Interestingly, none of the advocates for greater transparency or accountability in social media who came to the committee called for an outright ban.  They had a range of good and interesting policy recommendations on transparency and accountability etc. and the Government would do well to go back to those and reconsider them.  We also have to deal with the issue of spending limits.  While the spending limits do not change inside the election period, there are spending limits outside of it.  It is the same with posters and you will see all sorts of posters going up all over the place three months before the election that are allegedly for political meetings.  Those posters are not for political meetings at all; they are just election posters by another name.<\/p> <p>  I do not support the amendment but I support Deputy McAuliffe's concern that we could have a much more advanced set of regulations for online platforms.  We do not need to wait for the European Union regulations; in fact we should move much further.  There are certain activities like microtargeting that should be illegal inside and outside of the election period.  They should not just be illegal for political campaigning but for any kind of advertising.  It is acceptable when you open a newspaper and there is commercial content that is labelled as an advertisement.  We know about that but nobody knows when they have been microtargeted, regardless of whether it is in the commercial or the political world.  While I do not support the amendment, I support Deputy McAuliffe's call for the Department, the Minister and his colleagues to seriously look at this.  The one message we got clearly from the advocacy experts, who made an important presentation, was that the technology is accelerating at such a speed that not only do we have to play catch-up but we do not even know where things are going.  They made a strong case that the electoral commission should have the ability, in real time, to start to understand and make recommendations to the Government, which could then be acted on quickly by way of regulation to primary legislation.  If we fail to grapple with this now, during elections at some point in the future there will be serious points of contention over our failure to regulate and who has or has not done what on online advertising.  While I do not support the amendment, I support the intention and argument from the Government to come back on this at the earliest possible opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022060100002#D00100","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":1584,"content":"<p>I want to support this amendment.  We had quite a detailed discussion on this in the committee.  The Government needs to show leadership when it comes to political advertising, which this Bill proposes to regulate for a short period of time, during the election cycle.  That cycle can be only three weeks and as many contributors have spoken about, many elections are won and lost in the intervening periods.  On political advertising in general, I would totally support this amendment and I would be interested to hear what the Minister of State has to say.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022060100002#D00200","speaker":"1566"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":1585,"content":"<p>This is an area that needs a lot more attention and I welcome that the amendment has been brought forward in that spirit.  With online political activity, an audience is built up over time.  A lot of that is done by the parties with resources and that includes anyone who is elected, such as a Deputy or another office holder.  They have the resources to be able to build up followers and audiences between elections and that is probably the biggest advantage they have.  There is a legitimate argument that people without those resources being able to do some online advertising can be a counterbalance and that needs to be considered.<\/p> <p>  When we were looking at this in the committee we got strong input from people with expertise saying they did not want a situation where after an election, such as the next election or another one, everyone in the country would be talking about what happened with online campaigning, how that influenced the outcome of the election, how we did not have safeguards in place and how the election was influenced by external forces or whatever.  It would be damaging to confidence in the democratic system if that happened.  I urge that this area gets sufficient attention and that should happen before the election.  The point Deputy &Oacute; Broin made is that they were arguing that the commission needs to be able to react in real time.  If something is happening during an election campaign that most people would consider as out of order and having an undue influence on an election, it must have powers or the ability to take measures then.  It is no good having a review after the election and learning some lessons at that point if people can see that there are things that need to be reacted to immediately.<\/p> <p>  I am not sure that this blunt measure is sufficient but I accept that in the absence of other measures, a blunt one like this has a certain attraction.  What is needed would probably be a much more detailed way of regulating this rather than an outright ban.  I tend to reach for outright bans on things from time to time but in most cases taking a more nuanced and regulated approach is the correct one.  Failing that, if we have no other options then an outright ban might be the best thing to do but it will not capture a lot of it and it will not counterbalance the issue of the resources that people build up between elections, which puts them at an advantage over newer candidates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022060100002#D00300","speaker":"1550"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":1586,"content":"<p>As far as I am aware, the EU proposal was sent to this committee for consideration in December.  Is that correct?  There might be an opportunity for the committee to have a discussion on that at some point.<\/p> <p>  I take on board the points that all Deputies have made and there will be a review of Part 4 of the Bill after three years of it operating.  I take the point that Deputies Cian O'Callaghan and &Oacute; Broin have made about reaction in real time.  I am not sure how the commission could play a role in that in the middle of an electoral event, which is the challenge.  The ability of the commission to review electoral events afterwards and make recommendations is a strong and useful one.  It is something that will help in the robustness of the political system and as Deputy &Oacute; Broin has said, this whole space is shifting rapidly and we are consistently trying to catch up with it, which is something we have to be mindful of.  On publication of the Bill, the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, flagged a legislative proposal to protect the integrity of our electoral system and democratic process that has been developed by the Office of the Attorney General.  That is something I was going to flag in my closing comments but it is an added element to consider.<\/p> <p>  I will specifically respond to amendment No. 74 before Deputy &Oacute; Broin comes back in.  Amendment No. 74 proposes to replace section 119, on public information requirements for online political advertisements under this Bill, with an alternative section, which would prohibit online political advertising.  The amendment also proposes to oppose section 120 on obligations on online platforms regarding online political advertisements; section 121 on the identification and verification of buyers; and section 122 on the obligations on buyers regarding online political advertisements.<\/p><p> An interdepartmental group on the security of Ireland's electoral processes and disinformation was established in early 2018 to consider the substantive issues arising from experience in other democratic countries, having regard to the use of social media by external, anonymous or hidden third parties.  Its principal focus was on the risks to the electoral processes, including those arising from disinformation spread via social media and other means.  The interdepartmental group was chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach.  Its membership included representatives from the franchise section of our Department and the then Departments of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Defence, Education and Skills, Foreign Affairs and Trade, Justice and Equality and Public Expenditure and Reform, as well as from the Defence Forces, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the national cybersecurity centre.  The first report from the group was submitted to the Government in July 2018.<\/p><p> Overall, the assessment found that risks to the electoral process in Ireland are relatively low, taking into account the mitigating factors that are already in place.  It was recognised that the spread of disinformation online and the risk of cyberattacks on the electoral system pose more substantial risks.  That is in line with EU findings and recent international experience.  The report's recommendations included a commitment to regulate for transparency in online political advertising.  In this context, a public consultation was announced on 21 September 2018 and a discussion paper that outlined the issues and challenges involved in regulating online political advertising was published as part of the consultative process.  A total of 15 submissions were received by the closing date of 19 October 2018.  The public consultation was followed by an open policy form on the regulation of transparency in online political advertising, held in Dublin Castle in 2018.  The forum was attended by a wide range of representatives from media and political spheres, online companies and the European Commission.  A broad consensus emerged from the forum that there was a need to regulate online political advertisements during electoral periods.<\/p><p> The European Commission has published its Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the transparency and targeting of political advertising on 25 November 2021.  Similar to the provisions in Part 4 of the Bill, the Commission proposal does not propose to prohibit political advertising in any media for reasons that are similar to those I set out earlier.  Indeed, the Commission proposal envisages the introduction of a transparency regime across all forms of advertising media that is broadly reflective of that being introduced under Part 4 in respect of online political advertising.  Given the very detailed provisions that we are introducing under Part 4, we will not accept this amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022060100002#D00400","speaker":"1512","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":1588,"content":"<p>I presume, once it is set up, that the commission will have the capacity to employ outside experts to undertake some of this research if it chooses to.

One might be sceptical that the necessary protections will be implemented in the short term, when they are needed, for example, in advance of the next electoral cycle.

I am happy to withdraw the amendment so that we can get the commission set up and it can deal with this.<\/p><p>Deputy &Oacute; Broin talked about the small guy being able to spend a little bit.  I did that too when I was starting off.  When one looks at the advertising libraries, the medium-sized parties, as we call them now, spend vast amounts of money, which will only get bigger as activity increases online.  Unlike any other sort of media, transparency is different.  If I have an advertisement on the front page of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>stating that my priority is older people, that says something to older people, but it also says something to other groups who are not in that category.  One cannot see that transparency online.  Advertising can tell older people they are the priority, tell younger people they are the priority, and tell everybody else that they are the priority.  Politics is about allocation of resources and where one's priorities lie.  That is the difference between online advertising and other media.  The spending is clearly being done by the medium-sized parties, not smaller ones.<\/p><p>My two amendments were ruled out of order.  They dealt with mandatory take-down notices, which would allow the commission to act during an electoral event, and with a code of conduct.

They will impose a new obligation on the leaders of political parties to provide a written statement and an accompanying statutory declaration in respect of each year to the Standards in Public Office Commission stating that all donations from outside of the State, whether in cash or in kind, have been declared and that no other donations, either in cash or in kind, took place.  The amendments insert new requirements into the Electoral Act 1997 in respect of adherence to financial reporting standard, FRS, 102 and the inclusion of all property in the ownership of the political party and its subsidiary organisations when the annual statements of accounts are being prepared.  They also prohibit donations in any form of cryptocurrency and provide a wide range of investigatory and enforcement powers to the Standards in Public Office Commission, as the body currently responsible for regulatory oversight of the Act.  These provisions are modelled on similar powers in the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015, which the Standards in Public Office Commission is already familiar with.  The amendments provide for the inclusion of credit unions in the definition of &ldquo;institution&rdquo;.  This will allow political donations accounts to be opened and maintained within credit unions by the recipients of political donations rather than such accounts being solely confined to banks and building societies.  They also provide for the amounts specified in sections 23C and 48C of that Act to be varied by order, having regard to changes in the consumer price index.  These amounts relate to the donation threshold in respect of which the obligations under the Act apply to third parties.  All other donation thresholds under the Act can already be varied by order in line with changes in the consumer price index.<\/p><p>I believe the proposed amendments will clarify and strengthen the relevant provisions of the Electoral Act 1997 against the malicious use of financial resources from outside the State to interfere with our political and democratic processes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022060100002#F03400","speaker":"1512"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":1638,"content":"<p>I would like the Minister of State to elaborate on his intentions with specific regard to amendment No. 90.

We are in a unique position on this island because there are two jurisdictions with two different sets of electoral law and laws governing political donations, and a number of parties operate on an all-island basis, including that of the Minister of State, Sinn F&eacute;in, People Before Profit and the Socialist Party.  This session, therefore, is a valuable opportunity to provide the maximum level of clarity in order that everyone will understand the implications of what we are agreeing to, and I reiterate I strongly support the Minister of State's amendments.<\/p><p>I am interested in the changes to section 22 of the Electoral Act 1997 given we will be adding subsidiary organisations operating outside the State to the scope of that section, which will have implications for donations made to subsidiaries operating outside the State, whether that is Sinn F&eacute;in or a branch of the Green Party in Belfast, or People Before Profit or the Socialist Party.  Specifically with respect to the changes being made to section 22(2)(<i>c<\/i>)(i) of the 1997 Act, will the Minister of State be as explicit as possible with regard to the new status of requirements for political parties with respect to donations made to subsidiaries outside the State?<\/p><p>The separate question Deputy Nash raises is an important one and, again, full transparency is required.  In consideration of any such changes, we also need to be clear we will not create additional anomalies.  His amendment, if I understand it, seems to suggest that where a donation to a party organised on an all-island basis is accepted in the North, the rules of electoral donations that operate for that party in the South should apply both North and South.  That would mean, however, that we would be extending the reach of the political donations legislation from the South to the North.  I have no problem with that, given the sooner we have standard and harmonised rules North and South, the better for me, as the committee knows.<\/p><p>Nevertheless, it would create an anomaly in the North, if it were even legally possible, because all of a sudden, for political parties such as those I mentioned, the southern standards would have to be applied in the North, as opposed to the standards that would apply for the Ulster Unionist Party, the Democratic Unionist Party, the Social Democratic and Labour Party, SDLP, and Fianna F&aacute;il.  All of a sudden, there would be a two-tiered system in the North whereby the southern rules would apply to parties that are all-Ireland in nature and the Westminster rules would apply to those parties operating only in the North.  I am not sure whether southern law could be extended to the North in that way, but that is a separate issue.<\/p><p>In any event, would we want to create an anomaly whereby the SDLP could accept larger donations but Sinn F&eacute;in, the Green Party, People Before Profit and the Socialist Party would be in a different situation?  I think that is an equally important part of the consideration.  I am not averse to the conversation at all but we need to be clear about the ramifications.  What could not be the case, and I know Deputy Nash would not accept this in the South, is that one group of parties could accept larger donations than others.  That makes no sense, but his amendment would have that effect on the level of donations acceptable in the North.<\/p><p>I acknowledge this is quite technical but will the Minister of State talk us through the ramifications that changes to section 22, especially for parties such as his and ours that are all-Ireland in nature?

I would like to see more detail and adjustment on Report Stage.<\/p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Broin makes a very valid point regarding the all-Ireland nature of some parties despite there being two jurisdictions.  Even so, as a basic premise, if a corporate donation is considered wrong, a party should not accept it regardless of what it is allowed to accept.  In this State, we have come to a settled will whereby corporate donations are deemed not to be appropriate, and just because they are permitted does not mean a political party should avail of them, regardless of what is permitted North or South.  I hear what Deputy &Oacute; Broin is saying, but I would imagine many people who support all-Ireland parties believe there should not be illegal corporate donations and would be surprised to learn that some of those all-island parties receive donations that would be illegal in the South.  Of course, it is a matter of regulation, but it is also about being honest with people and saying how we believe we should operate, and how we will operate, North and South.<\/p> <p>  There is more work to be done on this issue and I look forward to the Minister of State returning to it with further amendments.

SIPO essentially conceded to Deputy Mary Lou McDonald's argument and contention there are effectively two Sinn F&eacute;ins.  There is Sinn F&eacute;in in the North, which is organised and registered in the North and can take advantage of British laws where there is no limit applied to donations.  Even though the bequest by Mr. Hampton was bequeathed to Sinn F&eacute;in in the Republic, Sinn F&eacute;in made a corporate decision to accept it in the North.  SIPO accepted there is a legal difference between both jurisdictions, but that does not mean there is not a real problem.  There is a real problem as articulated by Deputy McAuliffe.<\/p><p> Frankly, from where I am standing, it is unethical to accept donations of that scale that dwarf the &euro;2,500 corporate limit on which we decided as a Parliament and as a society more generally because of the toxic and poisonous influence of money on politics.  It is not right that is accepted.  Either parties themselves must decide whether this is right and whether it fits in with their moral and ethical compass or we legislate.  I understand the challenges involved in legislation given we must deal with two jurisdictions on this island.  I am not blind to the arguments and points articulated by Deputy &Oacute; Broin in terms of potential imbalances that might be introduced in the system in the North if we choose to go this way, but that should not act as a barrier to us dealing with this because it is a very real issue.  We have seen the corrupting influence of big money on politics in this country and we have learned those lessons.  I think we need to learn those lessons from a 32-county all-island perspective.<\/p><p> I will conclude my remarks by saying that in the last piece of correspondence we received from the Standards in Public Office Commission, it specifically suggested a new electoral commission, when formed, should prioritise and examine this issue.

These include: amendments to specify that in respect of the desirable skills and experience of electoral commission members set out in section 9, the expertise in financial matters be expanded to include membership of a recognised accountancy body; consequential amendments which may arise from the new Part 6 of the Bill, an amendment of the Electoral Act 1997 relating to political donations and accounts; amendments to clarify some of the provisions contained in section 104, which amends the Second Schedule to the 1992 Act in respect of the registration of electors - the amendments will clarify some of the new processes, in particular, the process regarding applications, identity and in respect of citizenship changes; and amendments to allow political parties to apply for a lottery licence in support of their fundraising activities.<\/p> <p>  Finally, the committee might also note that, as signalled by the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, on the publication of the Bill, legislative proposals to protect the integrity of our electoral and democratic processes, which have been developed by the Office of the Attorney General were recently approved by the Government for drafting.  Arrangements are currently under way to publish these proposals and I intend to bring forward the proposed amendments as the Bill continues its progression through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  My officials have conducted briefings in recent days in respect of the amendments we discussed on Committee Stage and further briefings can be arranged, if necessary.  From my discussions with the members, I believe they found them useful.  We are more than happy to do that.  It has helped progress this Bill over the past two days as well.<\/p> <p>  I again thank my officials for the fantastic work they have been doing on this groundbreaking legislation.

Maidir le figi&uacute;ir&iacute; ginear&aacute;lta a bhaineann leis an m&eacute;ad&uacute; sin, i r&aacute;iteas sa bhliain 2020, bh&iacute; an m&eacute;id a leanas le r&aacute; ag Foras na Gaeilge faoi dh&iacute;olach&aacute;n &Aacute;IS; is &eacute; &Aacute;IS an pr&iacute;omhdh&aacute;ileoir leabhar Gaeilge.  Ma&iacute;odh:<\/p> <blockquote> \t&Oacute;... 2014 t&aacute; f&aacute;s lean&uacute;nach tagtha ar dh&iacute;olach&aacute;n ioml&aacute;n &Aacute;is agus, taobh istigh de sin, f&aacute;s lean&uacute;nach ar dh&iacute;olach&aacute;in leabhar ginear&aacute;lta (go simpl&iacute;, sin leabhair ghinear&aacute;lta l&eacute;itheoireachta nach t&eacute;acsleabhair iad).

Thar an tr&eacute;imhse... 2013 go 2019... th&aacute;inig ard&uacute; 40.3% ar dh&iacute;olach&aacute;n leabhar ginear&aacute;lta. <\/blockquote> <p>Is dea-sc&eacute;al &eacute; sin gan dabht ach n&iacute; mar sin a bh&iacute; i gc&oacute;na&iacute;, agus leis an sc&eacute;al a chur i gcomhth&eacute;acs, caithimis s&uacute;il a chaitheamh siar.  Nuair a chuir mise suim sna leabhair ar dt&uacute;s, sna 1980d&iacute;, bh&iacute; c&uacute;rsa&iacute; leabhar go hainnis.  Bh&iacute; droch-chuma amach is amach ar leabhair Ghaeilge agus bh&iacute; rith cl&oacute; agus d&iacute;ol an-&iacute;seal orthu.  A bhu&iacute;ochas do ch&uacute;pla teach nua foilsitheoireachta a buna&iacute;odh i ndeireadh an ch&eacute;id seo caite, cuireadh slacht agus caighde&aacute;n ar na leabhair, agus d&aacute; thoradh sin, arda&iacute;odh an rith cl&oacute;, agus arda&iacute;odh an d&iacute;olach&aacute;n.  Is ag an staid sin a t&aacute;imid faoi l&aacute;thair; gach teach foilsitheoireachta ag iarraidh cur leis na pobail l&eacute;itheoireachta &eacute;ags&uacute;la at&aacute; cruthaithe acu f&eacute;in.  An l&eacute;itheoir nua a thiocfadh ar an bhf&oacute;d i mbliana, bheadh rogha m&oacute;r leabhar ar f&aacute;il d&oacute;.  Agus, d&aacute; bharr sin, n&iacute;l c&uacute;is ar bith nach leanfadh s&eacute; air ag l&eacute;amh i nGaeilge.  N&iacute; raibh s&eacute; sin f&iacute;or tr&iacute;ocha bliain &oacute; shin.<br\/><br\/>An rud eile a chabhraigh go m&oacute;r le f&aacute;s sa d&iacute;olach&aacute;n, sin &eacute; an t-Idirl&iacute;on.  Tr&iacute;d an Idirl&iacute;on, ar na me&aacute;in sh&oacute;isialta, t&aacute; leabhair Ghaeilge &aacute; bpl&eacute; go coitianta ag l&eacute;itheoir&iacute; ar bhealach n&aacute;r tharla riamh roimhe seo.  T&aacute; deis iontach anois againn leabhair nua agus seanleabhair a chur faoi bhr&aacute;id an phobail l&eacute;itheoireachta, is cuma c&aacute; bhfuil siad.  Agus a bhu&iacute;ochas don Idirl&iacute;on freisin, t&aacute; su&iacute;omhanna Idirl&iacute;n agus siopa&iacute; ar-l&iacute;ne ag na foilsitheoir&iacute;, agus t&aacute; s&eacute; ar chumas l&eacute;itheoir&iacute;, cuma c&eacute;n aird den domhan ina bhfuil siad, leabhair a ord&uacute; uainn.  Seolaimid amach ar an bpost chucu iad, cuma m&aacute;s i Meirice&aacute; at&aacute; siad, sa Fhrainc, n&oacute; i mbaile beag &Eacute;ireannach at&aacute; ar uireasa siopa maith leabhar.  I bhfocal eile, t&aacute; ceannaitheoir&iacute; anois againn in &aacute;iteanna nach raibh leabhair Ghaeilge ar f&aacute;il in aon siopa leabhar riamh roimhe seo.  T&aacute; deis n&iacute;os m&oacute; ag l&eacute;itheoir&iacute; Gaeilge ar fud an domhain teacht ar r&eacute;imse n&iacute;os m&oacute; agus n&iacute;os leithne leabhar n&aacute; in am ar bith roimhe seo.  Agus c&eacute;im ar ch&eacute;im, le hard&uacute; l&iacute;on agus r&eacute;imse na leabhar, t&aacute; ard&uacute; tagtha ar l&iacute;on na l&eacute;itheoir&iacute;, agus n&iacute; beag sin.<\/p><p>Dea-sc&eacute;al &eacute; sin ach leis an fh&iacute;rinne a r&aacute;, t&aacute; deacrachta&iacute; freisin ann.  Le tuiscint a fh&aacute;il ar na deacrachta&iacute; sin, n&iacute; m&oacute;r tuiscint a fh&aacute;il ar an gcaoi a n-oibr&iacute;onn teach foilsitheoireachta.  Gach bliain, foils&iacute;mid r&eacute;imse nua leabhar agus b&iacute;mid ag s&uacute;il go mbeidh an-d&iacute;ol orthu.  An bhliain ina dhiaidh sin, foils&iacute;onn muid r&eacute;imse eile leabhar agus b&iacute;onn muid &aacute; nd&iacute;ol, agus b&iacute;mid ag d&iacute;ol na leabhar a foils&iacute;odh an bhliain roimhe sin.  An bhliain ina dhiaidh sin ar&iacute;s, foils&iacute;onn muid r&eacute;imse eile leabhar.  B&iacute;mid &aacute; nd&iacute;ol sin, agus na leabhair a foils&iacute;odh an bhliain roimhe sin, chomh maith leis na leabhair a d'fhoilsigh muid an bhliain roimhe sin ar&iacute;s.  Mar a thuigeann an coiste, t&aacute; an st&oacute;r leabhar ag m&eacute;ad&uacute; agus an t-ualach riarach&aacute;in ag &eacute;ir&iacute; n&iacute;os troime.  An rud ar f&eacute;idir a dh&eacute;anamh mar thionscal beag cois teallaigh sa bhaile agus gan agat ach 40 leabhar, n&iacute; f&eacute;idir a dh&eacute;anamh nuair at&aacute; breis is 100 n&oacute; 200 leabhar agat.  Is gn&oacute; ansin &eacute;.<\/p><p> In&aacute;r gc&aacute;s f&eacute;in, t&aacute; muid ag foilsi&uacute; le 30 bliain.  I mbliana, beidh muid ag iarraidh leabhair nua na bliana seo a dh&iacute;ol, chomh maith leis na leabhair a d'fhoilsigh muid le 30 bliain anuas.  Le lean&uacute;int den tseirbh&iacute;s sin, t&aacute; costais bhreise orainn nach raibh orainn nuair a thosa&iacute;omar amach sa ghn&oacute; seo.  T&aacute; ualach trom riarach&aacute;in orainn agus t&aacute;imid ceal ar sp&aacute;s oifige agus sp&aacute;s st&oacute;rais.  Cos&uacute;il le tithe foilsitheoireachta eile, t&aacute;imid tagtha ag staid an-leochaileach mar chomhlacht.  T&aacute; an obair at&aacute; againn r&oacute;mh&oacute;r don chomhlacht mar at&aacute; agus t&aacute; g&aacute; leis an gcomhlacht a mh&eacute;ad&uacute; leis an ualach sin a iompar go fadtr&eacute;imhseach agus forbairt a dh&eacute;anamh.  Is ionann sin le r&aacute; go dteasta&iacute;onn oifig nua, sp&aacute;s st&oacute;rais agus foireann.  T&aacute; pleananna againn chun an m&eacute;id sin a bhaint amach agus t&aacute; m&eacute;id &aacute;irithe den obair sin tosaithe ach t&aacute; c&uacute;namh uainn.  In &aacute;it ard&uacute; sa mhaoini&uacute;, t&aacute; an maoini&uacute; do leabhair Ghaeilge tite ar ch&uacute;l le blianta beaga anuas.  Mar a luaigh Deirdre N&iacute; Thuathail n&iacute;os luaithe, in &aacute;it an &euro;1.8 milli&uacute;n a bh&iacute; ann in 2008, n&iacute;l ann ach &euro;1 milli&uacute;n anois. <\/p><p> Ceist &iacute; seo a bhaineann le lean&uacute;nachas san earn&aacute;il agus leis an bhfoilsitheoireacht a thabhairt gl&uacute;in eile chun cinn.

Cur am&uacute; airgid poibl&iacute; a bheadh ansin agus cur am&uacute; uaf&aacute;sach tallainne agus fuinnimh.  Lena chinnti&uacute; nach mar sin a tharl&oacute;idh, t&aacute; dh&aacute; rud le d&eacute;anamh ag an St&aacute;t: acmhainn&iacute; breise a chur ar f&aacute;il do na foilsitheoir&iacute;, agus acmhainn&iacute; breise a chur ar f&aacute;il don d&aacute;ileoir &Aacute;is, &oacute;s rud &eacute; gur &eacute; a chuireann &aacute;r leabhair sna siopa&iacute;.

Ach na hacmhainn&iacute; cu&iacute; a fh&aacute;il &oacute;n Rialtas, tabharfaimid an obair seo c&eacute;im eile chun cinn.<\/p><p> Mar aguis&iacute;n beag leis an m&eacute;id at&aacute; r&aacute;ite agam, n&iacute; miste c&uacute;pla rud a r&aacute; faoi na point&iacute; &eacute;ags&uacute;la a arda&iacute;odh ag na cruinnithe coiste go dt&iacute; seo.  &Oacute;n&aacute;r saineolas, tar &eacute;is breis is 30 bliain i mbun foilsitheoireachta, tuigimid c&eacute;ard is fearr a oibr&iacute;onn.  T&aacute; r&iacute;omhleabhair d&eacute;anta againn f&eacute;in, agus leis an fh&iacute;rinne a r&aacute;, n&iacute; raibh d&iacute;ol maith orthu.  Coinneoimid s&uacute;il ar an margadh sin agus m&aacute; cheapaimid go mbeidh athr&uacute; ar an sc&eacute;al sin, d&eacute;anfaimid r&iacute;omhleabhair nua.  N&iacute; f&aacute;l go haer &eacute;.

N&iacute; dheachaigh leabharlann ar bith i dteagmh&aacute;il linne riamh ag iarraidh orainn r&iacute;omhleabhar a chur ar f&aacute;il.  D&aacute; dtiocfadh, bheadh muid bre&aacute; s&aacute;sta a bhfuil de leabhair againn a chur ar f&aacute;il ar BorrowBox n&oacute; ar ch&oacute;ras ar bith eile a d'iarrfaid&iacute;s.<\/p><p> Agus m&eacute; ag tr&aacute;cht ar na leabharlanna, n&iacute; d&oacute;igh liom go bhfuil s&eacute; s&aacute;s&uacute;il go mbeadh c&oacute;ip amh&aacute;in de chuile theideal ag an tseirbh&iacute;s leabharlainne i mBaile &Aacute;tha Cliath agus go gcaithfeadh an l&eacute;itheoir fios a chur ar leabhar Gaeilge go speisialta.  Lena r&oacute;l a chur i gcr&iacute;ch mar fhoras cult&uacute;rtha - mar a thugann siad orthu f&eacute;in, agus an ceart acu - ba ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh rogha mhaith leabhar Gaeilge ar an tseilf i ngach leabharlann sa t&iacute;r.

I ask committee members participating remotely to use the raised-hand icon on Microsoft Teams if they wish to contribute.<\/p><p> This meeting is convened to discuss pension issues and Department of Social Protection related matters for foster carers, which are listed as part of our work programme.  There are currently 3,948 foster carers looking after 5,265 children throughout the State, according to the latest figures from the Child and Family Agency, Tusla.  We are all aware of the reports on the shortage of foster carers and foster families, with more demands being placed on the fostering system each year.  Sadly, those demands are further compounded by the numbers of unaccompanied minors arriving in Ireland as a result of the conflict in Ukraine.  As the person who exposed and eventually secured the closure of the exploitative hostel system for unaccompanied foreign minors arriving in the State, which facilitated the scandalous disappearance of 443 children during the most prosperous decade this country has ever witnessed, I know how important the foster care system is in protecting unaccompanied children from being exploited and trafficked into and through this country.<\/p><p> The vast majority of foster carers have to give up their employment upon becoming a foster carer in order to meet the complex and at times challenging needs of those in their care.  While foster carers receive a weekly allowance for the child placed in their care, they do not receive any payment for themselves, which results in them falling through the cracks in the social welfare system and thus denies them eligibility for a contributory State pension on retirement.  This acts as a barrier to those wishing to take on the role of a foster parent at a time when we need to make fostering more attractive.<\/p><p> Last year, as part of the pre-budget submission to the Minister for Social Protection, the committee made a recommendation on addressing the pension issue for foster carers which is available on the Oireachtas website.  When presenting this committee's report on the Pensions Commission's recommendations to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, on behalf of the committee, I made specific reference to foster care parents who do not accrue a PRSI record as a result of the foster care payment.  It is our view that the Pensions Commission's proposal on pensions for family carers should apply to foster carer parents in recognition of the vital work they do in our society.  <\/p><p> I thank members of the committee for raising this important issue as a priority item on our work programme for this year.  I especially thank the committee's policy advisor, Ms Haley O'Shea, for her work in compiling the briefing circulated by the committee secretariat to members.

Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such request.

I also welcome the opportunity to briefly discuss the foster care allowance.  I am accompanied by the chairperson of IFCA, Mr. Raymond Nolan, and Mr. Brendan Gillen, foster carer and vice-treasurer to IFCA&rsquo;s board finance sub-group, and Ms Clare Corridon, who is a newly-approved foster carer.<\/p> <p>  Founded in 1981, the Irish Foster Care Association is the national organisation that supports foster families and the wider fostering community.  We advance and promote best practice in foster care through support, advocacy and learning provision based on evidence-based practice and research and counselling.  IFCA is a member organisation and members comprise mostly of foster carers, social workers, academics and all those who have an interest in foster care.<\/p> <p>  IFCA has charitable status.  It is a not-for-profit and is governed by a board of directors.  It is registered with the Charities Regulatory Authority.  We deliver targeted support to our members through our national support services and our local branches and hubs.  IFCA promotes the development of positive change for children in alternative care and influences policy, legislation and opinion through our advocacy work.  We believe in the value of foster care as an effective alternative for children who, for various reasons, are unable to live with their own families.<\/p> <p>  Foster care is complex and foster carers require a range of supports and expert advice to enable foster carers provide the best possible care for the child or children in their care.  There were 5,841 children in the care of Tusla at the end of 2021, of which 3,782 were fostered by general foster carers and 1,489 by relative foster carers.  There were 4,018 foster carers at the end of quarter 3 of 2021.  This is broken down to 2,437 general foster carers, 1,057 relative foster carers, and 524 private foster carers.<\/p> <p>  Tusla&rsquo;s adequacy review in 2020 notes an 11% decrease in the numbers of foster carers since 2016.  This is a grave concern, as the numbers of children requiring foster care have increased.  IFCA&rsquo;s submission to the committee is informed by its 40 years of experience in supporting foster care in Ireland and we welcome the opportunity to share this experience and knowledge with it.  I have included some more information about IFCA as an appendix with this opening statement.<\/p> <p>  Foster care is the backbone of care for children who are in the care of the State.  Ireland is unique in this respect, in that the majority of these children are growing up as happy and confident young people who attend school every day, some of whom will be focusing on the upcoming State exams, while growing up within the family environment.  Children in foster care are thriving and foster families are offering secure, happy and fulfilling childhoods to children and supporting them to reach their full potential. <\/p> <p>  The placement of children in foster care in Ireland is legislated for in the Child Care Act 1991, the Child Care (Placement of Children in Foster Care) Regulations 1995, the Child Care (Placement of Children with Relatives) Regulations 1995 and the national standards for foster care, 2003, all of which are underpinned by the UN Convention of the Rights of the Child which was ratified by the Government in 1991.<\/p> <p>  A child comes into the care of the State when it is assessed that he or she is at risk and requires care and-or protection. Children are received into care in either a voluntary or court-ordered capacity.  Foster care is the predominant type of care for children in the State with approximately 92% of children placed in foster care.  Foster families offer warm, caring family life to children and tend to their physical, social, emotional and other needs which are underpinned by the stability of family life.  Foster care can be offered to a child on either a short- or long-term basis.  Short-term foster care is for a period of less than six months&rsquo; duration.  Anything over that is long-term foster care.<\/p> <p>  Foster carers support children who may be dealing with issues of neglect, abuse or abandonment and help them to feel supported, loved and accepted unconditionally.  Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, has the statutory responsibility to approve foster carers and place children with them.  The national standards for foster care, 2003, set the standards for the recruitment and retention of foster carers.<\/p> <p>  The process of becoming a foster carer is rigorous and is governed by the procedures and guidelines for foster care committees 2017, which outline the assessment process of prospective foster carers.  Foster care committees are convened by Tusla and they approve foster care applicants.  When a person and his or her family apply to become a foster carer, they are subject to a thorough assessment to comply with Tusla&rsquo;s policy, procedures and best practice guidance, 2017.<\/p> <p>  Section 4.7 of this policy entitled availability to care for children in care, states that it is necessary, in the interests of meeting the needs of vulnerable children, that at least one foster carer is available to care for the child on a full-time basis.<\/p><p>Applications may be accepted from working parents depending on their actual availability to the child.  One carer must be available to provide day-to-day care for the child, work in partnership with Tusla, facilitate contact with birth parents and siblings, bring children to school, attend childcare reviews and attend training.  Consideration of approval of working applicants or carers looks at their availability to meet the child&rsquo;s needs.  Children who need short-term, emergency or respite care require a full-time foster carer from the time they join the family.<\/p><p> The vast majority of foster carers are requested to relinquish their employment on becoming a foster carer to meet the myriad complex needs of children coming into care.  Foster carers receive a weekly allowance for the child who is placed with them to cover their needs.  If the child remains in placement with them following six months, they can then receive child benefit.  Foster carers do not receive any payment for themselves, which results in their not having adequate social welfare credits for eligibility for the contributory State retirement pension.  Foster carers can qualify for the home carer period scheme if the following criteria are met: they are providing full-time care for a child or children under the age of 12 years, a child or children over 12 years who need an increased level of care, or an adult who needs an increased level of care; they are not employed, self-employed or training outside the home; they have not had a paid, credited or reckonable voluntary contribution during the period they are providing the home care; they are not in receipt of a weekly payment from the Department of Social Protection, other than child benefit; they can demonstrate that due to the nature and extent of their home caring responsibilities they were unable to engage in insurable employment and self-employment; and the person for whom the home caring is provided meets the required conditions.  The majority of children in foster care remain with their foster carers to the age of 23, which is the age of leaving care, and many stay beyond this age.  Foster carers are at a distinct disadvantage, as most of them have been requested to remain at home to meet the care needs of their foster children.  They are not entitled to sign on for social welfare credits as they are not available for work.<\/p><p> Recognition of the role of foster carers for children in State care is currently not adequately considered in the social welfare system, particularly in relation to State pension contributions.  Currently, the investment in time and care by foster carers does not trigger contributions towards the State contributory pension for the full duration of the care provision.  This leaves foster carers at risk of poverty in their later years while performing an essential service to the State.  This is not an equitable or sustainable situation if the State wishes to continue to leverage alternative home care as a State intervention in the alternative care system in the future.<\/p><p> While foster carers can qualify for the home caring period scheme, it is limited and restricted to children under the age of 12, or an ill or disabled person over the age of 12.  We believe this age restriction should be raised to a minimum of 23 years of age based on the aftercare supports required by vulnerable children in care.  This would be a more complete reflection of the time contribution given by foster carers and would acknowledge tangibly the key support provided by foster carers in addressing social challenges to the State.<\/p><p> Where a foster carer remains on the Tusla-approved panel of foster carers and remains available for receiving a child into foster care, he or she should continue to be included for State contributory pensions contributions purposes for the entire period of being on the approved panel.  This will facilitate retention of foster carers between placements, ensure a sustainable pipeline of foster carers and encourage the return of foster carers to provide the vital care they provide for the State&rsquo;s most vulnerable children.  We request that retrospective contributions be paid by the Exchequer for any gaps for long-term carers and we advocate for foster carers to be included in this long-term carer cohort for the period they are foster parents, even if it is less than the period defined by the Commission on Pensions of 20 years.  We also advocate for the age cut-off be extended from 12 years of age to a minimum of 23 years of age to reflect the additional support required by children in care and to ensure that continuity of support is provided by foster carers.<\/p><p> At present, foster carers are not getting contributory pension contributions for the period where the criteria I have just outlined are not applicable.  This needs to be urgently addressed.  Foster carers who have contributed to the State alternative care system to offer loving, stable, safe and caring homes to children in the care of the State are disadvantaged by the social welfare system while they play a vital role for our society.<\/p><p> If I may, I will turn briefly to the foster care' allowance.  Foster carers receive a weekly allowance for caring for a child who is in the care of the State.  The fostering allowance for children under the age of 12 years is &euro;325 per child per week and is increased to &euro;352 for children over the age of 12 years.  The allowance provides for the foster carer to meet all of the living needs of the child.  When a young person reaches the age of 18 years he or she is formally not in care.  However, where a young person remains living with his or her foster carer and continues to participate in full-time education or training, a reduced aftercare allowance of &euro;300 is given.  The foster care allowance has remained static since 2009.  The increasing costs of living, with inflation currently running at 12.3% to the end of April this year, has reduced the value of the allowance.  Economic forecasts inform us that inflation is set to rise further.  The IFCA intends to submit a pre-budget submission to Government on the foster care allowance.  We would welcome an opportunity to return to the committee to discuss this further in the near future.  I thank the Chairperson and committee members. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022060100002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Catherine Bond","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":1890,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Bond.

I very much welcome the invitation and the opportunity to share my experience insofar as it is relevant to the committee's deliberations.  I am the chief executive officer and chairman of a non-statutory fostering agency, Foster Care Ireland.  We currently meet the needs of 26 children in 18 placements.  My background is technical and managerial, and I have 35 years of public sector experience.<\/p> <p>  This submission outlines the role of fostering in the State&rsquo;s care for children whose families cannot care for them.  Tusla currently subcontracts the provision of less than 10% of foster care placements to the six non-statutory fostering agencies in Ireland.  I will talk about the challenges and rewards of fostering, focusing on the support the State offers to foster carers.  In my conclusion I will make suggestions for improvement in State support for foster carers, with particular reference to the benefits of recognition, the index-linking of the fostering allowance and the introduction of pension credits.<\/p> <p>  Foster care is the lowest-cost short-term response to caring for children who cannot rely on their family.  Whether through relative foster care or placement with foster carers, fostering closely resembles the family structure familiar to most children that is at the core of our society.  Tusla has the responsibility to safeguard children and provide for children in need.  It recruits, trains, supports, and supervises foster carers with whom it places children.  There are non-statutory providers of fostering services, that is, fostering agencies that recruit, train, supervise and support foster carers in providing placements for one or more children.  The service is provided directly to Tusla and the non-statutory providers account for a growing, but relatively small percentage of foster placements.<\/p> <p>  While there are differences in scale and structure between the statutory and non-statutory fostering bodies, they each operate to the same framework, observe the same standards and aim for similar outcomes.  Acknowledging that there are ownership preferences, it is worth recalling that monopolies, left to themselves, can become self-serving.  With competition and a healthy tension in the sector, providers can collaborate, co-operate and compete to drive service innovation and adaptation to the benefit of all.  The delivery costs under either model of ownership or market dominance are at the very least comparable.  Members will not be surprised if I claim that the non-statutory model, being smaller, less bureaucratic, more agile and responsive, delivers a superior service under contract to Tusla, as is evidenced by inspection results and independent research commissioned with other non-statutory agencies in the sector.<\/p> <p>  The recent history of fostering in Ireland shows a decline in the number of Tusla-provided placements.  This decline has been partially offset by an increase in the number of placements through the non-statutory providers.<\/p><p>This is against a background of a rising demand for placements driven by demographic and social trends.  The availability of foster care placements must improve if the demand is to be met.  A failure to do this can only result in poorer outcomes for children with higher direct and indirect costs for the State.  Common to both statutory and non-statutory organisations is the challenge of recruiting, training, supporting and retaining a sufficient number of foster carers.  In this presentation I concentrate on the aspects of recruitment and retention of most interest to the committee.<br\/><br\/>A decision to commit to fostering is as multifaceted as buying a house and greater, arguably, than deciding to change career or employment.  It invites compromise; compromise in making a decision that will bring rewards and entail constraints, and will only be possible if enabled.  The rewards are intrinsic to the process of fostering and being an active agent in the development of another human being.  The constraints are immediate, bearing as they do on personal space, time, freedom and the need to prioritise others.  Among the enablers are the training, support, collegiality with other foster carers, financial allowances and support and recognition that the current State framework promotes.<br\/><br\/>The pool of available placements is not static - it grows with recruitment of new carers and shrinks as carers retire.  With each retirement there is a loss of capacity and of valued experience.  Early retirement can be precipitated by weak enablers or the emergence of more attractive employment options.  The costs of recruitment are high and comprise advertising, inquiry progression, training and assessment.  Typically, there is a 1% yield of qualified carers from the initial inquiries we receive.  Inquiry progresses through a home visit, completion of a detailed application pack and assessment by a professionally qualified social worker.  There is training and, finally, approval at a Tusla area foster care committee.  Fallout can occur at any point in the process, at a greater sunk cost the later it happens in the process.  With such high recruitment costs there is an economic incentive to retain foster carers for as long as possible.<br\/><br\/>Although not ideal, many foster care placements can be for the duration of the remaining childhood.  Making a good match between child and carer is at the heart of what we do, and it is in the child&rsquo;s interest that the match endures as long as the child needs the placement.  Two of the most frequent criticisms of the care system are the frequency with which placements break down and the frequency with which social workers change.  Stability is a huge factor in a successful placement.  It is linked with carer resilience secured through careful recruitment and is sustained by training and professional support.<br\/><br\/>The committee has a direct interest in and can influence the evolution of the enabling framework, particularly how and when the framework adapts to the current need to attract and retain foster carers.  The financial support to foster carers in the form of the fostering allowance and the recognition that their work receives are salient in any decision to commence or cease to foster.  As the committee heard, foster carers of children over 12 receive a tax-free payment of a fostering allowance of &euro;352 per week.  This amount has been fixed since 2009, over which time inflation was 9.8% and is now rising rapidly.  As a positive enabler or incentive, it is weakening, and the weakness must be addressed for capacity to be retained.<br\/><br\/>Foster carers who would prefer fostering to working have to weigh up the consequences for their pension entitlement.  In the absence of pension recognition for fostering, potential carers may opt for employment.  This is on the grounds that there will be future pension benefits when their needs will be greater.  The fostering allowance and pension credits are two critical factors in the decision to foster and to cease to foster.  The adjustment of one and the introduction of the other, in particular a pension entitlement, could rebalance a decision in favour of fostering as a desirable activity that will benefit society and, by retaining foster carers, the overall costs of fostering.<br\/><br\/>Recognition is a powerful reinforcer and motivator.  It has tangible and intangible dimensions.  Recognition of qualifications brings status and respect.  Recognition and awareness of outcomes brings societal approval and reinforcement.  Pensions credits, to which family carers are now entitled, leave foster carers feeling, by comparison, overlooked and underappreciated.  This year&rsquo;s fostering week brought television coverage of successful fostering outcomes that reached out to many and improved the image of fostering in marked contrast to the high profiling of institutional failings that received so much news coverage.  This rebalancing is to be applauded and the imagination of those involved is exemplary.<br\/><br\/>To conclude, Foster Care Ireland supports all efforts to improve the image, societal regard and tangible recognition of the growing professionalism of fostering.  There is a <i>prima facie<\/i>case for the adjustment of the fostering allowance, at a minimum in line with inflation.  The provision of a pension entitlement proportional to the fostering allowance would help to level the playing field to make fostering more attractive and improve recruitment, retention, service level and cost at a stroke.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022060100002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Taylor","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":1893,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for the opening statements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022060100002#D00200","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":1894,"content":"<p>I thank all the witnesses for coming in this morning and for their opening statements.  I have a couple of questions and the first relates to child benefit.  I had a gentleman from my constituency who contacted me.  He is the grandfather of four children - his daughter is their mother - and he and his wife take care of them.  The daughter is having problems of her own and she does not see the children.  She continued to get the child benefit payment in respect of four children of &euro;560 per month for six months, or &euro;3,360 over the period.  She made no contribution to the children and it was money that she received and could keep.  I found that quite unusual and had not come across it before.  It is something I wanted to mention.  I know within the social protection system there may not be room for that level of flexibility when it comes to child benefit and the six-month rule is there.  What are the views of the witnesses on that?<\/p> <p>  My second question relates to the State pension.  What happens with former foster carers who reach the pension age?  How do they manage once they come to the age of 66 and cannot access a State pension?  I presume some of them can get the non-contributory State pension, which is means-tested, but there are obvious difficulties there as well.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Taylor of Foster Care Ireland argues that a pension entitlement would be proportional to the allowance received now but does he mean the group seeks a State pension higher than the current rate of &euro;253?  Is the group looking for a rate matching the fostering allowance or the State pension as it is today?  The difficulty with the State pension is that the important recognition from the Department of Social Protection is not there.  I imagine there is a huge financial cliff edge for foster carers once they reach pension age but cannot receive the full State pension.  In fairness, they are very much entitled to that.  Will Mr. Taylor speak a little more about what he would like to see with a pension?<\/p> <p>  I know the pensions commission in its report put forward recommendations for carers, including long-term carers, and the use of Exchequer funds to top up where contributions do not reach the full amount.  Will Mr. Taylor speak a little more about that?  I imagine the pension issue is probably making it harder to bring in foster carers.  Then again, on the other side foster carers might come into the system when the State pension is so far away.  Is the knowledge even there for them that this is an issue?<\/p><p>Does it only become apparent when they get to 66 and it is too late?  People cannot buy contributions now and there are significant difficulties there as well.  My questions are about child benefit and the State pension.  I thank the witnesses again for their contributions.  I have to go into the Chamber to speak, but I have a few minutes.  If I go out, I will be back again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022060100002#D00300","speaker":"1604","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654038000,"counter":1896,"content":"<p>In terms of the child benefit query from the Deputy's constituent, that situation can arise under what is termed a \"private foster arrangement\".  It is governed under the Children Act.  If the family, which is related, are not approved or assessed for foster care, therefore, they are in a private arrangement between the individuals within a family.  This is something IFCA sees to a significant degree based on calls to our national helpline.  It is something that needs to be addressed because we find that relative carers, in particular grandparents, are caring for their children's children - their grandchildren - but they are not entitled to receive child benefit.  There is no additional income to enable them to care for those children and keep them out of the care of the State altogether.  There is no recognition of the value and contribution the family gives.  That is something IFCA has been speaking about to the Department and Tusla.  They are traditionally known as private arrangements and the families caring for the children are not entitled to any income while the child benefit continues to remain with the birth parent of those children.<\/p> <p>  We have a number of foster carers who are now reaching retirement age who suddenly find out that they have no entitlement to the State pension.  Many of them have worked prior to coming into fostering and gave up their employment to take on the care of children from the State.  This is the real kernel of the issue in terms of pensions.  While the pensions commission recommended that home carers would get a 20-year entitlement to contributory pensions for long-term care, IFCA requests that this would not apply to foster carers.  There needs to be a unique pension status for foster carers that gives them enough credits for the duration of their fostering career, from the time they take on their first child to the time they retire from fostering, if they remain on the Tusla panel.  This adequately reflects the time they have given to the State, where they have not been eligible to enter the workforce.  That is only fair and correct and recognises the long service these families have given to the care of children on behalf of the State.  What we would like to see in the pension provision is that foster carers would receive contributory pension credits for their entire period of fostering when they were not available for work because they were caring for children on behalf of the State.<\/p> <p>  I will defer the question on the comparative merits of the contributory pension and the foster care allowance to Foster Care Ireland.  Many foster carers enter fostering with a big heart and pensions are probably the last thing on their mind.  I might defer to Ms Corridon, who is in this position at the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022060100002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Catherine Bond"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654038000,"counter":1897,"content":"<p>This was all news to me.  It was not until I had the opportunity to speak to more experienced foster carers that I discovered this was going to be a problem.  I am a veterinarian by profession.  I have a PhD and I gave up full-time employment to become a foster parent.  There is so much going on.  We were approved at the end of August 2020 and within a month we had our first placement.  The child in our care had quite a lot of medical needs so that then became the priority - his medical care, his development and managing around the system.  I must admit that pensions were probably the last thing on our mind.  It is something we need to get a little bit more savvy about.  Thankfully, my husband works full time but I gave up full-time employment to become a full-time carer.  It very much depends on the needs of the child, as to how much time will be involved.  An infant was placed with us so that was very much full time.  It might have been different if it had been an older child.  We did not know what to expect when we were approved.  We were approved for children aged from zero to 17 in 11 months, so we did not know who we were going to get or even how many.  People just do not know when they go into it as it is very much down to chance and timing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022060100002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Clare Corridon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654038000,"counter":1898,"content":"<p>I am not an expert on pensions.  The thrust of my remarks was that we have a problem with declining capacity.  We have a second problem given that inflation is rampant.  Consequent on that, the conversations that we are witnessing between foster carers relate to the allowance primarily and the costs of providing for children.  Several of them are in a position where they might decide to desist.  The question is what kind of incentives are appropriate.  I am looking at it from the perspective of how we build, retain and ensure that we have enough capacity to address the issue.  The technicalities of the design of the pension are beyond my expertise and experience, but that is the market situation, if one likes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022060100002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Taylor"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":1899,"content":"<p>I was listening upstairs, so I am aware of what was said in the submissions.  We are a social welfare committee and it is obvious that other issues that have been raised are more appropriate to the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  I will, therefore, focus solely on social welfare because that is where we can give the most help.<\/p> <p>  The no-brainer at the beginning is to just increase the foster care allowance in line with inflation from 2009.  Something is going to have to happen there or otherwise its value will go down rapidly.  I take it that if that happened, it would be a considerable start, although the witnesses might aim for a lot more.  We have people in every week with all sorts of requests.  Ms Corridon says she is a vet.  It is like any farmer at the fair.  The issue is what is realistic right across the board in all of the very valid, contending demands but this is a particular case as nothing has happened since 2009.  Most welfare rates have gone up in the meantime so that is sensible.<\/p> <p>  The second point that strikes me, if I understood correctly, was that in some care orders there is a requirement that the foster carer gives up work.  I am trying to latch it on to some existing payment rather than create a totally new payment.  The definition of the carer's allowance is that one gives somebody full-time care and attention.  It seems that rather than having to apply and make the case that there is full-time care and attention involved, where foster parents have to give full-time care and attention, by definition, that entitles them to the carer's allowance.  That would mean they would get a weekly payment over and above the foster care allowance, which I understand is to pay for the child.  That is something we could look at as a committee.  I am interested in hearing the reaction of the witnesses to that.  Sometimes it is easier to get something when amending an existing scheme than creating a brand new one.<\/p> <p>  I do not want to get too technical on the credits and pensions but, like everything else, it is technical.  I will try to keep it simple.  A credit is as good as a paid contribution if, first, one has ten years paid from the time one started work to the time one reaches pension age.  That could be achieved in gaps and reached by adding a bit here and a bit there, but one has to have 520 contributions paid sometime in one's life, between whatever time one started working, which could include holiday work and so on.  It is not confined to full-time work.  As long as one earns &euro;38 a week, one gets an A-rated stamp, but one has to have ten years.  I am curious to find out if the witnesses know or could find out how many foster parents would get caught by that, allowing for a child being with them for 20 or 23 years, depending on the age he or she is fostered at.<\/p><p>This would be, for example, 20 years out of a 40-year working life.  How many people will find the ten-year paid contributions a problem?<\/p><p> The next issue is of huge constraint, which is the 12 years and after.  If it is birth to age 12, or if the family got the child at two or three years old, it would be three to 12 years and so on.  There is an issue when the child is 12 years of age.  I definitely believe there is a case for an exception to be made here.  If the foster parent is required to be there until the child reaches the age of 23 then it is a very reasonable case.  It is about the term limits we come up against.  People are all the time coming into the clinic to see me where they have their pensions and so on and perhaps they are trying to get the care years credit, depending on the size of the family and all sorts of things, including caring for elderly people.  There is a limit, however, on the credit someone can get, which is 20 years.  The credits might be due to being out with illness, being unemployed, or due to caring credits.  The total limit is 20 years.  One might jump out of the fire, if the limit is raised to 23 years of age for fostering.  Because a person may have been ill, or may be ill in the future, or if a person was unemployed, or ends up on credits for all sorts of reasons, he or she may hit the 20-year ceiling.  It would seem to me that if they got rid of the 12-year limit and instead raised it to 23 years in the case of foster care, and if we got rid of the 20-year credit ceiling in the case of fostering, then all would be left is the barrier to the credit being as good as the stamp.  This is what I am trying to get at.  At some stage in a person's career he or she would have had to put up 520 contributions.  I should not use the word \"stamp\"; it is very old-fashioned of me.  When I started working they were actually stamps that one put on a card.  Would the ten-year contribution clause cause a problem?  Do the witnesses foresee it causing a problem for many?  Would most of the foster carers have worked before they fostered and perhaps returned to work once the fostering was finished and the child was over a certain age?  This is where I can see we might go in the short term.  Is this the kind of direction that would help to make it much more likely, while not absolutely cast iron, to get a contributory pension?  Would this help to do something with the foster care allowance?  Would it help to say that, by definition, foster carers are entitled to the carer's credit?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022060100002#E00500","speaker":"1575","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654038000,"counter":1901,"content":"<p>The Deputy has highlighted two of the key recommendations.  The first is the age restriction on the eligibility for children to qualify for the home caring period scheme.  If that age could be increased from 12 to 23, it would make a significant difference because in most cases of fostering the child has longer-term needs and longer-term development needs and stays with the foster carer for longer.  The second key point made by the Deputy was on the 20-year limit on the contributions.  Fostering can, and does, last longer than 20 years and in the case of multiple fostering, it can certainly exceed the 20-year cap.  If this limit was removed with regard to foster carers it would be another huge step.

We must look at the issue from a social protection point of view.  This is where we can be most useful.<\/p> <p>  I acknowledge the incredibly important role that foster parents play in the provision of care for extremely vulnerable children and children who very much need that care.  I have seen this work in my role as a primary school teacher.  I have seen many children who were going through the foster care system and were in extremely loving and caring placements that helped those children achieve their full potential.<\/p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v has dealt in length with the issues around the credits and the pension.  I accept this is clearly not work foster carers do for money.  If people make the decision to enter the foster caring system, they are clearly not motivated by profit.  It was interesting for me to find out that I would not qualify as a foster carer based on the work that happens within my household.  To qualify as a foster carer a person within my household would have to make a decision to step back from work.  While we are both parents within our household we would not qualify as foster carers, which is interesting.<\/p> <p>  I want to ask about the far end of foster care.  I attended an Empowering People in Care, EPIC, event that was run on the Waterford campus of the South East Technological University, SETU, which I am now training myself to say as opposed to saying WIT.  Will the witnesses talk to us about what happens when the child reaches the age of 18?  This is very important.  I learned at the EPIC event that it can be a situation that places a great deal of stress and pressure on those children who are, essentially, exiting State care or foster care.  How do the witnesses feel this could be designed to be better supported?  In my own case, at the age of 45 I know that I could still turn the key in my parents' door.  When we go back to basics, whatever happens in life, we know that there is still a door we can turn the key in.  I believe it is the case with many foster parents that they still provide this lifelong relationship with children who have passed through their care.  I do not believe this is supported or recognised.  Will the witnesses talk to us a little about that?  Will they also comment on the pressure facing the foster child if he or she enters third level education and, for example, if a course is not working out for them?  What are the implications of this on their payments?<\/p> <p>  If a person has gone through the fostering experience, it seems to me very strange that foster carers would care for a child for a long period and then at the age of 18 or 23, the doors just seem to come down on the relationship.  I know, of course, that the doors do not come down on the relationship, but how does the State understand that relationship?  Perhaps the witnesses would outline their experiences of that, and if there are ways the State could support an ongoing relationship in a better way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022060100002#F01200","speaker":"1617"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654038000,"counter":1912,"content":"<p>The Deputy has touched on a very relevant issue at the moment, which is the terminology of aftercare.  Legally, within the Child Care Act the legal age of adulthood is 18 years.  When a young person in foster care arrives at the age of 18, he or she is no longer deemed to be a child in care.<\/p><p>They then move into the aftercare space.  Many young people in foster care find the term \"aftercare\" does not reflect their status in life.  They are defined by their care status as opposed to the achievements in their own lives.  Foster carers also find the terminology of aftercare very frustrating and demeaning.  In 2021, IFCA held a series of focus groups specifically looking at the aftercare system and how it impacts on children in care and foster carers.  Foster carers felt devalued by the system of aftercare because when the child reaches the age of 16, many of them are told by an aftercare worker that they are taking over, the child is moving into aftercare and their job is done.  These families are hugely invested in these children, like Ms Corridon, who has had her little boy from two weeks of age.  They are investing all their lives into these children.  It is the same for Mr. Nolan, who is fostering three children.  To be told when the children reach 16 that they have done their job is quite demeaning and belittling for foster carers because they have invested in these children's futures.  They see themselves as part of these children's futures and the vast majority of them are, thankfully.  They have raised these children and brought them to all their appointments and access visits.  They have brought this whole young person out at the other end and want to continue caring for them.  The vast majority of foster carers continue to care for these children beyond the end of aftercare, which is at age 23.  We know of children of foster carers who are now fostering other children themselves and so it is almost like a family fostering.  The whole area of aftercare needs to be reviewed.  I am aware that Tusla is reviewing it.  The Irish Foster Care Association and Empowering People in Care, EPIC, have entered into a joint endeavour to get the views of foster carers and young people in care.  That report will be issued quite soon and we can provide that to the committee.<\/p><p> Within the review of the Child Care Act, we need to look at the legal age of leaving care being 18.  Not many parents would tell their child, on reaching 18, that they are on their own.  Not many parents would tell them at the age of 16 that they need to spend the next two years preparing them for leaving.  It is not natural in family life.  While these children may be chronologically 18, developmentally they are not because of the myriad of complex issues they have on coming into care, the early life experiences, loss and separation they have had in their lives.  We have a very responsible job in caring for these very vulnerable young people in our society.  There is a huge investment by the State for all these children in their foster care placements, as well as by the foster carers, only for it to fail at the last hurdle.  We in IFCA often wonder about that.  Sending these children out into the big bad world and severing ties with them sets them up for failure.  As many parents will know, sometimes when children go to college, they do one year of a course and do not really like it and want to change direction.  The system does not facilitate that for our young people in care.  There are young people in care who want to go on to do masters' degrees and need the financial means and support to do that.  This is also an area for the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  When we have published our final report, which is imminent, we can share that with the committee if it would help it in those areas. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022060100002#F01300","nonspeaker":"Ms Catherine Bond","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":1914,"content":"<p>Here in Ireland there is a commitment in the programme for Government for a universal basic income, UBI, pilot.

We often hear that at the first meeting a child has on leaving aftercare, they will be given the number for Focus Ireland to find alternative types of living accommodation.  That can be quite disappointing and devastating for foster carers because they do not want their young people going into homelessness.  They want them to get the best in life that they have prepared them for, while also having that safety net under them.  We need a system where our young vulnerable people leaving care can have somewhere to come back to, a place of safety.  The Deputy said he still has the key to his mother's house.  Many of us do.  We need a safety net for our young people so we are not just casting them off into the ocean and hoping all the investment and supports they received during childhood will stay the course for them.

As others said, we are delighted to have them here.  I pay tribute to foster parents throughout this land.  They have a very nurturing and caring approach to people.  I constantly meet people who have been in foster care who say they are heading back to their parents, which are the foster parents, to see how they are.  They might be coming from a different part of the country.  There are still many misconceptions about foster care.  There are many couples who would like to foster but say they do not have the ability or do not feel they can do it.  Is that something the witnesses come across a lot?  How can we approach that?  That is said to me several times a month by people who would like to foster.  I also raise the six month assessment.  I know we have to be careful and people have to go through an assessment but would the witnesses be in favour of shortening that to four months, as a way of bringing people on board quicker?<\/p> <p>  Whether we like to admit it or not, there are a minority of people who make terrible references to foster parents by saying they are in it for the money.  I deplore that comment.  First, foster parents do not get a payment.  The payment is towards the costs of bringing up the child and caring for them, ensuring that child can attend all the events children would and have as natural an upbringing as possible.  I hate that comment.  It is a minority of people who say it.  They will say it privately, which is appalling.  That is something I would like stamped out.  Mainly it is a matter of the misconceptions that still exist.  There are many people who feel they would like to foster but think they cannot.

That partially addresses the negative connotation of people only being in it for the money.  That is why I said that anything members can do to highlight the importance and the societal benefits of fostering is a material contribution to building capacity.  The Senator asked about the length of the assessment.<\/p><p>I suggested in my remarks that it is a big decision.  It is actually quite complex.  You are surrendering quite a lot.  You need time to transition that.  What is actually going on in that assessment period is a conversation between a professional - a qualified social worker who has experience of fostering - and the person who is intending to foster.  There is a mutual informing process going on there.

They are all well informed, which is great to see.  I would like to think that this may be the beginning of proper engagement to work towards meeting foster parents&rsquo; needs.  This will benefit the children who are in care.  We speak about issues such as allowance, pensions, etc.  These issues must be thrashed out.  People must feel they are respected.  I say this because the sacrifice that is made is enormous.  If you have not walked a mile in my shoes, you just do not know what I am talking about.  That is fair to say.<\/p> <p>  On the whole, the way fostering has developed in Ireland is great.  The work that Tusla does is fantastic in the main.  There are gaps.  There are gaps in every part of our society, whether that is health, public transport or whatever, and there are gaps in fostering.  Pensions are one of those gaps, as is the issue of the foster care allowance.  Senator Murphy mentioned mileage.  I cannot understand or process how something that was set in 2009 could be relevant today.  It is set in the foster care allowance that for the first 50 km I travel, I do not get any compensation.  I cannot process that and I am a smart enough individual.  If I travel 49 km per day with a child, I get nothing.  However, if I travel 51 km per day with a child, I get an allowance for 1 km.  For that 1 km, we get 25 cent.  That is not respectful to people who are doing this on a voluntary basis and bringing up children on behalf of the State and society.  It is disrespectful.  That is the feeling on the ground, if I may say that.<\/p> <p>  The Irish Foster Care Association is the association that supports us as foster parents.  I have to hand over &euro;70 from my pocket to Ms Bond so that I can be a member of the association.  I am a volunteer.  The State should be paying that fee.  I know Tusla has been asked to look into that and it has given it the side kick.  I do not see why we, as volunteers who do not get paid, do not get a salary and whose needs are not met, should have to take &euro;70 out of our pockets to be a member of the association that supports us.<\/p> <p>  We are moving in the right direction.  We are speaking today to members of the committee.  We cannot drop the ball now.  We need to engage with the Irish Foster Care Association.  Tusla has asked us to grow our membership.  However, we cannot grow it if we are asking people who are volunteers for &euro;70.  We need the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to increase the budget given to the Irish Foster Care Association.  It is minimal.  It is just not enough.  The Irish Foster Care Association does not even have the number of staff it needs to meet the demands for counselling and advocacy.  I have used the advocacy service in recent times and that is ongoing.  It is an invaluable service.  I could not put a price on it, and nor could Tusla.  It has saved three children in care.  It has saved the placement.  The advocacy worker was just phenomenal.  That is the quality of staff that IFCA has.  This is not recognised either in the funding the association is getting.  The funding needs to be at least doubled to support the people who are bringing children up on behalf of this State.<\/p> <p>  I can tell the committee one story that sprang to mind.  Last year, on Easter Saturday I think, I was outside doing something.  A ten-year-old child came outside and asked me if Theresa and I were going to buy a cottage in our 80s.  I said that we may not live into our 80s.  He said, &ldquo;You will\".  When I asked why he said that, he said, &ldquo;You are good people&rdquo;.  I said, &ldquo;Thanks a million but why would you say we are good people?&rdquo;  He said, &ldquo;You change children&rsquo;s lives.&rdquo;  That is powerful message from a ten-year-old child.  I relay that message to the committee today.  That is the basis on which we must move.

For many of them, it is a difficult process to gather all of the information.  The vast majority of them have been fostering for a long period of their lives.  We must remember that if I take in a child at the age of two weeks, as Ms Corridon has done, and I have the child until they are 23 years of age, I might then take in a five-year-old child five years down the road and have that child until they are 23.  Therefore, there are limitations to somebody taking up paid employment.  The only way someone might have the required number of contributions would be if they were made prior to that person entering fostering.  This is certainly an issue we could interrogate further among our members who are in this predicament.  We need the State to recognise the duration for which somebody fosters and to make contributions for them.  The comparative cost of children in residential care is substantially higher, and will always be substantially higher, than a State pension to foster carers.  The vast majority of foster carers foster more than one child.

Making massive demands without succeeding is not much use.<\/p><p> When someone comes in with a pension contribution record, the first step is to count whether he or she has 520 reckonable contributions.  That gets you over step one, after which you get into what is currently the averaging system, although it will not last forever.  A total of 40 years' worth of contributions is being talked about for everybody in the future.  The contributions can be either paid or credited.  Once you get over the first hurdle, you just need to credit, as long as there is no limit.  If someone is required to provide care for the child well beyond 12 years, that case is a no-brainer.  The idea of the 12 years is that when the child goes to secondary school, most parents can at least earn &euro;38 per week.  I refer to cases that are not high dependency and to there being an out regarding children with a severe disability.  It is a question of what can be done in one year and, regarding the second year, where the best pitch is.  It is also a question of which arrangement will get 99% or virtually 100% through and of not getting everything you want while actually winding up with nothing.  It is a guessing game when dealing with Departments, as the witnesses know.  I have always found that the more one can operate within the existing system and tweak the system, the more one is likely to get what I describe in the next budget change.  I am referring to what occurs if you try to rewrite the rules more.<\/p><p> On the case that my good colleague raised, namely, that of the living wage, the matter is being addressed in a very tentative way in one Department.  It is not in the Department of Social Protection at all.  It kicked the matter to touch because it saw the implication of a living wage for everybody and so on.  It should be achieved in the future.  Having a living wage, with additional income taxed, is a very good idea but it is a question of how to get to all these great places and do so step by step.  It would be useful to get some data on how many people, before, after or even during very part-time work, manage to achieve the 520 paid contributions so we will know what the real problems are.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022060100002#H01000","speaker":"1575","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":1929,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.  I have a couple of comments and questions that follow on from where he left off.  It would be interesting to know how many foster-care parents come from a work environment into their role.  If they have worked for ten years, they can continue to make voluntary contributions for the rest of the foster-care period.  In that case, one is talking about the cost of the voluntary contribution, which is a minimal cost compared with the actual return one would get in terms of a State pension.  The feedback from raising awareness of this opportunity among foster parents might indicate the number of people who fall into the category.  If a considerable number of foster parents do fall into the category, the overall cost to the Exchequer of an extension for everyone is reduced considerably.  From the delegates' perspective, it would be useful for them to make their members and foster parents in general aware of what I am talking about and of potential eligibility.<\/p> <p>  The delegates raised the issue of making credited contributions where foster parents are between caring roles.  Am I correct that, in those instances, they are not in receipt of a payment?  Not being in receipt of payments could cause significant problems with regard to getting a credited contribution.  This is somewhat different from the issue we are dealing with in terms of family carers.  It might be one that the delegates may wish to revisit and revert to us on.  Am I correct that a foster parent is eligible to receive the carer's allowance if caring for a child with a serious or significant disability?<\/p> <p>  Could I have clarification on an issue concerning child benefit that comes under the remit of our committee?  My understanding is that if a child leaves the family home, for whatever reason, the parent continues to receive child benefit for six months.  If it goes beyond that period, the foster parent receives it.  I have two questions in this regard.  Does Tusla provide an additional allowance for the first six months to cover the shortfall?  Alternatively, could the child in question be left without an additional resource coming into the household?  Does that apply in respect of the children I spoke about earlier, namely, the unaccompanied minors, who, thankfully, are now going through the fostering system rather than the horrendous system that was in place prior to that?  Does child benefit kick in immediately for foster parents of unaccompanied minors, because the parents of the latter would not be in receipt of child benefit?<\/p> <p>  Excuse my lack of understanding, but Mr. Taylor might clarify a point for me.  He stated, \"The delivery costs under either model of ownership or market dominance are at the very least comparable\".  He was talking about the statutory and non-statutory models.  I have had no dealings with the non-statutory model.  The only dealings I have had relate to home help.  Where the home help is not directly employed by or paid by the HSE, the rate is decided by the company employing that individual to provide this support.  Do the parents Mr. Taylor engages with receive the fostering allowance?  What is the relationship between those parents and his organisation?  Do the parents receive allowances over and above the fostering allowance?  Mr. Taylor made the point that there are savings because his model is smaller, less bureaucratic and more agile.  How can there be savings if the payment rates are the same?  I would like that to be clarified because I do not understand how his system operates by comparison with that associated with home help funded by the HSE.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022060100002#J00200","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654038000,"counter":1930,"content":"<p>Points were made on the importance of awareness-raising in the foster care community and on people who have worked for ten years making additional contributions.  Awareness-raising can certainly be undertaken.  We can also undertake to collate the data on whether people would have the ten years of contributions, but we are aware that many do not.  We can continue to obtain the data.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of foster carers receiving a payment between foster-care placements, the carers are not given any retainer payment by Tusla but are on the register of foster carers and available to foster.  Therefore, there is certainly a gap for foster parents in the period.  The rationale for not paying the child benefit to the foster carer for the first six months is in the provision in the Child Care Act, which specifies that short-term fostering is for six months or less.  Therefore, the objective is to return the child to the family.<\/p><p>The rationale has always been that there is hope that the child will return to the family.  The disruption of that payment to the birth family would be too great, and the bureaucracy around having to reapply for it would probably take as long in that period.<\/p><p> On the Chairman's other question, the foster carers do not receive any additional payments other than the foster care allowance.  They may approach Tusla for extraordinary expenses.  Ms Corridon may be able to speak to the experience of taking in a new baby, and all of the expenses attributed to setting up a new foster care placement when I finish.  Funds can be provided on an extraordinary one-off basis, for example, if carers want to buy particular items for a child.  Without a doubt, however, financial pressures are placed on foster carers in the first six months of the placement, particularly if the foster carer has a teenager who is going to school, given the cost of uniforms.  In our recent survey carried out during fostering fortnight this year, we asked our foster carers what difference an additional allowance would make for them.  We received high levels of responses stating that an additional allowance would enable foster carers to bring children to more activities or perhaps even pay for therapies for children that are not provided by the HSE or Tusla.  Tusla does not make up the shortfall in the allowance; it is assessed on a case-by-case basis.<\/p><p> On foster carers who care for children with disabilities receiving the home carers allowance, it is a real challenge.  Many of the children in foster care have highly complex needs, but a diagnosis of disability is required in order for the foster carer to avail of those other payments.  All of our children come into care with significant levels of need because they have very early traumatic experiences, but they may not be diagnosed as having a disability.  Our foster carers are providing high levels of care for children with very complex needs, but will be unable to apply for extra payments if the children are not diagnosed as having a disability.<\/p><p> On unaccompanied minors, we have not really seen cases of foster carers having an unaccompanied minor being placed with them in a official fostering capacity yet.  Just yesterday, an approved foster carer who has an unaccompanied minor placed with them contacted our helpline.  However, the placement is not within a fostering capacity.  The issue that the foster carer raised with us is the high levels of cost associated with housing a child who has arrived in the country, starting them in a new school and buying the school uniform, and dealing with very traumatised children who will require levels of counselling and trauma care.  As of yesterday, when the foster carer contacted IFCA, she had not received any financial assistance from anybody.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022060100002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Catherine Bond","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":1932,"content":"<p>She had not received any assistance?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022060100002#K00200","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654038000,"counter":1933,"content":"<p>That is correct.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022060100002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Catherine Bond"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":1934,"content":"<p>She will be getting the foster care allowance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022060100002#K00400","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654038000,"counter":1935,"content":"<p>No.  She is getting nothing.

The first concerns child benefit.  I can fully understand why the child benefit is not withdrawn from the birth family.  It makes perfect sense.  However, the purpose of child benefit is to deal with he additional cost of rearing a child, which, sadly, has become far more expensive in the past 12 months than it was heretofore.  In that instance, those particular children are losing out.  The State is making the payment through the Department of Social Protection.  Surely, a similar payment should be made by Tusla for the interim window and period?<\/p> <p>  Second, I was very surprised by what Ms Bond stated in respect of the treatment of foster parents of unaccompanied minors.  The State did not covered itself in glory in respect of the treatment of these children in the past.  Many were found in appalling conditions.  I refer to those fortunate enough to have been found.  Sadly, 443 of them were never found.  No one seems to care about them.  Ms Bond has stated that in those instances the State is not supporting the foster parents involved in providing support, accommodation and far more to children who are coming from extremely traumatic situations.  We have seen first-hand what is happening at the moment with unaccompanied minors coming from Ukraine.  Such minors have been coming to Ireland from all over the world for the last 25 years.  We would like to hear more from Ms Bond on that issue.  <\/p> <p>  Does Ms Corridon wish to comment on her own experience of becoming a foster parent?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022060100002#K00900","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654038000,"counter":1940,"content":"<p>My husband and I had around 24 hours' notice that we were going to be taking home a two-week-old infant.  We had absolutely nothing and did not have a clue what we needed to get, so there was a mad shopping frenzy.  I should also say that this happened in the middle of the Covid pandemic.  I am sure members can imagine how difficult it was.  Thankfully, we had the means to buy the items we required.  If we were in that situation and did not have money in the bank to pay, it would have been difficult.  No additional payment was provided to help us get set up.  Anyone who has bought for a new baby will be aware how expensive it all is.  I mentioned that the child in our care has medical needs.  We have had to pay for surgery and a number of different medical expenses for him.  It will take time to be compensated for that.  It was more important to us that he got the surgery and the treatment.  We had to go private in order to do that.  It takes time.  There are additional expenses, but we put the needs of the child first.  We were in the position to meet these additional costs, but for other people it would be a huge financial strain.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022060100002#K01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Clare Corridon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654038000,"counter":1941,"content":"<p>On the question of the comparison of models, I introduced the issue quite deliberately in order to make the committee aware that there are two systems and to highlight the benefits of having alternative models.  In other words, it is not a question of which is better.  The fact that there is not a total monopoly enables both to learn.  I will give one example.  Insofar as the six players are all subcontracted or service providers to Tusla, the agency can then exercise its own judgment as to how well or not these agencies are performing.  Inevitably, it raises the bar for them because it insists on full compliance with all the standards.  The success in doing this is illustrated by the fact that looking at the results HIQA inspections, we can see that the six non-statutory agencies score higher than Tusla regions do under the same tests.  The point I am making is that there is value in this model.  It empowers Tusla in certain ways.  It also provides learning for the overall system.  I am not trying to say that one model is superior to the other, but that a level of competition that is appropriate in the areas where it is public is useful.<\/p><p> We had a worry ourselves as non-statutory agencies that we were perceived as being expensive or in it for the money.  Those are both very pejorative comments to apply to us and, as the Senator suggested, they could be applied to the people who do it but that is not the case.  My agency was founded to prevent children from going into 24-hour care at a higher cost to the State, motivated by an earlier intervention.  That said, in the context of the service delivered, there are two aspects to a fostering placement, namely, that of the child, which is monitored by his or her social worker, and that of the foster carer, which is monitored by the link worker.  In the Tusla model, Tusla from separate Departments will provide both those inputs in order that it will have a rounded view rather than one person's view.  In the case of the non-statutory model, we provide the link worker and Tusla continues to provide the child's social worker, so the rapport between those two is very important for the health of the placement.  As a link worker, a case worker in Tusla could hold more than 20 placements, while in the private agencies it ranges from eight to 12.  The level of service delivered to the foster carer, therefore, is higher under the non-statutory model and it is not surprising the inspection results show full compliance.  Part of Tusla's issue relates to a staffing problem.<\/p><p> On the final question, which I have alluded to, the number of placements at non-statutory agencies is growing while that in Tusla is shrinking.  That has to do with the level of service foster carers experience.  Those trends should result in both Tusla's level of service and the overall level of service improving.  To return to the Chairman's question relating to how the costs of all this are paid for, we commissioned a study, given the accusation the cost was too high, that examined the value for money.  We asked whether, in comparison with Tusla, we were offering value for money and the answer was an unequivocal \"Yes\".   It would have cost Tusla more to deliver the level of service we were offering.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022060100002#K01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Taylor","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":1943,"content":"<p>Will Mr. Taylor comment on the relationship between foster parents and his organisation versus that between foster parents and Tusla, with reference to the remuneration?

I do not even know where we sit in regard to child benefit; I will have to look into that.  There was no information about the supports and there certainly was not financial interest in becoming a foster parent.  I was a little horrified to hear I will be financially out in regard to my pension and so on as a result of becoming a foster parent.  No discussion or information was given about that.  The focus is very much on whether we fit the bill and were good enough, with all the evidence required for that.

T&aacute; an-&aacute;thas orm f&aacute;ilti&uacute; ar ais roimh an gcoiste chun tosa&iacute;ochta&iacute; strait&eacute;iseacha na Roinne a phl&eacute;.   The Minister of State and I are delighted to have the opportunity to speak to the committee on strategic priorities for tourism, culture, arts, sport and media.  The Joint Committee on the Irish Language, Gaeltacht and the Irish-speaking Community will address Gaeltacht priorities.<\/p> <p>  Last November when my Department's sectors were among those most seriously affected by the Covid-19 crisis, I spoke to the committee about my priorities and the vital importance of these sectors to Irish society, our individual and community well-being and our national economy.  I am very pleased we are now in a position to enjoy the safe and successful reopening of our society.  With it, our tourism sector looks forward to a busy summer season ahead.  I am also delighted to see audiences back at arts, culture and event venues and I welcome the full return of fans to our sports grounds.  Notwithstanding this, I am aware that there are factors casting a shadow over the recovery, not least the devastating war in Ukraine as well as rising inflation in our economy and internationally.<\/p> <p>  A key priority has been to continue supports for these critical sectors, which employ hundreds of thousands of people, so that they can stabilise and generate economic activity as we move further along the road to recovery.  I draw the committee&rsquo;s attention to a number of important developments in relation to these sectors.  This year, for tourism, I have allocated an increase of &euro;67.6 million, or 31%, on the comparable 2021 allocation.  The increased funding will facilitate a further &euro;50 million provision to assist vulnerable tourism businesses to survive until inbound tourism recovers.  There is a &euro;35 million increase in the tourism marketing fund in 2022 to support marketing strategy and restore inbound tourism to Ireland.  Further to the economic recovery plan published last year, the Government decided to extend the VAT rate reduction to the end of February 2023.  This extension covers the same goods and services as the original measure, including restaurant supplies, tourist accommodation, cinemas, theatres and museums.<\/p> <p>  I was pleased to announce details of a &euro;50 million suite of measures to support the live performance sector in 2022.  This included a further strand of the live performance supports scheme as well as the &euro;15 million live performance restart grant scheme, which opened for applications in March.  The Arts Council provides the vital investment needed to protect artists' livelihoods, support arts organisations, develop audiences and nurture young people&rsquo;s engagement with and appreciation of the arts.  Maintaining the record &euro;130 million allocation for 2022 allows the Arts Council to fund events and festivals in across Ireland while nurturing excellence.  From the earliest days of the pandemic, the dramatic realisation of the true intrinsic value of the arts provides an imperative for maintaining funding to the arts.  With regard to my Department's capital programme, the programme for Government makes strong commitments for continued capital investment in our national cultural, sporting, language and tourism infrastructure.<\/p> <p>  Ireland's tourism sector is of significant value to the economy and benefits regional development.  Recruitment continues to be a significant challenge for the tourism sector with up to two thirds of businesses reporting reduced capacity due to staff shortages.  The Department and F&aacute;ilte Ireland are continuing to collaborate with industry and other Departments to ensure there is a co-ordinated approach to addressing labour and skills shortages.<\/p><p>I am continuing to liaise with the recovery oversight group in respect of the tourism recovery plan and issues affecting the sector.  Work is also ongoing on the development of a national tourism policy that will set out the path over the coming years and ensure that sustainability is at the heart of recovery in the sector.  This policy will be underpinned by a programme of capital investment which includes investment in activity-based tourism.<\/p><p> There has been much recent discussion about the costs and availability of key components of the tourism sector, such as hotels and car rental.  While I recognise that businesses in the sector are grappling with increased input costs and that increased demand leads to an increase in prices, it is essential that all businesses in the sector are mindful of the need for Ireland to maintain its value-for-money proposition as a tourism destination.<\/p><p> Evidence of excessive charges and prices for tourists, both domestic and overseas, has the potential to cause reputational damage for Ireland.  Furthermore, any negative impact could derail the positive recovery in that sector.  We must work together to ensure that our c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte and good value continues.  The tourism recovery must be sustained and sustainable.<\/p><p> With the climate emergency as our backdrop, the future we imagine is one that will bring tourists and tourism businesses on a journey towards a sustainable model that embeds and protects our environment, local communities, natural heritage and beauty.  Last year, the arts and culture recovery task force submitted its report, Life Worth Living, which outlined ten recommendations to support the recovery of these sectors.  We have made significant progress on implementing the report.<\/p><p> I was especially pleased to announce &euro;25 million in budget 2022 for the pilot basic income guarantee scheme as part of budget 2022, as part of the three-year pilot&rsquo;s investment of &euro;105 million.  Applications closed on the 12 May with close to 9,000 applications received.  Under this scheme 2,000 artists and creative arts workers will be provided with &euro;325 per week for three years.  I hope this scheme can bring new life and support to the arts and culture sector and that it will provide an important legacy for our artists.<\/p><p> In February, Government also agreed in principle that the Creative Ireland programme will continue for a further five years to encompass the period 2023 to 2027 and will focus on the following pillars: creative youth; creative communities; creative industries; creative health and well-being and creative climate action and sustainability.<\/p><p> The report of the night-time economy task force was published in 2021 and contained a number of practical recommendations to help support and sustain the night-time economy, with some pilot measures to support new developments in this area.  A robust implementation structure has been agreed to ensure that the recommendations are implemented, which has the flexibility to react to new ideas and developments as work progresses.<\/p><p> In tandem with these developments, we continue to commemorate in a meaningful and respectful way, the events that shaped the foundation of the state, as part of the decade of centenaries programme. The all-party committee, which I established to contribute to the commemorations programme, is working proactively with me as we come to the closing years of the centenary commemorations, with a number of significant events scheduled over the coming years.<\/p><p> It is a priority of my Department to address the future of broadcasting and media in this country and safeguard the availability of quality, informed and trusted sources of news and content.  Some examples from budget 2022 to support this sector include the additional &euro;4.2 million funding I secured for TG4 for 2022, which was the largest ever annual increase in TG4 funding, and the &euro;5.5 million allocated for the establishment of the coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n.<\/p><p> I was glad also to be in a position to provide increased funding to the sound and vision scheme which will be allocated this year, to support the production of high quality television and radio content, including a special round to address climate action and climate change.  With regard to the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill, I also thank the committee for the publication of a comprehensive pre-legislative scrutiny report with regard to the general scheme of the Bill.<\/p><p> The 33 recommendations contained in the report raise a wide range of important issues and highlight the scale and complexity of the matters to be addressed in the Bill.  To address one of the key recommendations of the report, I established an expert group to examine the possibility of providing for an individual complaints mechanism in the Bill.  I have now received the report of the group and am considering its recommendations.  It is a priority to ensure swift progress of the Bill through the legislative process, with a view to having it enacted as soon as possible.  While this is subject to the scheduling of each stage of the legislative process in each House of the Oireachtas, I will urge all Members to work closely with me to expedite its passage, especially against the backdrop of infringement proceedings which are being taken against Ireland in respect of the transposition of the  audiovisual media services directive.  The enactment of the legislation, without delay, is critical to avoiding significant penalties.<\/p><p> In parallel with the passage of the legislation, my Department is working with the Public Appointments Service with a view to shortly commencing an executive search for the key roles in coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n including that of online safety commissioner.  The establishment of an coimisi&uacute;n will provide the regulatory and developmental framework to allow me to implement many of the recommendations in the report of the Future of Media Commission, which will be brought to Government shortly.  I am sure committee members will agree that all of these measures are critical.  I look forward to ongoing cross-party engagement on this important agenda, where I envisage we will require a rolling suite of legislation to address the effective regulation of this hugely important and influential sector.<\/p><p> Tourism, culture, arts, our language, sport and media are fundamental to our society, identity, well-being and our democracy.  As Minister, I will continue to advocate strongly for these sectors as we emerge from a very difficult period.  I am happy to take any questions members may have.

Our key priorities in sport are to support the sector&rsquo;s continued recovery from the impact of Covid-19, to continue investment in vital infrastructure and to contribute to building a healthier and more active society by increasing sports participation across all sectors.<\/p> <p>  Consequently, we have set a target of 60% of the population participating in sport and physical activity by 2027.  The last two years have shown us how important sport and physical activity are for our physical health and mental well-being.  As we emerge from the pandemic, the Department continues to prioritise engagement with the sport sector and our significant allocation under budget 2022 will support a strong and vibrant sports sector and provide opportunities for everyone to engage in sport and physical activity.<\/p> <p>  We have started work on a number of actions which will be of real benefit to sport and we will be working on delivering others in 2023.  First, I wish to embed the sport-for-all ethos across all strands of the sports sector, whether at national governing body level or grassroots level.  The sports action plan includes 43 distinct actions and initiatives aimed at increasing participation levels across the board.  The emphasis is heavily oriented towards increasing inclusion, diversity and equality in sport.<\/p> <p>  We have a record &euro;12 million budget from the Dormant Accounts Fund, for investment in 2022, with which we can focus increased efforts to ensure that all persons have the opportunity to partake equally in sport and physical activity.  I specifically wish to develop a funding line under the Dormant <\/p> <p>Accounts Fund that will allow clubs and other organisations to apply directly for sport-for-all funding that will be targeted at increasing participation.<\/p> <p>  The commitment to diversity, inclusion and equality within the sport action plan is also underpinned by a commitment to increasing female representation on the boards of sporting organisations to a minimum of 40% by 2023.  It is intended to give clarity to sporting organisations on the implications of non-compliance with this measure later this year.<\/p> <p>  Second, we will be working on other priorities, such as building on the 2022 winter initiative, in order develop a strong programme of events for this winter and beyond, as well as the development of a national swimming strategy and a national database of sport and recreation amenities to provide people with key information on sport and recreational facilities in their localities.<\/p> <p>  Sport Ireland has published its new long-term high-performance strategy until 2032 which covers the next three Olympic and Paralympic cycles and will support and enhance Ireland&rsquo;s position internationally.  We have provided an increased allocation of &euro;96.2 million in current funding for Sport Ireland in 2022; up 5% on last year.  This will enable it to continue to support the sector through its various funding programmes.  These initiatives support the fulfilment of the Government's high-performance policy, grant funding for sporting organisations and equality in grant funding for female and male players.<\/p> <p>  In recent years, Ireland has won bids to host the Ryder Cup in Limerick in 2027, games in the UEFA Euro 2020 finals, the women&rsquo;s Rugby World Cup 2017 and is the preferred bidder to jointly host the T20 men&rsquo;s Cricket World Cup 2030.  We will also host the prestigious US college football matches in Dublin for five years from 2022 and, it is hoped, beyond that.  We have engaged with the UK Government and have decided to support the FAI&rsquo;s submission of an expression of interest for a co-hosting bid for Euro 2028.  Officials from my Department will examine the feasibility of supporting a bid before a final decision is made by Government.<\/p> <p>  We are currently developing a major-sports-events policy and the public consultation phase of this process has just concluded.  Major sports events have the potential to deliver many benefits for sport, society and the economy.  The final policy and strategy, which will be published later this year, will seek to maximise those benefits for Ireland.<\/p><p>On capital investment in sports projects, the latest round of the sports capital and equipment programme closed for applications last year.  A record 3,106 applications were received, seeking over &euro;200 million in funding.  The equipment-only projects were assessed first and grants with a total value of &euro;16.6 million were announced in 2021.  The remaining capital applications were then assessed and 1,865 individual grant offers, with a total value of over &euro;143.8 million, were announced in February 2022.  This represented the highest level of allocation ever made under the programme.  Unsuccessful applicants were able to appeal the Department's decision and 146 appeals were received by the deadline of 4 April.  Some &euro;6 million was kept in reserve for successful appeals and the outcome of that process was just announced yesterday.<\/p><p> Resources have been provided in 2022 to continue to progress the projects allocated funding last year under the new large scale sport infrastructure fund, LSSIF.  The priority in the short term is to advance all of the successful projects with a view to awarding new grants to projects that missed out under the first set of allocations.  On completion, the scope for awarding any additional grants, adjusting the level of existing grants, and the timing of any new call for proposals will be considered.<\/p><p> I wish to reaffirm the Government&rsquo;s commitment to developing the Sport Ireland campus at Blanchardstown.  The 2022 allocation of &euro;9.6 million will allow Sport Ireland to complete ongoing projects and progress the planning and design on the national velodrome and badminton centre.  A new campus master plan has been drafted that will provide the framework for the long-term development of facilities at the campus over the next 15 to 20 years.<\/p><p>I thank all members for their time and attention and both of us are happy to take questions on any policy issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022060100002#B00200","speaker":"1475","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":1964,"content":"<p> We now will proceed with the question-and-answer session with members who have a five-minute slot today to ask questions and within which to receive responses.

In the Minister's opening statement, she stated, \"our tourism sector looks forward to a busy summer season ahead\" and indeed it does.  You can already see an abundance of tourists throughout the city but for how long will that last, given the price gouging that is going on in hotels and the extortionate room rates people are being charged?  People are beyond furious about this.  During the pandemic, when hoteliers had asked the public to support them by holidaying at home, people did support them.  Now you have a situation where things are opening up again and are getting busy and the great rip-off begins.<\/p> <p>  For example, I checked on Monday morning, when a room in a Dublin hotel was priced at &euro;320 for the night, no breakfast.  I received correspondence yesterday from a family who, because they were concerned about missing their flight, sought to book a room overnight in order that they could depart early for the airport.  The family of two parents and four children were quoted a price of &euro;816 for one night in Dublin city with no breakfast.<\/p> <p>  Another hotel on a Saturday night in June quoted a Dublin price of &euro;393, where the price in Belfast it was &euro;193.  The cheapest price I could see for two nights in July was &euro;600, again with no breakfast.  Another hotel quoted the same two nights at two euro short of &euro;1,300 but the good news is that there was breakfast included with that.  <\/p> <p>  These are extortionate prices about which people are completely furious.  <\/p> <p>  This is going to cause significant reputational damage to Ireland as a destination without a shadow of a doubt.  When the word gets out to overseas visitors that this is a rip-off, that people are paying way above any other hotel rates right across Europe, that Ireland is starting to rip off people again, this will cause long-term damage.  <\/p> <p>  I was going to say it stinks of pure greed but it is pure greed.  When one goes on to any site to look for hotel prices right across any other major European city, they offer fair prices and value for money.  In Ireland, particularly in the cities and in the larger areas, they are literally engaging in extortionate pricing.  It is not fair on other hotels in quieter areas of the country which are not engaging in price gouging and are trying to do their best to encourage tourism.  When word gets out among overseas visitors, that reputation will be given to us unless a stop is put to it.  <\/p> <p>  We must also consider domestic tourism, as people are not going to forget these prices.  People will remember all the supports the industry was given during the pandemic.  People supported these hotels, stayed and holidayed at home.  At the time, people had said some of the prices were very expensive in comparison to other times but they were absolutely nothing to the price gouging and the brazen rip-off that is going on now.  In her opening statement, the Minister stated, \"We must work together to ensure that our c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte and good value continues [and that the] tourism recovery must be sustained and sustainable.\"   What plans does the Minister have to ensure that this price gouging stops?  What is the Minister's assessment of the wisdom of extending the VAT reduction, given that demand is not the problem?  Would she be reluctant to extend this reduction further given this phenomenon or what measures does she plan to take to call out the hotels on these prices because we have to sustain our tourism in the long term?  Once a place gets a reputation of extortionate prices, people will just stop coming.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022060100002#C00300","speaker":"1497"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":1966,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy, who has raised a significant, highly topical and current issue.  As the committee is aware, there are significant cost inflation pressures for businesses, including tourism, at present but nonetheless, as the Deputy has said, Ireland has well-known attractions, many of which are in the Deputy&rsquo;s own constituency.  I think of the beautiful Carlingford which I go to myself and other places which again and again bring visitors back.  It is very important that businesses consider both their pricing levels and the added value and extras that they offer to help keep that reputation and that overall good-value proposition and competitiveness.  It is important that we attract back customers time and again and that their experience is one where they want to return.<\/p> <p>  On the hotel pricing issue, the 2022 rebound in the Irish tourism sector is very strong and stronger than expectations.  It could actually reach two thirds of the 2019 levels.  This has been helped by that stronger than anticipated recovery in air connectivity, as the 2022 peak summer access will be back to 90% of 2019 levels.  <\/p> <p>  April occupancy levels in Dublin hotels reached over 83% and the expectation is that the equivalent figure for May will be 90% or more.  Dublin is currently seeing at least 10% higher occupancy than cities such as London, Rome or Amsterdam.  No one thought that would happen so soon.  There is strong customer demand on the ground with a great deal of deferred travel, which is the key part here.  There is also the wedding activity, which is putting a real squeeze on available accommodation.  Other key domestic factors are also back in play now as we, thankfully, see the resumption of large concerts and matches.<\/p> <p>  We are seeing increasing numbers of those anecdotal reports of excessively high prices in the hotel sector and the Deputy has given examples there in this regard.  Whether these reports are reflective of the general market or of the prices that are being sought online for remaining rooms is somewhat moot because, as the Deputy has noted, such reports can have a really negative impact on our reputation as a visitor destination.<\/p> <p>  As I have said, I am very aware that businesses, including tourism businesses, are facing significant cost pressures due to inflation and other economic factors and the hotel-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022060100002#C00400","speaker":"1471"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":1967,"content":"<p>My apologies for interrupting the Minister but she is saying that businesses are facing additional pressures.

They have had a stressful two years.  They include catering, restaurant supply companies, cinemas, caterers and museums.  The Deputy knows the type of businesses that are on the list.

Does he now believe it is appropriate that there should be an independent investigation into the association?  We have seen another high-performance director leave, an election take place in which votes were not counted and members being expelled in a move that was subsequently found to be <i>ultra vires<\/i>.  There is clearly something wrong.  The Minister of State has indicated that he will consider withholding funding, but the concern, as expressed by Kellie Harrington yesterday, is that this may impact directly on the boxers.  Nobody wants to see that happen, but there is clearly something rotten at the heart of the IABA.  It is my view that there should be a complete independent investigation.  I would be grateful to know the opinion of the Minister of State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022060100002#D00500","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":1973,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for his comments.  As he is aware, there has been an independent review of IABA with very strong recommendations.  If he reads the review and recommendations fully, it sets out many difficulties, the dysfunction, the governance concerns and the issues that arise in terms of the connection with the grassroots and between the core organisation and the board.  That is why we have been very clear that we want IABA as an organisation to fully adopt at its extraordinary general meeting in June all of the recommendations that have been proposed.<\/p> <p>  To be clear, there has been an independent review, which has produced very clear and frank recommendations, which underpin best practice around governance and other aspects of how to run a sporting organisation.  We want to see them fully implemented and for the board to embrace all of the recommendations.  We want an implementation plan that is decided within a minimum of three months and then monthly meetings overseen by Sport Ireland around the implementation.  If that does not happen, there will be very severe financial consequences.  We will look at protecting athletes like Kellie Harrington and others.  We have seen great success in the European championships and in the world championships in the past week or two.  We want to ensure our high-performance athletes and grassroots are protected, but there will be immediate challenges for IABA as an organisation if it does not implement the recommendations.  We are not standing over ongoing cyclical dysfunction, zero women on the board and multiple other challenges.  We have had the resignation of Bernard Dunne recently and previously that of Billy Walsh.

Just like the Minister of State, I am concerned by the level of dysfunction, and I do not have confidence in the current board.  It is important that the grassroots and athletes are protected.<\/p> <p>  I will ask the Minister a couple of questions.  One of the issues she mentioned is that we would be seeing the imminent publication of the commission on the future of media's report.  We have been anticipating that for a while.  The Minister might indicate when that might happen.  She also stated that the recruitment process for coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n will begin shortly.  Is there an indication as to when we might see that happen and when the members and, in particular, the online safety commissioner will be in place?<\/p> <p>  I echo the concerns around tourism and the VAT rate.  There is one area where I think we have been successful in tourism.  Tourism Ireland has been active in promoting regional development, especially through the regional co-operative marketing fund.  Specifically speaking to what is happening at Rosslare Europort in the context of attracting international visitors, through the investment we are now seeing, Irish Ferries, Brittany Ferries and Stena are all promoting Rosslare and Ireland.

My colleagues mentioned the extension of the VAT rate and the high prices being paid in that context, particularly in the hotel end of things.  This has not occurred in the restaurant sector.  Several other countries in the EU have a split VAT rate.  If this price gouging continues, perhaps we may seriously need to consider looking at the VAT rate, and perhaps splitting it and allowing the restaurant industry to continue with a reduced VAT rate.  I say that because the same type of gouging is not happening in the restaurant industry.  It only seems to be happening in the hotel industry.<\/p> <p>  Turning to sport, I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, for finding that extra money for the sports capital grants programme.

A city the size of Galway, which has roughly 250,000 people, has only one hockey pitch.  When this large-scale funding scheme opens, the funding must be targeted to where there are deficiencies.  It should not be a case of putting large amounts of money into one or two or three projects.  This is an aspect we must explore.

I refer to certain projects that missed out.  There is also the aspect of broader demand.  We will engage with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform regarding the possibility of an additional budget line in this context.  Some &euro;100 million was made available.  Equally, the previous Government, and the then Minister of State, Deputy Brendan Griffin, allocated &euro;86 million at that time.  We are, however, cognisant that there is a necessity in the context of existing projects and the level of ambition across the country.<\/p> <p>  I also share the Senator&rsquo;s point about ensuring we intervene where facilities are needed.  We must move beyond single-sport facilities.  We must embed a municipal concept in sport and particularly where we invest on a bigger scale.  This will require sporting organisations to look beyond their own specific interests and to work together for the broader community.  That type of approach works much better across Europe and also gives better delivery for the State.  There is also the matter of how we can better integrate our education system with sporting and community facilities.  Any future iteration of the large-scale funding programme will mandate sporting organisations to come together to undertake larger projects in regions or communities.  This is what investment of this type should be targeted at, rather than for single and specific projects, as we have seen happen over many years.  This municipal concept must be at the core of any future budget line in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022060100002#F01100","speaker":"1475"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":2020,"content":"<p>I concur with the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments.  Senator Malcolm Byrne mentioned the IABA and I also have my concerns in this regard.  To be quite honest, there must be wholesale change at the top of that organisation.  An independent review was commissioned at short notice because this committee was seeking to look at the governance of the IABA.  The review was undertaken by the same person who carried out the previous review and yet the recommendations do not refer to the senior management in the organisation.  This is where the problem seems to be, and I say this having spoken to representatives of the clubs and to volunteers on the ground.  I do not have faith in the organisation.  I will be honest about this.  The situation must be re-examined.  Having talked to the people on the ground and in the clubs, they are not happy with the recommendations that have come from the report I referred to.  Therefore, this issue must be looked at again.  A significant number of people, some 30 volunteers, were suspended.  Those were people who had devoted thousands of hours to this sport throughout their lives.  Those suspensions were appealed and those appeals were upheld, but the people concerned have had to fund the cost of those appeals that vindicated them.  I do not think this is acceptable in any sport.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022060100002#F01200","speaker":"1639"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":2021,"content":"<p>Looking at the issues identified by the review, those aspects it points to include culture, the leaking of confidential information at the board, public distancing from board decisions, internal conflict, lack of clarity regarding roles and responsibilities, lack of active participation in the working of board subcommittees and significant issues regarding governance structures.  There is also the absence of women on the board, which is a problem, and we must deal with it.  The review also highlighted issues such as the independence of the board, the disconnect between the board and the grassroots, issues around oversight and control, the lack of diversity more generally and a range of other issues.  If the IABA fully embraces all the recommendations, it will go from being an organisation that is clearly dysfunctional when it comes to governance to one that can demonstrate best practice in future.<\/p> <p>  What we should not have, and what we cannot have, is people in the IABA, at whatever level, undermining clear recommendations.  People with obligations in that sport need to front up and to fully implement the recommendations.  What I will not stand for is anyone in the IABA undermining clear recommendations.  I want full follow-through on them.  I am not going to entertain a campaign that seeks to undermine recommendations.  The recommendations here could apply to many other sports and some of those sports have implemented similar recommendations already.  What is it that the IABA does not like about having women, independence and diversity on its board?  What does the organisation not like about changing the culture and behaviour of its board or about building a better connection between its board and the grassroots?  Therefore, if people within boxing think we are going to allow a kind of a campaign to undermine the current recommendations, we will not entertain any such campaign.  In the context of IABA, we will protect athletes and the grassroots, but we will have reform.  I am clear that the recommendations, when broken down and analysed, identify clear problems that we need to resolve.

There are concerns in the community about what some call a de facto exclusion of artists with disabilities insofar as the scheme may put someone at risk of having their other supports cut.  Can the Minister make some assurances on that?  If not, can the scheme be made exempt to disability allowance, the blind pension, the medical card and so on in order that people will not risk their supports being cut?<\/p> <p>  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comments on the night-time economy task force.  It is good to see that a robust implementation structure has been agreed.  Importantly, the flexibility is there to react to new ideas.  That is positive.  I commend the Minister on that.  I have been struck by the struggles people are facing, as well as the streams of people who we see walking out of town late at night trying to flag down taxis.  We have lost over 2,000 taxis from the industry since 2019.  My colleague, Deputy O&rsquo;Rourke, had a briefing in the audiovisual room at Leinster House yesterday, which called for the ten-year rule to be looked at.  In speaking to the Minister as an environmentalist, I note that when walking out the main arteries of town, you see streams of people who are unable to flag taxis and often, there is only one person in those cabs.  This is not a good use of resources.  The report of the night-time economy task forces called for an increase and extension of eight new routes to be in operation for 24 hours in Dublin.  There are currently three such Dublin Bus routes.  We need to see policy change if we want people to change their habits and to view the bus as an option late at night.  This is obviously the area of the Minister&rsquo;s colleague, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan.  It is a key recommendation in the night-time economy task force.  I would welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comment on the unavailability of taxis late at night.  People will not go into the city centre if there is no way to get home.  <\/p> <p>  I will add my voice to another issue because if we do not say it, it will not happen.  The report of the Future of Media Commission must be published.  We are getting fobbed off time and again by the Government and it has to be published.  The Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill must now go through the D&aacute;il without Deputies having access to that report, as has been the case for Senators as well.<\/p> <p>  My final request to the Minister is to consider in her budget allocations a ring-fenced allocation to RT&Eacute; for the development of the RT&Eacute; Player.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022060100002#G00100","speaker":"1686"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":2024,"content":"<p>I missed the Senator&rsquo;s last question.

It is our intention to publish that shortly.  We are having final meetings about it with the Ministers.<\/p> <p>  As for the basic income for artists scheme, it is the case that I have no statutory function in social welfare means tests.  That is a matter for the Minister for Social Protection.  The participation of artists with disabilities is a matter that I take very seriously.  I have sought to ensure that all artists, including those who have a disability, can apply to participate in the pilot.  Helplines were established for them so that they could see if they would be impacted.  We are encouraging everyone to apply.  A key research question that will arise from this entire basic income scheme process will be around the impact that such a payment could have on artists with disabilities.  To that end, I was determined since the outset of the basic income for artists scheme that artists with disabilities would be in a position to participate.  We therefore worked closely with the Department of Social Protection to enable their earnings to be treated as earnings from self-employment and to be taken into account in respect of the earnings disregards that apply to many social welfare payments.  That means that the basic income for the arts will be treated like any other income that a person in receipt of social welfare payments earns from employment.  Not all disabled artists are on social welfare supports, but for those who are dependent on income supports, the issue to which we have referred relates primarily to the manner in which social welfare schemes assess income from other sources.<\/p> <p>  Again, eligibility for social welfare is a matter for the Minister for Social Protection.  However, this is all shining a necessary light on this.  This will be a key piece that will arise from this research pilot scheme.  We have done everything possible to encourage them, as far as we could within the constraints of not being the Minister for Social Protection, in terms of trying to get the basic income for the arts over the line.  Of the approximately 9,000 applications that we received, 6.9% of those are from people with a disability.  They will therefore be represented on the scheme.  They definitely will have a chance to feed into and to be part of the research.  I am sure that like other artists, some will be on the control group as well.  I have done what I can within the constraints of the scheme and given the fact that I am not the Minister for Social Protection but Minister with responsibility for arts. <\/p> <p>  In relation to the night-time economy, I acknowledge what the Senator is saying about taxis and how it is not sustainable to have one person in a taxi.  On the issue of the eight proposed bus routes, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is very supportive of any developments there and in the night-time economy sector.  His Department, as well as the various transport agencies, are on the implementation group.  I agree fully with the Senator.  The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is determined to get that done too, from a sustainability point of view.  <\/p> <p>  RT&Eacute; is not funded by the Exchequer, but by licence fee receipts.  Therefore, that is a matter for RT&Eacute; to decide on.  A portion of the funds from the recent sale of land by RT&Eacute; have been ring-fenced for digital.  I think that may include the RT&Eacute; Player.  It will also go towards the paying down of debt.  I think I have addressed all of the Senator&rsquo;s questions.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022060100002#G00400","speaker":"1471"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":2027,"content":"<p>I believe so.

I welcome the fact that as we speak the chief executive is up before the Committee on Transport and Communications and a lot of those issues might be teased out there.  Dublin Airport is a regulated entity and the Commission for Aviation Regulation is an independent regulator for charges at the airport.  It also sets out a comprehensive range of quality standard targets, including on security times, to ensure a high quality service for passengers at the airport.  The passenger experience at Dublin Airport is falling so far short of the service that our citizens, tourists or visitors should expect at our largest State airport.  The Government recognises the undue stress that these unacceptable delays are having on passengers.<\/p> <p>  As the Deputy knows, ministerial level meetings have been held since the security delay issues first emerged at the end of March and I know that the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Naughton, met the authority earlier this week.  They have requested that the DAA report back within 24 hours on solutions that can be put in place as we approach a bank holiday weekend, which is a pinch factor.  Up until last weekend queue times had improved on those experienced by passengers at the end of March, with over 90% of passengers getting through security in less than 45 minutes but what we saw last weekend is not acceptable.  As the Deputy said, it has a real risk of doing severe reputational damage to our tourism.  I have written to the chief executive of the DAA to express my concern and I hope that the recent engagement with the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, will see immediate solutions put in place because we need that to happen.

Similarly, if one is flying from Kerry to Dublin and is going to take an ongoing flight one has to go out again and come back in, which is bonkers and makes no sense whatsoever.  I was on to Kerry Airport about this on Monday to see if it could do something bilaterally with the DAA and I was also on to the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, about it.  The experience for tourists trying to get to Kerry or Donegal or trying to go home could surely be helped by squaring that circle and it should not be impossible to fix that one.

It is a factor that is particularly detrimental to rural tourism more than it would be to short city breaks.  Awful prices are being charged.  I went on a few of the car hire websites last week and we are talking Monopoly money, which is not acceptable.  I accept the principle of supply and demand but just because a price can be charged does not mean it should be charged.  That is an area that needs to be addressed.  We are spending a fortune marketing the Wild Atlantic Way abroad, for example, yet when people come here they cannot afford to rent vehicles.<\/p><p>One thing I tried to progress when I was in the Department, and I came up against brick walls, was the concept of a hop-on, hop-off Wild Atlantic Way bus service.  It is a linear route, so it would not be very difficult logistically.  It would be a very doable project from a sustainability perspective, a tourist experience point of view as well as from the perspective of local engagement and local benefit.  It would be something that would greatly benefit both the communities and the visitors.  Certainly, in the context of the situation where people cannot rent cars at present, it would be a very sought-after service.  I cannot see how it cannot be done.  It is very possible to do it with a few daily services running each way.  Is this something on which the Minister could throw her shoulder to the wheel, if she will pardon the pun, and try to get the bus moving?  It would be a massive addition to the Wild Atlantic Way.  That is one matter I ask the Minister to bear in mind.<\/p><p> I have questions on two other matters.  The Carlingford cove initiative is in the programme for Government.  When I was in the Department I believed it was an important one to progress.  There is a vast offering along the eastern seaboard, perhaps more so from a walking and cycling point of view than as a driving route.  There are all the peninsulas on the west coast, but that is not the case on the east coast so it probably lends itself better to walking and cycling.  Is there any progress on that in respect of F&aacute;ilte Ireland?<\/p><p> Another initiative was the concept of the invitation follow-up to The Gathering.  Is there any progress on that?

With regard to the situation with the Liverpool fans at Saturday night's match in Paris, how many Irish Liverpool fans were in Paris for the UEFA Champions League final as well?  The fans, some of them children, were treated disgracefully by the French authorities and the commentary afterwards rubbed salt in the wounds.  Obviously, UEFA has a stake in all of this as well.  Clearly, the venue appeared to be quite unsuitable and the organising, or lack thereof, appeared to fall well short of what one would expect for a major European final.  Would the Minister of State consider conveying to UEFA his concern that there is nothing to stop this from happening, for example, to travelling Irish fans for an Irish international game in the future, if that is the poor level of organisation at UEFA events?  Would he consider expressing his concern?  As I said, many Irish lads were caught up in the hassle, through no fault of theirs, on Saturday night.  They appear to have been treated disgracefully.  It is not acceptable and we should express our concern about it.  Cities like Paris that have been awarded big tournaments such as this should not get them again if they have mishandled them and dealt with them badly, as Paris clearly did on Saturday night.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022060100002#J00700","speaker":"1581"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":2051,"content":"<p>We all are very concerned about what we saw and the total disorganisation beforehand, with fans arriving with tickets and being excluded and then being blamed for just trying to get into a match.

From a security perspective, the authorities there did not plan this well, and blaming everyone else is not the solution to that.  Other authorities have reflected their concern and I share that.  From an Irish perspective, I am confident that if we ever host a match, and I believe we have the UEFA Europa League final in 2024, we will make sure that everything is in place to provide an excellent fan experience so there would be none of these scenes in a Dublin context.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022060100002#J00800","speaker":"1475"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":2052,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and the Minister of State for the briefings.  Deputy Chambers referred to the aspiration to have 60% participation in sports.  One big obstacle to that happening is the Safeguarding 1 course, the child protection course.  Every volunteer has to do it.  It is a requirement if one wishes to work with children under 18 years of age or vulnerable adults.  I have done some research.  When I looked it up last night I found there are no courses available anywhere in the country.  It seems to be a complete mess.  Different sports partnerships put it on different platforms if one wishes to access it.  It is very difficult to find out and there is no uniformity with the application process.<\/p> <p>  The FAI, the GAA and the IRFU run their own courses, which is good for them, but smaller sports organisations such as Hockey Ireland, cricket, basketball and other sports have to get their volunteers to do the course, but there is no centralised platform.  Smaller sports are not in a position to run it.  This means clubs are going to lose volunteers and participants.  I ask the Minister of State to intervene in this to ensure there is a centralised platform that it is easily accessible and understandable and that there is a good healthy supply of courses, so there is no queue for the course.

First, I sincerely congratulate the Minister on getting the basic income for the pilot relating to artists.  This scheme is truly groundbreaking and will set our country apart in terms of how we value art and those who create it.  I echo the concerns, which the Minister addressed comprehensively, about how the basic income for the arts, BIA, payment might impact on people with disabilities who are in the arts sector.  I know there is an ongoing engagement happening between the Minister and the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys.  I ask that would continue during the pilot .  At the conclusion of the pilot, we will have a scheme that works very well for everybody who wants to participate in the creation of art in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Second, I thank the Minister for her extraordinary work during the pandemic in putting the live performance support scheme in place and for the significant collaboration that happened with local authorities and with practitioners in the industry.  Those same practitioners are finding their way back to work, albeit very slowly in some cases.  They are asking for us, as legislators, to consider looking at the reduction of the VAT that applies to many people in that industry.  I know there is an ongoing engagement with the Ministers for Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance, Deputies Michael McGrath and Donohoe, with a view towards having that looked at under our national tax strategy.  I would ask the Minister if she could perhaps make her feelings known as well.  Again, we are getting very conflicting information from various quarters as to whether this is possible or not from an EU VAT legislation perspective.  However, if it is, I ask the same sort of supports that have been extended to those in the hospitality industry also be extended to those in the arts industry, especially our musicians, entertainers and technicians.<\/p> <p>  On tourism, there is one point I want to make.  I make this point whenever I have the opportunity.  I refer to the much maligned Airbnb.  We need to look at how this platform and those similar to it can impact on the supply of housing in locations that have a very significant challenge around supply.  I live in a small, rural community in east Galway.  I live in what F&aacute;ilte Ireland beautifully coined as the Hidden Heartlands, which I think is wonderful.  For us in that small community, Airbnb has been truly a game changer in terms of how we market ourselves to the world, for families who are willing to welcome travellers from all over the world into our small, rural, east Galway community and how we market the very interesting activities that one can partake of in those communities.  That is replicated across the whole of the Hidden Heartlands in that there is a challenge around hotel rooms in many parts of it.  Airbnb and other platforms like it have given those less-visited locations an opportunity to market themselves to the world.  On foot of that, we need to be careful in how we move forward in regulating Airbnb and other industries or platforms like it.  We do not throw the baby out with the bathwater and deny an opportunity for particularly rural and remote locations to have people visiting them.<\/p> <p>  I live beside a very successful forest walk that was developed by our local community in conjunction with Coillte.  With the advent of Airbnb, certainly before the pandemic, I, for the first time, met people visiting there from Germany, Scotland, Italy and France.<\/p><p>They were all staying in local Airbnbs, an opportunity they did not have prior to the advent of that platform.  That is something of which we need to be mindful.<\/p><p> I thank the Minister for the additional funding for the extraordinary work of TG4.  I acknowledge the quality of the content emanating from that station and the work it does to connect with Irish communities worldwide.  The TG4 player is used extensively abroad by people who are trying to learn the language and also by people who are anxious to have a deeper understanding of Irish culture, the Irish people and our beautiful island.  TG4 is doing valuable work in throwing open a window to the world on what it means to be Irish and to live on this beautiful island.  I thank the Minister for her support for it.<\/p><p> Turning to the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, I congratulate him on his work on seeking to ensure increased and more diverse participation in sport.  That was very much reflected in the sport capital grants awarded earlier in the year and by those clubs and entities that are ambitious in increasing particularly women&rsquo;s participation in sport being very well funded and supported.  The Minister of State may not have specific information on the development of our velodrome project.  We are anxious to see it get under way.  New Zealand, which is similar in size to Ireland, has two national indoor velodromes which is beginning to produce very positive results in terms of New Zealand's participation in the sport of cycling from the grassroots up and success at international cycling competitions with wins and medals awarded.  It is beginning to have an impact.  Something similar could happen in Ireland as soon as we get our national velodrome under way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022060100002#K01900","speaker":"1483","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":2075,"content":"<p>Regarding the basic income for artists pilot, I thank the Acting Chairman for his support for that.  I share his enthusiasm for the widest possible participation in it.  I also agree with his comments on TG4.  I was very happy to increase its funding significantly in the past two years.<\/p> <p>  On the VAT on live performances, currently, artists and live entertainment event workers benefit from a favoured VAT regime but for shows or events where food and drink are not served, VAT is not charged.  A lower VAT rate is already applied to tickets for cinemas, theatres, some musical performances, museums and galleries' exhibitions.  I understand one of the issues raised by some representative industries is that musicians and performers charge 23% on the fees they charge.  There is push on the sector to reduce this amount.  I hear their point of view on this and I will make sure I raise it with my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, for consideration.<\/p> <p>  Regarding short-term lettings, peer-to-peer platforms like Airbnb are an important part of the tourism accommodation mix but we need a range and choice.

Damaging behaviours such as bullying, harassment and victimisation will not be tolerated across this sector.<\/p> <p>  Over the past number of years, report after report points to unacceptable behaviours in the arts and creative sector right across the spectrum from inappropriate language and insults to sexual assault and violence.<\/p><p>The fact that similar behaviours have emerged in other sectors is cold comfort and I believe it is my responsibility, as Minister with responsibility for culture and the arts, to take action to ensure that such behaviours in the creative sectors are consigned to history.<\/p><p> In this important area of work, my Department has partnered with the Irish Theatre Institute, ITI.  I am providing funding to the ITI which to date has amounted to &euro;400,000.  The ITI has been working in this area since 2017 to undertake extensive research and analysis, assist in the drafting of that, which will respond directly to the key issues, and work with my Department to implement those policies in an effective way that will, I hope, make a real and lasting difference to anyone working in this sector.  Last year, the ITI undertook a landmark survey of the arts and culture sector, the results of which led to the launch of the Speak Up: A Call for Change report in November, with five important recommendations.  Each of the five recommendations has a range of actions, all of which have been progressed by my Department, in partnership with the ITI and in collaboration with agencies, Screen Ireland and the Arts Council.  The recommendations include short-term actions, practical initiatives and the longer term challenge of changing mindsets, behaviours and culture.<\/p><p> Overall, in working through these recommendations and associated actions, I consider that there must be a fundamental change at a systemic level, which requires a change across society.  In helping to achieve this, a comprehensive awareness campaign is under way in combination with practical initiatives, such as bystander training, to effectively tackle sexual and gender-based negative behaviours on the ground.<\/p><p> For the past year and a half, I have funded Minding Creative Minds to provide a range of counselling and advisory services to the creative sector, free of charge.  Some &euro;530,000 has been allocated to date for this very valuable service and I will continue to fund this into the future.  The Minding Creative Minds service is a 24-7 confidential mental health and well-being support programme for the Irish creative community and is delivered by Spectrum Life.  Over the past six months, my officials have been working closely with Minding Creative Minds to expand its existing services and to incorporate some of the recommendations contained in the report, namely, offering specialised support for victims.  Minding Creative Minds is in the process of road-testing these additional services to ensure that practices are up to the necessary standard.  I expect this work will be completed shortly and that I will be in a position to make announcements soon.  It is very important, in such a sensitive area, that the services are adequately tested before they are rolled out to the public as each and every case may represent a traumatised individual.  Appropriate consideration for the victims of these damaging behaviours is vital.<\/p><p> Resourcing availability of information is another key focus of the work under way and the Irish Theatre Institute has been working on developing a new website which will incorporate elements of all five recommendations, and will have relevant resources and information available, including sectoral codes of behaviour, policy documents and other toolkits for artists and arts organisations.  It will also have an online register whereby organisations can formally sign up to the code of behaviour and publicly declare their commitment to its implementation.  This should help to build awareness and transparency across the sector.<\/p><p> Screen Ireland is collaborating with the Arts Council to develop bystander intervention training, which should be ready to roll out next month.  Screen Ireland is also developing a suite of dedicated online training tools for arts organisations, artists and arts workers.  These include self-led training, free of charge, in bullying and harassment and in unconscious bias.  There will be additional bespoke elements for particular areas, for example, intimacy co-ordination for stage and screen.  It is intended that these will be self-led.  It is planned that the basic self-led modules, such as bullying and harassment, will ultimately become compulsory for workers in all organisations receiving grant funding from the Arts Council and Screen Ireland.  The Arts Council and Screen Ireland are also introducing a new condition of funding for all recipients of grant funding whereby they must confirm that they have taken all necessary actions over complaints of poor behaviour on behalf of a board member or staff members.<\/p><p> In the meantime, I continue to engage with stakeholders and all interested groups, as do officials in my Department.  I have had many meetings that have been helpful to me and, in particular, I recall Fair Pl&eacute; telling me that I was the first Minister to engage with it.  Most recently, I had a very constructive meeting with members of Safe Arts of Ireland, some of whom gave evidence to this committee.  I assured them that I would continue work to implement Speak Up: A Call for Change and would keep them updated in the coming weeks and months.<\/p><p> I am pleased that the committee has taken a strong interest in this issue and am happy to take questions from members.

The code will include the following broad key principles: zero tolerance of the seven damaging behaviours, along with policies and procedures to maintain the code; published procedures for accepting complaints of damaging behaviour from individuals while protecting them from reprisal or retaliation; timely investigation and resolution of complaints of damaging behaviour; and awareness-raising of unacceptable behaviour in the workplace and roll-out of training using free training resources, ultimately to all workers in the organisation.  In due course it will be expected that all organisations that receive or hope to receive funding from the State will adopt the code of behaviours.

To begin, I will take this opportunity to address our passengers directly and to apologise unreservedly to everyone who was impacted by the challenges at Dublin Airport last weekend.  That experience jars with our tradition of providing a positive passenger experience for our passengers.  While the past number of weeks have been challenging, I fully appreciate that what our passengers experienced at the airport last weekend fell extremely short of our desired standards.  I appreciate the anger, frustration and upset that this has caused.  Put simply, we failed in our duty to our passengers and I offer my deep apologies to everyone impacted and, indeed, to Members of the Oireachtas, as I also recognise the reputational damage to our country, for which connectivity and ease of access are our lifeblood.<\/p> <p>  I also assure passengers who were affected by last weekend&rsquo;s queues that they will not be left out of pocket.  These challenges were not of passengers&rsquo; making in any way, and we will work closely with everyone impacted to make sure that they are not impacted financially.  If passengers were affected by last weekend&rsquo;s events, I ask them to complete the online form on our website at dublinairport.com or email customerexperience@dublinairport.com and we will ensure speedy recompense.<\/p> <p>  I also take a moment at the outset of today&rsquo;s meeting to acknowledge the incredible efforts of all DAA&rsquo;s employees, during what has been a hugely challenging time.  Our people, and the members of the committee know this, are fiercely proud of our organisation.  Their commitment and their efforts have been outstanding, particularly over recent weeks and months. <\/p> <p>  However, I appreciate that apologies are not what people are most interested in today.  The committee and the public will be very keen to understand, and the Chairman asked me about this, first, exactly how these challenges have arisen and, second, the immediate steps we are taking as a business to address them and to ensure that last Sunday&rsquo;s events will not be repeated.  There are three factors which have led to the current situation, which I have outlined in detail in my statement.<\/p><p>I would like to briefly state the following for the record.  The unexpectedly rapid rise in passenger numbers affecting the global aviation industry, the significant challenges in recruitment, particularly in security screening as a result of the new European Union's enhanced background checks and the absence due to Covid-19 at the start of the year combined had a significant impact on the business and created very significant queues for our passengers on 27 March, following which we implemented a significant work programme to address these challenges.  First, since recruitment began in 2021, we have now recruited more than 300 new airport search unit officers, with 150 officers recruited since the end of April 2022 alone.  We will bring another 70 officers on board over the coming weeks.  The Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, has set no upward limit on recruitment numbers.  However, given the absolute criticality of security training, the process of on-boarding these new staff cannot be rushed.  While we are making significant progress, it will take us another month before we get the full complement of additional trained security officers deployed on the floor of the airport.  We have deployed a company-wide task force of office-based staff and senior management.  This includes more than 400 people, who have now worked over 2,000 shifts and over 8,500 hours in support of our front-line team.  All of my team here have done multiple 3 a.m. starts in the airport over the previous months.<\/p><p> We have also introduced overtime and incentives for our security staff, secured additional external queue management resources and introduced a very wide range of process improvements, passenger experiences and communications initiatives.  I wrote to you, Chairman, as recently as last Friday on the positive progress we have been achieving across a whole range of key areas, which have led to an improved service level.  Until last weekend, 94% of all departing passengers travelling through the airport had cleared security in 45 minutes or less during May, while almost 80% had cleared security in 30 minutes or less.  However, the fact remains that we have been, and are still, managing a resource gap as we pivot from losses of nearly &euro;1 million per day and 1,000 redundancies during the Covid-19 pandemic, to a dramatic recovery of air travel which has been faster and earlier than anyone could have predicted.<\/p><p> In parallel with our substantial recruitment and resourcing up process, set to deliver a further increase in processing capacity this month and next month,  we have been operating to a plan, albeit one that is predicated on very fine margins, and the Herculean efforts of our staff.  Reflecting on last weekend, Friday saw a similar number of passengers as Sunday pass through Dublin Airport, and travel on Friday was without incident and without undue delay.  On Sunday, that plan failed.  Let me explain why and also why I have confidence in our updated plan.<\/p><p> On Sunday last, we had rostered and resourced staff to meet the demands of serving 50,000 departing passengers across both terminals one and two, with 200 security officers and a further 24 team supervisors and co-ordinators on duty.  This would have allowed us to open sufficient security lanes and X-ray machines to cater for the first wave of departing passengers.  However, on that day, we were 37 officers down.  Some 17 of these officers were new recruits who were on our rostering system and it was anticipated they would have completed training to allow them to work last Sunday but, in fact, they had not yet been certified.  This anomaly in our processes has since been resolved.  Some 17 recruits were not there but who should have been there.  It was a process issue and we have since fixed that.  We also incurred a loss of 20 officers that were absent from work on that day.<\/p><p> Many of those 37 staff have particular clearances and certifications required to open and operate a lane.  They cannot be readily substituted by other DAA staff.  Without this capacity, we were unable to bring in substitute staff at short notice in the early hours of Sunday morning.  This compounded the queueing problem throughout much of Sunday.  The impact of this reduction in our anticipated team meant that we were unable to open six security lanes, three in each terminal, which was a loss of 30% capacity in the first wave.  Each lane ordinarily screens about 200 passengers per hour and being down six lanes, we had a processing deficit of 1,200 passengers an hour.  We were unable to achieve our anticipated productivity and this quickly led to queues forming in security.  As more and more passengers joined the growing queues for the available security lanes, the situation became compounded.  This led to a decision at 10.30 a.m. to advise those passengers queueing outside the terminal with flights departing before noon that they would not make their flights.<\/p><p> This leads me to what will be a very different bank holiday weekend and into the extremely busy summer months of June, July and August ahead.  We are focusing on passenger experience improvements across three core areas, while also introducing new escalation and triage mechanisms in the event of any unanticipated issues arising.  We have submitted a detailed plan to the committee that is focused on a better passenger experience around a number of key areas: maximising the availability of staff resources, increasing the number of security lanes open at peak times and improving queue management.  There is a detailed plan which hopefully at a later stage in this session, I will be able to take the committee through.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022060100002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dalton Philips","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":2120,"content":"<p>You might give a quick outline for the public.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022060100002#B00200","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654038000,"counter":2121,"content":"<p>I will go to our passenger advice first as I think passengers are very keen to understand that.  Our advice to passengers due to fly out of Dublin Airport over the coming period is to arrive at the airport at least two and a half hours before the departure of a short-haul flight to Europe and the UK, and at least three and a half hours for long-haul flights.  At times, when the terminal gets particularly busy, be it this weekend or into the future, we will triage access to the terminals and only allow departing passengers into the departure level who have a flight departing within two and a half hours to short-haul destinations and three and a half hours to long-haul destinations.  Passengers who arrive too early for their flights - that is, if we need to invoke the triage - will be asked to wait in a dedicated passenger holding area outside of the terminal, with special considerations being given those passengers who require special assistance and those important fliers with autism, etc.  Access to the appropriate terminal for departing passengers will be controlled and will require the presentation of documentation indicating the time of flight, such as a booking confirmation or boarding card.<\/p> <p>  DAA will put in place bad weather-cover, seating and toilets in the holding area as quickly as possible in the coming days, following trials of this system over the June bank holiday weekend.  We do not anticipate it will be needed this weekend but this is what we will be building for the summer, and we can go into more detail.  Following these incremental measures, we are confident that we have a robust plan and we do not envisage a repeat of what occurred last Sunday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022060100002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dalton Philips"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":2122,"content":"<p>Can you give a summary of your plan in terms of extra staff, so that the public will know what is being put in place?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022060100002#B00400","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654038000,"counter":2123,"content":"<p>Although challenges remain, the measures we have taken will very substantially mitigate the risk of this weekend and beyond.

We had a very difficult Sunday and we let many of our passengers down.

We will have a number of activities in place to ensure that people can have confidence that they will make their flights.  We have an operations and safety plan in place.  Clearly, safety has to be the number one issue - getting people safely onto the flights.  We will have a strong communication plan around the two and half hours and the three and a half hours.  Challenges remain but we continue to operate a very tight operation with finite margin for error.  A significant programme of work is ongoing by our dedicated people to bring the operation back to the standards our customers should be able to expect.  We want all of our passengers to have a positive experience travelling into and out of Dublin Airport.  As the summer season ramps up, we will continue to drive improvements in our overall service offering to this end.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022060100002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dalton Philips","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":2125,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Philips.

That is our key bottleneck and having those officers up, even though it is only three to six of them, depending on the day, makes a material difference.  We have also gone out to other airports, both regionally in Ireland and internationally.  I have put this out to the EU to try to get security officers over here.  We need to recertify them but that can be done quickly.  The problem is that all the other airports are scrambling for these workers.

Where will people with reduced mobility be able to access the airport?  Will they be able to drive right up and be dropped at the door?  Will they have to queue or make extra arrangements?  The DAA has brought in new staff and will be bringing in more.  The figures Mr. Philips mentioned were a 10% increase in staff and 40 new security people and I ask that they be briefed fully.  It is very difficult when you get new staff in.  When staff have been there for a long time they know the ropes and they know what to do but new staff can be overenthusiastic and the DAA needs to be careful of that.

To have such a critical error that led to such consequences, financial for the DAA and disruption for everybody else.  It is not the person who made the mistake but the box in which it was made.  It is the chain of command.  It would be helpful if the witnesses explained this matter a bit better and if not then at least come back to us.

To me, that is a fairly obvious option and I do not understand why cordons were not deployed quicker.  My query goes back to the process, and ensuring there are checks and balances.  The DAA conducts risk profiling, risk analysis and risk planning.  For example, when a suspect package is found then people must be moved from the area.  Has the DAA thought through its processes?  There was nobody to process people but there are other things that cause chaos from time to time at an airport.  It does not seem to me that the DAA had something to deploy and that people were trained to cope with various scenarios no different from a fire drill in this building.  We know when a fire drill happens here that there are people in each corridor to tell us what to do and we follow their advice.

The Deputy is absolutely right that the DAA is a critical piece of State infrastructure.  We are a semi-State body but we are also a commercial entity.

We have a credit rating and need to protect our financial profile so we can continue to access capital markets on a go-forward basis.<\/p> <p>  When this crisis hit, it became evident that the aviation industry was one of the most significantly impacted industries.  As the months and weeks passed, it also became clear that this crisis was going to impact us for a significant amount of time.  Mr. Philips has on a number of occasions referenced the fact that all the industry analysts throughout the course of the two years that the pandemic impacted us suggested we would not be back at 35 million passengers until 2024 and 2025.  To be clear, we had a payroll cost at the end of 2019 of &euro;20 million per month, with 3,000 domestic staff to service 35 million passengers.  The employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, and temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS, supports were approximately &euro;4 million of that.  Our staff took pay cuts which amounted to approximately &euro;2 million or &euro;3 million per month.  We were able to remediate our &euro;20 million per month payroll costs by reducing them to approximately &euro;9 million per month.  We absolutely needed to do that or we would have been losing &euro;1 million per day for those two years.  That would have categorically damaged our financial profile for the next number of years.

We have heard a lot of discussion about the contracts and I know people who have applied for the jobs that are available.  Our guests have told us that the contracts guarantee an employee 20 hours per week, possibly 40 hours per week, and staff are required to be on stand-by.  The DAA is restricting itself when it comes to recruitment.  For instance, somebody in Tipperary might apply for a job at the airport, be given 20 hours per week and told they are on stand-by for another 20 hours.  That means the person must get from the midlands to the airport at short notice.  The DAA must go back to having a permanent, fully trained, qualified and professional staff who can expedite proceedings.  It has been too reliant on casual staff.

It is important we get across that the last thing the DAA wants is to offer our colleagues contracts that would not allow people to have a decent standard of living and some certainty with regard to when and how they work.  I can understand how people see those types of contracts that typically exist in the retail sector but they do not operate the same way in the aviation sector.  The vast majority of our employees are permanent, full-time employees, particularly in this area where 75% of the airport search unit, ASU, officers work what are called static rosters, which mean there is no fluctuation in the number of hours they work or when they work them.  They have absolute certainty in that regard.<\/p> <p>  In the model we have brought in as a result of Covid-19, 25% of people are on a flexible pool roster and will work between 20 and 40 hours per week.  They get 30 days notice of a 30-day roster.  It is 60 days before there is any change to people's rosters.  I can tell the committee that the DAA has no intention to go down the road of bringing in casual contracts of employment.  It is not in our interests because retention would be an issue.  We have issues around Garda clearance and training.  It is not at all in our interests to have turnover of employees.

I will conclude by saying two things.  I thank the DAA representatives.  I apologise but I have another meeting.  Dublin Airport is a strategically important State asset, facility and service.  It should have been classified accordingly.  I believe, and Mr. Philips, to be fair, is right that nobody foresaw what was happening because I have gone through the newspapers and articles.  Around the world there are issues with aviation, so those who claim to have a knowledge that it was going to happen, I am sorry but they did not.  I stand over that in this room.  It is not acceptable that on a continual basis some people have said today they want to redeploy staff from Cork Airport to Dublin.  We must not cut the capacity of Cork Airport or indeed Shannon Airport because it is critical the capacity of Cork, which is under the DAA's watch, is kept to its fullest.  On another day, there needs to be a re-emphasising and a re-accentuating of Government aviation policy and the airlines.  The DAA, Government and the airports have a role to play because 85% of our travelling public are coming in and out of Dublin Airport and that is far too high.<\/p> <p>  I conclude by wishing Mr. Philips well in his new move.  Today is a disappointing day for him and his staff here are doing their best.  I thank the staff on the front line last Sunday.  I had people ringing me at 6 a.m. in the morning and I thought they were imagining it or making it up.  They were not, unfortunately.

As one of the few Dublin-based members of the committee present, I can say that Dublin Airport is not just an asset for Dublin; it is an asset for the whole country.  I believe that 87% of national aviation traffic goes through Dublin Airport.  When something goes wrong, it reflects badly on the DAA, on Dublin and on Ireland.  Ultimately, we become a bit of a laughing stock.  I know that is the last thing that the DAA wants to happen, and the last thing we want to happen.  The DAA is a 100% State-owned company.  It is giving ammunition to people who say that the State cannot run things.  I do not want that ammunition to exist.  Suffice to say, the service has not been satisfactory in any way, as the witnesses have admitted.  People presumably missed not just holidays, but also weddings and funerals.  It is just not acceptable that people are missing flights.<\/p> <p>  I have a few short questions not just on the issue of delays, but also on the general passenger experience through Dublin Airport at the moment.

The more we generate commercially, the lower, essentially, the net cost for our aviation customers in terms of airport charges.  In theory, that operates as a virtuous circle.  The more efficient and commercially driven the organisation is, the more benefit that ultimately goes to the travelling public in terms of lower costs for using the airport.  Obviously, that model has been disrupted through the pandemic, as have all of the bases in which it was set.  That included a 23% reduction in our capability to generate aeronautical revenues in the most recent determination.  We are now going through a new process to reset all of those bars and we have made a submission to the regulator to say that, for example, when the much lower traffic base we are operating on and the much higher operating costs in many cases, particularly in the context of payroll costs and energy,  are taken into account, that should generate a change in the parameters that were used the last time and generate an increase in that charge.

I thank the committee for the opportunity to give an update today on the future of the post office network.  I am joined today by principal officer, Ms Jenny O'Hora from the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications.<\/p> <p>  Colleagues will be aware that An Post is a commercial State body with a mandate to act commercially.  It has a statutory responsibility for the State's postal service and for the post office network.<\/p><p>Postmasters are independent SMEs contracted by An Post to run post offices and the Department does not have a direct relationship or contract with them.  They are not State employees, nor are they employees of An Post.  As such, they are not paid a fixed salary.  Their income is derived on a fee-per-transaction basis.<\/p><p> The agreement reached between An Post and the Irish Postmasters' Union, IPU, in 2018, which was supported by 80% of the IPU's membership, has underpinned significant change and investment to redefine the post office network, including reducing the number of post offices, modernising the postmaster contract and an acceptance that new business lines were required, along with capital investment in the network.  This is a vital part of the delivery of An Post's strategic plan.  To implement the plan, the cost of which was estimated to be in the region of &euro;150 million, the Government provided a long-term low-interest loan of &euro;30 million to the company in December 2017 to support and protect the renewal of the post office network and the continued fulfilment of a five days per week mail delivery service.<\/p><p> As set out in the programme for Government, we are committed to a sustainable An Post and post office network as a key component of the economic and social infrastructure of Ireland.  I have met the chairperson and the chief executive of An Post.  They fully understand the Government's position.  I have met the IPU three times.  I addressed its annual conference last October and will do so again on 4 June.<\/p><p> The Government recognises the importance of a high-value and high-quality post office network to our citizens across the country as well as the central and trusted role of postmasters in our communities.  The network's social value was particularly evident during the pandemic and the demonstrated commitment of staff and management to supporting our communities, in particular the elderly and vulnerable, has been commendable.  Through its network of 900 post offices, An Post continued to provide key Government services to citizens, including through its existing commercial contracts with the Department of Social Protection and the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA.<\/p><p> The financial challenges facing postmasters are well documented and arise mainly from the decline in mail volumes and the move to electronic transactions in both mail and the post office network.  The pandemic has exacerbated these challenges and impacted the transformation programme for the network.  In recognition of this and the significant role played by postmasters during the pandemic, I worked with An Post and introduced the pandemic relief fund in 2021, which was worth &euro;8.5 million over an 18-month period.  This commenced on 1 July 2021 and will continue until the end of this year.  The fund aims to incentivise new business by increasing product commissions while also incorporating an element of protection for business declines due to the pandemic.  In addition, An Post undertook to invest &euro;400,000 over an 18-month period in postmaster training to help equip postmasters with the skills and information they need to maximise the business going through their post offices.<\/p><p> I recognise that there are genuine concerns around the future of the post office network and a potential cliff edge scenario where significant numbers of postmasters choose to retire at around the same time in late June or early July.  This could see citizens losing their local post offices as well as the wealth of services available to them through those offices.<\/p><p> I am pleased to advise the committee that, as announced yesterday, I secured approval this week for a proposal that will see a funding intervention by the Government of &euro;10 million per annum over a three-year fixed term from 2023 to 2025, to be distributed by An Post to the post office network.  This is the first time that the Government has agreed to introduce such a package.  It will help to support a sustainable, nationwide post office network in line with the commitment in the programme for Government.  It also aims to ensure access to important services of social value across the post office network and that there is a network of sufficient scale in place for the public to access these services across the country.  It also provides clarity for postmasters in terms of any decision that they may need to make about their future.  It will be disbursed in a manner that seeks to mitigate the genuine financial challenges faced by many of our post offices while acknowledging the need for continued commerciality and modernisation, as has been the company's strategic goal for the network in line with its agreement with the IPU.<\/p><p> An Post is a strong commercial semi-State and its strategy seeks to build on its growth and diversification.  The network is one of the company's core strengths and the continued development of the network and its services is a vital component of its sustainability.  An Post will continue to seek and win new business actively and to explore opportunities to develop new or enhanced product lines for the post office network.  I understand there are a number of initiatives under active consideration by the company.<\/p><p> The Government is committed to working with An Post and postmasters to ensure that the network continues to play a strong role in delivering State services.  The Government will continue to engage on the issue to ensure that we can protect and safeguard the network in line with the programme for Government commitment.  The one-off nature of this intervention seeks to copper-fasten the transformation under way and incentivise a network of strong, commercially focused enterprises.<\/p><p> Decisions regarding retirement or closure are ones for each of the independent postmasters to take.  The Government's intervention does not mean that some post offices will not close due to retirement or personal decisions, only that they should not close due to lack of Government support.  It is the Government's intention to avoid those decisions being necessary on foot of economic hardship.  The Government hopes that closures will decelerate in order to facilitate initiatives by the company to take off and bear fruit, permit time to assess the findings of census 2022 and whether demographic changes might change the trajectory of rural businesses, and allow for the transformation programme to conclude and new commercial practices to be adopted.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for affording me this opportunity to address it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022060100002#W00300","speaker":"1578","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":2907,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for attending our meeting.

The number one target here was to ensure our post office network is intact.  If anyone wants to retire for personal reasons, which I think was one of the Deputy's later questions, it will be his or her decision.  If somebody wants to take up the postmaster role it will be advertised again.  We are all very aware in our own constituencies of post offices where somebody retires and when the role is advertised it is not picked up because it is not viable.  This unprecedented package gives postmasters certainty.  Talking to one or two, they are now not going to retire, knowing this package is in place.  This is for their communities.  It is about what this does for our local communities so they have access to those critical public services.

However, we have to look at providing offline services not just within the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications or in the Department of Transport.  We are looking, for example, at motor tax and the potential around that.  Likewise, the Revenue and the Department of Social Protection are looking at other services.  This financial package is giving the breathing space and the time for all of Government to look at what potential offline services could be provided.  That is in line with our Town Centre First policy as well.  That relates to the interdepartmental group, so this is a whole-of-government approach to try to identify this.

I was down home in Clare last night and met a group of postmasters.  It was the latest in a sequence of meetings I have had.  There was the IPU and Mr. Tom O'Callaghan of the Independent Postmasters Group and I was just getting a gauge from the small and the large postmasters on what they are facing and the challenges, and trying to take the pulse of the whole thing.<\/p> <p>  Today is historic because this is Government committing funding it never has before to the network.  It is important to acknowledge that.  It is also important to say the genesis of the problems facing the network lies in the slow dismantling of that once-famous S52 contract.  It was very much a fit-for-purpose contract.  As the Minister of State said a moment ago, postmasters do not receive a salary.  They are paid on a transactional basis.  The old S52 contract ensured if you went in for a social welfare payment or whatever transaction, the larger post office received a little bit less in transaction payments.  It was positive discrimination to put more money into the smaller rural post office.  Cumulatively across the year, and across many years, that ensured the network as a whole remained viable.  What was on offer a few years ago was a brand new contract.  Some jumped at it.  I think there are now 440 remaining on that old S52 contract.  Some of them are struggling but they see a future.  However, the 560 or so that moved onto the brand new contract are in trouble.  Today's announcement is positive.  It throws a lifeline but they will continue to be in trouble unless there is a whole suite of new transactions and services that breathes viability into those post offices and puts money in their pockets.  From the outset, Mr. O'Callaghan, the IPU and all individual postmasters looked for money and for subvention but were very clear that alone would not be enough.<\/p> <p>  I have a number of questions.  The first is the postmasters sought &euro;12 million, so why &euro;10 million and not &euro;12 million.  I want to qualify that as well because last week the IPU was upstairs here briefing Deputies and its representatives said for every &euro;1 million less than the &euro;12 million, 100 post offices were put at risk, so why &euro;10 million and not &euro;12 million?  I would like an answer to that first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022060100002#Y01300","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":2924,"content":"<p>I have answered that previously with Deputy O'Rourke.  Again, this was work on foot of information coming from An Post, working with officials in my Department, the  Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and economists to look at quantifying the social value.  It is important to say as well the pandemic relief fund is an &euro;8.5 million fund over 18 months.  What I am announcing this week is a &euro;10 million fund every 12 months.  It is significantly more than what postmasters are currently receiving from the pandemic relief fund, which runs out at the end of the year.  It is very important to say getting this unprecedented package for postmasters in place is no small feat.<\/p><p>We want to give them the space to attract more business and incentivise them to drive more business through the post office network.  That is through banking and all of the other services but to work with An Post to drive that business.  An Post is providing training and supports to postmasters and postmistresses.<\/p><p> Today, I want to call on the public to use their local post office.  We have all attended public meetings across the country to talk about the survival of local post offices but there is an obligation on people.  People value their post office but they need to use it as well and this funding gives post offices a timeline or a breather in which to drive new business.

My dad does not use a laptop or a smartphone but he is one of those people who drives to his local post office on a Thursday to collect his pension.  Let us be ageist.  The Minister of State and I are of a similar age and I probably only go to a post office to buy stamps or post a parcel.  We need to find a way to get way more people in through the doors of post offices and not just people who are drawing down pension or social welfare payments or people who post a parcel once or twice a year.  We need to see an awful lot more offline services available in post offices too.  The postmasters have made some suggestions to the Minister of State and they made some suggestions to me when I met them in County Clare last night.  The payment of college fees is possible through bank and student services but that is not possible yet through post offices.  Now, when a woman in paid employment goes on maternity leave her maternity payment goes through the bank only but the children's allowance can be paid through banks or a post office.  That is another situation that could be changed by ministerial order.<\/p> <p>  The passport issue has become a debacle.  It was insulting to the post office network that the Passport Express service was renamed last week.  A pay per passport was always something good.  The application was always something good and rapid but it is not like that anymore.  The postmasters have said that they have undertaken a huge amount of anti-money laundering work for the last number of years without being compensated.  What more can be done?  A sum of &euro;10 million is good but it does not bring them up to the full sustainable level of &euro;60 million per annum and postmasters will need a lot more.

I have asked people, both younger and older, how often they use and are in post offices and what they were there for.

The alternative was that we could have had that service process through the post offices.<\/p> <p>  Perhaps there are other systems, such as social welfare payments and identity issues to ensure there are is not fraudulent activity and so forth, even if these payments are being made directly to back accounts, where recipients may have to come in, present themselves, and show that they are available for work, etc.  What exactly is the Minister of State talking about in respect of these services?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022060100002#AA02100","speaker":"1696"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":2969,"content":"<p>Taking the Department of Transport, for example, motor tax is one area we will be looking at in providing that revenue.

That is why that as part of that interdepartmental group this needs to be a whole-of-government approach.  It is not for me to certainly say that within the Department of Transport we can look at these services.

I sincerely thank the Minister of State for what she has achieved.  In 2016, when I was the Opposition spokesperson on this issue, I and others, through engagement with the Irish Postmasters Union, An Post and others, produced a paper which circulated as Fianna F&aacute;il policy.  It spoke about the provision of a public service obligation.  The genesis of that was a methodology for providing funding to post offices that were not viable, with the intent of ensuring they would remain open to provide a service that was needed but which was not viable because not enough people were using it.  People had moved to digital platforms and that is continuing.  The paper recognised that people in a certain age cohort were never going to change and go onto the digital platform and stated a belief that they were still entitled to that service regardless of whether others had adopted a digital platform.  There was certain resistance in the Government at the time.  I am pleased today to see the culmination of that work and the Minister of State's input into it along the way.  I am very thankful to her and her departmental officials for seeing the merit of it.<\/p> <p>  There is no doubt that this is a battle that was hard won, and I have no doubt that the Minister of State encountered resistance in different quarters.  During that time, I and others have continued to engage with various Departments and particularly the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which took some convincing.  I am pleased that has happened.  The Minister was certainly on board at an early stage.  With a push from the Minister of State she has succeeded in getting officials to a point of understanding the benefit that a post office means for rural Ireland.  It is actually greater than just the service that it provides or the number of people to whom it provides it.  I have used the phrase previously, but the harp over the door of the post office has a significance.  It says to other businesses and people who live in the community that the State still has a value in this gathering, collective or community.<\/p> <p>  I could quibble over the &euro;10 million or &euro;12 million, but that would undermine the massive achievement that has been made.  Next year, when the Minister of State returns to the committee, and I hope she is still in office, we can argue the toss about whether it is &euro;11 million, &euro;12 million, &euro;13 million or &euro;14 million, but I do not want to take from what she has achieved.  Knowing the resistance that would have existed within the bowels of the greater government, the Minister of State has achieved an amazing amount.  I talk regularly to Mr. Ned O'Hara.  I have great respect for him and his team in the IPU, who really value and recognise what has been achieved here.  Mr. O'Hara has been a pioneer.  There have been detractors who have gone their own way.  They have not amounted to much.  There are people who seek to undermine the work of the IPU.  I believe that is wrong and negative in the extreme.<\/p> <p>  There are issues around services that need to be addressed.  We will look at that in another piece of work.  People are throwing in ideas, and I have heard for years about Sparkassen banks and community banks.  There is a failure to recognise the work of the credit union movement.  In Germany, there are various banking systems.  It is entirely different.  It has community banks, but we do not have community banks.  That is not the solution in the short term.  If we go to a community banking model, how long will that take?  It will take a lifetime.  What we want is a recognition that the State values post offices, and it is always the case that if one values something, one must be prepared to pay for it.  The Minister of State has achieved that, and well done to her.<\/p> <p>  I have ongoing engagement with postmasters.  Again, I do not want to quibble about the details, but I will make a point.  An Post has done very well under David McRedmond, who has a phenomenal team around him.  He has shown great leadership and a great vision.  He has turned the company around.  I recall when I was in that role in 2016, and the Minister of State and I have discussed this, that the then Minister, Deputy Naughten, called me at midnight one night to tell me he was taking a memorandum to the Cabinet the next day that was going to increase the price of a stamp to &euro;1, such was the perilous state of the finances of An Post.  That is only a few years ago and that has changed because of the work of David McRedmond and his team.  The only suggestion I have for this is that the &euro;10 million be spread among the postmasters rather than the post offices that fall within the ownership of the company.  They will be well able to manage the viability issue or lack of viability if such exists.  I appeal to the Minister of State that in the disbursal of that &euro;10 million she limit it to those post offices that are on contract to postmasters.  That may help to resolve the &euro;2 million gap between where the IPU is and where the Minister of State is.  I do not expect a direct response on this, nor am I posing it for such.<\/p> <p>  I acknowledge the work Ms Jenny O'Hora does.  What she does is well known and recognised.  It is a huge achievement for her, the Minister of State and the Department to have moved the dial so much in what is being done, because the State does not take decisions like this lightly.

We all spoke about the disaster, from a reputational point of view, that was Sunday at Dublin Airport.  Beyond that, we discussed the impact it had on individuals who missed their flights.  Upwards of 1,400 people were affected.  It was an absolute shambles and there were chaotic sights.  We have seen the four-point plan that has been published.  We realise that staffing is an issue, without getting into the ins and outs of the number of staff who have been laid off.  During the meeting we tried to raise some issues with Mr. Dalton Philips.  I accept that the Minister of State's engagement with him has been significantly greater than the interaction we have had with him.  We want to know if there are any resources that can be brought to bear on the situation beyond those which the DAA is engaging at the moment?  We understand the difficulties involved in getting staff cleared to work in particular parts of the airport.

A couple of things have not been mentioned so far today, including the immediate ability of post office franchisees to develop additional transaction revenue.  A previous proposal was for post offices to be able to print all government forms.  Rather than people needing to go to the local authority office or request forms from the tax office, they could go to the post office where they can be printed from PDFs.  The post offices have access to every form the government produces and they could charge a transaction fee of 50 cent or something like that based on a PPS number.  That is a social service that could be provided really quickly.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State spoke about An Post linking in with the banking sector.  There is already an agreement between bankers and An Post.  The problem is the transaction fee is very low.  However, that model could be replicated for KBC and Ulster Bank which are exiting the market.  We know that will not be without pain.  Perhaps An Post could get in the middle of that bun fight, for lack of a better term, to provide services.  It is obvious that the banks acquiring those assets are having considerable difficulty subsuming those accounts into their banking systems.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State mentioned motor tax a number of times.  People in local authorities always tell me how pressed they are for staffing.  In the D&aacute;il today we were shouting about not having enough staff to process disability grant applications and yet we have people retained in motor tax departments throughout the country.  Surely that is something that could be expedited.  I know the Minister of State spoke about a whole-of-government approach.  Can the Department of Transport not move responsibility for motor tax into the post office network straight away?

It was opportune, given what happened  at Dublin Airport over the past weekend.  As she is probably aware, a media probe in recent days reported that it seems private investment of approximately &euro;8 million has been secured for Waterford Airport.  Local authority funding of &euro;2 million is additional to the Government's previous commitment to provide &euro;5 million for the development of the runway extension and ancillary buildings at the airport.  This will allow Boeing 737s and Airbus A340s to land there for the first time.  The visit of the Minister of State was welcome, but I would like to hear very shortly that once shareholder agreement is hopefully reached and an application is submitted, the Department will be ready to go.  I ask that this money not be tied up as part of a public procurement piece in terms of development.  I request that it be given to Waterford Airport in the form of grant moneys and that the airport will be able to spend it as it wants, as was the case with national aviation funding that was paid directly to Kerry Airport last year in the form of subvention funding.  Otherwise, we will be caught up in a plethora of public procurement issues and difficulties.<\/p> <p>  The cost of building the runway extension has increased by nearly &euro;2 million since it was first mooted approximately 18 months ago.  Potentially, it might increase again.  The people of Waterford and the south east and I will be expecting that the Government will provide for any shortfall and that no one will come back and state that the estimate for the cost of the runway extension has gone beyond the envelop that was previously discussed.  I remind the Minister of State that &euro;160 million was put into a national aviation package more than two years ago and that Waterford Airport was completely bypassed in that regard.  The stopgap funding that was being paid up to 2019 was also withdrawn.<\/p> <p>  What has happened at Dublin Airport has shown for the first time that our aviation policy is flawed.  Too much traffic is going through Dublin.  We are trying to build capacity in one place, and we are not looking after the regional airports such as Waterford, Cork, Shannon and potentially Sligo and Ireland West Airport Knock.  I ask the Minister of State to have a serious review of this matter.  It is stated in the programme for Government that it is the Government's intention that circumstances in the south-east region will improve and that Waterford will be the driving economic power there.  In order to have a functioning region, we need to have a functioning airport.  That is long past due.<\/p> <p>  The retention of rescue services in the south-east region is also very important.  I was glad to hear the Minister of State reiterate that Waterford will remain a 24-7 base in the new configuration.  It is very important that we move on to the next step.  We have been too long waiting for this to happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022060100002#GG00300","speaker":"1616"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":3034,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Shanahan.  It was a very positive visit to Waterford Airport and to celebrate 20 years of the search and rescue service there.  To reiterate what I said when I visited the airport, the commitment from the Government to help fund a runway there still stands.  There are conditions around that, of which everyone is aware, regarding a proposal coming from Waterford Airport in respect of private investors.  We await the outcome of that.  Developments in that regard sound positive on the basis of the Deputy's account.  As he is aware, we have to go through the public spending code, as does every project.  This is public money.  I await the proposal, and I look forward to that for Waterford Airport.<\/p> <p>  The continuation of search and rescue services in Waterford is critical.  We have seen the value of it.  The event I attended was a wonderful occasion to mark the Trojan work, dedication and commitment of all those involved in search and rescue and all the volunteers, and, of course, to remember those who lost their lives in the act of rescuing or being rescued.

I congratulate the Minister of State on her strong engagement with us, as politicians.  I pay tribute to the Irish Postmasters Union and to Ned O'Hara, who engaged with us a very constructive way.  I also pay tribute to the postmasters in County Clare with whom I engaged when they came to my office.<\/p> <p>  What is being done is ground-breaking.  It is the first time the Government has invested directly in the post office network.  It is a realisation that the post office is much more than just a service.  I understand that more services will come on stream as a result of this injection of moneys.  The report from the interdepartmental group is yet to be published.

It is important that we get the message out to people that they need to use their post offices in order to support the network as we roll out services.  An Post, which is an independent, commercial, semi-State company, has a strategy and a mandate to ensure that there is increased services and that it helps the post office network to get these services on board.  That is its role.  Representatives from An Post will come before the committee in the next few weeks.  It is important that the committee asks them about the company's plans to support the services and to help postmasters and the network to grow.<\/p> <p>  The interdepartmental group was looking at offline services and what different Departments could provide in regard to such services.  It was clear to me when I became Minister of State that that alone was not going to keep the network of 900 post offices throughout the country open.  That is why we needed this financial support.  In the meantime, we need to look at taking a cross-Government approach in order to identify potential offline services that An Post would bid for.  They would be put out to public procurement, and it would be up to different agencies to pitch for them.  This is why it is important that when An Post comes before the committee, members talk about the importance of it bidding for these potential services in order that, according to its mandate and strategy, it will help to grow the network.<\/p> <p>  The Department of Transport has identified motor tax as a potential service that could be provided.  The Revenue Commissioners have also outlined a number of services to be looked at.<\/p><p>These are being fleshed out the moment.<\/p><p> The Department of Social Protection is also considering some services.  This needs to be driven by the Government rather than just the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  This is the problem.  We have a Town Centre First strategy, which I know the Deputy is very aware of because he comes from a rural constituency.  How do we ensure that our villages and towns thrive?  The post office will be a key part of that but we need to make sure that every single Department is looking at potential offline services.  Online services should also be considered.  It is part of An Post's remit to look at online services.  It is important that we work across Government in that regard.  It is a work in progress.  This is giving the post offices and the postmasters breathing space.  An Post has a very significant role to play here because it is part of its mandate and strategy to ensure the network grows.  We had the census recently.  That will shed new light on where people are living and on remote working.  Many people have gone back to their home towns and home villages.  New light will be shed on the services that people now require in their local areas and where these services are required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022060100002#GG00600","speaker":"1578","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":3038,"content":"<p>That update is really positive.  The role postmasters, postmistresses and all of those involved with the post office network played during the Covid pandemic was clear for everyone to see.  As we emerge from the pandemic, this injection of money is really welcome.  It gives postmasters and postmistresses certainty for the future.  They can plan and look forward to developing their businesses and their services further.  It is very encouraging to hear the Minister of State say that the State will be there.  She is not just saying it.  She has managed to put this package together and she deserves great credit for doing so.  It is fantastic.  I have no doubt that she had many a battle in many a room with many officials and other Ministers.  A great deal of credit is due to her on this.  Well done.<\/p> <p>  I will move on to the Minister of State's other area of responsibility, that of aviation.  We had a long meeting in committee room 2 with the DAA earlier.  I will not go over it, but I have heard the Minister of State's comments in recent days.  I know she is trying to do the best she can as Minister of State with responsibility for aviation.  It has been a problem of mismanagement in the airport.  Mr. Dalton Philips assured us today that the DAA hopes to have plans and resources in place to deal with the numbers it expects to go through the airport this weekend.  This issue exposes the frailties in our national aviation policy.  Some 87% of passengers are funnelled through Dublin Airport, which is a really sad indictment of our national aviation policy.<\/p> <p>  Last week, Mr. Conal Henry, the recently appointed chairperson of the Shannon Group, came before this committee.  He was put forward for the job by the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan.  He got a ringing endorsement from the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications.  In the course of his interaction with us, he pinpointed amendment of the national aviation policy as a key ambition of his as chairperson of the Shannon Group.  He pointed out that there is one really dominant airport and four others that fight over the remaining 13% of traffic.  That is not sustainable on an island of our size.  The Minister of State will understand the economic importance of an airport to a region.  I represent County Clare, Shannon, the mid-west region and the western seaboard.  It is just critically important.  Some 40% of foreign direct investment, FDI, companies are based in the Shannon region.  They need connectivity, whether to mainland Europe, the US or anywhere else in the world.  They need that.  One of the primary reasons many of those companies set up in the region is that connectivity.<\/p> <p>  We should consider the investment Government has made in Shannon Airport, even in recent years.  The committee visited the airport and looked at the new scanning system it has.  Some &euro;4.6 million was invested in that equipment, which means that, having gone through pre-clearance for the US, people can now go through just one security check.  Passengers travelling through Dublin have to go through two, and that airport's equipment is not up to date.<\/p> <p>  It is easy to make the case that it would make more sense to have more people flying to and from Ireland through Shannon, as was previously the case with the stopover.  We need, by means of a national aviation policy, to encourage airlines to provide for that.  We also need key hub connectivity through the airport, especially in this post-Brexit era.  We have connectivity to Heathrow, which is very welcome, but prior to the pandemic it was planned to have connectivity to Paris.  There was also a Lufthansa service to Frankfurt but this is not back on track yet.  I know Government has given money directly to airlines to fly and to re-establish routes, which is very welcome.  I hope that will happen but we really do need a fair slice of the cake to enable airports outside of Dublin to take the pressure off Dublin Airport.  It cannot all be about one really dominant airport.  We need to spread it out.  National aviation policy should be brought in line with key Government policies like Project Ireland 2040.  The aviation policy is in total variance with that.  It is also at variance with the regional economic strategies, which the Minister of State will be familiar with.  We need to recognise airports like Shannon Airport as economic drivers.<\/p> <p>  In some ways, the airports are like the post offices, which the Minister of State is after sorting out.  They should be looked at in that way.  They are more than just airports.  They are of regional importance.  They are also of importance to the country in providing a counterbalance to Dublin.  The events in Dublin over recent days tell us that everything is being funnelled through Dublin because of existing policy, which needs to be amended.  Deputy Shanahan mentioned the need to amend national aviation policy as well.  I have no doubt that Deputy O'Donnell will also do so.  The Minister has confirmed to me on the floor of the D&aacute;il that he is committed to reviewing aviation policy.  When will that happen?  For me, it cannot happen quickly enough.  It must also involve consultation with stakeholders in the regions and throughout Ireland.  This could result in a win-win for everyone.  We can have a sustainable network of airports which all have specialties.  I was talking about Shannon Airport and American transatlantic traffic.  The airport could major in that.  There could be something for Cork, Knock and Waterford as well.  We need to cut up that cake in a more equitable way so that we all benefit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022060100002#HH00200","speaker":"1517"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":3039,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his comments about An Post.

You do not have to take anything out of your bag, not even your laptop or phone.  It is a very swift and easy route to travel.  As the Deputy will know, we included Shannon Airport in the regional airports programme because of the Covid pandemic and the concern I had to ensure that Shannon, and Cork for that matter, would be in a position to rebound coming out of the pandemic.  That is why they were included in the regional airports programme for the first time.  There is also a marketing fund available for the Shannon Group, which was also doing a really good job before the Covid pandemic.<\/p><p>With Ms Mary Considine, the CEO, and the new chair, Mr. Conal Henry, the group has a dynamic team who are up for driving more connectivity to the mid-west.

The review of the national aviation policy started in 2020 just before the pandemic.  A pause was put on the review and rightly so because we had to deal with the pandemic.  The thinking, which was correct, was that we needed to wait until the pandemic ended to see how aviation would settle, what the travel patterns would be and whether people would travel for business again.  The census will also feed into the review.

Will the Minister of State assure me that it will continue receiving this critical revenue until such time as it reaches at least 3 million passengers?  She is the Minister of State who allocated the money and she can see the good use that it has been put to, for example, installing important security equipment, baggage haulage facilities and so on that make it easier to get through the airport.  The public might not see all of that, but significant amounts of money have been invested in Shannon, much of it directly by the Shannon Group.  For the first time, we are receiving money under the regional airports programme.  It is being put to good use.  We are in competition with the likes of Dublin, so it is not an even playing field.

We must ensure that we maintain Shannon Airport and that it thrives and develops as we come out of the pandemic.

The postmasters must give six months' notice to An Post if they decide to retire.  Many of them will want to make a decision at the end of June.  It is extremely important that the Department give some outline as to how the scheme will work and, generally, the level of payments that will be involved.  The last thing we want is for there to be any degree of uncertainty as to how much they will get.  There may be postmasters deciding to relinquish their positions at the end of June and they will go for the safe bet of retirement.  That is not what we want.  I know this is a really tall ask, but I ask that a serious body of work be done between now and the end of the month to give a general outline.<\/p><p>I am not expecting it to be the finer detail but, generally, the postmasters would be aware of the level of support they get from the State.  I know it is a tall ask but they have to give six months' notice and 30 June is the date.  I am sure the Minister of State is familiar with that.  It is very important so we might follow up on that.  Overall, it is a very good news story.<\/p><p> It is important that people would understand that the &euro;8.5 million is over 18 months and the &euro;10 million is over 12 months.  I cannot say enough for the post office network.  I remember many years ago hearing a certain businessman speaking about setting up a business in Ireland and he said the network is where the cost is.  We have to harness An Post as a community service with its network.  There are several points.  When the driving licence comes up for renewal, could An Post tender for that?  We have to find other elements and have a national perspective to bolster what it does.  It has gone into banking and I believe there is huge scope to promote this area.<\/p><p> The committee might follow up with the Minister of State to get some flesh on the bones prior to the end of June.  I suspect the Irish Postmasters&rsquo; Union and its members will be very interested in that, particularly given the pandemic payment has been a huge factor with them in terms of support.  I very much welcome that and commend the Minister of State on the great work she has done in this regard.<\/p><p> It would be remiss of me, given Deputy Naughton&rsquo;s role as Minister of State with responsibility for aviation and international travel, not to make reference to our meeting with the DAA today.

There are a number of factors and we would ask the Minister of State to follow up on that.  If the weather is bad, there can be people queueing outside T1 and T2 in the rain, which is unacceptable for us as a committee.  We ask the Minister of State to follow-up.  We made it quite clear to Dalton Philips, the CEO, and his colleagues in the management team that that cannot take place.  It is unacceptable in this day and age that people need to do that.<\/p> <p>  Second, those in the DAA appear to have very little wriggle room in terms of the available manpower.  They were given additional manpower of 40 people but 30 of those will be trainees, three are coming from Cork and seven are part of an internal reallocation.  They were down 37 during the weekend, with 17 of those due to a monumental management cock-up with regard to trainees who were not certified but who were included in the roster, and there were 20 absentees on the Sunday.  To get through this weekend is very important.  There are many things that we welcome.  They are opening a lot more lanes and there will be 12 lanes at peak times, and they have the 40 staff.  However, they do not appear to have any contingency in terms of staff on call, which is a worry for the committee.<\/p> <p>  The rain is a huge factor and it needs to be quickly nailed down.  They need to find some way to ensure that if it is raining, people are inside.  It is not acceptable that people are outside.  We ask that when people are queueing, they would give out water and look after people with food, which was not happening last weekend.<\/p> <p>  We ask the Minister of State to keep a serious eye on what is happening.  We have said to them that we will look to bring them back in again by the end of June.  They expect that, by that time, they will have all of the 167 additional security checkers in place for the summer schedule.  It is very regrettable what happened last weekend.  We can talk about this all we want but the bottom line is that there was a cock-up in the rostering and that was a management failure, pure and simple.  It should not have happened.  There will be absentees.  Our only concern is that there is very little headroom in terms of staff.  If they get fair weather and the 40 are there, it looks like they will get through with a pinch, but it is something that we need to keep an eye on.<\/p> <p>  I assume the State stands ready so that if there is a need for further supports in any form and things happen over the next couple days, the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, the Minister, Deputy Ryan, and the Government stand ready to provide support.  I do not believe it is tolerable for any member or any customer, and the general public will not put up with what happened last week if there is a repeat of it this weekend.   Whatever needs to be done will have to be done.  Is the Minister of State committed to that area?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022060100002#MM00300","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":3113,"content":"<p>I reiterate that this can never happen again.  I have had daily meetings with the DAA and I met with the chair of the DAA and with the SIPTU trade union because I know staff are under huge pressure there at the moment.  I agree with the Chairman in regard to ensuring that passengers are not outside in the rain and that cover has to be provided for them, and I am categoric on that.  Yes, those in the DAA are under pressure with staffing, particularly security staffing, which requires experience, specialised training and expertise in that area.  What they really need to do is communicate with the public and reassure the travelling public that people will be able to make their flights safely and with ease of access.  There may be some queueing but people will be moved through as quickly as possible.  For anything they need to do now, they need to start doing it in order to ramp up their resources.  If that means going out to a private company to help them with managing queues and to relieve their own staff on those duties, that needs to be done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022060100002#MM00400","speaker":"1578"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":3114,"content":"<p>We have asked them to be proactive.
