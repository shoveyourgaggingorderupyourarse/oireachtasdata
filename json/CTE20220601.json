The purpose of the Bill is to consolidate and update legislative provisions regulating the main types of consumer contract.  It also gives effect to EU Directive 2019\/770 on certain aspects concerning contracts for the supply of digital content and digital services; EU Directive 2019\/771 on certain aspects concerning contracts for the sale of goods; and to the main provisions of EU Directive 2019\/2161 on the better enforcement and modernisation of Union consumer protection rules.  <\/p> <p>  I welcome Deputy Troy, Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, who is accompanied by his officials.  <\/p> <p>  Groupings are applied to amendments as follows: amendments Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, and amendments Nos. 8 to 18, inclusive;  amendments Nos. 4 and 121; amendments Nos. 5 to 7, inclusive;  amendments Nos. 19, 20 and 23 to 30, inclusive; amendments Nos. 35 to 50, inclusive; amendments Nos. 52 to 54, inclusive; amendments Nos. 56 to 59, inclusive; amendments Nos.66 to 69, inclusive;  amendments Nos. 71 to 85, inclusive;  amendments Nos. 87 to 99, inclusive;  amendments Nos.105, 106, 109 to 120, inclusive; amendments Nos. 123 to 141, inclusive; amendments Nos. 150 to 155, inclusive, and amendment No. 163;  amendments Nos. 21 and 122;  amendments Nos. 31 to 34, inclusive;  amendments Nos. 60 to 65, inclusive and amendment No. 86; amendments Nos. 100 to 103, inclusive;  amendments Nos. 143 to 149, inclusive; and amendments Nos. 156 to 162, inclusive.

The Consumer Rights Bill is a long and complex piece of legislation that transposes three EU directives and updates existing domestic consumer rights law.  The purpose of the Bill is to reform, modernise and consolidate consumer protection legislation by bringing existing provisions together in a single enactment while introducing enhanced consumer protection measures.  The Bill will give effect to the following three consumer rights directives: directive 2019\/770 on certain aspects concerning contracts for the supply of digital content and digital services; directive 2019\/771 on certain aspects concerning contracts for the sale of goods; and the main provisions of directive 2019\/2161 on the better enforcement and modernisation of Union consumer protection rules.<\/p> <p>  This Bill marks an important step forward in consumer protection as it has the safeguarding of consumer rights at its heart.  It will be good for traders in that it puts responsible behaviour on a legislative footing and evens the playing field for all, so that traders who do not treat customers fairly and honestly will be held accountable and will not gain an unfair competitive advantage.<\/p> <p>  Since publication, small errors have emerged, as well as places where more precision or clearer language should be used.  The vast majority of Government amendments put forward today are to address these technical issues.  It is important we deal with these grammatical, technical and clarifying amendments to ensure the legislation is as accurate and robust as it can be.  There are some slightly more substantive amendments being introduced and I will give further explanation of those as we reach them.<\/p> <p>  I indicated on Second Stage that I would bring forward certain amendments aimed at ensuring the powers of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, and the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, are sufficient for the additional functions they will have as a result of the Bill.  I also intend to bring a technical amendment on the definition of \"basic rate\" in relation to charges for communications by telephone to bring it into line with a ruling of the European Court of Justice.  As these amendments require further development, I put it on notice that I intend to bring them forward on Report Stage.<\/p> <p>  I also stated on Second Stage that I would bring forward an amendment to section 459 of the Companies Act 2014.  However, this amendment is still being finalised.  It is therefore my intention to bring forward this amendment on Report Stage.  The purpose of the amendment will be to clarify the role of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform when holding on trust the unclaimed properties of dissenting shareholders who have not sought to claim the properties in the seven years following an acquisition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022060100002#B00300","speaker":"1596"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":10,"content":"<p>As the Minister of State has outlined, there is a huge number of amendments, specifically 162, but many of them are technical, relating to small errors, typos, better wording, etc.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022060100002#B00400","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1654038000,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Section 1 agreed to.  <br \/><br \/>SECTION  2<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":12,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, and 8 to 18, inclusive, are related and may be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022060100002#B00600","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 15, line 5, after &ldquo;contract&rdquo; &rdquo; to insert &ldquo;(other than in Part 5)  <\/blockquote> <p>These amendments are straightforward.  They are technical amendments aimed at clarifying the meaning of &quot;sales contract&quot;.  The definition of that term in section 2(1) states it &quot;has the meaning assigned to it by <i>section 11(1)<\/i>&quot;.  However, while the main definition of sales contract is in section 11(1), section 10(1) states that the term includes:<\/p> <blockquote> \t(a) a contract concluded between one part-owner and another, and<br \/><br \/>(b) a contract for the sale of goods to be produced or manufactured by the trader, including goods made to the consumer&rsquo;s specifications. <\/blockquote> <p>As a result, the cross-reference to section 11(1) in the definition of &quot;sales contract&quot; in section 2(1) is too narrow.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 refer to minor technical changes.  Amendment No. 3 deletes the term &quot;or supply&quot; from section 2(4), which states: &quot;A reference in this Act to the sale or supply of goods includes a reference to the transfer of, or an undertaking to transfer, the ownership of those goods.&quot;  The reference to the supply of goods in the subsection is incorrect and should be deleted as the supply of goods is generally understood to encompass transactions, such as hire purchase agreements, under which ownership of the goods will not or may not be transferred.  Amendment No. 8 removes the provision in section 10 which states what a sales contract includes.  Amendment No. 9 makes a minor technical change.  Amendment No. 10 follows amendment No. 8 in that it transfers the provision which describes what a sales contract includes into section 11. <\/p><p>Section 12 is subject to a number of clarifying and technical amendments which will ensure accurate transposition of the sale of goods directive Article 3(3) and Article 10(3).  These amendments are not policy-driven.  Amendment No. 11 adds text to section 12(2)(a) to ensure the subsection clarifies that, in line with the requirements of the sale of goods directive, the digital content or digital services element of such contracts comes within the scope of Part 2.  Amendment No. 12 makes a technical change.  Amendment No. 13 is a minor technical amendment, necessary to clarify that the contracts referred to in section 12(2)(b) do not include contracts for the sale of goods with digital elements.  Amendment No. 14 is a typographical correction.  The purpose of amendment No. 15 is to delete section 12(2)(c), which obscures the fact that the contracts referred to are sales contracts, and to replace it with a new subsection (3), to make it clear that contracts for goods with digital elements are to be regarded as sales contracts, irrespective of whether the digital content or service is supplied by the trader or someone else and where the digital content or service is incorporated or interconnected in such a way that its absence would prevent the goods from functioning.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 16 substitutes the word &quot;single&quot; for &quot;sales&quot; to give correct effect to Article 10(3) of the sales directive.  Amendment No. 17 is related to these matters and inserts the word &quot;sales&quot; before the word &quot;contract&quot;.  Amendment No. 18 makes a further minor clarifying change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022060100002#B00700","speaker":"1596"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":14,"content":"<p>Under amendment No. 3, the word \"supply\" is being deleted.

Some of them delete a word and others add a word, while some clarify small typographical mistakes, including cross-references.  They are not policy driven; they are to tidy up the Bill as drafted.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 19 deletes unnecessary language.  Amendment No. 20 gives the consumer the right to all remedies arising from a lack of conformity with the contract, as opposed to only the first-tier remedies of short-term termination of the contract, repair or replacement.  Amendment No. 23 deletes language that is superfluous.  Amendment No. 24 makes a technical change.  Amendments No. 25 to 29, inclusive, correct incorrect cross-references.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 30 makes a minor technical change to delete an irrelevant subsection.  Amendment No. 35 corrects an incorrect cross-reference, as do amendments Nos. 36 to 39, inclusive.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 40 makes a minor grammatical change.  Amendment No. 41 corrects an incorrect cross-reference.  Amendment No. 42 is another straightforward amendment, the purpose of which is to broaden the scope of section 34 to include instances where goods are not in conformity with the sales contract and where the trader otherwise fails to comply with the requirement of Part 2 of the Bill.  Amendments 43 to 45, inclusive, change the wording of paragraphs (d), (e) and (i) of section 39(1) so that the cross-references match the section titles to which they refer.  Amendment No. 46 corrects an incorrect cross-reference, as does amendment No. 47.  Amendment No. 48 clarifies a change to the wording referring to the meaning of \"alternative dispute resolution procedure\".  Amendment No. 49 makes a slight change to the wording of section 41(1) to ensure that the precise transposition of Article 17(2) of the sale of goods directive, which states that the commercial guarantee statement shall be provided to the consumer on a durable medium, at least at the time of the delivery of the goods.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 50 makes a minor technical and clarifying change.  Amendment No. 52 corrects an incorrect cross-reference, as does amendment No. 53.  Amendment No. 54 adds a new subsection (9) to underline that nothing in Part 3 will affect the right to terminate a contract under section 29(2), a new subsection proposed under amendment 31, and section 93(2), both of which cover mixed contracts.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 56 inserts a cross-reference to section 55 to ensure that Article 10 of the digital directive, to which section 57 gives effect, is fully transposed.  Amendment No. 57 gives consumers the right to all remedies arising from a lack of conformity with the contract, as opposed to only the first-tier remedies of short-term termination of the contract, repair or replacement.  Amendment No. 58 inserts a cross-reference to section 55 to ensure that Article 10 of the digital directive, to which section 57 gives full effect, is fully transposed.  Amendment No. 59 deletes superfluous language, as does amendment No. 66.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 67 makes a minor technical change.  Amendment No. 68 deletes superfluous language.  Amendment No. 69 corrects an incorrect cross-reference.  Amendment No. 71 inserts clarifying language to section 69(3) in respect of the obligations of traders.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 72, 74 and 75 change the wording of sections 71(1)(c), 71(1)(h) and 71(1)(i) so the cross-references match the section titles to which they refer.  Amendment No. 73 would insert a cross-reference inadvertently omitted during the drafting process.  Amendment No. 76 is a clarifying change to the wording referring to the meaning of \"alternative dispute resolution procedure\".  Amendment No. 77 corrects an incorrect cross-reference, as do amendments Nos. 78 and 79.  Amendments Nos. 80, 81 and 82 make minor technical changes.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 83 inserts clarifying language in section 88(6) to ensure consumers are liable for any loss or damage suffered by the trader as a result of the failure of the consumer to comply with the obligation under all of subsection (3) or fails to return the goods or material under a type of agreement referred to in subsection (5).  Amendment No. 84 is a minor technical change.  Amendment No. 85 corrects the inadvertent omission of a reference to a reduction in the price as a remedy for consumers.<\/p><p> Amendments Nos. 87, 88 and 89 change the wording of sections 94(1)(b), 94(1)(c) and 94(1)(d) so the cross-references match the section title to which they refer.  Amendment No. 90 inserts a cross-reference inadvertently omitted during the drafting process.  Amendment No. 91 is a clarifying change to the wording referring to the meaning of \"alternative dispute resolution procedure\".  Amendment No. 92 makes a minor technical change, as does amendment No. 93.  Amendments Nos. 94 and 97 are minor technical changes to ensure the application of Part 5 accurately transposes the consumer rights directive with regard to digital content.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 95 is another amendment that seeks to ensure the precise transposition of a directive provision.  Article 2 of the consumer rights directive defines a sales contract as any contract under which the trader transfers or undertakes to transfer the ownership of goods to the consumer and the consumer pays or undertakes to pay the price thereof, including any contract having as its object goods and services.  Amendment No. 96 corrects an incorrect cross-reference.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 98 would insert a new subsection (9) into section 97.  It is proposed the text for this section would be transferred from section 102 as the provisions fit more appropriately into the section setting out the application of Part 5.  Amendment No. 99 corrects an incorrect cross-reference.  Amendment No. 105 is a clarifying measure.  Amendment No. 106 corrects an incorrect cross-reference.  Amendment No. 109 ensures the full title of the Central Bank of Ireland is used consistently across the Bill.  Amendments No. 110, 111 and 112 make minor grammatical corrections.  Amendment No. 113 makes a minor grammatical correction to substitute \"a trader\" with \"the person\" to make the language consistent.  Amendment No. 114 makes a minor grammatical correction.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 115 makes a minor grammatical correction to substitute \"a trader\" with \"the person\" to make language consistent.  Amendment No. 116 makes a minor grammatical correction similar to amendment No. 115.  Amendment No. 117 makes a minor grammatical correction.  Amendment No. 118 again makes a minor grammatical correction to substitute \"a trader\" with \"the person\" to make the language consistent.  Amendment No. 119 makes another minor grammatical change.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 120 is a minor technical change to amendment No. 117 to provide for the summary proceedings under Part 4 to be taken by the Central Bank of Ireland.  Amendment No. 123 renumbers a subsection because of the addition of a new subsection with amendment No. 122.  Amendments Nos. 124, 125, 126, 127 and 128 all make minor grammatical corrections or correct an incorrect cross-reference.  Amendments Nos. 127 and 128 are the amendments in that group that correct an incorrect cross-reference.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 129 is a minor technical amendment to insert a right to terminate a hire-purchase agreement under section 73B(3).  Amendment No. 130 corrects an incorrect cross-reference.  Amendment No. 131 makes a minor grammatical correction.  Amendment No. 132 is a small technical amendment to insert the right to terminate a hire-purchase agreement under section 73B(3).  Amendment No. 133 makes a minor grammatical correction.  Amendment No. 134 corrects an incorrect cross-reference.  Amendment No. 135 is a small technical amendment to insert the right to terminate a hire-purchase agreement under section 73B(3).  Amendment No. 136 makes a minor grammatical correction.  Amendment No. 137 corrects an incorrect cross-reference.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 138 is a minor technical amendment that deletes the reference to a list of provisions and inserts reference to any section 73A to 73H in its place.  Amendment No. 139 deletes the list of provisions as mentioned in amendment No. 138.  Amendment No. 140 is a clarifying change to the wording referring to the meaning of \"alternative dispute resolution procedure\".  Amendment No. 141 makes a minor technical correction, as do amendments Nos. 150, 151, 152, 153 and 154.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 155 makes a minor technical correction to delete in paragraph 3 of Part 2 of Schedule 5 the words \"12 (determination of characteristics of subject matter of contract),\".\", whose inclusion is inappropriate and could be regarded as contrary to the unfair commercial terms directive.  Amendment No. 163 removes the reference to \"certain\" in regard to hire-purchase and consumer hire agreements from the Long Title.  The term is unnecessary and potentially misleading in that it suggests the amendments to the Consumer Credit Act 1995 may not apply to some types of agreements when that is not the case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022060100002#C05600","speaker":"1596","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":71,"content":"<p>There are many amendments in the group.

We are drowning in the detritus of planned obsolescence.  One need only visit a local civic amenity site on a Saturday morning to see piles of electronic waste or look at the number of mobile phones that we all have lying in drawers at home and that are beyond use.  The amendment is grounded in the idea that we protect the right to repair and ensure that we are part of the movement that fights back against the idea that global companies can build planned obsolescence into products.  By passing this amendment, we will fight back against the idea that we should be sold products by some of the world's largest companies knowing full well that they will only last a couple of years.  Having built in that obsolescence, we as consumers should have the right to repair the same products.  I am speaking specifically about smartphones and tablets, but we are also seeing it now in Kindles, coffee machines, large household appliances and the whole panoply of products that are sold to consumers.<\/p><p>The Minister of State will tell us that we should not be moving ahead of prospective EU legislation but, by accepting the amendment, there is an opportunity for him to be radical and for Ireland to become a leader in ensuring that we as consumers build in the right to repair the products sold to us as we see fit, that consumers are not penalised and that the same conglomerates do not go after entities that repurpose or refurbish iPhones or, to keep this generic, smartphones.<\/p><p>My amendment will not be accepted, so I am anticipating that I will be revisiting this matter on Report Stage.  In anticipation of the Minister of State's response, I will not be pressing the amendment, but I wish to keep it on the agenda.  We need to ensure that we fight back.  I am sick of the fact that if I purchase an iPhone, the software architecture of which allows the hardware to work with the Houses of the Oireachtas, email, WhatsApp and all of the other software that we need to survive in the modern world, that piece of kit will last less than five years or, if I am lucky, five years.  Processes and the software start slowing down after two years and the battery cannot be replaced.  There is no means by which someone can continue using the product for which he or she has shelled out considerable amounts of money.<\/p><p>People are sick of the fact that they are sitting on a mountain of this electronic detritus.  They are sick of the fact that phones are locked or bricked, to use that term.  They want to buy products that are recyclable, repairable and designed to last longer, and that is essentially what this amendment, as long winded and all as it is, is about.<\/p><p>I see no reason to say anything else.  I wish to hear what the Minister of State has to say on my amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022060100002#E00500","speaker":"1514"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":82,"content":"<p>I will speak in support of the amendment and encourage the Minister of State to ensure that, if it is not accepted as Deputy Sherlock has indicated, we might see something on this matter on Report Stage.

People often repair their goods, for example, shoes.  If you get a hole in your jacket, you do not say that that is it and the jacket needs to go.  The right to repair, particularly where technology is concerned, is important.  I encourage the Minister of State to consider this matter before Report Stage and devise a suggestion of his own.

The purpose of maximum harmonisation directives is to ensure consistency across the whole of the EU and no member state can introduce new rights in their transposition that would put us out of step with other member states.<\/p> <p>  I wish to inform my colleagues of something, though.  They may already be aware of it but, if not, the European Commission's working party on consumer protection and information is considering a number of proposals to empower consumers to make sustainable consumption decisions.  Once such proposal has a particular emphasis of promoting repair and reuse and will consider harmonising certain aspects of consumer law, promoting repair as the primary remedy for consumers.  Another proposal under deliberation seeks to improve participation by consumers in the circular economy by providing better information on the durability and repairability of certain products.  This involves introducing several requirements, including providing consumers with information on the existence and length of a producer's commercial guarantee of durability for all types of good or on the absence of guarantees in the case of energy-using goods; providing information on the availability of free software updates for all goods with digital elements; and providing information on the repairability of products for all types of good.  This initiative also seeks to protect consumers against unfair commercial practices that prevent sustainable purchases, such as early obsolescence.<\/p> <p>  I would welcome further protection given to consumers around the repairability of electronic equipment and access to maintenance of said equipment.<\/p><p>My officials are actively participating in these working party discussions.  However, as I said, because of the fact that it is a maximum harmonisation, I am advised that there is no discretion in the implementation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022060100002#E00700","speaker":"1596","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":85,"content":"<p>I sometimes feel &ndash; I would have been accused of this in the past as a Minister of State &ndash; that we are perhaps hiding behind EU rules.  However, I think there is an opportunity within the amendment not to fall foul of EU rules, because we are merely giving an additional right to the consumer to have that which they have purchased in good faith to be repaired.  The amendment describes a particular element.  It reads: \"In relation to equipment with an electronic security lock or other security-related function, the manufacturer shall make available to the owner and to independent repair providers, on fair and reasonable terms and through secure data release systems where appropriate, any special documents, tools or parts needed to disable the lock or function, and to reset it, for the purposes of diagnosis, maintenance or repair of the equipment.\"<\/p> <p>I do not see how that is injurious to the rights of the manufacturer in terms of fair competition rules from an EU point of view or maximum harmonisation rules.  Again, I know the Minister of State is frankly not of a mind to accept the amendment.  If I understand the Minister of State correctly, he is sympathetic to what the amendment seeks to do.  However, at a time when we are talking about the circular economy - there is legislation before us on that very issue - I think people are just absolutely fed up with the idea of built-in obsolescence.  I think we have crossed the Rubicon of people&rsquo;s patience around it.  This amendment, in its own small way, seeks to push back against this rampant consumerism.  The Minister of State said he will repair and fix shoe leather and I am of a similar mind.  There is a strong movement around people not necessarily wanting the best, new or shiniest, but wanting to repair, reuse and recycle.  Longevity is a key thing now in terms of products that we purchase.<\/p> <p>  I will withdraw the amendment.  However, I seek to submit it again or have it revisited on Report Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022060100002#F00200","speaker":"1514"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":86,"content":"<p>I appreciate fully what the Deputy said.

Their purpose is to give full and accurate effect to Article 16 of the consumer rights directive, as amended by Article 4(12) of the better enforcement and modernisation directive.  These are small technical changes to clarify the section and do not reflect a policy change.  As some digital service contracts will involve the payment of a price by the consumer while others will not, Article 16(a) provides for different rules for the two forms of contract.  Sections 111(1)(a) to 111(1)(d) of the Bill deal with the application of Chapter 5 to service contracts.  The proposed amendments revise these subsections.  <\/p><p>Amendment No. 100 deletes the current section 111(1)(a) as it is unnecessary given that the provisions contained therein are already provided for in section 97(2)(b).  It replaces this with the text of the current section 111(1)(d).  This is because section 111(1)(d) gives effect to the first of the application provisions in Article 16 of the consumer rights directive.  It is therefore appropriate to transfer the text of section 111(1)(d) to section 111(1)(a).<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 101 and 102 amend section 111(1)(b) to ensure that Chapter 5 does not apply to digital service contracts after the digital service has been fully supplied if the contract does not place the consumer under an obligation to pay the price of the digital service.  This takes account of the fact that, for digital service contracts that do not place the consumer under an obligation to pay the price of a digital service, only the first part of Article 16(a) of the consumer rights directive applies.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 103 replaces the current sections 111(1)(c), 111(1)(e) and 111(1)(f).  The current text of section 111(1)(c) is deleted and replaced to provide that Chapter 5 does not apply to the digital service contract after the digital service has been fully supplied if the contract places the consumer under an obligation to pay the price of the service and supply of the digital service has begun with the consumer's prior expressed consent and acknowledgement that he or she will lose the right to cancel the contract once it has been fully performed by the trader.  This gives effect to both parts of Article 16(a) of the consumer rights directive.  A new section 111(1)(d) is to be inserted to provide that Chapter 5 does not apply to a contract for the supply of digital content not supplied on a tangible medium where the supply of the digital content has begun and the contract does not place the consumer under an obligation to pay the price of the digital content.  This change gives proper effect to Article 16(m) of the consumer rights directive.  <\/p><p>For digital content contracts that place the consumer under an obligation to pay the price of the digital content, Article 16(m) applies in full.  The new section 111(1)(e) provides accordingly that Chapter 5 does not apply to a contract for the supply of digital content not supplied on a tangible medium where the performance of the digital content has begun if the contract places the consumer under an obligation to pay, the consumer has provided prior express consent to the performance of the digital content beginning during the cancellation period and acknowledges that he or she thereby loses the right to cancel the contract and the trader has provided confirmation of the contract in accordance with section 105 or, as the case may be, section 109.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022060100002#H07400","speaker":"1596"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1654038000,"counter":331,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":332,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 101:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 88, line 9, to delete &ldquo;the consumer&mdash;&rdquo;

When we looked at the insurance Bill, we found that it needed a market study because we do not want unintended consequences.  The practice of discounts is widely used by service providers as a way of attracting new customers.  It is an important competitive dynamic, which, among other things, has facilitated new entrants into the market, and we certainly do not want to risk that.  It took some market analysis to get to where we are with the insurance Bill to which I referred a minute ago.

The proposed amendment relates to the handling of consumer complaints and seeks to insert four new sections into the Consumer Protection Act 2007.  The proposed section 66C refers to complaints in the context of subscribers who receive a service from traders where that contract is successively renewed or rolled over.  This definition is relatively broad and, as I said previously, there is a complex landscape here that involves multiple sectoral regulators, most of which already require traders to operate complaints handling processes and provide access to alternative dispute resolution services.  In many instances, this requirement is linked to their licensing agreements.  For example, ComReg provides a complaint handling service called ComReg Connects for broadband, home phone and mobile phone consumer complaints.  Service providers are required to have a code of practice for handling consumer complaints.  Their code should contain all the information customers need to make a complaint, including information on refunds where appropriate.  Service providers have ten working days to resolve complaints, after which time customers can request ComReg&rsquo;s assistance.  Customer complaints that remain unresolved for more than 40 working days can be escalated to ComReg&rsquo;s dispute resolution procedure and ComReg can then adjudicate.  While I see where the Deputy is coming from, I feel there is a duplication in this amendment.  Rather than enhancing the Bill, it would put an onus on another body, the CCPC, where the responsibility for this already rests with sectoral regulators such as ComReg or the CRU.  I do not intend to accept this amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022060100002#K03400","speaker":"1596"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":451,"content":"<p>The justification for the amendment is the lived experience of consumers who take out contracts, with broadband providers in particular.  Often, the consumer purchases a broadband product, such as fibre to the home or a copper line, that is advertised as providing 1 GB but it provides less than that and there are dropouts and blackouts in the service provision.  The consumer might pay &euro;80 for that.  I raised this on Second Stage.  I know there is a withholding arrangement built into the legislation in relation to moneys.  I fully accept that I may not be on the right track here so I have an open mind on this matter.  I am trying to ensure that, where the consumer goes through all the steps with the provider and where it is found that the trader did not adhere fully to the legislation, there is a stick built in whereby the provider will become guilty of an offence.  We have enough anecdotal evidence based on our own experiences as public representatives of services having failed people where there is a contract to supply.  I am open to correction on this but there do not appear to be sufficient penalties built in to ensure manners are put on the providers.  This amendment seeks to provide some remedy for the consumer, as well as some penalty for the provider.  Most people's experiences are positive and that is fully acknowledged.  Establishing a scheme that is unambiguous in its nature will provide a clear charter, for want of a better expression, to the consumer and the provider where there is an absolute understanding of the expectations on the provider or the trader.  That is where I am coming from.  ComReg is overloaded and is not resourced.  Let us call a spade a spade.  We know that so let us acknowledge that.  There are not enough personnel in ComReg and policing these issues has been a perennial problem.  People will be reluctant to withdraw a part of their payment for lack of a service if they do not feel there are enough protections built in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022060100002#K03500","speaker":"1514"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":452,"content":"<p>I would go back to the point that we are giving ComReg the same enforcement powers as the CCPC as part of this Bill.  This amendment is a duplication as it is asking the CCPC to do exactly what ComReg can do.  It will have new and enhanced enforcement powers similar to the CCPC as part of this Bill.  As the Deputy rightly alluded to, this Bill will for the first time give consumers the right to withhold payment for poor service.  However, there is quite clearly a dispute mechanism in place at the moment for broadband, home phone and mobile phone services and that rests with ComReg.  Consumers can make a complaint to the service provider and it has ten days to resolve the complaint.  Where that does not happen, they can refer the matter to ComReg and then there is a process by which it can intervene and escalate the problem.  Heretofore, ComReg did not have the same enforcement powers as the CCPC but it will after the enactment of this Bill.  Why would we give the CCPC a role in this while we are enhancing the powers of ComReg in order to do exactly what it can do?

It is very nice to be back in person after two years.  We value our engagements with the Oireachtas very highly.  These are important opportunities and an important part of our work.  The council is an independent body established under the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012.  Its mandate is to endorse and assess the official macroeconomic forecasts, assess the budgetary projections, assess compliance with the fiscal rules and assess the fiscal stance.  Our focus is on the overall fiscal stance, rather than on individual tax measures or spending items.<\/p> <p>  Yesterday, the council published its 22nd fiscal assessment report.  It is based on the Government&rsquo;s forecasts published in April in the stability programme update, SPU, 2022.  The Irish economy has continued to grow, despite the challenges.  Higher energy and food prices have taken inflation to the highest rate in a generation.  While this will slow growth in 2022, the economy is expected to continue to grow in the years ahead, helped by the high-pay and high-tax sectors.  Nevertheless, developments remain uneven across sectors and higher inflation impacts lower-income households far more than the average or wealthier households.  Risks and uncertainties are also high.  Inflation could remain higher for longer than the SPU assumes and there are downside risks to activity.  We also note with concern that the SPU only projects three years ahead to 2025.  This undermines a medium-term approach and good planning for budgetary policy.  The council strongly recommends a return to five-year-ahead forecasts as was committed to by the Department of Finance and confirmed by the Minister in the past.<\/p> <p>  The budget balance is being boosted by revenues from a faster-than-expected recovery from Covid-19 and continued growth in high-pay, high-tax sectors.  Over the medium term, the budget balance is set to reach a surplus in 2023 and to improve to a surplus of 2.7% of GNI* by 2025.  This should help to put Ireland&rsquo;s debt ratio on a steady downward path to reach 80% of GNI* by 2025, down from 106% of national income in 2021.  However, there are significant pressures on many spending areas.  Some of these are known, others have not been factored into the budgetary plans.  In terms of spending, we broadly know that, first, higher inflation creates significant spending pressures.  The council estimates that each one percentage point increase in inflation in the economy would create pressures on Government spending of approximately &euro;700 million just to stand still if pay, welfare, pensions and the costs of goods and services were fully adjusted to maintain their value in relative terms as prices increase.  We assess that the planned increases in current spending under the Government&rsquo;s 5% spending rule over 2023 to 2025 would not be sufficient if the Government opted to fully maintain existing supports and services in real terms, although for later years the shortfall is relatively small.<\/p><p>This implies that the Government will need to make choices between accommodating price pressures, other changes to spending plans and revenue-raising measures.  Second, there are likely to be temporary costs associated with the war in Ukraine.  Of the &euro;7 billion in contingencies for spending set out in budget 2022 back in October, &euro;2.5 billion remains unallocated.  This may be spent on humanitarian assistance for Ukrainian refugees but it could also be used for further temporary and targeted cost-of-living measures.  Third, the Government plans to ramp up public investment spending to almost 5% of national income by 2025 and keep it at this high level out to the end of the decade.  The increases should help to meet climate change and housing objectives but capacity constraints in the construction sector could see higher costs or lower output for a given price.  Poorer value for money and possible spending overruns could result and a high degree of diligence will be required.  Fourth, many countries are considering raising defence spending in the light of the war in Ukraine.  For Ireland, the report of the Commission on the Defence Forces establishes a range of different scenarios. <\/p><p> However, there are many areas where we are in the dark on the Government&rsquo;s plans.  The Government committed to halving Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse-gas emissions by 2030 but it has not factored in the full costs to the State of achieving this.  Estimates from Mr. John FitzGerald in 2021, in a very useful piece of analysis, put the cost at an additional 1.7% to 2.3% of GNI* on average over the years 2026 to 2030.  The Government has also not costed its planned major healthcare reforms under Sl&aacute;intecare beyond this year and there is no clarity on how much progress has been made to date in terms of the overall cost of the reforms.  The Government has also not responded to the Pensions Commission recommendations on how to address funding shortfalls in the pension system.  Annual spending on pensions is set to rise by about 1.5% to 2% of GNI* by 2030 amid a rapidly ageing population.  The upfront fiscal costs of auto enrolment also need to be built into future budgets, if implemented. <\/p><p> The Government faces a delicate balancing act between supporting the economy and vulnerable households in the face of higher inflation while not contributing to higher inflation through second-round effects.  Sticking to the 5% spending rule, as the Government commits to and as the council welcomes, should help with that objective and with facilitating the debt ratio falling at a steady pace from high levels.  Reducing the debt ratio in line with these plans would be appropriate to help build a buffer so that future shocks, particularly major downturns, could be cushioned by budgetary supports in a similar way to the response during the pandemic.  Following the rule would also help to ensure that spending increases do not lead to excessive stimulus to the economy at the current time and would help avoid the risk of second-round effects on wages and prices potentially destabilising the economy and the public finances.  However, sticking to the rule also highlights the difficult trade-offs that are involved.  The various spending pressures that we have discussed raise significant questions about how they will be accommodated within the Government's spending rule alongside existing policies.  Sticking to the rule could imply reductions in planned spending elsewhere or higher taxes. <\/p><p> In the background to all this, an ongoing concern of the council&rsquo;s is the growing over-reliance on corporation tax to fund everyday public services.  Corporation tax receipts represent nearly one in every four euro of tax revenue raised by the Exchequer and the top-ten paying companies account for more than half of those receipts, up from a quarter in 2008.  The Government does not currently have a strategy to reduce this over-reliance.  The council&rsquo;s assessment is that the Government should clearly show the impact of excess corporation tax receipts on the budget balance, as we do in this report and it should take measures to reduce its reliance on corporation tax.  The council has set out a way to achieve this by making contributions to the rainy day fund or running debt down.  The Exchequer has benefited significantly from corporation tax receipts in recent years which could be considered excess, that is, beyond what is explained by the performance of the domestic economy.  By using these excess receipts to fund ongoing expenditure, the Government has potentially opted not to set aside some &euro;22 billion in a rainy day fund or to reduce net debt by a substantial amount. <\/p><p> I thank members for their attention and look forward to their questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022060100002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":543,"content":"<p>Thank you Mr. Barnes.

First, in terms of the budgetary numbers and temporary measures, there is still space because there are still contingencies that are likely to be available this year, even within the existing budget.  Second, looking ahead, or taking this year and next year together, within the Government's spending rule there would be space to do that.  However, as we have highlighted, there are choices between how far we take measures to deal with the cost-of-living crisis as compared to other policy initiatives the Government might want to take.  The reality is that we are having to pay more for imports of energy and food and if we need to provide more help to some households, that is going to cost extra money.  That needs to be weighed against other potential alternatives.<\/p> <p>  The other way in which there is space, potentially, is that there is some room to do that without over-stimulating the economy.  What is good about targeted measures is that rather than just pumping money in across the board, they give it to those who really need it the most.  Lower income households spend around one third of their income on food and energy so this is a huge shock for people who do not have many savings to fall back on.  For wealthier households, it is a much lower share of their spending and of course, they are in a better starting position as well.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022060100002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":546,"content":"<p>It is good to hear that.

The report refers to about &euro;1 billion worth of interventions since the start of the year up to the publication of the Stability Programme Update, SPU, about 90% of which were untargeted.

The Government can improve that trade off by directing more money towards those who need it most rather than spreading it out more equally.  There is a case for stronger targeting but it is obviously difficult.  Targeting is not an easy thing to do.  We know that poorer houses need to be targeted, as do rural households and older households but even within those groups, not everyone is treated the same.  There is a difficult mix and that is why we do not come down particularly strongly in any particular way, partly because it is not our mandate to look at the exact design of specific measures but also because we recognise it is a difficult thing for the Government to do.

I will, however, make a couple of points in response.<\/p> <p>  A difficult judgment is being faced between temporary and permanent measures.  We do not know how long these price shocks will last.  We are aware that energy prices and food prices can be very volatile.  They may well go up and make the next winter very difficult in Europe.  On the other hand, they could also go down if things work out better than expected.  The Government must think about the balance between temporary measures where we make these once-off payments or time-limited payments, which is mostly what the Government has done, versus these permanent increases in welfare payments that would, essentially, be required to keep their real value over time but would need to reflect the fact that prices may fall.  This is the temporary versus permanent split the Government must think about.<\/p> <p>  The second point is the exact amounts.  It is a very difficult question.  Again, it depends on which instruments the Government wants to use, what combination it wants to use, and to what extent it wants to target.  The important part about targeting is that even just raising welfare rates in line with general inflation probably would not fully compensate the lower income groups who are spending a much higher share of their income and facing a much faster rate of increase than the general population.  That is an important point to bear in mind.  Ultimately, I believe the Government needs to co-ordinate across policies.  IFAC has also suggested co-ordination with the social partners on how the whole package will look.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the amount of fiscal space.  We believe that the Government's spending rule is actually providing useful guidance.  It is forcing the point that there is a choice between how much is ultimately spent on the permanent increases in welfare payments and other things.  We are not taking any view on how that choice should be made.  That is a democratic choice but it is forcing the right kinds of questions to be asked.<\/p> <p>  One very helpful aspect is that the Government seems to be interpreting the rule in terms of the level of spending.  In 2021 there was a big underspend.  If the Government was to lock in that underspend it would create more space to tackle the cost-of-living crisis.  That is one of the very live questions the Government faces.  It probably would not make a lot of sense to try to catch up on that underspend very quickly and then realise there is not enough money to deal with the cost of living.  This is one of the things that gives the Government a bit of marginal manoeuvre. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022060100002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":551,"content":"<p>Large parts of that underspend come in the area of health and recruitment in health, so not trying to catch up causes problems there and accentuates the problems we have.<\/p> <p>  I believe it was the Institute for Fiscal Studies in Britain that analysed Boris Johnson's measures and suggested that they shielded the most vulnerable by giving the types of payments that were made for those on social welfare payments of &pound;650, an additional &pound;150 for those on disability payments, along with a suite of other measures.

Obviously, there is a downside from lower activity but there is an upside from higher inflation.  This is one of the things that compensates it.  Some of those effects would wash out naturally, which means it would increase in line with the economy.  In a sense, therefore, there is not a huge gain there.  A big issue would be the indexation of the income tax system.  We have discussed this before.  The income tax system bands are set in cash terms.  If one keeps the bands fixed and there is inflation, or wage inflation, then more income is going to move into the higher bands and will be taxed more heavily.  Those effects are going to be bigger if wage inflation is higher.  There is a potential upside of something that would raise the average tax rate if those nominal bands were kept in the same place.  The programme for Government commits to indexation in some form.  The Government has factored into its plans a degree of partial indexation, but if one kept that currently planned degree of partial indexation it would not be enough to compensate for the wage inflation that is now expected.  As a consequence of that, one would now expect the average tax rate to increase if those amounts that are currently planned are kept there.  That would tend to improve the public finances as a whole and improve the budget balance, but the Government spending rule does not take revenue into account so it would not have any counterpart on the other side.  This is something we discussed in another box in the report.

The impact of the inflation crisis has been uneven.  Would our guests go even further and say there are winners and losers in this situation?  It is not just that the impact is uneven.  Would it be fair comment that some people are being hammered while others are doing very well?  I would be interested to hear our guests' views on that question.  I note that corporate profits and net household wealth are up.  Somebody is doing well out of all of this and it is certainly not the majority of low- and middle-income households, who are being hit disproportionately hard, as our guests have alluded to.  Even the headline inflation rate does not take into account the hit that low- and middle-income families are taking.<\/p> <p>  I know IFAC does not get into policy suggestions but one possible approach to dealing with this situation is to insulate people's incomes against the impact of inflation and to do that, if I understood what our guests have said, would cost &euro;700 million.  Was that the relevant figure?  The problem is that &euro;700 million would take us over the 5% rule.  I am generally in favour of insulating people's incomes, wages and so on from the impact of inflation.  One approach could be to take money back from those who have benefited from this situation to insulate the losers fully and ensure there are no winners.  The Government's mantra is it cannot fully insulate people against the impacts of inflation.  That is the Government's view.  I do not think that is a statement of fact but is rather a statement of policy.  The Government has decided it is not going to insulate people fully from the impact of inflation because the cost would be too high and perhaps it would take us over the 5% rule.  The Government could do it if it wanted to.  That is a consideration.<\/p> <p>  Another consideration that is never debated is we should ensure there are no winners.  I am not asking our guests to advocate for that position but is it something we might consider as an option?  In the current circumstances, no excess profits should be made because that is not fair when the income of other people is being hit.  That would be a legitimate policy consideration.  Perhaps we might even cap profits.  We always talk about capping wages and a need to limit wage increases, social welfare increases and pension increases because the skies might fall on us if we let them rip.  The possibility we might cap profits, wealth and very high salaries is never considered.  As I said, I am not asking our guests to advocate for that position because I know IFAC does not advocate particular policy measures but is that a legitimate thing to consider in the range of options that is open to the Government?

I guess the tax on that type of car will go up as the cars powered by diesel and petrol leave the roads.  Another area where there is a conflict of interest concerns the context of hyperinflation and the necessity of supporting people on fixed incomes.  We will have to support people who have disabilities.  Additionally, we will have to increase support for those people and not just keep it in line with inflation.  I say that because we can already see from the reports done that people with disabilities have additional costs to bear just to live.  I refer to how we can address this aspect and how we can keep those supports in line with inflation.  Equally, we also have people who are working and contributing to society.  I refer to the cost of travelling to work for the many people with no access to public transport.  Public transport is probably now being subsidised more and that is benefiting some people because of a reduction in rates, while other people who have no access to public transport must use their own vehicles to go to work and are facing greater costs as a result.<\/p> <p>  We can see a differential emerging before our eyes.  How do we balance this situation?  Let us take people who have mortgages as well and consider the rise expected in interest rates and the resultant increase in the costs of mortgages for working people.  How can we best address this type of situation?  Is it through additional tax reliefs to help people to pay their mortgages?  We are trying to do everything for everybody.

The Deputy is right about the cost of supporting vulnerable households.  He has given a good sense of the many challenges existing in society.  The cost of supporting the most vulnerable groups and households, including those with the lowest incomes and those with various challenges in their lives is going to increase and this is what the Government needs to manage.  So far, it has mostly focused on temporary measures that may be warranted because the increase in this regard that has brought about higher energy prices has been relatively recent.  Eventually, over time, it would be natural for welfare rates to increase and for supports to be adjusted in the way referred to.<\/p> <p>  An important point, is that the Government cannot help everyone in this situation.  That would not be a sustainable approach and it would not make sense.  The Government, as we have said, is facing this balancing act between protecting the economy and protecting those groups that are vulnerable and not putting a great deal more money into the economy when inflation is already high and demand is strong.  The best way of doing this is by targeting such protections at those who are the most vulnerable.  A big challenge politically is that a wide section of the population is under some pressure because of these energy and food prices.  It can be hard to target protections in this kind of environment, because some people will not benefit much or at all from Government measures if they are targeted.  It is a challenge for the Government to communicate information on this scenario and then to calibrate its response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022060100002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":591,"content":"<p>Following on from that point, let us take the working person and public sector pay.

Other areas would include raising other forms of taxes or exploring the composition of spending in other respects.  Finding alternative sources of revenue will be important.

I thought it was ironic this morning, at a time when inflation stood at 8.2% in May and there is all this energy insecurity and fuel uncertainty in respect of cost and availability, that the news headlines focused on how we are going to achieve our climate action targets for 2030.  I refer to us being beaten into submission in the context where, whatever else might happen, it is necessary to achieve those targets at whatever cost that may entail.  People were being interviewed and giving their viewpoints on this subject in respect of the full enormity of what this endeavour is going to cost not yet having been realised.  I was thinking of someone having porridge, perhaps choking on hearing those comments this morning, and wondering if these headlines were really coming at this time.<\/p> <p>  I preface all I am saying by stating that I have as much, and maybe more, of a concern about the environment as anybody else.  I am not a climate change denier, but I am a realist.  I live in the real world of representing people, many of whom live in rural locations and must travel to work at enormous cost.  Their children must also be transported to schools.  These people are living in rural locations as they are perfectly entitled to do.  As I have always said, whether people are living in Blackrock, Ballinskelligs, Templenoe or here in any part of the centre of Dublin city, they are entitled to live where they and their families wish to be.<\/p><p> How sensible is it to be in the D&aacute;il one day imposing taxes upon taxes in the name of trying to reduce our carbon emissions while at the same time telling people they have to suck it up?  The Government is also saying we must introduce measures to take the bite out of this harsh financial reality and so far all it has come up with is a reduction in the price of fuel, which actually went up on the two nights previous to the deduction.  It went up more on the Sunday and Monday than it came down on the Tuesday.  There was also the famous &euro;200 in respect of electricity.  I can tell the Government that is well forgotten now because the prices people are paying on their fuel and energy bills are astronomical.  There are also issues around energy insecurity because the Government did not have the gumption to go ahead with an liquefied natural gas facility in the Shannon Estuary.

The core of the issue is that the climate transition is, even without the war in Ukraine, a very complicated and challenging undertaking.  As we have emphasised, it requires a huge re-engineering of our society in many ways.  It is not just about changing the energy mix.  It is a very deep change to the way the economy functions and the way society functions.  On top of that, there is the war in Ukraine.  In some ways, the war has had some of the same effects that meeting emissions targets would have had, in terms of having to change and move away from fossil fuels and things, but it is happening far more quickly and in a far more unstructured way than we had planned.  It underlines the fact that we ultimately need to take a steady approach towards tackling climate change but in the short run there may be some more urgent imperatives, which means some slightly different actions will have to be taken than would otherwise have been the case.<\/p> <p>  What the Deputy said also highlights some of the issues we will face with climate transition.  One issue is higher energy prices, which are today caused by Ukraine but may ultimately be caused by the phasing out of fossil fuels.  How we manage the social aspects of that is important.  Relatively wealthy households are probably in a better position to manage that transition than lower-income households, partly because they spend less of their money on food and energy but also because they have more savings.  They are in a much better position to deal with most problems.  We did not mention this in our earlier answer but the Government needs to start thinking about what the social implications of the climate transition will be in the long term and how it is going to manage that.  That is one of the big fiscal costs.  For example, the evaluation that was done in the Netherlands of the economic impact of their climate change package put a lot of emphasis on the fact the Government was going to have to compensate some groups in society or provide more help for them to transition.  For someone who is relatively wealthy, it may be not so difficult to manage investing in a heat pump and insulation but for someone on a much lower income, undertaking that kind of investment, which will pay back over quite a long period, is going to be much more challenging financially.  The Government has to think about the social implications of that.  Good planning, both on the climate side and with regard to the economic and social implications, will help make the transition as smooth and fair as it can be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022060100002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":603,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022060100002#G00500","speaker":"1487"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":604,"content":"<p>I, too, was trying to use the Internet but it was not working.

I am sure the witnesses are more aware of this than I am but I have noticed a particular issue in the media.  There is one thing that is thrown out there but you almost cannot discuss it.  Deputy Canney referred to wage increases and the impact they will have.  I have noticed that in a lot of commentary, both within the D&aacute;il and in the media, as soon as any kind of increase in wages is mentioned, people say wage prices will spiral and increase inflation.  I would be interested in the witnesses' views on the concept of the wage-price spiral.  Where do we need to be at in order for that to happen?  The factors causing inflation are energy prices and supply chain issues.  A few weeks or months back, there was a graph in the <i>Financial Times<\/i>which showed that since 2020, wages in the eurozone did not really increase so that has not been the cause of inflation.  I would be interested in the witnesses' views on that.  Sometimes we have a very closed conversation nationally on certain topics.  People are struggling.  I have my own views on the matter but I would be interested in what the witnesses have to say.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022060100002#G00600","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654038000,"counter":605,"content":"<p>It is a genuinely complicated question, partly because we have not had inflation like this for a generation.  Many things have changed in between.  We do not really know what it will be like in the current environment or how people will respond.  A lot of it ultimately comes down to human behaviour and expectations and things that are very hard to get to the bottom of.  There are two channels through which wages would be increasing.  As we have seen, since the onset of the pandemic there are labour shortages in some sectors.  That would naturally bid up the wages.  That is more like a conventional overheating but it is relative to some sectors, including construction and areas like that.  A special feature in the Irish case is that there are some sectors linked to the digital and pharmaceutical industries, which have very high wage growth for reasons that are totally unrelated.  It is really to do with global factors.  That is a permanent increase but it means the average wage rate does not mean very much because it is a combination of all sorts of different wage rates at totally different levels and with totally different growth rates.  It is a very hard thing to think about.<\/p><p>We have already produced a note on the matter, but it is something we are thinking about much harder because it is becoming a big reality for the Government.<\/p><p> When people set their wages, they may anticipate a level of inflation and want to be compensated for that.  The question is what level they anticipate.  If they think everyone else is going to raise their wages, and by consequence companies also raise their prices, they will ask for more.  We do not want to be in the environment where everybody is bidding up relative to everyone else because there will just be higher inflation.  That will not really achieve very much and it means there will be higher inflation just to stand still, in a sense.<\/p><p> A big question for Ireland is also what happens relative to other countries.  If other countries in the eurozone have the common currency, we need, in a way, to keep an eye on what is happening in those countries.  If they did not raise their wages very much and we raised ours by a lot, our relative prices would increase by a lot and we would lose competitiveness.  We also need to look at that fairly carefully.<\/p><p> In terms of what this means, as we said earlier, this is an energy price shock and it is imported goods that have increased so we cannot fully compensate that through wages for everyone.

Inflation was incredibly low in the pre-pandemic period, averaging 0.5% per year.  It was already starting to creep up through the end of the pandemic, partly because of a shift from services to goods, which put up some goods prices.  This was exemplified in construction.  We also saw labour shortages and as businesses reopened, some prices were going up.<\/p> <p>  The real driver to these sorts of levels can be clearly seen as the contribution of energy and, to a degree, food prices.  In the months ahead we can probably expect to see it showing more in other prices.  Other items that are not explicitly energy and food contain inputs from the energy sectors and we can see that in the euro area inflation, services are starting to play a bit more of a role.  These are services from areas that are very energy-intensive, such as transport.<\/p> <p>  The big question after that is what will happen next.  The Stability Programme Update 2022 assumes that oil and energy prices will stay at the same level and one would expect those components to disappear and inflation to come back, at some point, towards a more normal level.  The programme update assumes it will go back to approximately 2%, which is the ECB target, although we have not been there for a long time now.  There is much uncertainty around that, including how long the immediate knock-on effects will last.  It partly depends on policy as to whether inflation will really take off or we will get second-round effects, etc.  There is massive uncertainty, but what we see now is very clearly related to energy and food, essentially, along with rents and so on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022060100002#H01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":618,"content":"<p>A vote has been called.<\/p><p>I propose we suspend the meeting for 15 minutes.

There are obviously many risks around that and a lot of things could go wrong.  That could potentially lead to quite a difficult winter in Europe.

A clear lesson is that trying to overdo the response and insulate ourselves from these shocks will lead to higher inflation and second-round effects.  How far those go depends on many things.<\/p> <p>  One thing that has changed significantly is the way monetary policy works.  We now have an independent central bank in the euro area, which one would expect to take this very seriously.  That is one of the reasons interest rates have increased: people expect the ECB to respond and it has indicated it will start to raise interest rates in the next couple of months.  That is different from the picture we had six months ago.  That is one of the forces one would expect to keep inflation down.  The higher it sees inflation going, the stronger it is likely to respond.  That is one reason it would be counterproductive to have excessive across-the-board wage increases.<\/p> <p>  There is a delicate balance for the Government to strike.  There is a legitimate case for protecting the economy in the short run and for helping lower income and more vulnerable households, but a balance has to be struck with not putting too much money into the economy or creating unsustainable wage and price expectations.  It is a difficult balance and there is no magic formula to do it.  In the early days of social partnership, Ireland was able to use different instruments together and co-ordinate different parts of the economy to achieve an outcome.  It is a different situation today but that process worked quite well.  Like many countries, we have not needed those processes to the same extent for a long time.

We need to tackle all these things while maintaining the economy and public finances on a sustainable path.  The Government's 5% rule provides useful guidance in this context, keeping Government spending in line with the underlying potential of the economy.  The flip side of that is that choices have to be made between different things because we cannot keep putting money in the pocket without saying where it will come from.<\/p> <p>  On costs, this high-cost environment highlights the contribution of domestic factors to high inflation or the high cost of living.

That is a case for addressing these issues in a timely way and that is why we highlighted the fact there is as yet no response to the Pensions Commission's proposals.  It is ultimately a political choice.  There are a number of options: raise the pension age, raise contributions or lower benefits.  Those are political choices and I am not taking a view between them.  Probably, given the size of the challenge, you need to do a combination of those things.  The Pensions Commission recommended eventually linking the retirement age to life expectancy, which would help to reduce costs, and fairly significant increases in PRSI contributions.  The Government has to decide which of those channels it will take.<\/p> <p>  There are two driving factors which are important.  One is the population.  People are living longer.  Life expectancy aged 65 is increasing quite a bit.  The time people can expect to spend in retirement is going up and we are having a more generous pension system.  That would stop if we started to index it as the Pensions Commission suggests, but we are making the pension system more generous as we go.  The other factor, which is less well understood, is that the number of people reaching retirement age will increase by 50% between now and 2050.  These big baby boom-type generations are reaching retirement.  That is where most of the cost increase is coming from.  That is why we probably need a combination of the two.  In the Pensions Commission proposals, the life expectancy increase deals with that piece and the tax part deals with the rest.

That shows one can have big temporary stimuli without driving the public finances massively off track though, of course, we accumulated that amount of debt, rather than permanent measures.

Maybe energy prices fall at some point and temporary measures to smooth over that increase may be the appropriate thing to do.  With regard to the VAT cut for the hospitality sector, the council does not look at these kinds of specific measures.  Economists are often quite sceptical about those measures - how much they actually deliver and how much they reduce prices by, as compared to boosting the cash flow of those firms.

It has changed essentially because the economy has recovered much faster.  High inflation tends to reduce that debt ratio.  The other big thing that has changed is the budget balance which now looks much healthier than we thought before.  That is what is putting it on this downward trajectory.  Another thing that has changed which goes in the other direction is that we have seen interest rates go up a lot.  At one point, Ireland was paying zero.  It is now more like 1.5%.  It is a big change at the margin.<\/p> <p>  In the short run, we are relatively well protected because Government debt has been issued at relatively long maturities and the Government is holding quite large cash balances.  That was done for precautionary reasons but it is actually quite a good idea because it has locked in low interest rates.  It has pre-funded that.  The strategy has arguably paid off.  Eventually, however, we will have to roll that debt over and we will go from the situation we will have in the next couple of years where interest costs will fall, because the debt we are issuing is still likely to be at lower interest rates than the debt it is replacing.  That dynamic will go into reverse in the medium term.  The debt outlook has changed quite a lot.  The change has been partly favourable and partly less favourable.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the trajectory, the concern is that debt is still at a relatively high level compared to many countries and compared to what it has been historically.  We have just discussed all the pressures on the cost of living and the risks.  If those risks were to materialise and there was to be a big global recession in which Ireland was be hit badly, we would be in a different situation.  However, in an SPU scenario where we come to growth and inflation comes back under control, the years ahead will actually be quite favourable.  Unemployment will be quite low, the economy will be growing quite fast in real terms and interest rates will still be very low.  I will borrow the phrase about fixing the roof while the sun is still shining.  Those will actually be quite good years.  They are not amazing years but they will be relatively good.  Reducing public debt is a very difficult exercise.  One wants to do it in relatively favourable circumstances such as that.  One does not want to be doing it in a position where the economy is growing much more slowly which, in the long run, may well be what happens in Ireland or where one has major economic problems.  It is very much about taking the opportunities.<\/p> <p>  The policy mistake of most advanced countries over past decades has been not to take the opportunities.  When a country comes out of a recession or a slowdown, there are always problems to deal with.  The country says it will do it, but not now.  The country understands it needs to do it, but it will not do it now.  One sees that the debt goes up during every crisis.  It stabilises after the crisis for a bit and then we have another crisis.  One is basically going up an escalator.  This is really happening because of the failure to take slightly courageous decisions in relatively good times in the economy to get debt down.  If we want to avoid being caught in this trap or being in a situation that is worse where one has to reduce debt against a difficult background, this is why we should make this plan.<\/p> <p>  Of course, if the economy were to go sour, we would need to look at it differently but that is basically the reason that remains a priority despite all of the other challenges.  That is why we think sticking to the 5% rule would be helpful in that context.  Of course, that imposes choices, but it imposes exactly the choices one should be making.

I question that.  I would have thought the lesson in the current situation is we need to invest rapidly in areas which are making us more vulnerable to this inflationary crisis - to insulate ourselves against it rather than thinking about saving up money against the rainy day further down the road.  We should throw enormous amounts of money at education, training and apprenticeships.  We should remove every barrier to educating and training, given that the greatest resource we have is the human beings who live here but who are wasted in their ability and talent to a very large degree because it is made so difficult for them.  Large numbers of people could be contributing but it is made difficult for them to realise their potential and make a contribution.<\/p> <p>  We are seeing it now with all these bottlenecks - I love these economic euphemisms - but we have a lack of apprentices, tradespeople and people trained in areas such as construction, health and education.  It would be far better to take these windfall revenues or what might turn out to be temporary revenues from a relatively small number of multinational companies and really funnel them into an area like that, because that would actually protect us.  Obviously, we need to invest in sustainable energy production in order that we become less vulnerable to international price shocks in that area.<\/p> <p>  We also need a focus on the diversification of Irish agriculture when we consider that food security is becoming an issue again.  We need to rapidly diversify Irish agriculture which would have a very positive environmental spin-off by reducing imports and therefore carbon footprint further down the road.  It would also insulate us to some degree against inflation that is dictated by international market pressures.  These are choices.  There will be a debate potentially about this rainy day fund.  I would be interested to hear Mr. Barnes's response.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the wage thing, the RT&Eacute; website has a headline to the effect that the Minister, Deputy McGrath, says there will be tough negotiations ahead over the public sector pay agreement.  The debate has already started with the suggestion that we cannot give these workers too much to compensate for inflation.  I ask Mr. Barnes to reiterate the figure that he gave, which might be helpful in our debate in the next while.  He mentioned &euro;2 billion for pensions wages and social welfare to keep pace with inflation.  I ask him to tell us what that is based on, because it is an interesting figure.<\/p> <p>  Is there not a danger that if we do not give workers, pensioners and social welfare recipients increases at least in line with inflation, we start to create the conditions for a possible recession as consumer demand begins to fall off?  We know a significant driver of Irish economic growth has been consumer demand.  If ordinary working people just cannot afford to spend and therefore fewer goods and services are purchased, is that not as big a danger?  I take Mr. Barnes's point about not giving money to people who really do not need it or who have benefited and deciding where those thresholds would be is a matter for a serious debate.  However, is there not a big danger that if we start imagining that there could be something really wrong with giving workers pay increases or giving people pension increases to deal with inflation, it could have an equally bad effect in terms of consumer demand?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022060100002#N00800","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654038000,"counter":653,"content":"<p>The Deputy made two very important points.  Obviously, investments in areas such as education, training and agriculture would be very good for the country but they could also be good for the public finances in some sense if they have high returns, that is, by training people so they have higher incomes, which feed back into the tax system, and are less reliant on the welfare system.  Depending on how they are done, all these can, in principle, be helpful to the public finances.  They are also relevant to the public finances for other reasons.  The Government should naturally be thinking about that and the democratic process needs to take a view on it.<\/p> <p>  There may be a case that under certain conditions, some of this could be financed from some of these excess receipts.  However, there are a number of caveats to that.  The case would need to be made very carefully if the Government were planning to do that.  One of those caveats is that many of these things actually involve recurrent spending.  In education spending, for example, there is a new generation every time.<\/p><p>One is locking in recurrent spending and there may also be current expenditure that is related to the capital part.  Funding recurrent spending from a volatile source of revenue that we might lose is risky.  That risk must be carefully considered.<\/p><p> Another point is the overall amount of money put into the economy.  One of the reasons for not putting so much of the corporation tax money into the economy is that it is essentially coming from the outside and is being pumped into the economy.  In an environment where there are risks of inflation and overheating, that is a constraint on how much you can put in.  If it is funded through taxation there is an offset somewhere, in that someone has less money to spend.  If, however, you are just funnelling in external money, that is a recipe for overheating, which may not be sustainable if the tax revenues are not sustainable.  In short, definitely the investment is a source of future prosperity or at least it should be if it is done properly.  How that interacts with the rainy day fund must be very carefully considered with these kinds of receipts because there are risks involved.<\/p><p> On the second part, in terms of wage inflation I wish be clear about the figure that I gave.  It was a figure of approximately &euro;2 billion for operating for the unexpected inflation.  It is the difference between what was projected in the budget and in the stability programme update, SPU.  Inflation has actually been a bit stronger than that so the actual number would be a bit higher.  The number actually includes the State pension, public sector pay, welfare rates and payments on goods and services.  About half of that would be public sector pay.  Of the remaining, one quarter of the title would be pensions.  The welfare and the other parts are actually relatively small compared to that.  This is one of the cases for targeting the number of welfare recipients relative to the size of the economy.  Relative to the population, it is a relatively well-defined group.  That is purely the figures part.<\/p><p> On the economics, the Deputy is right.  This is one of the reasons why we say that when the Government strikes the balance, the reasons for the extra cost of living supports are partly for very vulnerable people or people on low income in general, but it is also to support the economy.  Most people's wages have not gone up in response to the inflation we have seen.  Mostly this is because we do not have a lot of choice as to whether we purchase fuel or food.  When people are having to make choices between that and other things, the other things are the ones that are domestically produced.  For example, people might go out less and they would spend less on all sorts of other domestic activities.  This is why it will slow consumption in the domestic economy.  There is some case to have some increase in wages because of that reason.  Increasing in line with the full value of those pressures for everyone is not a desirable policy because one would be helping everyone, and yet the economy as a whole is being negatively impacted by these higher import prices.  Not everyone can be fully compensated.  That is obviously a very extreme case.  The question is: within that, who is the Government going to compensate and by how much?  There is no simple answer to that.  This judgment must be reached by the political process and by society more widely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022060100002#N00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":655,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Barnes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022060100002#O00200","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":656,"content":"<p>Is everyone happy?

We often discuss how it is extremely important in a functioning democracy to have those key components to allow for different views to be expressed and to allow for people to campaign and engage in the public policy process.  For a number of years, there has been an issue with regard to the definition of \"political purpose\", and how it impacts on civil society organisations.  They argue that it is too wide and that it interferes with and limits the legitimate work of NGOs and civil society groups.  They argue that the basic freedom of individuals and organisations in Ireland to raise funds and campaign on issues that affect them is constrained by the Electoral Act 1997 in ways that violate their constitutional rights and EU law on freedom of assembly and association.  Organisations such as the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, Amnesty International and others have stated that they are effectively banned from seeking funding for some of their work and can potentially be sanctioned for engaging in the public policy process.  There are examples of organisations being taken to court for accepting funding, being threatened with prosecution for raising funds to engage with the public policy process and being forced to limit or end their operations in particular specific areas entirely.  That is not healthy in a democracy.  It is worth noting that the civil society organisations make the point that they are only seeking to have these restrictions removed regarding their day-to-day campaigning work.  They are not seeking any changes with regard to the way they are governed with respect to elections or referendums.  They fully support being governed on those in the same way as anyone else engaging in them.  The amendment seeks to address those concerns.

I am seeking to introduce a more severe penalty for breaches I think could have an inadvertent influence on our democracy, particularly in the case of corporate donations.  We have very strong corporate donation limits.  Compared to the British system, we are leagues ahead in terms of our ethical stance on this issue.  We know that politics is not always about the simple transaction.  It is also about building capacity.  Sometimes, building capacity increases the ability to operate across the island.  That is not about one political party.  It is about any political party that operates in both jurisdictions.  Both amendments are being subvented by the Government amendments.  I am happy to withdraw both of them.<\/p> <p>  I wish to speak to Deputy Cian O'Callaghan's amendment No. 65.  I believe Senator Ruane has done some work in the area.  I have met representatives of ICCL and have spoken in the D&aacute;il in favour of addressing the issues.  It is not as clear a line as is perhaps being put forward.  In essence, there is no ban on civil society groups raising funds, but if they are using the funds for political purposes or purposes that may be seen to be political, there is a limit.  It is the same limit that applies to any of us.  I understand that the same limits that apply to corporate donors also apply to those civil society organisations.  That can result in the drying up of a source of funds that would otherwise be available to such groups in other countries.  I can absolutely see the perspective of the groups.  It is very difficult.  There are campaigns that I would very much like to see receiving that kind of funding.  However, there are other campaigns, such as those from the far right in the US, in respect of which I would not like to see such funding drifting into our political system.  In the same way that we talked about online political advertising, there is a differentiation between the electoral periods and the capacity-building that is often done in advance of a referendum or an election.  There could be civil society groups operating in an overtly political way.  It does not happen in Ireland but it could happen.  Perhaps the Minister of State will accept Deputy O'Callaghan's amendment but I do not think he will.  I ask the Minister of State to look seriously at this area to see how we can resolve some of these day-to-day issues for the civil society groups.  However, if such groups use the funding to build capacity and use that capacity in a political way, they have to be subject to the same limits that apply to any other political activists or influencers during election periods.  That is the point I wish to make.  I am happy to withdraw my amendments.  I ask the Minister of State to consider Deputy O'Callaghan's amendment with the note of caution that I have added.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022060100002#B00400","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":691,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 68 essentially seeks to achieve a similar aim as Deputy Cian O'Callaghan's amendment.

It has been openly talked about in the NGO sector and across society for quite a long time now.

I thank Deputy McAuliffe for withdrawing his amendments.  I am opposing amendments Nos. 65 and 68 on the grounds that, as stated on Second Stage of the Bill on 7 April last, the Government is committed to the electoral commission, when established, undertaking a comprehensive review of the Electoral Act 1997 with a view to making recommendations to address, among other matters, the concerns raised by civil society concerning the definition of \"political purposes\" and its impact on the fundraising activities of certain civil society organisations.  It is my belief that the proposed review could be completed within a relatively short timeframe following the electoral commission&rsquo;s establishment.  Furthermore, given the complex issues provided for in the Electoral Act 1997, it is considered that the carrying out of such a comprehensive review of the Act would deliver an independent, objective, clear and efficient outcome for all affected parties with regard to the entirety of the interrelated provisions in that Act.  Like other Deputies, I have met representatives of the ICCL on a number of occasions to discuss the issue, as well as those of the Coalition for Civil Society Freedom more recently.  There is no doubt that there is a difference of opinion on the issue in terms of trying to achieve the same objective.  That is what we want to do.  There is a concern on the part of the coalition, in respect of the timeline of the establishment of the commission and the review of the 1997 Act, that the review may not be delivered within the lifetime of this Government.  However, we have given a commitment that it will happen very quickly, once the commission is established.  We have given that commitment.  I give a political commitment that we want the issue to be resolved as soon as is practicable, once the commission is established.  I accept the fact that the ICCL and the coalition were not happy with our response.

The points made by Deputy McAuliffe are very fair.  This is an area that requires careful consideration.  Any activity that impacts on the political system must be subject to boundaries and limits.

Having some counterbalance to that from civil society and NGOs can be healthy in a democracy.  We should be aware that large sums and resources are employed by corporate interests all the time to influence political decisions.  We need to be mindful of that.

I fully support the spirit and intention of Deputy O'Callaghan's amendment.  We need to make sure that however this is resolved, it does not create opportunities for other interests to influence our electoral processes or referendums outside the election period.  One of my fears, even with the wording the ICCL originally proposed, was that it did not guard sufficiently against that.  That is the challenge now.  It always gets my back up a little when the threat of unintended consequences is used as a reason for inaction.  This is an issue that has to be resolved but it has to be resolved in a way that does not create other problems.  For example, one could imagine a situation, as happens in other jurisdictions, where all the conditions of this amendment were adequately adhered to but money from economic or political interests, which many of us would strongly oppose, could still be used to finance campaigning activity outside an election period.  That would not necessarily fall foul of any of the conditions in the amendment even though it would impact on the outcome of elections, referendums or even just the legislative process.  Finding that balance is quite tricky.  I support Deputy O'Callaghan on this issue.  We would like the Minister of State to come back to the committee because there is a desire on our side of the House to find a way to resolve this matter that is fair and equitable, and to tackle that imbalance that Deputy O'Callaghan rightly noted.  If the Minister of State was minded to do that, we might be able to get cross-party agreement on the fix for this.  I encourage that approach because I am not sure that what is on the table at the moment achieves that fix.  However, we do not have the advantage of the skills and draftspeople the Department has.

Online political advertising will be prohibited.&rdquo;.  <\/blockquote> <p>I promised yesterday during my contribution on amendment No. 32 that I would not repeat it at the same length today.  I do not want to fall out with the Minister of State on this issue.  Despite all the negotiations I have had with the Department, the contributions made here and during pre-legislative scrutiny and so on, there are a number of questions that have not been answered.  First, there has been no satisfactory explanation as to why we are treating different media outlets differently.  Radio and TV have a prohibition on political advertising and yet we have made a decision in this Bill to facilitate it for online platforms.  There is no explanation or rationale for why we have done that and there should be.  Second, we continue to limit the regulation to the period of the election and not outside it.  Third, we have heard a lot of discussion from the platforms about how they do not want Ireland to have a different set of regulations from other countries, but despite European directives we still do not have scrutiny or sight of that European legislation.<\/p><p>The best way of protecting our democracy is by not permitting online political advertising, in the same way we do for broadcast media, until we have a comprehensive response.  The Minister of State might say this amendment is using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.  Twitter says it does not allow political advertising and the amount of revenue Facebook gets from political advertising is a tiny fraction of the advertising market here in Ireland.  Banning political advertising online will not be a significant loss to those platforms but it would help to protect our market.  There is much discussion about what happens in online political advertising, and some people think other parties are better at it than others, but the real problem is that we do not know what is going on with a lot of the algorithms and microtargeting.  We need to have that level of trust in our democracy.  For all those reasons, I ask the Minister of State to consider accepting this very blunt amendment, and to withdraw sections 120, 121 and 122 from the Bill, in order to prohibit the use of online political advertising until the Minister and the commission can bring forward proposals that would satisfactorily regulate the space.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022060100002#C02500","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":718,"content":"<p>I admire the Deputy's optimism.  I have a few comments.  First, we already have different rules on non-online advertising.  For example, we know we cannot buy radio time or TV time but we can buy newspaper time and in many cases local newspapers would go out of business if it was not for the regular political adverts that are placed by Members of the D&aacute;il, both inside and outside of election time.  Therefore, if there is to be a standardised rule then theoretically it should apply to everybody.  There would not be many Members of the D&aacute;il who would argue that we should not be allowed to advertise in local newspapers.  I am a firm believer that those adverts in local newspapers do not get you a single vote but they keep people in employment and keep newspapers up and running.  Those newspapers have an important function and that is why many of us continue those advertisements.<\/p> <p>  I want to ask the Deputy proposing the amendment to consider the following issue: online advertising is cheap and the ability of people to boost Facebook posts, which could often be organic content rather than sophisticated ads, is something that gives small, non-party and small party candidates access to a way of promoting their work that they otherwise would not have.  I am not in favour of an outright ban on online advertising.  I fully agree with Deputy McAuliffe that the weakness of the regulation of online advertising and platforms is evident in this Bill.  Interestingly, none of the advocates for greater transparency or accountability in social media who came to the committee called for an outright ban.  They had a range of good and interesting policy recommendations on transparency and accountability etc. and the Government would do well to go back to those and reconsider them.  We also have to deal with the issue of spending limits.  While the spending limits do not change inside the election period, there are spending limits outside of it.  It is the same with posters and you will see all sorts of posters going up all over the place three months before the election that are allegedly for political meetings.  Those posters are not for political meetings at all; they are just election posters by another name.<\/p> <p>  I do not support the amendment but I support Deputy McAuliffe's concern that we could have a much more advanced set of regulations for online platforms.  We do not need to wait for the European Union regulations; in fact we should move much further.  There are certain activities like microtargeting that should be illegal inside and outside of the election period.  They should not just be illegal for political campaigning but for any kind of advertising.  It is acceptable when you open a newspaper and there is commercial content that is labelled as an advertisement.  We know about that but nobody knows when they have been microtargeted, regardless of whether it is in the commercial or the political world.  While I do not support the amendment, I support Deputy McAuliffe's call for the Department, the Minister and his colleagues to seriously look at this.  The one message we got clearly from the advocacy experts, who made an important presentation, was that the technology is accelerating at such a speed that not only do we have to play catch-up but we do not even know where things are going.  They made a strong case that the electoral commission should have the ability, in real time, to start to understand and make recommendations to the Government, which could then be acted on quickly by way of regulation to primary legislation.  If we fail to grapple with this now, during elections at some point in the future there will be serious points of contention over our failure to regulate and who has or has not done what on online advertising.  While I do not support the amendment, I support the intention and argument from the Government to come back on this at the earliest possible opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022060100002#D00100","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":719,"content":"<p>I want to support this amendment.

With online political activity, an audience is built up over time.  A lot of that is done by the parties with resources and that includes anyone who is elected, such as a Deputy or another office holder.  They have the resources to be able to build up followers and audiences between elections and that is probably the biggest advantage they have.  There is a legitimate argument that people without those resources being able to do some online advertising can be a counterbalance and that needs to be considered.<\/p> <p>  When we were looking at this in the committee we got strong input from people with expertise saying they did not want a situation where after an election, such as the next election or another one, everyone in the country would be talking about what happened with online campaigning, how that influenced the outcome of the election, how we did not have safeguards in place and how the election was influenced by external forces or whatever.  It would be damaging to confidence in the democratic system if that happened.  I urge that this area gets sufficient attention and that should happen before the election.  The point Deputy &Oacute; Broin made is that they were arguing that the commission needs to be able to react in real time.  If something is happening during an election campaign that most people would consider as out of order and having an undue influence on an election, it must have powers or the ability to take measures then.  It is no good having a review after the election and learning some lessons at that point if people can see that there are things that need to be reacted to immediately.<\/p> <p>  I am not sure that this blunt measure is sufficient but I accept that in the absence of other measures, a blunt one like this has a certain attraction.  What is needed would probably be a much more detailed way of regulating this rather than an outright ban.  I tend to reach for outright bans on things from time to time but in most cases taking a more nuanced and regulated approach is the correct one.  Failing that, if we have no other options then an outright ban might be the best thing to do but it will not capture a lot of it and it will not counterbalance the issue of the resources that people build up between elections, which puts them at an advantage over newer candidates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022060100002#D00300","speaker":"1550"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":721,"content":"<p>As far as I am aware, the EU proposal was sent to this committee for consideration in December.  Is that correct?  There might be an opportunity for the committee to have a discussion on that at some point.<\/p> <p>  I take on board the points that all Deputies have made and there will be a review of Part 4 of the Bill after three years of it operating.  I take the point that Deputies Cian O'Callaghan and &Oacute; Broin have made about reaction in real time.  I am not sure how the commission could play a role in that in the middle of an electoral event, which is the challenge.  The ability of the commission to review electoral events afterwards and make recommendations is a strong and useful one.  It is something that will help in the robustness of the political system and as Deputy &Oacute; Broin has said, this whole space is shifting rapidly and we are consistently trying to catch up with it, which is something we have to be mindful of.  On publication of the Bill, the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, flagged a legislative proposal to protect the integrity of our electoral system and democratic process that has been developed by the Office of the Attorney General.  That is something I was going to flag in my closing comments but it is an added element to consider.<\/p> <p>  I will specifically respond to amendment No. 74 before Deputy &Oacute; Broin comes back in.  Amendment No. 74 proposes to replace section 119, on public information requirements for online political advertisements under this Bill, with an alternative section, which would prohibit online political advertising.  The amendment also proposes to oppose section 120 on obligations on online platforms regarding online political advertisements; section 121 on the identification and verification of buyers; and section 122 on the obligations on buyers regarding online political advertisements.<\/p><p> An interdepartmental group on the security of Ireland's electoral processes and disinformation was established in early 2018 to consider the substantive issues arising from experience in other democratic countries, having regard to the use of social media by external, anonymous or hidden third parties.  Its principal focus was on the risks to the electoral processes, including those arising from disinformation spread via social media and other means.  The interdepartmental group was chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach.  Its membership included representatives from the franchise section of our Department and the then Departments of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Defence, Education and Skills, Foreign Affairs and Trade, Justice and Equality and Public Expenditure and Reform, as well as from the Defence Forces, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the national cybersecurity centre.  The first report from the group was submitted to the Government in July 2018.<\/p><p> Overall, the assessment found that risks to the electoral process in Ireland are relatively low, taking into account the mitigating factors that are already in place.  It was recognised that the spread of disinformation online and the risk of cyberattacks on the electoral system pose more substantial risks.  That is in line with EU findings and recent international experience.  The report's recommendations included a commitment to regulate for transparency in online political advertising.  In this context, a public consultation was announced on 21 September 2018 and a discussion paper that outlined the issues and challenges involved in regulating online political advertising was published as part of the consultative process.  A total of 15 submissions were received by the closing date of 19 October 2018.  The public consultation was followed by an open policy form on the regulation of transparency in online political advertising, held in Dublin Castle in 2018.  The forum was attended by a wide range of representatives from media and political spheres, online companies and the European Commission.  A broad consensus emerged from the forum that there was a need to regulate online political advertisements during electoral periods.<\/p><p> The European Commission has published its Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the transparency and targeting of political advertising on 25 November 2021.  Similar to the provisions in Part 4 of the Bill, the Commission proposal does not propose to prohibit political advertising in any media for reasons that are similar to those I set out earlier.  Indeed, the Commission proposal envisages the introduction of a transparency regime across all forms of advertising media that is broadly reflective of that being introduced under Part 4 in respect of online political advertising.  Given the very detailed provisions that we are introducing under Part 4, we will not accept this amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022060100002#D00400","speaker":"1512","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":723,"content":"<p>I presume, once it is set up, that the commission will have the capacity to employ outside experts to undertake some of this research if it chooses to.

In some ways, this blunt instrument is pulling the emergency brake, protecting our system and forcing the hand of the Government and Commission to implement regulations that would be more nuanced.  This is once-in-a-generation legislation.  One might be sceptical that the necessary protections will be implemented in the short term, when they are needed, for example, in advance of the next electoral cycle.  I urge the Minister of State to liaise with the commission.  I am happy to withdraw the amendment so that we can get the commission set up and it can deal with this.<\/p><p>Deputy &Oacute; Broin talked about the small guy being able to spend a little bit.  I did that too when I was starting off.  When one looks at the advertising libraries, the medium-sized parties, as we call them now, spend vast amounts of money, which will only get bigger as activity increases online.  Unlike any other sort of media, transparency is different.  If I have an advertisement on the front page of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>stating that my priority is older people, that says something to older people, but it also says something to other groups who are not in that category.  One cannot see that transparency online.  Advertising can tell older people they are the priority, tell younger people they are the priority, and tell everybody else that they are the priority.  Politics is about allocation of resources and where one's priorities lie.  That is the difference between online advertising and other media.  The spending is clearly being done by the medium-sized parties, not smaller ones.<\/p><p>My two amendments were ruled out of order.  They dealt with mandatory take-down notices, which would allow the commission to act during an electoral event, and with a code of conduct.

They will impose a new obligation on the leaders of political parties to provide a written statement and an accompanying statutory declaration in respect of each year to the Standards in Public Office Commission stating that all donations from outside of the State, whether in cash or in kind, have been declared and that no other donations, either in cash or in kind, took place.  The amendments insert new requirements into the Electoral Act 1997 in respect of adherence to financial reporting standard, FRS, 102 and the inclusion of all property in the ownership of the political party and its subsidiary organisations when the annual statements of accounts are being prepared.  They also prohibit donations in any form of cryptocurrency and provide a wide range of investigatory and enforcement powers to the Standards in Public Office Commission, as the body currently responsible for regulatory oversight of the Act.  These provisions are modelled on similar powers in the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015, which the Standards in Public Office Commission is already familiar with.  The amendments provide for the inclusion of credit unions in the definition of &ldquo;institution&rdquo;.  This will allow political donations accounts to be opened and maintained within credit unions by the recipients of political donations rather than such accounts being solely confined to banks and building societies.  They also provide for the amounts specified in sections 23C and 48C of that Act to be varied by order, having regard to changes in the consumer price index.  These amounts relate to the donation threshold in respect of which the obligations under the Act apply to third parties.

We are in a unique position on this island because there are two jurisdictions with two different sets of electoral law and laws governing political donations, and a number of parties operate on an all-island basis, including that of the Minister of State, Sinn F&eacute;in, People Before Profit and the Socialist Party.  This session, therefore, is a valuable opportunity to provide the maximum level of clarity in order that everyone will understand the implications of what we are agreeing to, and I reiterate I strongly support the Minister of State's amendments.<\/p><p>I am interested in the changes to section 22 of the Electoral Act 1997 given we will be adding subsidiary organisations operating outside the State to the scope of that section, which will have implications for donations made to subsidiaries operating outside the State, whether that is Sinn F&eacute;in or a branch of the Green Party in Belfast, or People Before Profit or the Socialist Party.  Specifically with respect to the changes being made to section 22(2)(<i>c<\/i>)(i) of the 1997 Act, will the Minister of State be as explicit as possible with regard to the new status of requirements for political parties with respect to donations made to subsidiaries outside the State?<\/p><p>The separate question Deputy Nash raises is an important one and, again, full transparency is required.  In consideration of any such changes, we also need to be clear we will not create additional anomalies.  His amendment, if I understand it, seems to suggest that where a donation to a party organised on an all-island basis is accepted in the North, the rules of electoral donations that operate for that party in the South should apply both North and South.  That would mean, however, that we would be extending the reach of the political donations legislation from the South to the North.  I have no problem with that, given the sooner we have standard and harmonised rules North and South, the better for me, as the committee knows.<\/p><p>Nevertheless, it would create an anomaly in the North, if it were even legally possible, because all of a sudden, for political parties such as those I mentioned, the southern standards would have to be applied in the North, as opposed to the standards that would apply for the Ulster Unionist Party, the Democratic Unionist Party, the Social Democratic and Labour Party, SDLP, and Fianna F&aacute;il.  All of a sudden, there would be a two-tiered system in the North whereby the southern rules would apply to parties that are all-Ireland in nature and the Westminster rules would apply to those parties operating only in the North.  I am not sure whether southern law could be extended to the North in that way, but that is a separate issue.<\/p><p>In any event, would we want to create an anomaly whereby the SDLP could accept larger donations but Sinn F&eacute;in, the Green Party, People Before Profit and the Socialist Party would be in a different situation?  I think that is an equally important part of the consideration.  I am not averse to the conversation at all but we need to be clear about the ramifications.  What could not be the case, and I know Deputy Nash would not accept this in the South, is that one group of parties could accept larger donations than others.  That makes no sense, but his amendment would have that effect on the level of donations acceptable in the North.<\/p><p>I acknowledge this is quite technical but will the Minister of State talk us through the ramifications that changes to section 22, especially for parties such as his and ours that are all-Ireland in nature?  He might also respond to my query in regard to Deputy Nash's amendment or, if he prefers, we can discuss that on Report Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022060100002#G00600","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":781,"content":"<p>I welcome the amendments and think they are important for all the reasons Deputy Nash outlined.  I had expected we could, perhaps, go further on some of them, which might have helped Deputy &Oacute; Broin in understanding the specific application of the provision.  I would like to see more detail and adjustment on Report Stage.<\/p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Broin makes a very valid point regarding the all-Ireland nature of some parties despite there being two jurisdictions.  Even so, as a basic premise, if a corporate donation is considered wrong, a party should not accept it regardless of what it is allowed to accept.  In this State, we have come to a settled will whereby corporate donations are deemed not to be appropriate, and just because they are permitted does not mean a political party should avail of them, regardless of what is permitted North or South.  I hear what Deputy &Oacute; Broin is saying, but I would imagine many people who support all-Ireland parties believe there should not be illegal corporate donations and would be surprised to learn that some of those all-island parties receive donations that would be illegal in the South.  Of course, it is a matter of regulation, but it is also about being honest with people and saying how we believe we should operate, and how we will operate, North and South.<\/p> <p>  There is more work to be done on this issue and I look forward to the Minister of State returning to it with further amendments.

SIPO essentially conceded to Deputy Mary Lou McDonald's argument and contention there are effectively two Sinn F&eacute;ins.  There is Sinn F&eacute;in in the North, which is organised and registered in the North and can take advantage of British laws where there is no limit applied to donations.  Even though the bequest by Mr. Hampton was bequeathed to Sinn F&eacute;in in the Republic, Sinn F&eacute;in made a corporate decision to accept it in the North.  SIPO accepted there is a legal difference between both jurisdictions, but that does not mean there is not a real problem.  There is a real problem as articulated by Deputy McAuliffe.<\/p><p> Frankly, from where I am standing, it is unethical to accept donations of that scale that dwarf the &euro;2,500 corporate limit on which we decided as a Parliament and as a society more generally because of the toxic and poisonous influence of money on politics.  It is not right that is accepted.  Either parties themselves must decide whether this is right and whether it fits in with their moral and ethical compass or we legislate.  I understand the challenges involved in legislation given we must deal with two jurisdictions on this island.  I am not blind to the arguments and points articulated by Deputy &Oacute; Broin in terms of potential imbalances that might be introduced in the system in the North if we choose to go this way, but that should not act as a barrier to us dealing with this because it is a very real issue.  We have seen the corrupting influence of big money on politics in this country and we have learned those lessons.  I think we need to learn those lessons from a 32-county all-island perspective.<\/p><p> I will conclude my remarks by saying that in the last piece of correspondence we received from the Standards in Public Office Commission, it specifically suggested a new electoral commission, when formed, should prioritise and examine this issue.  I hope we can do so, that we do not leave it to the electoral commission, and that we look at every possible tool and weapon in our armoury to address this problem, because it is a problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022060100002#G00900","speaker":"1599","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654038000,"counter":785,"content":"<p>It is one of the great tragedies of partition that it creates all of these difficulties in many respects.
