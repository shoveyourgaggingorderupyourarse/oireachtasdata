I assume the Deputy is referring to the information provided in Row 47 of Table 3 of the 2016 Revenue report entitled &lsquo;Analysis of High Income Individuals&rsquo;, specifically with regard to the 346 cases where excess relief was carried forward under section 485F of the Taxes Consolidation Act, totalling &euro;97,808,596.  It should be noted that this table refers to the actual amounts of specified reliefs, including excess relief, that were used in 2016 by those affected by the restriction, not relief which is due to be carried forward in the future. <\/p>  <p>  The High Income Individuals&rsquo; Restriction, was announced in Budget 2006 and came into effect from 1 January 2007. The aim of the measure is to limit the use of certain tax reliefs and exemptions, known as &lsquo;specified reliefs&rsquo;, by those on high incomes. Prior to the introduction of this restriction, such individuals, by means of the cumulative use of various tax incentive reliefs, had been able to reduce their tax liability to very low levels or to zero. The restriction works by limiting the total amount of \"specified reliefs\" that a high income individual can use to reduce his or her tax liability in any one tax year.<\/p>  <p>  The restriction, as originally introduced, was designed to ensure that individuals with adjusted income exceeding &euro;500,000 paid an effective rate of tax of approximately 20% on that income. Where adjusted income was between &euro;250,000 and &euro;500,000, a tapering system ensured that there was a graduated introduction of the restriction, with the effective rate of tax increasing towards 20% as adjusted income increased towards &euro;500,000. <\/p>  <p>  In Budget 2010, changes to the restriction from the 2010 tax year were announced. Those individuals with adjusted income exceeding &euro;400,000, as a result, now pay an effective income tax rate of approximately 30% on that income, while individuals now become subject to the restriction and the associated taper, where adjusted income is &euro;125,000 or greater and where they claim &euro;80,000 or more in specified reliefs.<\/p>  <p>  The policy intention of the restriction is to seek to improve the balance between promoting tax equity in relation to those on high incomes, while at the same time maintaining the incentive effect of the various tax reliefs which were introduced to achieve a particular public good.<\/p>  <p>  In his question, the Deputy makes reference to the provision under section 485F of the restriction, which allows for the carry-forward of the total amount of relief not used in a particular year as a result of the restriction. This is known as &lsquo;excess relief&rsquo;. <\/p>  <p>  Section 485F provides that excess relief can be carried forward to the following year (or years) and used as a deduction from the individual&rsquo;s total income in arriving at his or her taxable income for that year. Other relief to which the individual is entitled, including other specified reliefs for the particular year, is given priority to the excess relief carried forward. <\/p>  <p>  Reliefs carried forward as excess relief lose their character in that they are pooled together in a single amount and the pooled amount is then treated as a separate tax relief in its own right. <\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that the pooled excess relief is treated as a &lsquo;specified relief&rsquo; in the year in which it is used for the purposes of deciding whether the restriction applies in that year. As such, the ability to carry-over excess relief does not affect the policy intent of the High Income Individuals&rsquo; Restriction, which is to ensure that high income individuals are subject to a certain minimum effective rate of income tax year-on-year. On that basis, I do not propose to amend the restriction as proposed by the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022800062#WRA01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Household Debt Statistics","counter":16,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022800062#WRA01500"},{"type":"question","counter":17,"qnumday":16,"qnumall":"[9760\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022800062#WRA01600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the current levels of household debt; the way in which his Department monitors and invigilates this area in the wider interests of the economy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":18,"content":"<p>Over the last decade, the household sector has undergone a significant period of active deleveraging. Since its peak of &euro;204 billion in Q3 2008, the level of household debt has decreased by 32 per cent, or &euro;66 billion. At end-Q3 2018, household debt stood at &euro;137.5 billion, or &euro;28,316 per capita, and is now at its lowest level since Q3 2005. <\/p>  <p>  Irish household debt stood at 48 per cent of GDP in 2017, down from a peak of 117 per cent in 2009.  A similar trend is seen when expressed as a share of GNI*, a measure of national income that controls for most of the multinational related distortions to GDP, with household debt now standing at 77 per cent of GNI*, down from 147 per cent in year 2009.<\/p>  <p>  Recent data from both the Central Bank of Ireland and the Central Statistics Office indicate that the sustainability of household debt in Ireland has also continued to improve. From a peak of 215 per cent in Q3 2011, household debt as a share of disposable income has fallen to 126 per cent in Q3 2018, its lowest level since Q4 2003. <\/p>  <p>  However it should be noted that although household debt is now broadly back to pre-crisis levels, there still exist pockets of high household debt amongst certain households. The Irish household sector remain one of the most indebted in the EU. On a household debt per capita basis, current data shows that Ireland is the 6th   highest in the EU at &euro;29,000 per person. Thus the risk associated with household debt remains an issue which I closely monitor. Indeed many policy initiatives introduced in recent years, particularly in the area of mortgage arrears, along with Central Bank lending regulations, have had a very positive impact on household debt levels. <\/p>  <p>  Lastly in considering the role that debt plays in the economy, it is important to note, and also not lose sight of the fact that debt performs an important economic function for households and businesses, allowing them to spread and smooth their consumption and investment across time. Households require debt to purchase assets, entrepreneurs to start businesses, while established businesses require debt to invest and expand, all of which promotes economic growth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022800062#WRA01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insurance Costs","counter":19,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022800062#WRA01800"},{"type":"question","counter":20,"qnumday":17,"qnumall":"[9764\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022800062#WRA01900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the measures taken to meet and engage with insurance companies regarding excessive premiums being charged to consumers particularly in counties Carlow and Kilkenny; if the possibility of opening up the insurance market to new providers in order to increase competitiveness in prices charged for motor insurance has been investigated; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1368","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":21,"qnumday":37,"qnumall":"[9769\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022800062#WRA02000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the status of measures taken to meet and engage with insurance companies here regarding excessive premiums being charged to consumers, particularly in counties Cavan and Monaghan.","asker":"1271","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":22,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 37 together.<\/p><p>As outlined to the Deputy in previous PQ responses (including PQs 7359\/19, 48428\/18 and 40780\/18), stakeholder consultation formed the foundation upon which the two primary reports of the Cost of Insurance Working Group and the accompanying recommendations were developed.  This consultation process involved a wide range of stakeholders representing the different voices within this sector, including representative bodies, the major individual motor insurance providers and interest groups.

However, it is clear that all forms of Brexit will have a negative impact on the Irish economy. The more disorderly the UK&rsquo;s exit is from the EU, the larger the economic impact will be. Further the implications for our economy will be disproportionate relative to those for the rest of the EU. The most negative impacts are likely to be in agri-food and indigenous manufacturing sectors.<\/p><p>While my Department&rsquo;s central economic and budgetary planning scenario remains an orderly exit based on the UK leaving with a transition arrangement in place, the risk of a disorderly Brexit has increased.<\/p><p>The UK is one of Ireland&rsquo;s most important trading partners.

In services, Ireland is in the upper range of the most exposed EU Member States, particularly in Financial Services. <\/p><p>The paper also finds that the share of exports going to the UK has increased in a number of sectors over the past 15 years, including the agri-food sector, contrary to the trend decline in the importance of the UK as export destination for overall Irish exports.<\/p><p>Maintaining the closest possible trading relationship between the EU and the UK is therefore one of the Government&rsquo;s key Brexit priorities. The Government will continue to work to improve the business environment &ndash; to make it more competitive, to assist exporters to diversify markets, and to provide better infrastructure. <\/p><p>Longer-term, we need to mitigate against the potential of regulatory divergence between the UK and EU standards given its potential implications for trade, investment and the competitiveness of our businesses.

Since 2008, the Central Bank&rsquo;s real harmonised competitiveness indicator has improved by approximately 21 per cent.  <\/p>  <p>  The restoration of competitiveness has been hard-won through improvements in productivity, along with wage and price moderation. Importantly, the robust economic growth in recent years has not yet given rise to significant inflationary pressures. For 2018 as a whole, the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices averaged just 0.7 per cent. This subdued level of inflation has continued into 2019, with annual inflation of just 0.8 per cent recorded in January. <\/p>  <p>  On the pay side, while average hourly earnings grew at just over 3 per cent in 2018, a noticeable increase on the growth rate of 1.7 per cent recorded in 2017, this came on the back of a near decade of low or negative growth in earnings. While gains in household incomes are welcome, particularly given the sacrifices made over the last decade, we need to avoid a significant acceleration in wages, given competitiveness considerations.<\/p>  <p>  Despite the competitiveness gains made over the last number of years, the risks to our economy are numerous and primarily external in nature. First and foremost is the potential fallout from a more adverse-than-expected outcome from Brexit. Secondly, given Ireland&rsquo;s position as a small open economy with a high degree of integration in global value chains, any further escalation in trade protectionism or a slowdown in global growth would have a disproportionate impact on the Irish economy.  In addition, a faster-than-expected normalisation of monetary policy, changes in other jurisdictions that affect the competitiveness of Ireland&rsquo;s corporate tax regime and rising geopolitical uncertainty all have the potential to undermine growth in the economy.<\/p>  <p>  As many of the risks we are facing are external and thus beyond our control, the best way we can mitigate against them is through prudent budgetary policy, careful management of the public finances and by focusing on competitiveness-oriented policies, particularly those that increase productivity. Through the National Development Plan in particular, we are investing significantly to address the bottlenecks to growth which emerged during the recovery, such as the need for residential development and public infrastructure investment. This should ensure that our economy remains competitive and avoid the build-up of bottlenecks that could limit our growth potential.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022800062#WRA04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Motor Insurance Costs","counter":47,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022800062#WRA04600"},{"type":"question","counter":48,"qnumday":26,"qnumall":"[9958\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022800062#WRA04700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the steps he is taking the cost of motor insurance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1284","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":49,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, the Cost of Insurance Working Group was established in July 2016 and undertook an examination of the factors contributing to the increasing cost of insurance in order to identify what short, medium and long-term measures could be introduced to help reduce the cost of insurance for consumers and businesses.  <\/p><p>The initial focus of the Working Group was the issue of rising motor insurance premiums and the <i>Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance<\/i>was published in January 2017.

Additionally, securitisations were becoming more prevalent during the 1980s and 1990s.  If the member's mortgage was sold to a third party or had been securitised, the mortgage customer lost the right to vote on conversions. <\/p><p>The Code of Practice required that borrowers must consent to their mortgages being transferred and the lender was required to provide a statement containing sufficient information to enable the borrower to make an informed decision.  The Code of Practice was issued as a voluntary Code (as opposed to the other Central Bank Codes of Conduct issued under Section 117 of the Central Bank Act 1989).  Consequently, the Central Bank's regulatory powers, including the use of its Administrative Sanctions powers, do not apply to the Code of Practice. <\/p><p>I have been informed by the Central Bank of Ireland that it is considering the possibility of revoking or removing this Code of Practice as it leads to confusion regarding the protections available to consumers whose loans are being transferred.  The mortgage market has changed significantly since the introduction of the Code in 1991, and mortgage contracts now generally include a clause that the borrower's loan can be sold, which the borrower consents to when signing their mortgage contract.  As outlined above, the consumer protection framework around the transfer of loans has also evolved significantly since the voluntary Code of Practice was issued and the Central Bank is of the view that the voluntary Code of Practice is not appropriate in the modern financial environment.  <\/p><p>The Central Bank of Ireland and I are both of the view that the regulatory framework currently in place provides sufficient protections to consumers whose loans are being sold. The Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2015 ensures that consumers whose loans are sold to another firm maintain the same regulatory protections they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory Codes of Conduct issued by the Central Bank.The Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2018 that came into effect on 21 January 2019, ensures that all transferees of credit are now entities which are regulated by the Central Bank, i.e. loans cannot be transferred to an unregulated entity.

The report included an estimate for the increase in bank credit required to fund the Institute&rsquo;s estimate for housing supply. The ESRI used COSMO &mdash; the structural econometric model of the Irish economy &mdash; to generate estimates of both the mortgage credit required to purchase projected housing supply and the construction credit required to build it. <\/p><p>Last year, the Department of Finance undertook to update the work of the ESRI. Given the importance of housing to the macro economy it was deemed appropriate to amend the supply projection to a hypothetical 50,000 units by 2024. The report estimated that if such a level of supply was funded exclusively by the domestic banks, the loan to deposit (LTD) ratio of the aggregate Irish banking system would rise from 70 per cent as of Q4 2017, to 160 per cent in Q4 2024. Of course, housing supply is not funded exclusively by domestic banks and other sources of funding already exist in the Irish market.<\/p><p>Over recent years a number of non-bank entities have emerged to fund residential development. Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), pension funds, private equity providers and specialist lenders are now active in the market providing equity and debt to developers. Given the demand\/supply imbalance that currently exists, the increase in funders willing to fund construction is most welcome. There are also wider benefits to this process of diversification. As well as being consistent with the EU&rsquo;s Capital Markets Union agenda, such non-bank investment in the residential sector releases bank capital for alternative forms of lending. <\/p><p>It is important to note that the LTD ratio is also an insufficient metric by which to measure the ability of the Irish banking system to fund their lending activities. It is similarly an insufficient gauge by which to measure banking stability. In fact, under Basel III, LTD ratio requirements were removed and replaced with two quantitative liquidity management regulations &mdash; the Net Stable Funding Requirement (NSFR) and Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR). The NSFR takes the liquidity value of assets into account, while the LCR aims to ensure credit institutions hold a sufficient reserve of high quality unencumbered liquid assets that can be converted into cash under stressed conditions. Further, banks have many other sources of funding available to support their lending activities. Debt issuance, securitisation and covered bonds are just some examples of options available to the banking system. <\/p><p>Officials from the Department of Finance are currently working on the bank funding paper, which remains in draft form.

The proportionate limits allow lenders to make credit decisions based on an individual borrower&rsquo;s circumstances, subject to the overall exemption limit amounts as permitted by the lending regulations. Notwithstanding these proportionate limits, lenders are still required to assess an individual borrower&rsquo;s affordability and to lend prudently on a case-by-case basis, in line with the requirements of the Consumer Protection Code and other regulatory requirements.  The utilisation of these exemption allowances are monitored on an annual basis by the Central Bank in order to check compliance by lenders, and are evaluated relative to mortgage drawdowns.<\/p><p>The current calibration of the mortgage lending exemption measures permits lenders, in respect of the LTV limits, to provide up to 5% of new lending to first time buyers (FTBs) above the applicable 90% LTV cap and for non-first time buyers (non FTBs) to provide up to 20% of new lending above the 80% LTV cap.

Further, I understand that the Central Bank of Ireland does not have access to market-wide data on claims paid and premiums received for Employers Liability and Public Liability Insurance.  For example it does not have data with respect to firms that are passporting into Ireland on a freedom of services basis.   <\/p>  <p>  I would note however, that the Cost of Insurance Working Group, in its Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance, published data in relation to both types of insurance that it had received from Insurance Ireland, in Chapter 4 of the Report.  In this context, there is financial year data provided for the years 2011 to 2016 relating to the number of claims reported in each of the years, certain key financial indicators such as gross earned premium, investment income, gross incurred claims, gross management expenses and gross commissions.  The Deputy may find this useful in relation to his immediate enquiries.  <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy should note also that Recommendation 4 of the Report requires the Department of Finance to publish a Key Information Report for employer and public liability insurance.  In this context, the Department has asked Insurance Ireland to provide a more detailed data on claims paid and incurred claims, to be augmented with data on settlement rates, policy counts, and disaggregated by an accident year basis.  This request was submitted to Insurance Ireland in the first half of 2018.  The Deputy will also note that it has not been possible for the Department to fully implement this Recommendation as Insurance Ireland, who do not routinely collect such information either, has found the exercise of compiling this data complex and has signalled to my Department that it needs further time to complete this exercise.  I am hopeful that Insurance Ireland will be able to submit the requested data shortly so as to allow my Department to commence production of its Report.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Deputy will be aware that the Oireachtas recently passed the legislation to provide relevant powers to the Central Bank of Ireland to establish the National Claims Information Database.  The Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Act 2018 was commenced by the Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Act 2018 (Commencement) Order 2019 (S.I. 2 of 2019) on Monday 28 January 2019.  The Central Bank plans to collect claims data for the National Claims Information Database from insurance undertakings in the first half of 2019, with a view to publishing its first annual report under the legislation in the second half of the year.  It is expected that the Central Bank will collect and publish motor insurance claims information in respect of the last 10 years, including the number of claims reported and settled, the amounts paid on claims, the incurred cost on claims (i.e. the amount paid plus the outstanding amount to be paid, if any), and the actuarial estimate of the final cost of claims i.e. ultimate costs.  <\/p>  <p>  While the National Claims Information Database will focus on private motor insurance initially, the underpinning legislation has been developed in such a way as to allow its scope to increase over time. In this regard, the Cost of Insurance Working Group recommended in its Report on the Cost of Employer liability and Public liability Insurance that by the end of this year, the Central Bank produce a report on the merits and feasibility of collecting employer liability and public liability insurance data for inclusion in the National Claims Information Database.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022800064#WRC02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Protection Policies","counter":142,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022800064#WRC02900"},{"type":"question","counter":143,"qnumday":60,"qnumall":"[10164\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022800064#WRC03000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the consumer protection laws, regulations and codes that govern mortgage protection insurance specifically the area preventing mortgage providers from restricting customers to certain insurance companies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":144,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Central Bank that when an individual(s) applies for a mortgage loan to buy a home, the individual(s) will generally be required to take out mortgage protection insurance.

The day to day supervision of insurance undertakings is a matter for the Central Bank of Ireland, and so my officials have consulted with the Bank in respect of the information sought. <\/p>  <p>  In this regard, I am advised by the Central Bank of Ireland that, during 2017 (the latest available figures), 20 insurance undertakings, which are prudentially supervised by the Central Bank, wrote general liability business in Ireland.  It has also indicated that in 2017, there were 13 insurance undertakings, which are authorised in the UK, that were writing general liability business via Freedom of Service (FOS) or Freedom of Establishment (FOE).  A further figure which the Central Bank has provided my Department with is the fact that there are currently 139 insurance undertakings, which are authorised in the UK, that are notified to write general liability insurance on a Freedom of Service (FOS) basis in Ireland.  <\/p>  <p>  With regard to the point about competition raised by the Deputy, it is accepted that there is a lack of availability of employer\/public liability insurance providers for certain types of small businesses.  For instance, I am aware of the particular difficulties currently being faced by the play centre sector. It would appear that the main reason for these difficulties is due to a lack of capacity in the market which I understand has been driven to some degree by the overall claims level in the sector. In determining their willingness to enter into or remain in a particular sector of the market, insurers will generally make an assessment of what they consider the overall risk to be.  Therefore unfortunately even in situations where there have been no claims,  part of their assessment of what premium level to charge, or whether to offer cover in the first place  will be based on what they consider the general likely trend for claims in the sector will be, based on their overall past experience.  This difficulty is reinforced by the fact that award levels in this country are significantly higher in this country than for instance the UK.<\/p>  <p>  Consequently, these difficulties in the employer\/public liability insurance sector explain why Minister of State D&rsquo;Arcy is placing such an emphasis on implementing the recommendations of the second PIC Report as both of us are of the view that bringing our award levels more in line with other jurisdictions is essential if there is to be a sustainable reduction in insurance costs in the near future.  If this were to occur, I have no doubt that that there would be more entrants into the Irish market and more competitive pricing.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to Brexit and its impacts, the decision of the UK to exit the European Union undoubtedly poses challenges for the Irish insurance market, given the level of cross-border insurance business.  This will be the case no matter what the outcome is of negotiations on the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU.  However, in terms of general liability insurance (including employer and public liability insurance in particular), I understand that the majority of the main non-life insurers operating in Ireland also write this type of business.  In addition,  the Central Bank has advised that in 2017, 40% of the domestic Irish liability market was provided by UK authorised insurers, with one large UK insurer accounting for 22% of that total liability exposure. The Central Bank notes that: <\/p>  <p>  - this insurer has implemented its Brexit plan for both new and existing business; <\/p>  <p>  - the majority of undertakings providing liability insurance have developed and are currently progressing and implementing their Brexit plans on time for 29 March.<\/p>  <p>  As liability insurance is a commercial insurance product, the Central Bank expects that insurance brokers are reviewing the capacity of the insurance market and ensuring that their commercial clients are provided with suitable products from insurers to match their commercial client needs.<\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, my view is that the impact of Brexit on the provision of insurance should not be that significant.  I think of much more importance to the general health of the sector is the need to address the high award levels for soft tissue injuries in line with the recommendations of the PIC.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022800064#WRC04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Economic Policy","counter":154,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022800064#WRC04100"},{"type":"question","counter":155,"qnumday":64,"qnumall":"[10200\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022800064#WRC04200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the degree to which he continues to monitor the economic situation arising from unsettled international trade conditions and notwithstanding Brexit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":156,"content":"<p>I regularly monitor the latest economic developments.

As the Deputy is aware, there are a number of factors for this such as the cost of funds, the need for lenders to reflect the level of credit risk (and which is still an important factor in Ireland as a consequence of the banking and property collapse) and the need for banks to build up adequate capital buffers to meet increasing regulatory requirements and to withstand future adverse shocks.

It is a statutory Code first introduced by the Central Bank in February 2009, with the current CCMA becoming effective from 1 July 2013.  The CCMA provides a strong consumer protection framework, aimed specifically at the process to be followed by relevant firms, to ensure borrowers in arrears or pre-arrears in respect of a mortgage loan secured on a primary residence are treated in a timely, transparent and fair manner.<\/p>  <p>  Banks, retail credit firms and credit servicing firms are all required to comply with the CCMA.  The overriding objective of the CCMA is to ensure the fair and transparent treatment of consumers in mortgage arrears or pre-arrears, and that due regard is had to the fact that each case of mortgage arrears is unique and needs to be considered on its own merits.  The CCMA recognises that it is in the interests of borrowers and regulated firms to address financial difficulties as speedily, effectively and sympathetically as circumstances allow.  It sets out the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP), a four-step process that regulated entities must follow:  <\/p>  <p>  Step 1: Communicate with borrower;<\/p>  <p>  Step 2: Gather financial information;<\/p>  <p>  Step 3: Assess the borrower&rsquo;s circumstances; and<\/p>  <p>  Step 4: Propose a resolution<\/p>  <p>  Each regulated entity must consider the borrower&rsquo;s situation in the context of the solutions they provide, which may differ from firm to firm.  The CCMA does not prescribe the solution which must be offered.  <\/p>  <p>  Under the CCMA, a regulated entity may only commence legal proceedings for repossession where it has made every reasonable effort to agree an alternative repayment arrangement (ARA) with the borrowers and other clear requirements are met or the borrower has been classified as not co-operating.<\/p>  <p>  This framework requires lenders to exhaust the options available from the suite of ARAs offered before taking action which may result in the borrower losing his\/her home (whether by voluntary sale or repossession).  During the legal process, borrowers have opportunities to re-engage with lenders to find a solution.  In some circumstances, however, loss of ownership may be unavoidable.<\/p>  <p>  The arrears handling provisions in Chapter 8 of the Consumer Protection Code (the Code) apply when the loan is not a mortgage loan to which the CCMA applies.  The Code requires that regulated entities have in place written procedures for the handling of arrears.   Where an account is in arrears, a regulated entity must seek to agree an approach that will assist the personal consumer in resolving the arrears.  Specified information in relation to arrears must be made available to personal consumers, including general information to encourage the consumer to deal with arrears and stating the benefits of dealing with arrears.<\/p>  <p>  Where an account remains in arrears for 31 calendar days after the arrears first arose, a regulated entity must inform the consumer of the status of the account and other specified information. This includes the amount of the arrears to date and the interest rate applicable to the arrears, details of any charges in relation to the arrears that may be applied and the importance of the personal consumer engaging with the regulated entity in order to address the arrears.  This must be updated every three months, where the arrears persist. <\/p>  <p>  Where a regulated entity reaches an agreement on a revised repayment arrangement with a personal consumer, the regulated entity must provide the personal consumer with a clear explanation of the revised repayment arrangement and clarification on what data relating to the consumer&rsquo;s arrears will be shared with the Irish Credit Bureau or any other relevant credit reference agency.<\/p>  <p>  I would also like to draw the Deputy's attention to the Abhaile scheme, the aim of which is to ensure that people who are at risk of losing their homes to address their mortgage arrears and to help them wherever possible, to remain in their homes. The Insolvency Service of Ireland have stated that if a debtor can, at least, service the current market value of their home, irrespective of the mortgage balance, a Personal Insolvency Practitioner will be able to secure a permanent solution that returns the debtor to solvency and allow them remain in their family home. In over 90% of Personal Insolvency Arrangements, the debtor has remained in their home notwithstanding the fact that the majority of such cases were in long term arrears. <\/p>  <p>  Since Abhaile was established in 2016, over 10,000 households in mortgage arrears have received free financial, legal and insolvency advice from a Personal Insolvency Practitioner or a Dedicated Mortgage Arrears Practitioner under the scheme. Over 7,100 borrowers facing repossession proceedings have received advice and support from a Court Mentor and almost 4,800 borrowers facing repossession proceedings have received legal assistance at court from an Abhaile Duty Solicitor.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022800064#WRC05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Small and Medium Enterprises","counter":166,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022800064#WRC05300"},{"type":"question","counter":167,"qnumday":68,"qnumall":"[10208\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022800064#WRC05400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which his attention has been drawn to particular circumstances in which small business borrowers on foot of a court judgment or otherwise and continue to make payments in line therewith are being forced into court for the purpose of repossession; if a particular intervention may be appropriate in such circumstance with particular reference to lending agencies no longer operating here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":168,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, the courts are independent in the exercise of their judicial functions, and as Minister for Finance I cannot intervene in matters before them.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank has published regulations for firms lending to small and medium enterprises, these aim to strengthen protections for SMEs when borrowing from regulated lenders, they set out a framework which regulated entities must comply with when dealing with SME borrowers in arrears and financial difficulties.

The recovery in the economy in part reflects improvements in Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness over the last number of years. As measured by the Central Bank&rsquo;s Real Harmonised Competitiveness Indicator, Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness has improved by over 21 per cent from the low point in 2008. <\/p>  <p>  Despite the rapid rate of recovery, the main signs of overheating &ndash; for instance pay developments, credit growth, and inflation - do not yet suggest that overheating pressures have emerged. While price pressures have been seen in the housing market, these are more a function of structural imbalances between supply and demand, which we are actively seeking to alleviate, rather than evidence of over-heating.<\/p>  <p>  The strong growth in employment over the last number of years has seen the unemployment rate fall from a peak of 16 per cent in early 2012 to 5.7 per cent in January 2019.  Despite the improvements in the labour market, the economy is not yet operating at full capacity, with the unemployment rate still above the level considered to represent full employment in Ireland. Although, average hourly earnings grew at just over 3 per cent in 2018, this follows nearly a decade of low or negative earnings growth. <\/p>  <p>  Importantly the recovery in the economy has not yet given rise to inflationary pressure. For the sixth consecutive year inflation, as measured by the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices, has been below 1 per cent. This trend has continued into 2019, with inflation of just 0.8 per cent recorded in January 2019. <\/p>  <p>  As in any healthy economy, the pickup in credit growth has taken hold, albeit at a modest pace. However, since the financial crisis, a number of additional safeguards have been put in place to prevent the unsustainable build-up of credit, most notably the introduction of the macro-prudential regulations by the Central Bank. <\/p>  <p>  Over the medium term, with the domestic economy expected to drive growth, it is important that we remain cognisant of the potential upward pressure this will place on both prices and wages, which could give rise to a loss of competitiveness. Indeed, in order to prevent overheating pressures emerging we must focus on maintaining competitiveness-oriented policies, whilst avoiding pro-cyclical policy measures.  To this end, the Government will continue to implement budgetary policies designed to ensure economic stability and fiscal sustainability. This prudent approach to our public finances will help to mitigate against any future downturn in economy activity. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022800064#WRC05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU-IMF Programme of Support","counter":173,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022800065#WRD00200"},{"type":"question","counter":174,"qnumday":70,"qnumall":"[10211\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022800065#WRD00300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the interest rates at which Ireland borrowed in 2011; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":175,"content":"<p>To grant context to my response, I feel it appropriate to highlight that funding from the EU\/IMF Programme replaced Ireland&rsquo;s long-term bond issuance in 2011. <\/p><p>Therefore, while the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) maintained a continuous, albeit limited presence in short-term markets in 2011, the focus of this response is on the funding sourced under the EU\/IMF Programme. <\/p><p>During 2011 drawdowns from the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM), the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the first tranche of the UK bilateral loan totalled just under &euro;35 billion.  <\/p><p>As outlined in the <i>NTMA Results and Business Review 2011<\/i>which was published in January 2012, the average interest rate on this borrowing was 3.7% following hedging operations by the NTMA to protect against currency and interest rate risk.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022800065#WRD00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","counter":177,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022800065#WRD00600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Stations","counter":176,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022800065#WRD00500"},{"type":"question","counter":177,"qnumday":71,"qnumall":"[10040\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022800065#WRD00600","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the status of a new Garda station (details supplied) in County Limerick; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1328","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":178,"content":"<p>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the consultant architect has been appointed for this project.

Prior to the launch of the Scheme, and since its commencement, regular consultation in relation to the operation of the Scheme has taken place with a wide range of relevant stakeholders, including the members of the Advisory Group for the Policy on Gaeltacht Education. <\/p>  <p>  The overall objective of the Policy on Gaeltacht Education is to promote the use of Irish as the main language of Gaeltacht communities through the delivery of high quality education through the medium of Irish and by extending the use of Irish in school communities. The objective of the Scheme is to allow participating schools, following consultation with their local communities, to seek to achieve Gaeltacht School Recognition over a 5 year period on the basis of the implementation of specific language-based criteria, including the implementation of a total-immersion approach.  Currently there are 105 primary schools and 28 post-primary schools participating in the Scheme. A report, summarising the views of schools about the implementation of the Scheme, as reported to inspectors during advisory visits to the schools, was published in December 2018. The report indicates that the experience of Gaeltacht schools implementing the Scheme has been largely positive. <\/p>  <p>  The additional language support hours allocated to schools participating in the Scheme are based on the enrolment figures recorded in the previous year, which is in line with Department norms.  In recognition of the difficulties which some small isolated Gaeltacht schools face in relation to the recruitment of part-time teachers, for the 2018\/19 school year, schools participating in the Scheme were given the option to combine their additional language support hours with other primary schools in the locality to form clusters, which would allow for the creation of a temporary full-time teaching post shared by the primary schools in the particular cluster. For the 2019-20 school year, the further option of combining additional Irish-language support hours and\/or special education teaching hours to form full-time temporary teaching posts which may be shared by primary schools in a particular cluster has been provided.

Citizenship ceremony days take place periodically throughout the year, at which up to 3,000 candidates for citizenship make their declaration of fidelity to the Irish nation and loyalty to the State, give an undertaking to uphold the laws of the State and to respect its democratic values and receive their certificate of naturalisation.

This legal framework requires that any proposed community CCTV scheme must:<\/p>  <p>  -  be approved by the local Joint Policing Committee,<\/p>  <p>  -  have the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner, and<\/p>  <p>  -  have the prior support of the relevant local authority, which must also act as data controller.<\/p>  <p>  This is the legal basis for all community CCTV schemes, regardless of how they are funded. <\/p>  <p>  In accordance with this legal framework, I understand that the large majority of local authorities have previously undertaken to act as data controllers in the context of specific community CCTV schemes. This has been the case either in the course of the current grant-aid scheme administered by my Department, in connection with the previous grant-aid scheme operated by Pobal on behalf of the Department, or schemes funded independently by local authorities. I understand from my Department's engagement with the Local Government Management Agency that the total number of local authorities which have undertaken the role of data controller for these purposes amounts to 28 out of the 31 local authorities nationwide.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to be aware that on 29 November 2018 the Data Protection Commission issued a note (available on its website www.dataprotection.ie) confirming that there is a legal basis for community based CCTV and that the General Data Protection Regulation does not introduce new barriers in that regard.  In particular, the DPC confirmed that: &ldquo;Data protection legislation does not stand in the way of the roll-out of Community-based CCTV schemes that have been authorised by the Garda Commissioner. Once the local authority in the administrative area concerned is willing to take on and deliver on its responsibilities as a data controller for the schemes concerned, there is no legal impediment under data protection legislation to the scheme commencing.&rdquo;<\/p>  <p>  I understand that the Data Protection Commission is currently conducting an audit of the practice, operation and governance of CCTV as part of a wider inquiry into surveillance through the use of technologies for law enforcement purposes.  We expect the findings from the CCTV module of this process to be of assistance to all concerned and in particular to local authorities. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Programme for a Partnership Government commits to supporting investment in CCTV systems.  A grant-aid scheme is administered by my Department to support groups wishing to install CCTV systems in their localities.  Under the scheme, eligible groups including community groups and local authorities can apply for grant-aid of up to 60% of the total capital cost of a proposed CCTV system, up to a maximum grant of &euro;40,000 per scheme.  <\/p>  <p>  I am keen to ensure that all interested groups have the opportunity to avail of the grant aid in question.  If the Deputy is aware of any interested groups, I would encourage them to review the details of the grant aid package, available on my Department's website www.justice.ie or to make contact with my officials through the direct access email address communitycctv@justice.ie for further assistance. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022800066#WRE04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Vetting","counter":268,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022800066#WRE04300"},{"type":"question","counter":269,"qnumday":105,"qnumall":"[10115\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022800066#WRE04400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the Garda vetting section is now taking up to four months to approve applications from local authorities for the vetting of tenants prior to applicants moving into new council properties; if additional resources will be provided to the vetting section to ensure speedy processing of all vetting applications; his views on the fact that these delays are extending the period some households are remain in emergency accommodation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1215","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":270,"content":"<p>I have requested a report from the Garda authorities on the matter raised by the Deputy and I will be in contact with the Deputy directly when the report is to hand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022800066#WRE04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Residency Permits","counter":271,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022800066#WRE04600"},{"type":"question","counter":272,"qnumday":106,"qnumall":"[10190\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022800066#WRE04700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if an extension of time will be provided to facilitate the assembly of the necessary documentation in the case of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":273,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that the person concerned was granted permission to reside the State on Stamp 1 conditions on 6 November 2018. <\/p>  <p>  I am further advised that INIS has no record of a request from the person concerned in relation to extension of this permission.

All obligations and benefits of WTO rules will be considered in that context, but those considerations cannot be pre-determined at this time. <\/p>  <p>  Specifically, in relation to Article XXI of GATT, there are a limited number of instances where article XXI has been invoked, most recently by the United States to enable the application of tariffs on Steel and Aluminium products imported into the US, but more usually at time of conflict, war, and so on. This action by the US has been challenged by the European Union and several other WTO members and is currently being pursued under the Dispute Settlement Framework of the WTO. As with any trade related action, the use of Article XXI, which would have to be by the EU, would be open to challenge by other WTO members, if any so chose.  It could be argued that for the use of Article XXI to be effective the UK would have to adopt a similar approach.  <\/p>  <p>  I don't believe it is helpful for us to speculate on the use of such exceptional mechanisms, when we have concrete, worthwhile, proposals before us.  The Withdrawal Agreement provides a solid legal framework for the UK to depart the European Union through the commencement of the transition phase, followed by negotiations on the Future Trading Relationship.  The Government has repeatedly maintained that the best and only way to ensure an orderly withdrawal and protect the Good Friday Agreement is to ratify the Withdrawal Agreement and this remains our priority. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, I might note that the Government has, this week, brought the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2019 (the &lsquo;Omnibus Bill&rsquo;) to second stage in the Dail.  This piece of legislation allows the Government to amend a number of domestic laws in order to manage the negative sectoral impacts in the event the UK leaves the EU without reaching agreement on their withdrawal.  Additionally, the Government on both a domestic and international level are fully engaged with preparing for Brexit.  Along with our EU colleagues, our focus is on ensuring that the UK passes the Withdrawal Agreement which provides the clearest and legally unambiguous platform in which to begin talks on the future relationship, whilst, at the same time, ensuring that our most vulnerable sectors are protected from the worst impacts of Brexit.  In that regard, my Department has been at the forefront of delivering, with our Enterprise Agencies, a range of measures aimed at assisting businesses navigate the economic turbulence attendant on Brexit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022800067#WRF04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Aid","counter":329,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022800067#WRF05000"},{"type":"question","counter":330,"qnumday":127,"qnumall":"[10175\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022800067#WRF05100","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if the recent state aid approval by the EU Commission for a company (details supplied) was within existing state rules and in line with the thresholds set out in EU Regulation No. 1407\/2013.","asker":"1229","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":331,"content":"<p>The recent EU Commission approval for state aid to Carbery Food Ingredients Ltd. is individual, notifiable aid measure in the form of a direct grant for an investment project covering the processing and marketing of agricultural products (milk). <\/p>  <p>  The investment is in line with State Aid rules and meets with the rural development objectives including fostering the competitiveness of agriculture and will ensure Carbery continues to guarantee a market outlet for circa. 1260 farmer suppliers and employment to 250 people in the West Cork region. <\/p>  <p>  This aid measure was designed in accordance with the Guidelines for State aid in the Agricultural and Forestry Sectors and therefore is not required to comply with the thresholds of the De Minimis Regulation (EU) No 1407\/2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022800067#WRF05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"question","counter":333,"qnumday":128,"qnumall":"[10176\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022800067#WRF05400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if she has submitted a request or is preparing to submit a request at EU level to revise state aid rules as set out in regulation EU Regulation No. 1407\/2013 to protect exposed enterprises and exporters from a potential Brexit; the status of progress being made at EU level to increase current state aid thresholds to support enterprises here in the event of a hard no-deal Brexit; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1229","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":334,"content":"<p>My Department has been working closely with the Commission and DG Competition since November 2017 through the Irish\/EU Technical Working Group on State Aid.

I understand that within the National Ambulance Service there was a 50% response rate. <\/p>  <p>  As with all surveys, it raised a number of both positive and negative results.  These results have prompted the National Ambulance Service to take a range of measures to address the areas where improvements could be made.  <\/p>  <p>  I am clear that bullying or harassment in any workplace must not be tolerated and any such instance must be addressed in accordance with the appropriate grievance and disciplinary policies and procedures.

The role of the Forum is to create a space for conversations about what matters to staff in terms of engagement and to gather suggestions on how to improve it by building on existing approaches and continually looking for new ways to engage staff.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the NAS has strengthened representative bodies and increased the number of NAS staff representation in order to provide further regular and scheduled discussion around areas such as improvement in internal and upward communication, raising awareness around dignity at work issues, and health and wellbeing initiatives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022800069#WRH04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":446,"qnumday":167,"qnumall":"[10133\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022800069#WRH05100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on whether there may be a culture of bullying and-or harassment within the national Ambulance Service.","asker":"1317","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":447,"content":"<p>I am clear that bullying or harassment in any workplace must not be tolerated and any such instance must be addressed in accordance with the appropriate grievance and disciplinary policy and procedures. <\/p>  <p>  The Health Service, including the National Ambulance Service, recognises the right of all employees to be treated with dignity and respect and is committed to ensuring that all employees are provided with a safe working environment which is free from all forms of bullying, sexual harassment and harassment.

Within an overarching conservation ethos and focus, the <i>National Strategy<\/i>sets out three strategic objectives for angling:<\/p><p>- To make angling accessible and attractive through information, infrastructure and support. <\/p><p>- To develop tourism through the promotion of our angling resource. <\/p><p>- To recognise angling as a key leisure and recreation pursuit.<\/p><p>To date, my Department has provided &euro;2 million directly for capital projects under NSAD and a further &euro;537,000 has been provided under the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Rural Development The Salmon Conservation Fund and Midland Fisheries Fund, both sustainably funded from licence and permit income, are managed in parallel with the NSAD. For clarification, the total funding available to Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) to date is &euro;3.437 million across all aspects of fisheries development, which are to be delivered under the umbrella of NSAD. <\/p><p>Projects with an investment of &euro;1.473 million have been completed to date, representing some 43% of the available funding. Of this, &euro;1.275 million has already been drawn down and a further &euro;200,000 is due for drawdown shortly. <\/p><p>Drawdown of funds under NSAD, as with other grant-aided programmes involving public funds, is subject to all governance, environmental and other project requirements. In addition, the environmental and habitats window for undertaking fisheries works is short and often dictates the need for staged work and the delivery of projects over a number of years. It was always expected that delivery could take up to a three year period which reflects the often complex nature of fisheries projects. <\/p><p>My Department has separately funded project officers for IFI to promote capacity building and a collaborative approach within the sector and to address shortfalls in expertise within voluntary organisations delivering projects. The officers engage with these groups to progress projects through governance and into delivery phase. <\/p><p>To date, all calls for projects under the NSAD &euro;2 million capital works element have been oversubscribed and IFI are concentrating on delivery of existing approved projects before additional project calls can be considered. I have commended IFI on its delivery of NSAD and other investment schemes so far and would point to the following milestones, which demonstrate significant progress: <\/p><p>- Funding has been has been allocated to 174 fisheries development and management projects nationwide; <\/p><p>- 45% of the projects have been completed to date; <\/p><p>- Angling access has been upgraded in 78 locations with a further 22 due for completion in 2019; <\/p><p>- Over 20 Information and Education initiatives supported, introducing approximately 1000 people to angling and informing visiting anglers. This provided equipment to the value of &euro;60,000 to angling events, signage, marketing and promotion; <\/p><p>- Riparian enhancement, conservation and regeneration work completed on river channels; <\/p><p>- Anti-poaching equipment purchased and installed; <\/p><p>- 10 organised angling events funded to encourage positive social inclusion in communities; <\/p><p>- Over 5,000 hours of engagement and communication from IFI local staff and Projects Office to provide mutual support, information, assistance and advice. <\/p><p>- In respect of 2019, an additional &euro;393,000 has been allocated to IFI to fund initiatives to promote increased participation in angling by young people and novice anglers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022800071#WRK01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1260"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Waste Disposal Charges","counter":521,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022800071#WRK01900"},{"type":"question","counter":522,"qnumday":197,"qnumall":"[10090\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022800071#WRK02000","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 498 of 19 February 2019, the timeline for the provision of annual support for those caring for vulnerable persons with a condition such as lifelong or long-term medical incontinence to help meet the average annual cost of disposing of domestic waste.","asker":"1235","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":523,"content":"<p>I refer to the reply to Question No. 497 of 26 February 2019.

This allows motor vehicles to travel freely between the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland and Great Britain as well as within other EU countries.  <\/p>  <p>  If the UK leaves the EU with a transition period, there should be no immediate change in the position regarding travel.  If the transition period is followed by a lasting arrangement which allows for travel under the current terms, there will be no further changes.  Should a no deal Brexit occur, the UK (including Northern Ireland) will no longer be party to the Motor Insurance Directive. This means that a Green Card will be required to demonstrate to the authorities in Northern Ireland and Great Britain that valid motor insurance cover is in place for those vehicles, and vehicles from the UK coming to the State will likewise require a Green Card as proof of insurance.  However, even in the case of a no deal scenario, the EU Commission would be able under the Motor Insurance Directive to declare that vehicles entering the EU from the UK would not require a Green Card.  It would be a matter for the UK authorities to determine whether they required a Green Card for Irish vehicles.  My Department continues to liaise with the European Commission on this issue.<\/p>  <p>  As part of necessary contingency preparations, the Motor Insurance Bureau of Ireland (MIBI) has advised that, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, Green Cards will be begin to be issued to affected policyholders in March 2019 and policy holders are advised to contact their insurers a month in advance of their expected travel date.  This is an example of prudent advance planning by the MIBI and the wider insurance sector. <\/p>  <p>  The Green Card is used as proof of insurance.  The Department understands that the vast majority of Irish motor insurance policies already include cover for travel in the UK. In such cases drivers will continue to be insured to drive in the UK even in a no-deal Brexit. However, they will need to carry the Green Card as proof of insurance if no other agreement is reached with the European Commission in the meantime.  <\/p>  <p>  Not all policies may include such cover in the event of a no-deal Brexit. In that eventuality, drivers who may be travelling to or through Northern Ireland or Great Britain should check their motor insurance policies and, if in doubt, check with their insurers that such travel would be covered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022800071#WRK04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Driver Licensing Service","counter":550,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022800071#WRK04800"},{"type":"question","counter":551,"qnumday":206,"qnumall":"[10097\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022800071#WRK04900","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he will review an article (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":552,"content":"<p>The information contained in the article is correct.

The scheme applies to all house purchase loans approved by local authorities. One of the conditions of the scheme, which is a group policy, is that it is obligatory for all borrowers, who meet the eligibility criteria to join the scheme, except where their application has been rejected by the current insurance provider. Where a prospective borrower fails to qualify under the local authority MPI scheme, they must source comparable and alternative adequate cover elsewhere and provide evidence of this cover to the local authority. Therefore, for each Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan that has been drawdown to date, mortgage protection has also been taken out.<\/p>  <p>  While there is provision under the Consumer Credit Act 1995, that where a lender offers a particular mortgage protection policy, in accordance with the requirements of that Act, the borrower can source an alternative policy to suit their needs, that provision does not apply to local authorities.  <\/p>  <p>  The local authority mortgage protection insurance scheme is overseen by the Mortgage Protection Committee which is a sub-committee of the County and City Management Association and consists of representatives from the CCMA, local authorities, the Housing Finance Agency and my Department.  The policy is subject to periodic review and competitive tendering to ensure value for money for the policy holders over the entire life of the mortgage.<\/p>  <p>  As the previous MPI contract (2012-2016) was ending on 31 December 2016, it was necessary to undertake a public procurement competition for the provision and administration of a new scheme from 1 January 2017 for a period of 3 years.   As a result of the competitive process undertaken, there was no change in the insurance provider for the Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  According to the most recent RIHL figures from the Housing Agency, as of the end of January, the average loan amount for all applications recommended for approval to date is &euro;188,924.  The current rate for the MPI scheme since the 01 January 2017 is 0.555%, therefore the estimated average monthly repayment for MPI is &euro;87.38.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022800072#WRL05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","counter":617,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022800072#WRL05800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Commemorative Events","counter":616,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022800072#WRL05750"},{"type":"question","counter":617,"qnumday":230,"qnumall":"[10100\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022800072#WRL05800","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"her views on a matter (details supplied) regarding funding; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1318","askee":"1243"},{"type":"speech","counter":618,"content":"<p>As the Minister with responsibility for leading the Decade of Centenaries commemorative programme, my priority is to ensure that the Government's approach to the remembrance of the significant historical events and related themes of the period from 1919 to 1923 is appropriate, measured, respectful, inclusive and sensitive to the different perspectives that persist on the events of this period. <\/p><p>The role of women will be a significant theme of the commemorative programme.  As you will be aware, 2018 marked the centenary of a new era for women with the passage of the <i>Representation of the People Act<\/i>and the <i>Parliament (Qualification of Women) Act<\/i>.  On the centenary of passage of the former last February, I launched a State programme to commemorate these significant legislative changes.  The changes came from years of agitation by the suffrage movement and from the significant social change across Britain and Ireland that arose during World War One.  My Department supported a number of initiatives during the year under the commemorative programme.<\/p><p>On 21 November last, I announced the Markievicz bursaries initiative to assist artists to produce new work that reflects on the role of women in the period covered by the centenary commemorations and beyond.  Awards will be made to up to five artists\/writers under the scheme each year (2019-2023) to a value of &euro;20,000 per individual or group.  The Arts Council is administering the bursaries on behalf of my Department and will begin accepting on-line applications from artists shortly under the initiative. <\/p><p>In bringing forward plans to mark the significant historical events that took place between 1919 - 1923, my approach will continue to be informed and supported by the Expert Advisory Group on Centenary Commemorations and developed in consultation with the All-Party Consultation Group on Commemorations.<\/p><p>It is, I believe, very fitting that local authorities have a leading role in supporting inclusive, respectful and meaningful community-led commemorations, augmented as appropriate with support from the State, which will be considered on a case-by-case basis. <\/p><p>In recognition of the very important role that local authorities have played to date, and will continue to have, in encouraging measured and authentic citizen engagement which is sensitive to the local context, I have requested my officials to organise a special Decade of Centenaries forum for the local authorities, to take place on 13th March.<\/p><p>While the overall commemorative programme for the period, comprised of the measures set out above, will be subject to further development, there is at present no funding available from my Department for the purpose in question.<\/p><p><font color=\"#FFFFFF\">End of Take<\/font><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022800072#WRL05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"}]
