The purpose of this meeting is to discuss with representatives of Tusla and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs the recent &quot;RT&Eacute; Investigates&quot; programme on childcare facilities.  While there have been reports in the media, it is important for members to note that the committee cannot discuss individual cases and should avoid naming individuals, regardless of whether their names are in the public domain.  Members should not discuss anything which is likely to be the subject of court proceedings.  According to media reports, a number of investigations into the matter that is the subject of these proceedings are either open or are in the process of being opened by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Tusla and the fire service.  The committee should avoid direct discussion of the action or inaction of named individuals because doing so might prejudice any investigation.<\/p><p>On behalf of the committee, I welcome Ms Bernie McNally, assistant secretary, Dr. Anne-Marie Brooks, principal officer, Ms Laura McGarrigle, principal officer, and Ms Michele Clarke, chief social worker, from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  From Tusla, I welcome Mr. Pat Smyth, interim chief executive officer, Mr. Brian Lee, director of quality assurance, Mr. Cormac Quinlan, director of transformation and policy, and Ms Fiona McDonnell, national service director of children's service regulation.<\/p><p>I draw the attention of our guests to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  They are directed that only evidence connected to the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p><p>I ask all present in the room to turn off their mobile phones or switch them to flight mode because they may interfere with the sound system, making it difficult for parliamentary reporters to report the proceedings.  Interference may also adversely affect television coverage and web streaming.  I advise our guests that any submissions or opening statements will be published on the committee's website after this meeting.  Following the presentations, there will be questions from members.

For brevity, I will summarise some of my submission.  I will introduce my colleagues.  Dr. Anne-Marie Brooks is a principal officer with responsibility for early years policy and is standing in today for the principal officer with responsibility for quality.  Ms Laura McGarrigle is principal officer with responsibility for early years projects and is currently focused on the national childcare scheme.  Ms Michele Clarke is the Department's chief social worker.<\/p> <p>  Last week's \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\" programme was deeply distressing to watch.  The appalling mistreatment of children and the terrible management practices shown were unacceptable and inexcusable.  Tusla, in collaboration with the Garda and the fire safety authorities, is pursuing those responsible.  Tusla has the full support of the Department in conducting its work.  The vast majority of early learning and care services are safe and caring places.  This is based on the findings of thousands of visits by the inspectorates of Tusla and the Department of Education and Skills, and by the observation of Better Start, a service that has worked with 3,300 services across the country in recent years.  The actions we saw in the RT&Eacute; programme were, we believe, a horrific exception.<\/p> <p>  The Department takes its responsibilities in the area of early learning and care very seriously. We are working intensively to improve quality in services and to ensure that there is robust legislation and regulation.  We believe that Hyde and Seek does not represent the standard of care and education offered by the 4,500 services.  One case such as this is one case too many.  We are working extremely hard with Tusla, and via other means, to ensure that all children have access to loving and nurturing services and that services which do not meet required standards are closed down as soon as is legally possible.<\/p> <p>  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs wrote to the chair of Tusla last Friday highlighting the importance of the work of the early years regulator and to offer the continued assistance of her Department with ensuring the agency's optimal performance.  I echo the words of the Minister in recent days to assure members of the committee and the public that we believe the Tusla early years inspectorate is doing its job and using its powers in a very effective manner.  The Department gave Tusla significant new powers in 2016.  Now that its inspectorate is well established, we see the steady application of those powers.  Since the beginning of 2018, Tusla has deregistered five services.  This year, it has attached conditions to the registration of 95 services and prosecuted two services.<\/p><p>More prosecutions and deregistrations will follow and we will continue to work intensively with Tusla to ensure that the system and the processes meet the need that exists.<\/p><p> Many people who watched the programme have asked whether it took RT&Eacute; to discover the breaches of regulations and why it has taken so long for Tusla to act on previous findings.  The Department is satisfied that Tusla was intensively engaged with Hyde and Seek long before RT&Eacute; became involved, had already taken the operators to court, had forced the unregistered service to register, had attached conditions to its registration and was acting on unsolicited information.  All this was with a view to escalating enforcement action.<\/p><p> The due process that Tusla follows before a new inspection report can be published or a service closed inevitably takes time.  For example, while Tusla has the power to deregister a service, the current legislation requires it to give a service 21 days' notice of deregistration and gives services the right to appeal to the District Court.  These legal provisions take time and these processes occur in private in order to avoid prejudicing any legal cases which may arise.<\/p><p> Ireland lags behind many developed countries in terms of the affordability, and some of the quality aspects, of early learning and care.  As such, the policy and regulatory approach is predominantly to support services to develop, upskill the workforce and improve governance.  All of this is to improve the quality of the experience for children.  When Tusla observes non-compliance with regulations, its approach is to encourage the provider to fix the problems rather than to close down the service.  This works with the vast majority of services because most are anxious to provide the best possible service to children.  Tusla is assisted in this objective by other support services in the Department, such as Better Start and the 30 childcare committees.<\/p><p> It would not be in the interests of children or parents if Tusla immediately closed down services when it observes non-compliance.  Closing down a service at short notice can cause enormous inconvenience to families.  Where possible, and where there is no serious risk to children, helping services to improve is the right thing to do.  Where there is evidence of a serious risk to children and a failure of the operator to immediately address it, clearly all the force of the law must be applied to closing the service.  There is also a need to keep parents informed of what is happening, although this poses challenges to due process.<\/p><p> Yesterday, the Minister, Deputy Zappone, asked officials to review regulatory powers nationally and internationally to ascertain whether Tusla has sufficient powers.  She asked us to focus particularly on those powers required to close services immediately where a threshold of poor standards has been crossed.  The Minister has asked us to consider whether our primary and secondary legislation needs to be amended.  She has also asked us to examine ways to ensure that parents are informed at the earliest possible date of the findings of Tusla's investigations.  This could, for example, involve requiring services to display prominently their registration certificates, including any conditions attached.<\/p><p> Since 2016, an additional &euro;4.3 million has been given to the early years inspectorate.  This has enabled a major increase in the scale of Tusla&rsquo;s registration, inspection and receipt of unsolicited information activities.  Another commitment made by the Minister yesterday was that she would continue to do her absolute best to increase investment in quality.  This includes investment in the workforce and in the regulatory and inspection regime.<\/p><p> Questions have also been asked about why public funding continues to go to services in cases where there is non-compliance with regulations.  Most public funding takes the form of subsidies to parents, which enable parents to send their children to the service for free in the case of the early childhood care and education, ECCE, programme, where most public funding is invested, or for reduced fees in the case of the various subsidy schemes.  If the Department were to cut this funding when there is little spare capacity in the system, it is parents who would suffer most through facing increased fees for the same service.  In the case of the three Hyde and Seek services that have received public moneys, 99% of the funding has taken the form of subsidies to parents.  Of the &euro;1.25 million in public funding given to Hyde and Seek in the past five years, only &euro;10,000 has taken the form of grants to the service.  I stress that no public funding whatsoever has gone to the service that was unregistered.  Nevertheless, it is right that the State should set limits on the services that receive funding. This already occurs to some extent through the restriction of public funding to services that are registered with Tusla.<\/p><p> First 5, the whole-of-Government strategy for babies, young children and their families, includes commitments to further strengthen the link between public funding and quality standards, through the development of a new funding model and through a commitment to withdraw funding where quality standards are not met.<\/p><p> The broadcast last week of RT&Eacute;'s investigation offered many reminders of the 2013 RT&Eacute; programme, \"A Breach of Trust\".  This time, however, the independent regulator was already taking enforcement action when RT&Eacute; went in.  Another difference is that last week&rsquo;s programme showed footage from only one service owner.  We have come a long way since 2013 and standards have risen across the board.  In 2013, the Government announced a quality agenda and every one of the eight commitments relating to it has been delivered.  We have introduced minimum qualification requirements, a registration system, a national inspection system, new regulations, a quality and regulatory framework, the publication of inspection reports, new powers to deregister services and attach conditions and the Better Start quality development service.  Other actions to raise quality standards have also advanced, supported by a 117% increase in Government funding over the past four budgets.  These include a learner fund to support higher qualification of staff, new Department of Education and Skills inspectorate education-focused inspections in ECCE and a pilot paid continuing professional development scheme for staff.  This year, we introduced regulations for school-age childcare.<\/p><p> There is, of course, much more to be done and a number of major initiatives are under way to improve standards further.  These include the development of a workforce development plan.  Yesterday, the Minister requested that, as chair of the group, I should prioritise the element of the work to develop a professional regulatory body for those who work in the sector.  The development of a new funding model is also about to begin and this will support improved quality of provision and address affordability.  National consultation on a radical draft child minding action plan to map out a pathway of regulation and the support of all paid childminders will begin soon.  The development of a resource for parents to assist them in understanding what a good quality early learning and care service looks like is also about to being.  None of these new actions will be much consolation to the parents of children attending the Hyde and Seek cr&egrave;ches.  However, I speak on behalf of the Minister and everyone in the Department when I say that every effort will continue to be made to improve the quality of early learning and care services.  Reform on the scale we are undertaking inevitably takes time.  Objective analysis shows that the sector has already made huge strides and has been transformed in the past decade.  The Department is committed to ensuring that this transformation continues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019073100002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Bernie McNally","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1564527600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members for the opportunity to address the committee in order to provide context for and information on the role and remit of Tusla&rsquo;s early years' inspectorate.  I am joined by my colleagues Mr. Brian Lee, the director of quality assurance, within whose directorate the children's regulation service sits.  I am also joined by Ms Fiona McDonnell, the national director of the children&rsquo;s services regulation, and Mr. Cormac Quinlan, the director of transformation and policy.<\/p> <p>  As the regulator of the sector, and as the State&rsquo;s dedicated agency for child protection and welfare, Tusla found the adult behaviour towards children and the serious breaches of regulations at Hyde and Seek cr&egrave;ches shown in the RT&Eacute; broadcast shocking, unacceptable and worrying at the very least.  Tusla&rsquo;s early years inspectorate is the independent statutory regulator of early years services in Ireland and the largest children's regulator in the State.  It has responsibility for the registration and inspection of pre-schools, play groups, nurseries, cr&egrave;ches, day care and similar services that cater for children aged up to six years.  Every registered service provider in Ireland, of which there are almost 4,500, has been inspected by Tusla's early years inspectorate.  The early years inspection service was introduced in 1997.  In my written submission I have set out the various regulations and Acts that provide the powers to register and deregister services and enhance the enforcement powers of the inspectorate.<\/p> <p>  While Tusla works actively with service providers to highlight areas where improvements are necessary in order to improve standards in service that promote the safety and well-being of children, it is important to note that it is the responsibility of the registered providers to ensure that they are compliant with the regulations.  Key statistics on the early years inspectorate include that there are approximately 4,500 registered early years services.  Last year, 2,500 of these services, which is well over 50%, were inspected.<\/p><p>We also managed 413 unsolicited information cases regarding the early years service last year.  Almost 5,000 inspection outcome reports were published on the website.  Some 254 incidents were notified to the inspectorate in 2018 by service providers.  Approximately 1,400 change-in-circumstances requests, which relate to the services provided by providers, were received and addressed by the inspectorate in 2018.  We had one full prosecution of early years services, which commenced in 2018 and was completed this year.  A total of 138 services closed in 2018, some as a result of Tusla interventions.  Five services were removed from the early years register by Tusla in 2018 and to date in 2019.<\/p><p> Since the introduction of legislative reform and the Child Care Act 1991 (Early Years Services) Regulations 2016, it is an offence to operate a service that was not approved to operate under this regulation.  As we have set out, Tusla has powers to enforce that.  In summary, these powers involve: maintaining a register; placing conditions on a service where this is found to be appropriate; prosecuting a service that has not complied with a condition of registration; prosecuting a person or persons operating an unregistered service; re-examining the registration status of every service on at least a three-yearly cycle; and approving change of circumstances applications.  As a regulator, it is vital that Tusla exercises its regulatory powers in a proportionate manner, first, to drive improvement and, second, to respond to continuous and serious breaches of regulations within its remit while balancing the rights of providers to fair procedures and natural justice.  This is an important and difficult balance to achieve at times because deregistering a service can have a major impact on a community and parents.  The quality and safety of care received by children is the end result of a wide range of decisions made by a number of different stakeholders.  Such stakeholders include: providers themselves, in the context of their policies, training and guidance, local governance and internal control arrangements, and compliance with the regulations; professionals who work within those services in respect of education, training and the care of the children; parents and guardians in respect of what they access, see and understand from the services; commissioners; regulators; other bodies; and legislation.  While regulation and inspection are essential components in identifying and addressing risks within the early years sector, the early years inspectorate alone cannot regulate for individual behaviours that are not in evidence during inspections or not reported to Tusla through other appropriate channels such as Children First mandatory reporting or the early years inspectorate. It is the professionalism of individuals that keeps children safe and also ensures the delivery of good care.<\/p><p> To give a sense of the extent of the services that have been put in place since 2014, achievements of the early years inspectorate since that year include the establishment of national governance to ensure standardisation of inspection practices across the country.  An unsolicited information office was established in January 2018 to process information, concerns and complaints about early years services.  An online system to submit unsolicited information to the inspectorate is also available.  A stakeholder consultative forum was developed in 2015 to ensure that the inspectorate listens to the voice of the stakeholders, Government and the relevant authorities.  We established the national regulatory support forum in 2017 to provide supports to providers and respond to parent queries.  Following extensive consultation with the sector, the early years inspectorate published a quality and regulatory framework that is underpinned by research and best practice to make explicit what the requirements are under each regulation available for providers, students and parents.  At present, there are 58 full-time staff working in the inspectorate.<\/p><p> Tusla&rsquo;s early years inspectorate had acted appropriately as the regulator and was applying its regulatory and prosecutorial powers proportionate to the risks and issues in each of the cr&egrave;ches in question, based on the verifiable information available to it.  Tusla had concerns regarding repeated breaches of compliance with regulations in all the Hyde and Seek services which were informed by inspection, some of which was triggered by information received through the unsolicited information office.  The continued breaches of regulations resulted in a number of enforcement actions.  For example, Hyde and Seek Glasnevin was successfully prosecuted by Tusla in 2019 for the operation of an unregistered service.  Enforcement activity began in January 2018 when this matter was first brought to our attention.  Hyde and Seek Shaw Street was inspected in September 2018 and July 2019 and is subject to ongoing enforcement action.  Hyde and Seek Tolka Road has been subject to a significant level of regulatory enforcement activity and referrals have been made to Tusla&rsquo;s child protection and welfare services.<\/p><p> It is important to state in the clearest terms possible, however, that Tusla&rsquo;s early years inspectorate had no evidence of the serious child protection concerns or the high degree of serious non-compliance with standards that was shown in the RT&Eacute; programme.  Indeed, the behaviours displayed are unlikely ever to be evident during an inspection and we rely on good governance practice and appropriate mandatory reporting under Children First or through Tusla&rsquo;s unsolicited information office for the notification of child protection concerns.  Furthermore, if issues of non-compliance are evident during an inspection, these are brought to the attention of the service provider for immediate action.<\/p><p> RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s programme \"Cr&egrave;ches - Behind Closed Doors\" contained distressing footage which caused upset and anxiety for parents, guardians and the general public.  Tusla first received information from RT&Eacute; in July in respect of serious concerns regarding the quality of care in these services which provided evidence of poor practice and allowed the early years inspectorate to take additional action further to that set out earlier.  Tusla contacted RT&Eacute; to seek any further information that would assist us to take further action to protect children and footage of a chronology of events identified by them since they commenced their undercover investigation last April was provided.  There is ongoing liaison with RT&Eacute; in this regard to identify and address any child protection concerns.<\/p><p> Tusla has a primary responsibility to promote the safety and well-being of children and should always be informed when a person has reasonable grounds for concern that a child may have been, is being or is at risk of being abused or neglected.  These concerns are screened and assessed as appropriate under Children First.  Where there is an immediate and serious risk to a child, Tusla provides an immediate response.  All cases of suspected child abuse are reported to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  While this is a separate and distinct role in the protection of children from that of the early years inspectorate, there are clear links between the two.  Every early years provider must ensure that employees are trained in their obligations under Children First and every childcare worker in an early years service has a legal mandate under Children First to immediately report child protection or welfare concerns, or any observation of harm to a child, to the relevant social work department.  Every organisation and professional also has a professional and ethical responsibility to report their concern.  Tusla's website has extensive information and links to provide anybody with the relevant information and training around this.  Where Tusla&rsquo;s early years inspectorate receives a child protection concern, it is referred to the child protection team, which follows up accordingly.<\/p><p> The practice and behaviours broadcast in the \"Prime Time\" programme are an exception in the sector, are obviously unacceptable and are a clear breach not only of the regulations but of the trust placed by parents in the owners of Hyde and Seek.  I can offer assurance that having inspected all 4,435 registered service providers across 26 counties, most facilities are compliant with the majority of regulations and where non-compliances are identified, the vast majority of service providers work closely with Tusla to implement the necessary improvements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019073100002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Smyth","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1564527600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>Before we commence with questions from the members, does Mr. Smyth wish to make any further contributions or clarifying points that may have emerged since his statement was written?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019073100002#D00200","speaker":"1300"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1564527600,"counter":14,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019073100002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Smyth"},{"type":"speech","time":1564527600,"counter":15,"content":"<p>That is fine.

Although the D&aacute;il and Seanad are not sitting, their presence this morning shows that the members are absolutely still at work.  As has been indicated in both opening statements, members of the public including the committee members were shocked and horrified by the events we witnessed on \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\".  A word of thanks should go to the makers of that programme for their work in highlighting these issues affecting some of the most vulnerable citizens of the State.  It raises fundamental questions when it comes to the standards and practices within the sector.  Our guests have been very good in providing information as to the number of inspections.  On radio last week, Mr. Lee stated that over 50% of operators here are inspected and that this is a significant percentage when benchmarked against the figure for the UK, which is only 5%.<\/p><p>I am interested in discovering what is the position elsewhere in Europe, particularly the Nordic countries.  I would like Mr. Smyth to provide that information during the course of the meeting, if possible.<\/p><p> I only have three questions because I know the other members are waiting.  It is important that Tusla stated that it believes that this is an isolated, or at least very rare, incident.  Tusla also stated that there is a high rate of inspection, that the number of facilities shut down is low - Mr. Smyth mentioned five in the past 18 or 19 months - and that more than 138 operators deregistered themselves in 2018.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019073100002#D00400","speaker":"1300","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1564527600,"counter":17,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019073100002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Smyth"},{"type":"speech","time":1564527600,"counter":18,"content":"<p>On that basis, 4,500 service providers are operating with Tusla's permission and approximately 50% are investigated in any given year.

The child protection and welfare issues that obtain will not be evident during an inspection process.

I assure members, parents and everyone listening that there is a very good level of compliance among providers.  There are, however, limitations with any inspection regime, whether in this sector, the nursing home sector or other sectors.  Inspections are snapshots of quality in a service at a particular point in time.  As has been stated, rightly, it is for the service provider and staff to provide the best service when an inspection service is not present.  Childcare workers in early years services are mandated reporters under the Children First Act 2015 and are required to report any concerns they may have regarding child protection issues to Tusla's social work teams.<\/p> <p>  I want to be absolutely clear that the level of compliance in the sector is very high.  Our overriding operating principle is to drive improvement.  Most services engage and co-operate with us and they want to improve.  Compliance rates increase significantly when we put in place action plans for improvement after engagement with providers.  A service provider deregistered by Tusla will have gone through a series of steps where continuous non-compliance was demonstrated.  That is because our overriding principle is to drive improvements in the sector.  It is never possible, however, to give a cast-iron guarantee that something like what we are discussing could never happen again.

Regarding our approach as the independent regulator of this sector, we put in place action plans to seek remedies when inspections highlight concerns regarding service providers and staff.

That is available to the public and is written in a clear and straightforward way in the context of Tusla's expectations regarding what care and support services are meant to be provided.  It is a helpful guide to assist people in understanding what good quality care looks like.

The main statutory provision here is the Children's First Act 2015, which came into place at the end of 2017.  It introduced specific provisions for services and individual professionals.  Services covered are those defined by the Act and every childcare centre in the context of the services regulated by Mr. Lee.  Under the Act, providers are required to have a child safeguarding statement and it should cover all the policies and procedures that should be present in the organisation.  It should include what steps the provider has taken to ensure that staff are informed of their obligations.  Mandated persons as defined in Schedule 1 of the Act, such as childcare workers operating in this sector, have an individual legal mandate to report abuse when they see it.<\/p> <p>  Tusla's role is to provide supports.  When the Children First Act 2015, and the associated Departmental guidance, came into force, we developed a universal free e-learning programme.  It is available to everyone in the country so that they can understand their obligations in this area.  We also have a whole suite of material on our website regarding guidance on reporting and various supports available to individuals.  In addition, we have also worked closely with the Department in the context of the Children's First Act 2015 and there is an obligation on each sector.  The Act established an interdepartmental group as the implementation group for the Act.  A representative from every Department sits on that group and all sectors are required to produce cross-sectoral plans on how they support their sectors, including any funded services.  Tusla supported the early years sector in providing additional training supports, including the provision of additional trainers.  We also supported a \"train the trainer\" programme which provided tailored training to staff in the sector to enable them to understand their obligations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019073100002#E01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cormac Quinlan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1564527600,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I would add a departmental perspective in respect of both questions.  I agree with everything the representatives from Tusla said.  The first question was on whether we can be absolutely certain that this is an isolated incident.  We can never be certain of that, but we can offer the committee the evidence that is out there.  While the Department relies hugely on information from Tusla and advice from the regulator on how we are doing in the sector, other sources also inform the Department and the actions it needs to take.  As well as the 2,500 inspection reports we received from Tusla last year, we received information from the Department of Education and Skills inspectorate, which inspected 700 services in the ECCE programme last year.  We also have the Better Start quality development service and 130 expert practitioners who are working with services all the time.  They have worked with 3,300 services.  Tusla's unsolicited information service is really important.  We also receive information within the Department, so we have a number of sources.  Parents are increasingly a source of information as well.  We recently funded a post in the National Parents Council, in collaboration with the Department of Education and Skills, to build up the role of parents in the sector, to help them influence policy, etc.  We have committed to do much more under the Children First initiative.  I just wanted to say that we have many sources influencing and shaping our policies.<\/p> <p>  Regarding Children First and training, I would add to what Mr. Quinlan said about having that extra layer of training.  Early learning and care practitioners have access to all Tusla's resources, including online training and so on.  We have also developed a number of other resources.  A national steering group has been in operation since 2013, and there are 60 childcare committee staff throughout the country who are trained in training staff in respect of the Children First guidelines.  Some 15,000 childcare staff have done the additional training on top of basic training.  We continue to invest in that year on year.  We have a dedicated chairperson for that group and a dedicated co-ordinator for that amount of activity.  We are doing as much as we can.<\/p> <p>  It is also important to note that early learning and care staff are protected under protected disclosures legislation, so in that horrendous scenario where they may feel that they or their employment conditions are under threat, they are protected.  One would hope that only a tiny number of them would have to use those protections, but they are there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019073100002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Bernie McNally"},{"type":"speech","time":1564527600,"counter":27,"content":"<p>Tusla should follow by getting that information out there.

It is important that people feel confident they can report these matters to us because that allows us to act to protect children there and then in relation to their safety needs.  It is important that people see their obligation in that regard.  Everyone in our society holds that obligation,.

We have all spoken about how distressing and upsetting watching the programme last week was for everybody, particularly parents.  What we saw was not only a breach of regulations and standards of care, it also involved adults acting in an abusive manner towards children and the use of excessive force.  There are two separate issues here.  Obviously, the regulation side will deal with the poor standards of care piece.  However, it is so important that when a professional or anyone else sees what would be deemed to be reasonable grounds for concern or, in this context, even harm as defined by the Children First Act, which is a mandatory reporting requirement, it should be brought to the attention of the service.  I need to be clear on this because it is so important.  This is not unsolicited information given to a regulatory service, it is a child protection and welfare standard reporting form to our service that lists the child's details, who is suspected of causing harm to that child and the concerns relating in that regard.  This allows Tusla and the child protection and welfare service to immediately act if there is an immediate need to protect that child.  Irrespective of whatever regulatory process is happening, we can and should intervene to protect that child but we need the information from individuals who have an obligation to report that to us.  It is so important that we receive such information and that people see their obligation to send it to us.  This then affords us the opportunity to put in place immediate protection measures in respect of any child in order to prevent any future harm occurring.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019073100002#G00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cormac Quinlan"},{"type":"speech","time":1564527600,"counter":71,"content":"<p>I thank our guests for their presentations and for appearing before us to deal with this issue.  I do not want to be repetitive.  Both speakers and the Chairman have indicated that the scenes in the programme were horrific.  It is safe to say that what was viewed would be every parent's worst nightmare.  My sister, who has had a child in a cr&egrave;che for a number of years, heard me speaking about this on the radio and told me that she would not watch the programme because she did not want to think about anything that could have happened.  This matter has struck a chord with parents throughout the country.  The purpose of this meeting must be for us, as legislators and policymakers, to get to the bottom of how this could have happened and to see what can be done to reassure parents in terms of what we can find out and what actions are needed on the part of the Department and Tusla.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Lee made a very fair comment when he stated that last week's programme does not represent what happens in all cr&egrave;ches.  I and, I am sure, my colleagues have had a lot of communication from cr&egrave;che owners who provide excellent services, who feel very hurt by the scenes shown and who fear that the message could be transmitted that they are not providing care of the utmost standard.  I received correspondence from somebody whose child attends one branch of Hyde and Seek that allegedly has been managed quite well by another individual, which shows that this is a very difficult and nuanced issue and that we must be very practical about how we approach it.  Mr. Quinlan alluded to the fact that knowing that Tusla exists to oversee and to be reported to if there are suspicions about safety is a call to arms for parents and that everything should be reported if there is even the slightest suspicion.  Clearly, the structures exist.  They may need improvement but they do exist to protect children, which must be the primary concern at all times.<\/p> <p>  One question that has probably been asked by many people over the past week and during the coverage of this is how a relatively small group of reporters working for RT&Eacute; on perhaps a relatively small budget managed to uncover these issues in a cr&egrave;che that had not been consistently identified by Tusla.  How was this possible?

There were similar types of breaches of regulations but not to the same level of concern highlighted in the RT&Eacute; programme.  The most important part is that the child protection issues relating to rough handling were never observed during inspection and it is highly unlikely that they would be.  This is where mandatory reporting kicks in.  It is the duty of staff or undercover workers to immediately report any concerns about child protection to Tusla.  We are reviewing the footage from RT&Eacute; and as we identify child protection concerns or further breaches of regulations, we will take appropriate action in line with our statutory remit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019073100002#G01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Lee"},{"type":"speech","time":1564527600,"counter":73,"content":"<p>My next question relates to whether Tusla has considered making it compulsory for CCTV to be installed in cr&egrave;ches.

There are some aspects of policy that we share with the Department of Education and Skills.  We have responsibility for the legislation under which Tusla operates, both primary legislation and the regulations.  The regulations that were introduced in 2016 gave Tusla significantly more powers than existed under the old HSE system of inspections, etc.  Those regulations were being prepared for a number of years.  There was intensive liaison with Tusla and an active process of engagement around what it wanted, etc.  In the context of those regulations and the amendment to the Childcare Act that happened at the time, I am of the view that we provided as many additional powers as the system was ready for.  That has to be said.  We were moving from very light touch to where we hoped we were going in terms of right touch.  A lot more powers were given at that stage.  We operate very effectively with the inspectorate, recognising its independence, etc..  We are in constant touch with the inspectorate.  We are constantly hearing feedback from it on changes that might need to be made.  Hence, in the context of First 5, we had committed to reviewing the regulations before the RT&Eacute; programme was broadcast.  We absolutely will continue that intensive engagement when the inspectorate is well-established.  All inspectors and regulators take time to bed in.  The Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, took time to bed in.  Now that these are well-established, it is the right time to look at more powers, albeit that those powers may only be used on a very small number of occasions.

This feeds over to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  For example, in 2016, under the new regulations, we undertook an analysis of the 3,000 inspection reports that existed at that time.  One of the areas that providers were struggling with was that of outdoor play.  We were able to feed that finding back to the Department, which then provided capital funding.  It is important that we analyse our inspection reports every year.  We share that information, it is on our website.  We meet registered providers and we do road shows every two years.

The quality and regulatory framework is a document that shows, for registered providers, parents and students who are studying early childhood care and education in the colleges, the regulations in a very clear and concise way.  The framework is available on our website.  The website also contains additional links by means of which more information is provided.  The information is there.  The difficulty we had was in terms of trying to contact parents directly.  As a result, we established the regulatory support forum, which comprises the county childcare committees, the Department's Better Start quality development service, etc.  We go through all of our processing in the context of registering a service and what is required in regulation so that those involved are informed.  They are the people, the development workers in the local areas, who  will give the information to parents and providers.<\/p> <p>  This year, we are carrying out research for parents.

Where Tusla finds that the standard is so concerning and the owner of the service has given no assurances of immediate action to address it, we will look to give Tusla the powers to close those services down immediately.<\/p><p> Again, in our conversations with Tusla, it is clear it does not imagine this would happen very often.  It would be a power that is used quite infrequently but we are looking to grant such powers.<\/p><p> The other power we talked about this morning stems form the question of when Tusla can tell parents more.  Due process does not exist to protect Tusla but to give the services the right to correct any inaccuracies that they might believe Tusla made in its inspection.  It is about giving providers the opportunity to defend themselves, their reputations and livelihoods but it is also to ensure there will be no prejudice in the case of legal proceedings.  This will be a challenge and is one that other sectors also face.  What is the earliest point at which we can tell parents more?  We want to but we must respect providers and the law.  We will look at amendments over the next number of months as to what we can do in that space.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019073100002#K01400","nonspeaker":"Ms Bernie McNally","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1564527600,"counter":159,"content":"<p>Could I make a quick comment to reinforce some of the previous statements?  We mentioned red flags and even when a red flag is brought to us, the process can take a considerable amount of time for us to fully enforce that up to de-registration.  As mentioned before, that extra power to close a service immediately would be useful.  I have been looking closely at the legislation underpinned by the Food Safety Authority and the Health and Safety Authority.  It must be a very high bar to act to close down a service but I am looking at a threshold of a grave risk to children, whether there is an infrastructural problem with the building or the services' practices are so concerning that there might be an immediate risk to children, and it would be very useful to have that power to close such a service immediately rather than waiting 21 days, or even to build up the evidence to bring it to the 21 days.  Even to get to the point of proposing to remove a service, one red flag will not be enough evidence to get that through if it is challenged in court.  We must build a series of pieces of evidence to make a case to de-register a service.

Such parents seek clarity from us as to whether the interactions we are having today will provide some degree of confidence to those parents.  As a parent, if my child were in any of those facilities and I had no choice but to send my child there, I would be racked with guilt, feeling ambivalent about what I should be doing and I know for a fact that some of the children have been withdrawn from such facilities because I have been talking to some of the parents of those children.  I am not sure I have heard anything today that would give me crumbs of confidence or give those parents grounds for confidence.  I wanted to make that point at the very start.<\/p><p>Correct me if I am wrong, but everything I have heard today points back to Tusla saying it is reverting to Children First guidelines.

In the media in recent days, a number of academics, who are not living in ivory towers but working in universities and on the ground, have said they believe this case is an exception.  We fund staff in 30 county childcare committees, CCCs, across the country.  We provide funding of &euro;13 million between CCCs and national voluntary childcare organisations.

Let us nail that to the mast.  That is self-evident because we have relationships in our constituencies with childcare facilities and they are excellent.  I have a lot of sympathy for what I would call junior staff, as opposed to management staff, who are working under duress in some instances in these facilities.  However, there is a systemic failure somewhere because if there was not, we would not be sitting here today and we would not have witnessed the scenes we witnessed on the RT&Eacute; programme.  What I am trying to do is nail down where the obligations lie.  There are obligations regarding mandatory reporting and there seems to have been a failure somewhere in that respect and we need to address that failure.  Similarly, parents listening to this discussion will hear some sympathetic language about improving the quality of the conversation with parents and involving them more in respect of policy and so on.  However, if a parent who sent his or her child to one of these creches today had an inkling that something was going on, he or she will not go to the Tusla website or the Department of Children and Youth Affairs website to check the criteria.  They would not necessarily act on their instinct because they have trust that the regulatory regime is robust enough to ensure their child is protected.  That is a failure in the system.  As mentioned by other speakers, we need to get to a point now, arising from this episode, where parents are given power on a statutory basis to be part of a communications set-up, so to speak, with whatever facility their child happens to be in or attending in a way that ensures there is proper communication with them because they are being left out of the loop.  I repeat that parents are racked with guilt.  I am a parent.  I was racked with guilt watching that programme.  One could not but be racked with guilt.  Parents already feel guilty sending their children to childcare daily, given the society we live in where the two parents have to work.  We will have an opportunity to address and engage with the academics about whom Ms McNally spoke because it is our intention to have a second committee hearing, for which I thank the Chairman, to which those academics will be invited because it is important that we kick the tyres, so to speak, in respect of what the witnesses are telling us and have a robust discussion.  We will need to hear from parents also in respect of what we are hearing today.<\/p> <p>  I want to drill down into the programme.  Obviously, the people working undercover made representations, disclosures or notified Tusla.  I am concerned that too much time elapsed between the notification by those undercover workers and the lack of communication with parents such that some parents were not notified other than via RT&Eacute;.  Nobody is blaming RT&Eacute;.  It has done a public service on this issue.  However, the parents want to know why Tusla did not phone them to notify them this was going on and if they could be given a guarantee that their child will be safe in the intervening period.

Parents would have been informed and could have then made an informed choice as to whether they wanted their children to be in that service or not.  There would have been ongoing engagement with the regulatory services and measures could have been taken to ensure the person causing harm was not in contact with the children, and we could have informed the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of the suspected abuse.

I now turn to the Department.  We are looking at early years childcare in the wrong context.  Once profit is introduced, there will be 12 cent noodles and watered-down milk.  We need to move away from this completely.  This is more a matter for the Department than Tusla.  The workers in the sector must be valued.  Theirs is one of the most valuable jobs in society.  We trust these people with our kids and 99% of them do an excellent job.  To be fair, the show highlighted that workers were trying to stand up for the children.  It is the activities of the owner and the management that are in question.  Those workers need income security and secure contracts so that they are not required to sign on during the summer.  It is total chaos and it is not fair.  If, as we all say, we want quality affordable accessible early years and childcare, then we need to remove the for-profit aspect.  The Department is here on behalf of the Minister so it needs to send her the message that she needs to step up in that regard.  Once profit is involved, it will always end in disaster.  How do we know that the extra money for the access and inclusion model, AIM, or graduate recruitment is passed on?  We do not know that.  We must change the whole system.  I appreciate that the latter will not be done overnight but I would like to see the Department be stronger in this regard.  It is supposed to stand up for children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019073100002#O03900","speaker":"1266"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1564527600,"counter":262,"content":"<p>We are doing our very best to deliver the best possible outcomes for children.  There is evidence of progress.  The Deputy is absolutely right to raise the issue of profit.<\/p><p>I have heard one of the unions talk about this matter in recent days.  There is a difference between profit and profiteering.  This country would not be where it is were it not for companies running businesses and making reasonable profits.  There is a difference between offering a good service to children and families and making a reasonable profit - which we can all live with - and the horrendous situation whereby some services are making massive profits at the expense of children, parents and staff.  We have to look at that further.<\/p><p> Let us look at where we are, the money that has gone into creating our early learning and care and school-age childcare infrastructure and the question of whether there is no public service delivery.  We created access in the first instance when we received a great deal of money from Europe a number of years ago and a decision was made to give that, in the main, to not-for-profit providers predominantly.  Some of the money also went to private operators.  We are now in a situation whereby it is a private model, be it that a quarter of the services are offered not-for-profit operations.  Clearly, the Government can look at future policy in that area.  In the context of the current policy, we are actively looking at how we can work with providers to enable them to make reasonable profits but also to control affordability, quality, etc.  The Minister will be making an announcement on the appointment of a chairperson to head up this new funding model in the next few weeks.<\/p><p> What Deputy Funchion states about the workforce is absolutely true.  It is really important that we value our workforce in order for children to get high-quality services.  We are doing a great deal in that regard.  In the context of First 5, our commitment for the next ten years is about professionalising and valuing the workforce.  The Minister has called on the profession to deliver and to get a sectoral employment order because that will mobilise the machinery of the State - the Workplace Relations Commission, the Labour Court, our Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform - to address the question of what staff are earning.  Is it right that the average wage in sectors &euro;12 per hour and that a manager with 20 years' experience is on &euro;15 an hour?  Is it right that, as the Deputy stated, over 40% of staff are on part-time contracts and over 40% are on seasonal contracts?  We know that we have to address that.  There is a group to develop a workforce development plan that I am chairing which has just had its second meeting.  We are making progress.  The 117% increase in investment over the past four years has helped but we have a lot more to do.  I call on all the managers and owners of those 4,500 services to act.  I trust that they want to work in partnership with us and do whatever they can for their staff.  There has been investment and we have increased the ECCE capitation has increased by 7% and we trust that service providers are doing as much as possible to pass as much of that as they can on to staff.  This is a priority for the Minister and we will pass on this feedback.<\/p><p> On the specific matters to which the Deputy referred, we know that the majority of the AIM funding is being spent on the supports that we want to be given to children.  Extra money is being provided for inclusion co-ordinators.  Do we know that this money or the higher capitation we provide in respect of ECCE are always passed on to staff?  There is a question mark over that.  I fully agree with the Deputy in the context of the question she asked.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019073100002#O04000","nonspeaker":"Ms Bernie McNally","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1564527600,"counter":264,"content":"<p>I have one further question for the Department and one or two more for Tusla.

Those services could be subject to three or four inspections a year.  A good service might undergo an inspection every 18 months or two years.

The example of the NCT popped into my head and will not leave.  I have in mind a public information index, as it were.  While any of the 4,500 service providers could place its certification on a wall, I do not just want to see it on the wall.  If I am a new parent, I do not want to have to get into my car and drive to the front door of a facility that might be behind a gate.  It should be behind a gate, actually.  I want to be able to figure out whether the service has a good rating.  I do not want users telling me whether it is a good service.  Rather, I want Tusla, given that it is the statutory authority, to tell me whether it is a good service.  That is where my idea of an NCT arose.  I am not suggesting for a moment that Tusla make its risk register publicly available, but in the context of providing further information to parents so that they can make informed decisions, there should be a mechanism whereby Tusla could say on its website whether a service had passed inspection, reached a certain grade and, with the support of the provider involved, received a quality assurance mark.  Whether that be done in the context of the professional side or with regard to the actual bricks and mortar, parents would be reassured if a quality assurance mark was associated with childcare services.  Those are my four main points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019073100002#U04200","speaker":"1300"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1564527600,"counter":459,"content":"<p>We will take all that on board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019073100002#U04300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Lee"},{"type":"speech","time":1564527600,"counter":460,"content":"<p>We are into the fourth hour of this meeting.

We are committed to doing that.  If one thing comes from this meeting, it is the need for us, as people who work in the services, as parents and with the responsibilities that we have under Children First, to report incidents and issues as they emerge.  This is paramount in terms of ensuring that we can protect children as early as possible.  Regulation works up to a point but the reporting of these matters is the critical thing that can allow us to take immediate action to protect children.  We have set out the additional powers that we think can help.  We can work successfully with the Department over a short period in order to put those in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019073100002#U04500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Smyth","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1564527600,"counter":463,"content":"<p>On behalf of the committee, I thank our guests for attending.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019073100002#V00200","speaker":"1300"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1564527600,"counter":464,"content":"<p>The joint committee adjourned at 1.20 p.m. sine die.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
