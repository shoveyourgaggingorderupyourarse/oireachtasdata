Despite the Government's best efforts, announcements and plans this crisis is, unfortunately, getting worse rather than better.  Research from agencies such as Focus Ireland has confirmed that an overwhelming number of homeless families had their last stable home in the private rental sector.  They had to leave those homes as landlords were selling up and an increasing number of property owners do not accept rent supplement.  The Government has already promised that by July families would no longer be accommodated in hotels.  Instead, families are being told that emergency accommodation is not available.<\/p>  <p>  Today we learn that 12 families, with 30 children, were told to go to Garda stations on Tuesday night.  Three of these families had been evicted recently and they presented to Store Street Garda station, while other families and their children presented to Pearse Street and Clondalkin Garda stations.  These families were already homeless and evicted when they presented to the Garda stations.  The families depend on bed and breakfast accommodation and emergency accommodation on a day-to-day basis.  The situation is bad enough but, unfortunately, the events on Tuesday have brought a very negative and extremely worrying turning point.  Hundreds of phone calls were made by Focus Ireland to bed and breakfast accommodations and to hotels for the families on Tuesday night.  For them, however, there was no room at the inn.  Some of the families ended up sleeping rough that night.  Mike Allen of Focus Ireland has said that what happened on Tuesday is unprecedented and shocking.<\/p>  <p> It is more than three years since Fr. Peter McVerry described the housing crisis as a humanitarian one.  There are 61,600 households that qualify for social housing and one in five of those have been on the list for five years.  There are more than 60,000 people in severe mortgage distress.  Nationwide, there are 7,472 homeless people and this number has now increased by 32% since March 2016.  One in three of those who are homeless are children.  There are 12,056 families, including 2,563 children, in emergency hotel and bed and breakfast accommodation.  In Dublin alone there are 138 rough sleepers.  Hotels are now getting busy as the tourism season moves along.<\/p><p>This has very negative consequences for short-term emergency accommodation provision.  Nobody accepts that this is normal, but what is the Government doing to prevent this becoming the norm, as appears to be the case, in how homeless families are dealt with?  If hotels are booked out, what plans have been put in place to arrange emergency accommodation?  Has more emergency accommodation than is currently available - as we witnessed as recently as last night and Tuesday night - been sought by Dublin City Council on a short-term basis?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052500003#A00200","speaker":"1217","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1495710300,"counter":8,"content":"<p>The Dublin Region Homeless Executive has overall responsibility for co-ordinating the response to homelessness on behalf of the four Dublin local authorities, as the Deputy is aware.  What happened on Tuesday night is unacceptable.  The demand for accommodation experienced on Tuesday night was exceptional.  It was out of the ordinary in comparison with the situation in 2017 to date.  In regard to what has happened since then, from last night, 24 May, Dublin City Council has more than doubled the volume of emergency contingency capacity that is available to any family that may present in an emergency situation.  Clearly, Garda stations are not suitable places for families to be directed to in any circumstances.  There is now additional emergency contingency accommodation for families, which includes large units that can accommodate families of up to six persons.  Last night, only one of these new additional contingency units was needed to accommodate a family.<\/p>  <p>  At the end of March, 870 homeless families were housed in commercial hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation in the Dublin region.  Statistics to be published later today show a reduction in the number of families in hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation.  I spoke to the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government this morning and he made clear that he wants to ensure that we will have supported and appropriate facilities in order that families will be in more suitable accommodation.  The Minister wants these facilities to be in place by mid-year.  Over &euro;15 million is being invested in eight new facilities that will offer appropriate services for up to 240 families.  Available at these places will be facilities for children, homework clubs and key workers and housing assistance payment, HAP, place finders will be on site.  Families will be able to look after themselves in these places.  Work on the facilities at Mater Dei on Clonliffe Road, Lynam's Hotel, High Park in Drumcondra, for which Respond! is responsible, Clontarf, Clonard Road in Crumlin, Ballyfermot, Dundrum and Coolock is well advanced.  The State is spending &euro;4.5 million on the Mater Dei development alone.<\/p>  <p>  Outside Dublin there will be facilities to accommodate 21 families in Cork and 18 in Limerick.

They are a welcome development in recent months, although they have come very late in the day.  I hope the pace of provision will be quickened such that there will not be a repeat of what occurred on Tuesday night.  When a similar situation arose two years ago, in response to being told that the law was not strong enough in respect of the obligation on Government regarding the provision of housing for homeless families - it is very clear in the context of provision for children - the Taoiseach said that the situation would not arise again and that there was no need to strengthen any legislation.  It is a damning indictment of him and his Government that, two years later, the situation has arisen again and the crisis has worsened.  Despite all the best laid plans and announcements the delivery of housing has not been what it should be.  Despite the introduction of rent pressure zones, rent costs are higher.  The home-to-buy scheme has done nothing but give rise to higher house prices, particularly in Dublin.  Regulation on costs to builders is exceptionally slow and social housing provision is wholly inadequate.  In addition, the provision of rapid-build accommodation has been woefully slow.<\/p><p>After a year in office and with the Government on the cusp of having a new leader, it is time to concentrate on the job at hand and provide the services, facilities and housing units people crave.

The Minister, Deputy Coveney, has indicated that the current legislation that defines legal responsibility for the provision of homeless services, including the provision of accommodation to a housing authority, does not require change.  I accept there is an extraordinarily big challenge in accelerating housing supply but Rebuilding Ireland has ensured that very many actions are under way, so that we can begin to see the supply that is needed and to provide the necessary accommodation.  Nine months into the implementation of Rebuilding Ireland, there is strong evidence that the focus on increasing and accelerating supply is starting to work.  Planning permissions for 16,375 new homes were granted in the 12 months up to the end of December, an increase of 26% year on year, and commencement notices for over 13,000 new homes nationwide were submitted in the 12-month period to the end of February 2017.

After six years in office, Enda Kenny's record speaks for itself.  According to the Central Statistics Office, in 2011 there were 641 homeless children but, last month, 2,563 children slept in emergency accommodation funded by the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  That is a 300% increase.  These figures do not include children in Tusla-funded domestic violence emergency accommodation or the children of hundreds of families trapped in direct provision after getting their leave to remain or children in emergency accommodation funded by the new communities unit.  In fact, the Government has no idea how many children will sleep in emergency accommodation tonight.<\/p>  <p>  There are 183,000 vacant homes across the State, 40,000 in Dublin alone.  That is 24 vacant homes for every single adult and child in emergency accommodation.  That is Enda Kenny's legacy.  He put the rights of the child into the Constitution and he put thousands of children into emergency accommodation.  His would-be successor, Deputy Coveney, has been Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government for a year and, contrary to what the T&aacute;naiste said, since taking office child homelessness has increased by 20%.  Every single month Deputy Coveney has held office, the number of people in emergency accommodation has increased.  Also during his tenure, the length of time children are spending in emergency accommodation has grown ever longer.  Last year, before he took office, the average time was 12 months but today it is 24 months.  Can the T&aacute;naiste imagine one of her own children or her grandchildren spending two long years in a hotel?<\/p>  <p>  To make matters worse, people are now expected to find their own emergency accommodation and 200 families are being forced by Deputy Coveney to self-accommodate on a night-to-night basis, shunted from one end of the city to another and not knowing if, tomorrow night, they will be forced to sleep on the streets.  We might have thought things could not get any worse but now it emerges that homeless families are being forced to sleep in Garda stations, and Deputy Cowen outlined what happened on Tuesday night in this respect.  How can the T&aacute;naiste stand over this?  How can the Government stand over what is effectively the abuse of thousands of children?<\/p><p>Does the T&aacute;naiste believe that the current situation is acceptable?

The Government has recognised this challenge and has taken every possible action to ensure that the people of whom the Deputy speaks are provided with appropriate homes as quickly as possible.  The most recent homeless figures are a reminder of the challenge we face in dealing with this problem.  Dealing with the challenge head on is what the Government has done.  Luckily, as the economy has improved due to careful and appropriate management, we are in a position to help the people of whom the Deputy speaks.  Rebuilding Ireland has allocated &euro;5.3 billion to the provision of 47,000 social homes.  The Government has recognised the seriousness of the situation outlined by Deputy &Oacute; Broin.  The Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, has particular responsibility for the issue.  The biggest budget ever allocated to dealing with these issues has been approved.  A range of social supports are being put into place to help the children of whom the Deputy speaks.  Significant additional resources have been allocated.  In budget 2017, approximately &euro;100 million was allocated to homeless services.  Nobody wants to see the situation described by the Deputy.  That is why we have prioritised dealing with it and that is why more houses are coming on stream and the rapid builds are developing and will deliver homes for people.  Over 3,000 households exited homelessness in 2016, which is the highest level ever.  This year, there is a much higher level of response and aspiration to deal with the issue.  As I have said, the Government is working on its commitment to exit homeless families from hotels by mid-2017 except in exceptional circumstances.  A very broad range of actions, including dealing with vacant properties across the country, are being taken by every local authority.  The housing assistance payment is providing help to families to exit homelessness.  Multiple initiatives have been taken because we recognise the seriousness of the situation.  However, we are coming from a position where there was no new housing supply for several years and no money to pay for it.

In some ways, it makes her defence of Government policy failures even more remarkable.  As the family homelessness crisis was spiralling out of control in August 2015, the Taoiseach, Deputy Kenny, stated \"If a family becomes homeless in Dublin this evening as a result of being moved out of a B&amp;B, ...the local authority ... will have the resources to supply emergency accommodation for that family.\"  Two years on from that statement, families are being left on the street or in Garda stations.

He is correct.  Some 12 families could not find emergency accommodation in this city.  Some 30 children could not be accommodated.  Families were sent to Garda stations for their safety.  Seven families spent the night in police stations as it was the only way they could find safety for their children.  Unsurprisingly, some of the families were concerned about the potential implications of doing so, and so three families slept in Fairview Park and another family slept in Merrion Square.

The budget has been made available, as the Deputy is well aware.  A variety of funding mechanisms are in place for buying up more homes.  There is a &euro;70 million fund with the Housing Agency to buy houses that are available and are considered suitable.  Each local authority has been asked to identify vacant properties.

This was despite the expenditure of tens of thousands in consultancy payments to a company to investigate the issue &ndash; a job that was never sent out to tender.<\/p> <p> Interestingly, the same interview panel that trawled the world before deciding N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan was the best person to replace Martin Callinan included Josephine Feehily, who, in her role as head of the Policing Authority, failed to recommend the removal of the Commissioner; it included Kathleen O'Toole, who yesterday indicated that she wanted to take the heat off N&oacute;ir&iacute;n; and it also included Vivienne Jupp, former executive at global management consultancy Accenture, a company that benefited from multimillion euro contracts with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Vivienne Jupp was also instrumental in establishing Cyril Dunne as chief administrative officer in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  He was among the first to be made aware of the Templemore scandal.<\/p> <p> Yesterday, the outgoing Taoiseach said that if a Minister were in charge of a calamity like that at the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, that Minister would be sacked immediately .  The T&aacute;naiste might find herself heading up a different Department in a few weeks' time.  The current Commissioner has given us more than enough proof that she is not the person to bring An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na forward.  These might be the last weeks of the T&aacute;naiste in the Department of Justice and Equality.  Will she not consider doing what needs to be done in the best interests of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  Legislation allows for the Minister for Justice and Equality to remove the Commissioner when it is in the best interests of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

He does so again and again.  I believe that we ought to observe due process.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of the commission, Kathleen O'Toole is a person of the highest calibre.  She is uniquely qualified to take on this task.  The other 11 members of the commission are all highly respected in their diverse fields.  We are fortunate that they have agreed to bring the wealth of their experience to the task of shaping the future of policing in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The Government, along with the support of many in the House, decided to establish the commission because we took the view that it was appropriate to examine a range of issues relating to all aspects of policing in Ireland.  As the Taoiseach mentioned yesterday, these include: whether the combination of State security and policing should be in the one force; an examination of management and the kind of management supports that are necessary within a police force to be equipped to deal with the challenges that, sadly, we saw in Manchester this week; and the other challenges from international criminal gangs and cybercrime.  These are all new challenges facing policing.  It is altogether appropriate that we decided to establish the commission.  It is fully independent and will, I believe, provide a useful service for the future of policing in the country.  That is the only job of the commission and that is the job that it will do.<\/p>  <p>  In the meantime, a vast amount of policing work needs to be done in the country, not least that which relates to international terrorism and the threat posed by those who carried out the appalling attack in Manchester this week.  There are many other policing challenges.  We should support An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the vital work of securing the peace and keeping our communities and citizens safe.  Of course, inquiries are being carried out by the Charleton tribunal and the Committee of Public Accounts.<\/p><p>I suggest that we await the outcome of these inquiries before there is any further comment on the particular issues they are examining.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052500009#G00200","speaker":"1214","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1495712700,"counter":41,"content":"<p>It is outrageous that they might use international terrorism to defend the present Garda Commissioner.

On 19 May 2017, Judge Keenan Johnson, presiding in the Circuit Court, expressed his displeasure, annoyance and frustration at being seriously misled by a garda.  The judge outlined in open court that on 7 June 2016, while sentencing a woman on drug offences committed on 2 June 2015, a garda purposely and deliberately misled the court.  This is the same drugs operation in which other garda&iacute; have been found to have had an involvement as a result of the protected disclosure of Garda Nick Keogh three years ago.

That happened for a number of reasons, one of which was absolute disregard for financial governance and fair practice.  I agree that the shortcomings in this case are very serious.  I agree that they are unacceptable.  It is infuriating for the public and we need to get to the bottom of it.  This fell far short of the standard impartial, unbiased and thorough investigation we demand and expect.<\/p>  <p>  With this in mind I have ordered a report from Mr. Drennan, the current director of the ODCE, into exactly what went wrong.  That has to be our starting point in our attempts to understand what exactly occurred.  We must know exactly what happened and exactly what failed, we must be open to any and all new measures and solutions to fix this and I do not accept that this is entirely an issue of funding and resources.  So as the Minister, as a Department, as a Government, as the D&aacute;il, we must now devise solutions, be they in areas of procedure, organisational change, enhanced powers or legislative change.  If the report leads me to conclude that we need an entirely new model, then so be it.  We owe it to those who suffered during the crash to never, ever allow something of this nature happen again.<\/p>  <p>  I am deeply frustrated and share the disappointment and annoyance felt by Members of the Oireachtas and the public following yesterday's ruling by Judge John Aylmer.  Judge Aylmer considered that, as a result of shortcomings in the investigative process undertaken by the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, he could not allow the charges go before the jury for decision.  As a result, Judge Aylmer directed the jury to acquit Mr. Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick of all charges against him.  I share the judge's view that the shortcomings identified are serious and unacceptable.  As the Minister inheriting this long drawn-out and difficult case, I intend to complete a full review and examine all possible options.  Nothing is off the table.<\/p>  <p>  This has been the longest running criminal case in the history of the State, at almost ten years, and has resulted in a significant legal bill to be footed by the taxpayer.  As the trial is now complete, I am in a position to comment and review the results.  As Members know, although I was briefed by my officials when I took office, I was totally precluded from commenting on any case before the courts.  Now, and immediately on hearing the ruling, I have acted.  Yesterday I formally requested the director of corporate enforcement to provide me with a full and detailed report under section 955(1)(a) of the Companies Act 2014.  This should address the chronology of events, the specific issues and criticisms raised by Judge Aylmer and any other relevant issues.  I expect this report to be provided to me as a matter of urgency, and no later than 23 June.<\/p>  <p>  The functions assigned to the director include enforcing and encouraging compliance with company law, investigating and prosecuting breaches of the Companies Acts, referring cases to the Director of Public Prosecutions for prosecution on indictment and exercising a supervisory role over the activities of liquidators and receivers.  As Members know, the Director of Public Prosecutions is charged with the prosecution of criminal offences and the DPP's office operates independently of Government.  Mr. Ian Drennan was appointed director of corporate enforcement in August 2012 and he is statutorily independent in discharging his compliance and enforcement role.  It is important to note that the criticisms directed at the ODCE by Judge Aylmer regarding the investigative procedures pre-date Mr. Drennan's appointment as director.  When Mr. Drennan took office, the file relating to the case of Mr. FitzPatrick had already been forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecutions who took the decision to prosecute.  However, when he was informed of particular difficulties in the case in May 2015, including the discovery of documents and the shredding of documents, he took immediate and appropriate action in informing the Director of Public Prosecutions of those matters.<\/p>  <p>  Following his appointment, Mr. Drennan undertook a review of the organisational structure and management of the ODCE, together with the staffing and skills mix available to him.  That review identified, in particular, a significant skills deficit in the area of accountancy expertise.  Following that review, the director sought and was granted sanction to recruit seven new forensic accountants.  Five accountants have now been recruited and the process of recruiting a further two is in progress.  Additionally, the director sought and received sanction to recruit a digital forensics specialist.  This specialist is due to start work next month.  The ODCE also has an approved complement of seven members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Vacancies exist for two of the Garda posts following retirements.  The secondment of garda&iacute; to the office is a matter for the Garda authorities and the director has been in communication with them to expedite these vacancies.  The ODCE has recently been advised that one of the vacancies is to be filled shortly.<\/p>  <p>  I now want to comment briefly on the trial.  Under the proceedings initiated by the Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr. Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick, the former chairman and chief executive of Anglo Irish Bank Corporation plc, was charged with 21 alleged breaches of section 197 and six alleged breaches of section 242 of the Companies Act 1990.  The trial in respect of Mr. FitzPatrick began on 13 April 2015.  A jury was sworn in, before whom Mr. FitzPatrick was arraigned on alleged breaches as outlined earlier.  I understand that substantial legal arguments, which included the issues regarding witness statements and shredding of documents, took place in the absence of the jury.  The trial judge delivered a ruling on the range of issues on 2 June 2015.  She discharged the jury and directed that a new trial be held in October 2015.  Subsequently, in August 2015, the High Court ordered that the trial date be deferred to 25 May 2016.  Mr. FitzPatrick's retrial in connection with those charges began before Judge Aylmer and a jury in the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court on 21 September 2016.  At that time, it was envisaged that the trial would be likely to conclude by the end of 2016.  However, the bulk of the court's time between September and December was taken up with legal arguments which were required to be dealt with in the absence of the jury, and in respect of which no reporting was permissible for that period.<\/p><p>I understand that many of the arguments again related to issues now in the public domain.  The trial continued and legal argument in the absence of the jury meant that the hearing of evidence began in December 2016.  On Wednesday 24 May, Judge Aylmer directed the jury to acquit Mr. FitzPatrick of all charges.  It is clear from Judge Aylmer's comments that there were serious and unacceptable deficiencies in the investigative practices used by the ODCE in this case.  In particular, the manner in which two witness statements were obtained and the shredding of documents were cited.  The judge&rsquo;s comments were highly critical and highlight a number of areas of concern.  I note that the ODCE has accepted the criticism directed at it by Judge Aylmer and outlined some of the actions it had already taken long before the ruling which addressed these criticisms.  These steps included the appointment of new professional experts and an assurance that investigative procedures now in place will prevent such a case arising again.  This assurance can be provided because members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will now take the lead on all criminal investigations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052500019#R00200","speaker":"1247","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1495718400,"counter":120,"content":"<p>Is it agreed that the Minister will have an additional minute to conclude her contribution?

As a result, people are being thrown out of their houses.  I have attended such hearings, as have many other Members in their role as constituency representatives, to observe and support people in the process.  It is always a case of a big bank or business against a small person.  This trial turned that concept on its head.  It was a case of the State taking on a big person.  In one respect, it was intended to give the perception that no one, no matter how big they are, can get away with breaking the law.  If a small man is prosecuted, the prosecution is inevitably successful.  The collapse of this trial is so shocking on many levels that people are disgusted that the State has shown a lack of capacity in terms of how to bring a successful prosecution.  The comments of the presiding judge in regard to statement contamination, witness coaching, the shredding of documents, and the presumption of guilt rather than innocence have been widely reported in recent days.  These are fundamental issues in bringing criminal prosecutions.  However, this case was approached in a botched manner.  This serious and grave issue needs to be sorted out and there needs to be a proper follow-through, which is the most important issue.<\/p>  <p>  The State's approach to prosecuting white collar crime needs to be considered.  Prosecutions can involve many organisations, such as the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Criminal Assets Bureau, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, the Revenue Commissioners, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Health and Safety Authority and, potentially, the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Local Government Audit Service.  These are some of the many agencies charged with trying to bring white collar crime to heel.  There is a scattergun approach to doing so, with no co-ordination or focus.  The result is evidenced by the FitzPatrick trial and the fallout therefrom.  A proper debate on co-ordinating the State's approach to tackling white collar crime is needed.  If it is necessary to bring in a serious fraud squad or serious crime agency similar to those that exist in the United Kingdom and other jurisdictions, then the State should take that step.<\/p>  <p>  We must be mindful of the damage done to Ireland's reputation by this trial.  Ireland's reputation was discussed in the context of a debate in the House regarding the Apple tax judgment.  Many commentators from outside of Ireland referred to it as the wild west in terms of playing fast and loose on tax policy.  For outsiders to see the collapse of a trial of such importance in the context of the calamity of the banking crisis and Anglo Irish Bank in particular is hugely disturbing.  When one adds what has happened in this trial to the perception that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have created for itself as a result of financial irregularities at the Garda College in Templemore, the credibility of the Garda is in tatters.  I say that with much regret.  That issue has been debated in the House on many occasions.  The credibility of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement is also now in tatters.  We have to pull together to mend this damage.<\/p>  <p>  Serious questions need to be asked of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  It is an independent office, as are many of the agencies of the State.  Unfortunately, its independence shrouds a lack of accountability in terms of the organisations' output.  Why was this case once again sent for trial following the collapse of the first trial in view of the many misgivings such as critical documents having been shredded?  More details in this regard will emerge in the coming weeks.  More accountability is needed, as is more questioning of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.<\/p>  <p>  The total cost of this saga needs to be revealed when the Minister has that information.  We know the cost of it to ordinary people who are struggling to keep their homes or on whom banks are foreclosing.  Those people are carrying the cost.  The State is now being asked to pick up the cost of this trial on the double, in particular through the free legal aid scheme.   It is of huge concern that the criminal side of the free legal aid budget is being drained, which is impacting on the provision of civil free legal aid.  An ordinary person such as a woman who has been battered by her husband or is estranged or is trying to recover a maintenance payment and needs to avail of free legal aid for that civil matter cannot be helped because the free legal aid budget is being drained by cases such as the FitzPatrick prosecution.  The expansion of the terms of reference of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland to allow it to examine the functioning of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement needs to be considered.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of resources needs to be addressed.  During Fine Gael's time in this Government and the previous, staff numbers in the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement fell from 43 in 2010 to 35 in 2016.  The Minister has alluded to a recent increase in its staffing level.<\/p>  <p>  Clear legislation is needed for accountancy bodies in terms of conflicts of interest.  The same lawyers were advising Ernst &amp;amp; Young on several cases, including the FitzPatrick trial, a case taken against Ernst &amp;amp; Young by the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC, and in terms of Ernst &amp;amp; Young's own regulatory environment.  The area of conflicts of interest of professional organisations and the belief that Chinese walls exist or are good enough need to be further fleshed out.<\/p><p>I trained as an accountant in Ernst and Young in Limerick when I left college over 20 years ago.  I am putting it on the record that I had no involvement in auditing any financial institutions.  We dealt with small businesses and manufacturing.  Separation and conflicts of interest should be key issues, and Ernst and Young have questions to answer here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052500020#S00400","speaker":"1221","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1495719000,"counter":124,"content":"<p>The collapse of the longest running criminal trial in history, involving charges against the former chairman of Anglo Irish Bank, represents a damning indictment of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.

The consequences of his actions over many years has left many families presenting themselves on a regular basis to a community welfare officer.

They are trying so hard to meet their financial obligations and the bank is not playing ball with them.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister has said that she will seek a report, which I welcome.

In relation to the Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick case, it is clear that the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement categorically failed in its mission to encourage adherence to company law and bring to account those who disregard that law.  The sheer incompetence shown in this investigation is shocking and totally unacceptable in this day and age.  Commonsense informs us that it is not appropriate for anyone to take statements from witnesses except an Garda, or to shred documents in the midst of a criminal trial.<\/p><p>The financial cost of this fiasco will be significant.  Leaving aside the price of a nine year investigation, this 127 day failed trial is estimated to have cost &euro;3 million alone.  As usual the taxpayer is left cleaning up the mess and picking up the tab.  If one thing is guaranteed in this State it is that the taxpayer will be left on the hook.<\/p><p>The loss to the citizens of Ireland is not just financial.  This situation also lead to an immeasurable loss of public confidence in politics and the legal system.  The State can be bankrupted and banks can collapse and no one is held to account.  However, if one does not pay the TV license one can expect the full rigour of the law to be applied.  Public opinion is firmly of the belief that criminal law will is applied differently depending on who one is and what his or her worth is.  This has to change.  People across the country are rightly outraged at the conduct of the recent court case.  The shambolic way in which the ODCE has dealt with white collar crime contrasts starkly with so-called welfare fraud.  Public taxpayers&rsquo; money is currently funding an advertising campaign which follows the usual hard right agenda in its attempt to stigmatise those unfortunately dependant on welfare and not simply the tiny minority who commit fraud.<\/p><p>I look forward to the Government&rsquo;s similar campaign to tackle white collar crime.  Minister Varadkar has defended his recent campaign saying social welfare fraud was a crime which should be punishable.  I agree with that, but where is the Government&rsquo;s campaign against white collar crime?  A crime that cost us billions of euro brought this county to the brink of ruin and into years of devastating austerity which has fractured families and whole communities across the State.  Everyone agrees that the agency established to investigate corporate crime is clearly not fit for purpose.  Surely the Government is to blame for that.  The ODCE is under-funded, under-resourced and not given the opportunity to be effective.  One has to wonder why this is the case.  The chief investigator in the case of the former chairman of Anglo Irish Bank unbelievably had no previous experience and he admitted in evidence that he made many fundamental errors, including the destruction of documents.  This occurred in what was anticipated to be one of the most important cases in decades in this country.  Given his lack of experience, who appointed him as chief investigator?  Who was he accountable to?<\/p><p>In 2005, 2006, and 2007 Fianna F&aacute;il refused requests from the office to increase its workforce by 20 people.  The office described its resources as wholly inadequate.  The then Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, dismissed their requests.  Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and Labour have all been in government since this investigation began in 2008, so it is hypocritical of Deputies from these parties to stand here and say more should have been done to avoid this outcome.  They had the opportunity in government to tackle white collar crime but they failed to address it and this is the result of their inaction.<\/p><p>My party colleague, Teachta Adams, yesterday reminded the D&aacute;il that the Government spends just over &euro;5 million on the Office of Director of Corporate Enforcement.  That is &euro;5 million to investigate white collar crime.<b><\/b>It is clear the ODCE was unprepared, under-resourced, without the necessary skill and unable and not fit for purpose for the type of investigation and prosecution it needed to undertake.  The Minister said before the Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation on 21 June last year that she was of the opinion that the ODCE was sufficiently funded.  Clearly this is not the case.  In light of the serious shortcomings this investigation and court case have highlighted, does the Minister stand by the statement she made?  As the ODCE comes under her remit, does she personally take responsibility for this shambles?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052500021#T00400","speaker":"1327"},{"type":"speech","time":1495719000,"counter":127,"content":"<p>Ireland does not do prosecution of white collar crime.  It is not just the collapse of the trial and the acquittal of Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick, but for decades now we have see that thread.  We have seen the underfunding of resources of agencies that are supposed to be tackling white collar crime.  We see staff resources being cut, and we see no legislative framework that should underpin a strong, robust, anti-corruption, anti-white collar crime agenda.<\/p>  <p>  My colleague spoke about the request the OCDE made.  It was established in 2001 as a result of the tribunals of investigation and the massive corruption that we saw in those tribunals.  They spanned three decades yet there was only one conviction for corruption.  This is despite the fact that we know that politicians were up to their necks with brown envelopes and despite the fact that we know that people had benefitted in terms of their own lifestyle as a result of backhanders given to people in influential places.  The Criminal Assets Bureau did not go in and seize the assets at that time because there is one rule for certain individuals and another rule for others.<\/p>  <p>  When the ODCE was established in 2001 within a number of years the director was requesting resources.  The director wrote to Mich&eacute;al Martin, who was the line Minister at that time in 2005, and continued to write to him over a period of time to tell him that the ODCE was wholly inadequately resourced.  Deputy Martin was the then Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and he refused the request.  At a time when tens of thousands of additional public sector workers were being acquitted not one additional staff member was given to the ODCE.  Bertie Ahern stood where the Minister is sitting today and said the ODCE needed to wait its turn.  At the same time Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick and his ilk were setting in train the economic disaster that people the length and breadth of this country had to endure over the last ten years.<\/p><p><i>2 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>It is a symbol of how this country deals with white collar crime.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies now tell us that Se&aacute;nie FitzPatrick should be behind bars and that he caused an absolute catastrophe.  A number of years ago, that party was appointing the same Se&aacute;nie FitzPatrick to the boards of State bodies.  The Fianna F&aacute;il leader of the day was out playing golf with him and taking advice from him on economics, sipping wine and sharing dinner.  I am really annoyed today because all we are going to do is go through the motions.  We have fake outrage about white collar crime from Fianna F&aacute;il, a party that refused to beef up this agency at a time when such action was needed.  We have the fake outrage of the Minister, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, even though the ODCE has dropped 25% of its staff since Fine Gael came into power in 2011.<\/p> <p> This is not the first time the Minister has heard about the shredding of documents and vital information, or if it is, by God, there is something really wrong.  We in Leinster House, along with everybody who is clued in, knew about that for quite a while.  Was there not a report required at that time?  There was no need to wait until the trial collapsed.  There was no need to wait to beef up the resources of the ODCE or to have a review of every single agency.  That is what happens in modern democracies.  That is what happens when people in suits take our economy and ruin our country.  The Government should have looked to see what agencies we have.  It should have done a review to see if they were fit for purpose and it should have strengthened them and beefed up our legislation.  That is not what happened.  The Minister says her Government presented the seven additional forensic accountants to the ODCE.  Even though that staffing request was made in 2013, they were not appointed until 2015, two years later.  The trial was ongoing at that time.  We only had one person who could actually forensically analyse data on a computer.  It is absolutely mind-boggling.  It is like something out of Monty Python.  This is how the State deals with white collar crime.<\/p> <p> Year after year, I have been challenging both the responsible Minister and the Taoiseach to conduct a complete review of white collar crime agencies in the State.  I requested a commission that would examine all our agencies to make sure they were robust enough and, crucially, to overhaul our legislation to make sure we are not only going after the minutiae.  These bankers, these people who wrecked our country, should rightly be behind bars.  Since we have not made it illegal to do what they have done, they are walking the streets of Dublin and elsewhere with smiles on their faces, able to get on with their lives.  Meanwhile, tens of thousands of people who were forced to emigrate or are in poverty or have lost their houses are suffering because of this misery.  This cannot be allowed to happen time and again.<\/p> <p> It is not just me making these points.  A senior barrister addressing the Bar Council said that a tin-pot dictator would blush at the type of system we have.  In 2012, Mr. Justice Kelly said of the Anglo Irish Bank trial that he was astonished to find there were only 11 garda&iacute; and eight members of the ODCE working on it, the biggest trial in the history of the State.  All the warning signs were there.  While there can be no forgiveness or excuse for what happened in the ODCE, it is simply wrong to hang that office out to dry.  The present Government and Fianna F&aacute;il before it underfunded and under-resourced the fight against white collar crime because some of their own people were up to their necks in it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052500021#T00500","speaker":"1288","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1495719600,"counter":129,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with my colleague, Deputy Burton.  I will take seven minutes if that is acceptable to the House.<\/p>  <p>  Anyone charged with investigating serious crime has two basic obligations.  The first is to assemble all the information needed to persuade a jury that the accused person has committed a crime.  The second is to maintain the integrity of that information and of the information-gathering process itself.  To acquire full information fairly and to preserve it is not hugely demanding.  We know very well that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na eventually learned hard lessons after a long succession of cases in which prosecutions were thrown out because the evidence could not be relied upon.  We now discover that another major body charged with the investigation of serious crime seems to have learned nothing about the basic obligation to comply with the law of the Constitution.<\/p>  <p>  We all know that the defendant in a criminal case has rights.  It is also important to remember that serious crimes are prosecuted in the name of the people and they, too, have rights.  Mr. FitzPatrick has not been convicted of any offence and is entitled to the benefit of his directed acquittal.  However, that does not prevent me and most right-thinking people from continuing to believe that company laws were breached in an egregious manner in the management of Anglo Irish Bank.  That was the case made on the people's behalf and we expected Mr. FitzPatrick and others to be required to answer it.<\/p>  <p>  Those whose duty it is to prosecute cases on the people's behalf owe a duty to the people to discharge that function professionally and competently.  This train wreck of a case seems to reveal staggering incompetence in how agencies of the State do the people's business.  We as public representatives are not just entitled but obliged to find out why this happened.  I have heard Professor Niamh Brennan, a distinguished author and academic with a lot of expertise in this area, caution that we should not throw the baby out with the bathwater.  That is fair enough.  I am sure the ODCE has done good work over the years.  In this particular case, however, the failures have been monumental.  I am concerned that there might be wider implications.  Our regulatory landscape has many bodies independent of Departments with powers to prosecute summary offences in their own name and to prepare serious prosecutions for the Director of Public Prosecutions.  After this omnishambles, I fear there is a risk that other bodies could repeat those mistakes.  I believe the review that must now inevitably follow must include an audit of the competence and capacities of all regulatory agencies that are capable of mounting investigations and prosecutions in criminal law.<\/p>  <p>  I repeat my earlier statement that I respect Mr. FitzPatrick's directed acquittal.  However, I do not believe that outcome should prevent a full examination as to how and why this happened.  The Minister proposes a referral under section 955(1)(a) of the Companies Act 2014.  Although that may be a reasonable starting point, it is far from meeting the requirements of this matter in full.  In essence, the Minister proposes to ask the director to give an account of his own stewardship, to give his own story.  What is really required here is a robust external review of what happened and how it happened.<\/p>  <p>  I have listened to Deputies talk about resources.  Although some people want to make political capital out of that issue, the issue of the million breath tests was not a resources problem.  Evidence is not shredded because of resources issues.  We must demand and expect high standards from those whom we pay well to do the people's business.  We need an independent investigation into the workings of the ODCE, a process that has already been called for by my colleague, Deputy Alan Kelly.  Once the investigators have completed a review of that body, they should be tasked with repeating the exercise for any other body that has been charged with the enforcement of criminal law.  That would include the HSE, the Health and Safety Authority, ComReg, the Central Bank and others.<\/p>  <p>  I hope the Minister will now propose a meaningful engagement with all of us in opposition on these matters.  We must have robust mechanisms to carry out investigations into matters that have rocked the foundations of the State.  Others have spoken about the economic catastrophe that the people have endured in recent years.  The people have marched through that horror story and have asked that things be put right in order that we can have an economic future.<\/p><p>Equally, they have asked for an accounting in order that those in the banking system who, through their actions or inaction, caused the economic catastrophe that befell our people - as well as those who were tasked with oversight and who failed in that - will be held to account.

It is fair to say that white-collar crime is not taken seriously in this country.

It has always been something of a holding job rather than a thorough job.  Consideration now has to be given, as it was at the time of the murder of Veronica Guerin, to the establishment of a criminal assets bureau for white-collar crime.  Nothing less will address the situation.  It must be seriously resourced, robust in its attitude and willing to take on all comers in respect of white-collar crime.

Ministers do not have day-to-day contact with officials in a quasi-independent autonomous section of the Department.  Did no one in the Department shout stop?  My colleague, Deputy Howlin, brought in whistleblowers legislation, which has changed all of that.  Where are the people in the Department who have come forward and advised the Minister?  I believe that all those involved in this shambles need to seriously consider their positions.<\/p>  <p>  By whom will this report be carried out?  The Minister should not tell me that it will be by one of the officials in the Department.  I do not believe that would be acceptable to anyone in the D&aacute;il.  I hope the Minister tells me it will be done by someone who is competent and who has the relevant expertise, maturity and experience.  The people who have handled this from the Department's side appear to have been people who probably were very good but whose experience all related to civil litigation and who seemed to have little or no experience with criminal prosecution.  The cost of this to Irish society is severe.<\/p>  <p>  I listened to Deputy Pearse Doherty.  I recall that Deputy Doherty was one of the people who voted for the bank guarantee.  He was proud to do that and he told us what a good fix it was for the people.  People are gutted by what has happened with regard to this trial.  It would seem now that the legal insiders were aware, by and large, that a second trial would have had little chance of success.<\/p>  <p>  I have seen the advertisements against social welfare fraud put on the buses by my successor in the Department of Social Protection.  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is listed as one of his supporters in the current discussions within her party.  Will the Minister please tell the Minister for Social Protection to save half of the &euro;250,000 that he has put into that campaign and divert it to white-collar crime?  Were he to do that, he might actually do the public in Ireland some service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052500023#V00200","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1495720200,"counter":132,"content":"<p>Deputy Coppinger is next.

Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies certainly must have to go to acting classes because trying to generate an emotion around these issues must be extremely difficult for them.  The same applies to those in the Labour Party who were in government with Fine Gael for years while this lack of pursuance took place.<\/p><p>I would love to say that the acquittal of Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick has been greeted by working-class people and ordinary people with collective outrage.  Actually, it has been greeted with a collective lack of surprise because there is little or no faith in the Minister or any of the majority parties in this D&aacute;il, to deal with this.<\/p><p>It is quite clear of late that there are elements of a banana republic around this State when we consider the crises with the Garda, the church and so on.  There is probably an element of disappointment on behalf of the Minister and some in the establishment in Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il and so on.  There is an argument that they needed to jail at least one significant person in connection with the bailout.  Lo and behold, one of those significant people has gone.<\/p><p>This investigation was foiled due to the historical subservience of the establishment to big business and the lack of concern about white-collar crime in general.  It simply confirms the view of many people that there is one law for white-collar crime and another for blue-collar crime; one law for the rich and another for the poor.  Indeed, there is no law for the rich &ndash; let us be frank.<\/p><p>It would appear that the only things senior bankers got sentences for were life sentences of fat juicy pensions.  Can the Minister point to how many people have been prosecuted in connection with the bank bailout?  I think the number could be counted on one hand &ndash; it is minuscule.  However, the downfall of the banks was caused by the cutthroat profit motive that exists in the banking sector.  The previous Government and the Government before that operated light-touch regulation in the sector.  They were quite happy to see vast profits being made by the banks with minimal regulation.  This led to extraordinary mortgages &ndash; of up to 40 years in some cases &ndash; being heaped on the back of ordinary people.  This was well documented by my colleague, Joe Higgins, in his minority report at the banking inquiry.<\/p><p>The Minister says she is serious about white-collar crime.  All these developers have now had their act cleaned up in NAMA.  Either they are back on their feet or they are getting back on their feet.  Some are even getting State hand-outs.  I am not referring to the land that the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, is talking about gifting.  I am referring to Activate Capital, which is getting money from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, and some of the big developers who were involved in the crash.  Not a word has been said about them.  It is all perfectly legal and there is nothing illegal about it.  Never before have so few people paid for such serious crimes.  Let us consider the toll taken on health, education and special needs services.  Only this morning the T&aacute;naiste invoked the excuse that we had no money for years and that was why we have a housing crisis now.  The State had money but it was put into the banks.  The amount was &euro;64 billion in total.<\/p><p>The Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement is a convenient scapegoat.  Obviously, what happened should be investigated and any incompetence should be dealt with but the office is completely under-resourced.  Is the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation for real?  Fifty people were investigating the biggest crime that took place in this country in a decade of austerity.  The staff in place were completely inexperienced when it came to dealing with criminal investigations.  The lead investigator was never involved in a criminal investigation.  Garda&iacute; were not in place to take statements from witnesses.  Of course, errors were made in the context of under-resourcing, staff numbers etc.<\/p><p>At the same time, however, many Garda resources were put into fighting people over the water charges.  A total of 200 people were arrested at the time.  Vast resources went in to challenging the people who were challenging austerity.  On the same day that Se&aacute;nie FitzPatrick was being led out into the lovely sunshine, ordinary people from Tallaght &ndash; I will not comment on the case, of course, because it is <i>sub judice<\/i>- who were involved in a protest over the very austerity that was resulting from this white collar crime were facing court.  I will not comment on the details but already one 16 year old has been criminalised for that, in stark contrast to what has happened to Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick.  That is not lost on people.  It is certainly not lost on the people who voted for the Labour Party, Fine Gael or Fianna F&aacute;il.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052500023#V00400","speaker":"1434"},{"type":"speech","time":1495720800,"counter":134,"content":"<p>The fact that Se&aacute;nie FitzPatrick, with his rotten and corrupt practices at Anglo Irish Bank, is walking away free is not a blunder; it is a set-up.

There is a direct line between Se&aacute;nie FitzPatrick's rotten, corrupt activities at Anglo Irish Bank and the families that are this week being sent to Garda stations or are sleeping in parks because no homes are available.  The establishment in this country has contrived and conspired to ensure that he walks away free.  It is an absolute scandal.<\/p>  <p>  Consider the facts.  An individual with no previous experience in criminal prosecutions is put in charge of the case.  He has never even taken statements from witnesses in a criminal trial.  In 2012, a judge presiding over the High Court's commercial list wonders why only 12 garda&iacute; have been assigned to the case.  However, nothing is done.  Some garda&iacute; are even moved to other cases.  In March 2011, the Minister with responsibility for trade is told in a report that there are irregularities in the way the investigation is being carried out.  In December 2010, a preliminary report was shown to the DPP making the DPP aware of the manner in which the statements were being taken, which was irregular.  Mr. O'Connell told the court that the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement changed its practice since he gave evidence in 2015.  Therefore, it knew, yet we only find this out now.  To me, all of it stinks.  Ministers, garda&iacute;, judges and the DPP knew there were problems, but nothing was done and he walks away free because of the apparent blunders of one scapegoated individual.  I do not believe it for a minute.  It is rotten and absolutely stinks to high heaven.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputy Coppinger said, the ordinary people on the street have been shafted by Mr. FitzPatrick and Anglo Irish Bank and the disaster inflicted on the country rolls on.  The property assets that these people bankrolled with gambling and speculation were handed over to NAMA and then handed back to vulture funds and to some of the same developers who are now evicting people, resulting in a homelessness catastrophe.  One of the chief architects of this walks away and we are told it is because of a mess up in the investigation.  I do not believe it is primarily to do with resources in the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, although that is part of it.  That is part of the ongoing fact that there is one law for the rich and one law for the poor in this country.  This situation is perpetuated and protected by Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il and the establishment in this country.  However, I think it is worse than that.  I believe that many people in government and in the State knew that this was going to collapse and they let it collapse.  They let it run to this point so that Mr. FitzPatrick would get off.  The people have been shafted yet again.  The economy and people's livelihoods were destroyed and we have a housing crisis that rolls directly on from it, yet one of the chief architects walks away.  How convenient.  If anyone believes that this is a blunder, a mistake, a resource issue or the result of one individual not being able to cope with the stress, he or she must be living in fantasy land.<\/p>  <p>  I do not believe the Government's fake tears.  It must have known it.  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation was not present but her Department must have known because we have been told that there was a report stating there were problems in how the evidence was gathered.  It stinks to high heaven.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052500024#W00600","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1495720800,"counter":140,"content":"<p>If committing a crime in Ireland, wear a suit.  The chances of being caught are probably directly proportionate to the price of the suit worn.  Given media reports, the only source of information available to the House until today, which says a lot in itself, it is beyond credible that the Government could be surprised at the collapse of the case.  It appears that journalists covering the case, who were restricted in their reporting, were fully aware that the case would be dismissed.  For the Government to state now that it wants a report on this from the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement is far too little far too late.<\/p>  <p>  I raised the question of white collar crime during Leaders' Questions last week and highlighted that the staffing levels at the ODCE had fallen by more than 18% since 2010 and that the number of garda&iacute; working in the office has been reduced by 24.5%.  At one point, there was only one garda seconded to the ODCE, while 20 garda&iacute; are working in the Department of Social Protection.  This shows where the priority lies in detecting crime and who Fine Gael sees as being the criminals.  However, it is not only Fine Gael who do not see crooks in suits as a problem.  Fianna F&aacute;il told the ODCE, when it highlighted it was under-resourced, to get in line in 2007.  In 2015, when the first case collapsed, Deputy Howlin was the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and sat at the Cabinet table.  What did they do then?<\/p>  <p>  It is estimated that Ireland loses about &euro;2.5 billion a year from economic crime.  That is &euro;25 billion over the past ten years.  However, that is okay because they are the people who buy tables at party fund-raisers.  Today the Minister announced that this will be investigated and lessons learned.  We already know what is wrong.  It has been pointed out by the ODCE itself and by the Garda Inspectorate.  The question is one of resources.  However, we also now have to ask what was known all along about this case.  The chronology of some of the events have been outlined by Deputy Boyd Barrett.  The Minister outlined in her response the steps that have been taken by the ODCE.  I wonder when these steps started?  Was it after June 2015 when the first case collapsed?  Why was the second case taken?  Why was there a second prosecution?  The same evidence was to be used and presented, yet the Government and the DPP, knowing it would collapse, allowed a second prosecution to go ahead. <\/p>  <p>  In 2015, the Garda Inspectorate report noted that the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation was struggling to manage the volume of suspicious financial transactions forwarded as part of money laundering and terrorism financing legislation.  The report also found that the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation is investigating serious fraud without always having the skills and resources to conduct a thorough investigation.  This shows the Government's priorities.  It will go after and hound those in receipt of social welfare.  Fraud does take place there but these people have nothing and will have nothing at the end of it.  The people the Government is letting go and not targeting, however, are those who will walk away wealthy, with big pensions and with their names and freedom intact.  <\/p>  <p>  Other parties in the House are saying that we need an anti-corruption agency. In his leadership pitch, the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, is saying that he will establish one.  However, do we really need another agency or board and an inordinate delay in its establishment that allows politicians to say that they are dealing with the issue?  We do not.  We need the Government to act and to do what it knows needs to be done.  We already have the agencies; we have just never taken them seriously.  We have never made them work on behalf of the citizens of the country.  The potential savings for our society are huge at more than &euro;2.5 billion a year, against which the amount of social welfare fraud that takes place in the State pales into insignificance.<\/p>  <p>  The most important question is when the Government will show our citizens that the criminal law is not only a law for the poor and the defenceless.  When will it begin to address the scandal and start targeting those crooks in suits?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052500024#W00700","speaker":"1366"},{"type":"speech","time":1495720800,"counter":141,"content":"<p>I too am delighted to be able to speak today although it saddens me to have to speak.  The former director of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, Mr. Paul Appleby, has declined to comment on whether he will co-operate with the report and audit into the agency's role in the trial of Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick.  Let us think about that.  Mr. Appleby has received retirement benefits worth almost &euro;590,000 since he retired five years.  Controversially, he retired early on an annual pension of &euro;73,000 on top of a &euro;225,000 lump sum, most of it tax free.<\/p><p>I thank the judge and the jury in the case for staying so long.  I thank the judge and all juries that give their valuable time.  I thank the judge because if the trial ended long ago, we would not know any of this.  This particular judge has done a great service to the State.  People are criticising him for going on so long with it but he has done a powerful service to the State.  There was a media blackout for an awful lot of it.  We would not know anything about it.  I thank him from the House on behalf of the people of Tipperary.<br\/><br\/>The Minister said people have suffered.  There are shortcomings in the report.  If the Minister's meagre answer is that it fell short, it is pathetic.  What went wrong?  It is all very wrong.  It was wrong from the start.  Mr. Appleby was in the Competition Authority where he took on cases.  The solicitor was involved with CRH.  There is a long history here of abject failures to act and control big business when CRH was crushing small people in my county.  They were good, honest, family business people who gave huge employment as their people before them.  CRH wanted a monopoly.  Writing to the Competition Authority was like writing to Santa Claus.  At least one gets something from Santa Claus.  One got sweet Fanny Adams - excuse the expression - from the Competition Authority or any of those authorities.  It is all a racket.  They all get bought into it.  They are all self-serving and they serve the big business.  To hell with the ordinary people.  They came from the Competition Authority<font color=\"#FF00FF\"><\/font>and were appointed across to this so-called agency.  It is another quango that has done nothing for the people.  It has done nothing to explain the cost.  We are going to give a fat pension to the head of it for five years.  Then we have a solicitor who was with the Competition Authority and the DPP for years and now he is the main man who drafted all the statements incorrectly and took the statements incorrectly.  I wonder how many people were charged under this solicitor's watch in the DPP's office in the past.  If he is so incompetent to make such a monumental cock-up, what about the people who were prosecuted?  I happen to know of somebody the ODCE prosecuted.  He was a developer in Dublin who had an apartment block.  He was brought before the courts, severely treated and fined &euro;10,000 for not holding management meetings.  It is a case of who and what people are, as Deputy Pringle said.  It is a case of who people are and who they know.  This is outrageous.  It stinks from the high heaven.  There has been no appetite since I came in here in this or the previous Government to tackle this issue.  If there was, we would give them the resources.  We would give them all the resources they want.<br\/><br\/>We saw last night Caranua getting the resources and what is it doing with them?  It is setting up headquarters and appointing CEOs and a clatter of staff.  The public person it was supposed to represent has been dismissed and diminished.  We will celebrate the<font color=\"#FF22FF\"><\/font>centenary of the Soloheadbeg ambush in a year and a half's time and the men who fought to give us our freedom.  They are turning in their graves because we have been raped and plundered by big business and the systems that are supposed to protect the people.  Senior officials the whole way across the board have become self-serving.  It is all about career promotion and then they might be seconded someplace else, retire and go in as advisers and consultants the week after.  It is rotten.  It is a merry-go-round and it is rotten.<br\/><br\/>The ordinary people I represent on a daily basis are crying in anguish.  They are sick and traumatised and many of them have gone to their grave by suicide because of the cock-up that happened with the banks in this country, because of the vulture funds and because of Mr. FitzPatrick and all of those people.  This charade has been going on for ten years now.  I thank the judge for keeping it going on long enough to find out the information.  I have been down to the courts with families.  I have been in the banks with families.  They are merciless to those people.  They are mercenaries who have no mercy or understanding for people.  I call them mercenaries because that is what they are.  That is what the officials in this case are too.  They are not doing their job.  They have a duty to be held to account.  Mr. Appleby may not co-operate.  He will probably get immunity like the official who shredded and burned all the files.  He went down to St. John of God's, God help us.  He may be ill and he has immunity from prosecution.  It would not be in a Mills and Boon novel.

There has been one prosecution after 25 or 30 years.  It is a joke.  As I said, the solicitor went off from the DPP's office and we are told now he could not take a statement.  He was unable to take a statement and he was working in the DPP's office for years and probably decades.  Company law here is clearly smashed and broken by Anglo.  We all know that.

With regard to small business, yes, there is law but Deputy Pringle is right that the price of one's suit dictates who one knows and what one knows and it has not changed under this Government or this Taoiseach.  The Taoiseach is retiring now and going off into the sunset.  I wish him well in that.  I do not wish him ill-health but we need an audit of all the regulatory bodies because they are not regulatory bodies.  They are just compliance bodies.  They are regulatory bodies for the ordinary people.  There Inland Fisheries (Amendment) Bill 2017 is being forced at the moment.  People who went out to clean rivers to stop bridges being taken away were prosecuted illegally by the fisheries board.  We are passing legislation with gusto to make it legal retrospectively.  They were fined.  Some of them had to go to court three times and pay thousands of euro to barristers and solicitors.  They were found guilty and named and shamed in the paper illegally.  We cannot do anything with these people because they are too powerful.  We just play games with them.  It is on the agenda for next week finally to pass the Inland Fisheries (Amendment) Bill 2017.  Honest people were trying to ensure rivers were safe and clean and that fish could live in them.  They were trying to save roads, bridges and properties.  They were prosecuted illegally by men in suits waving badges at them and now we are passing legislation here to make it legal.  It stinks from high heaven.

However, the fragmentation of our institutions and organisations continues and it is clear they cannot cope with the issues they face.<\/p> <p> The website of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, features the following statement: \"The mission of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement is to improve the compliance environment for corporate activity in the Irish economy by encouraging adherence to the requirements of the Companies Acts, and bringing to account those who disregard the law.\"  The office clearly failed in its mission in the recent court case. <\/p> <p> I had dealings with the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement when I was dealing with the issue of Siteserv, when there was definite evidence of a spike in the price of shares in a company that was heavily indebted.  My contact with the office involved letters being sent back and forth on this matter.  I was informed by the ODCE that it had no role in the matter and did not hold this type of information.  If insider trading is not related to corporate responsibility, I do not understand the meaning of corporate responsibility.<\/p> <p> In 2015, the Social Democrats sought to bring a solution to the table when we called for the establishment of an independent anti-corruption agency.  We studied examples of similar agencies operating in other countries and made a proposal in the D&aacute;il in December 2015.  After our proposal was voted down by Fine Gael and the Labour Party, we persisted with calls for an anti-corruption agency and undertook extensive work on how such an agency would operate.  Examples of such practice internationally informed our research.  Two years after we first introduced this idea, the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, has decided to adopt certain aspects of it.  However, he advocates that the agency should only operate in respect of the public service.  If the recent case demonstrates anything, it is that such an agency should not only apply to the public service. <\/p> <p> A functioning anti-corruption agency would prevent, investigate and prosecute corruption.  Given that we have far too much fragmentation, the new agency would consolidate agencies charged with tackling corruption and strengthen the legislative framework in which they operate.  It would help to rebuild trust and renew public and international confidence in Ireland as a place in which to do business - not dodgy business but clean and honest business.<\/p> <p> When I was dealing with the Siteserv issue and the IBRC debacle, I was contacted by a remarkable number of people from the business world.  What they wanted was to be able to operate in a country that was a fair and honest place in which to do business.  They did not believe Ireland was such a place.  To give an example, the report on the Garda training college in Templemore states that Garda staff assigned to administrative roles in the college had no training or experience in administration and no knowledge of public procurement or financial procedures.  When this can occur in the college that trains garda&iacute;, is it any wonder we do not take white-collar crime seriously at any level?  What is required at political level is fundamental change, rather than postponing action until some time in the future. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052500025#X00600","speaker":"1226","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1495722000,"counter":149,"content":"<p>What is most frightening, worrying, alarming and shocking is the basic lack of competence that has been revealed in this case.  Given that the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has ultimate responsibility for the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, the Minister and her officials have questions to answer.  How did we end up with an agency that was not competent to do its most critical task?  I do not believe the answer is related to a lack of resources.  Six or seven years ago, towards the end of the Green Party's time in government, we requested a meeting with the then Director of Corporate Enforcement and specifically asked him whether the office had the resources it needed to carry out the critical task of identifying, among the carnage left by the banking crash, whether cases could be brought that would restore public confidence in the idea that inappropriate corporate activities would have consequences.  We were given a clear and categorical commitment that resources were not a problem.  I understand from reading more recent accounts that at critical times in the process, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement was offered additional resources at every turn to manage what everyone knew would be some of the most critical cases in the history of the State in terms of restoring and building confidence in the judicial system.<\/p>  <p>  For the past six or seven years, everyone has known that maintaining and restoring public confidence in the State has been one of the most important tasks facing us.  What was revealed in the judicial decision to pull the recent case is incredibly worrying.  While we must maintain due process in the judicial system, one of the strengths of this country, we must also ask why an agency utterly failed in its task to build an investigation in a proper, legal and considered manner.  As well as the view that some people got away with things in the crash because we were unable or unwilling to prosecute, there is also a concern that from now on, the rest of the business world will conduct its activities without fear of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.<\/p>  <p>  Change is required.  The Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement must maintain a rigorous guard over the accountancy profession, which failed completely before the crash to identify widespread inappropriate and illegal lending.  In the legal profession, solicitors were signing off and approving conveyancing and documents where there was not proper title or the paperwork was incomplete.  The legal system must know that the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement is an A-rated, top-quality agency which always does its job.  I am certain the profession does not believe that is the case today.  Last but not least, the banking system must know that the final arbiter, namely, the courts, is in a position to completely hammer out illegal activity in the banking system.  That faith has been shattered by the judgment delivered this week. <\/p>  <p> The Department, as the parent body of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, has a responsibility to find out why the agency was not competent to do its job.  The Minister must present clear mechanisms for restoring public confidence in both the ODCE and the judicial system and ensuring business people know they are operating in an environment in which ethics and the rule of law apply.  This must be done quickly because once public exasperation sets in, it is very hard to win back confidence.  We will start winning back public confidence by ensuring the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement is competent but that notion was blown out of the water this week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052500026#Y00200","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1495722000,"counter":150,"content":"<p>We will now take questions and answers for 20 minutes.

It is usual practice for garda&iacute; to question witnesses and take statements.  They should have done so in respect of the EY auditors, who were questioned by Mr. O'Connell himself.  In his evidence, Mr. O'Connell stated that the garda&iacute; did not do it because, according to them, they were \"flat out\" working on other Anglo probes.  What were those probes that were more important than this investigation into the activities of Mr. FitzPatrick and his loans?  When an Garda assistant commissioner received a letter in June 2015 informing him that garda&iacute; were not involved in taking these statements, why did the Garda not act?  Will the Minister admit that the assurance that the Garda will act as the lead in all criminal investigations from now on bears no weight, given its criminal failure to deal with this matter?<\/p>  <p>  I have a question on the role of EY in this situation.  Is the Minister's Department or any other still hiring EY, giving it contracts and paying it for reports and advice?  EY gave Anglo Irish Bank a clean bill of health just before the crash and the firm was taken on again to give advice and help in investigating the causes of the crash.  Along with other elites and parts of the clique of the Irish wealthy and powerful, such as Goodbody, PwC etc., EY is part of the nexus of the rich and powerful, which Deputy Boyd Barrett referred to, who view it as their job to protect one another and their golden boys such as, for example, Mr. FitzPatrick.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052500027#Z00100","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1495722600,"counter":152,"content":"<p>Did the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, at any time before or during the collapsed trial that is the subject of this discussion or during the previous collapsed trial raise issues with the Minister directly or with her Department about its capacity or the capacity of the DPP to mount the cases on behalf of the State?

Therefore, the then Minister knew.  Will the Minister, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, confirm that the then Minister knew and explain why alarm bells did not ring?  We were told the DPP in December 2010 was made aware of the manner in which the statements were taken to some extent, so the DPP knew there were problems with how statements were being taken.

As Deputies are aware, the Government published the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman Bill 2017 on 10 May and today's Second Stage debate on the general principles of the Bill is a positive step in the progress of this significant legislation which deals with a number of important issues for consumers of financial services and pensions.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill will amend, update and consolidate into one Bill all of the legislation underpinning the Financial Services Ombudsman and the Pensions Ombudsman with the aim of forming a unitary structure and amalgamating the Financial Services Ombudsman and the Pensions Ombudsman into the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.  The Government decision to amalgamate both offices follows the recommendation of a critical review under the public service reform plan.  In the drafting of the Bill, the Department undertook a full regulatory impact analysis, including a public consultation process along with a series of consultations with relevant stakeholders - both public and industry representatives.<\/p>  <p>  The Financial Services Ombudsman is an independent statutory officer who deals with unresolved complaints from consumers about their dealings with regulated financial services providers.  The statutory role of the Pensions Ombudsman is to investigate complaints of financial loss due to maladministration and disputes of fact or law relating to occupational pension schemes, trust retirement annuity contracts and personal retirement savings accounts.  The Pensions Ombudsman performs these functions independently and acts as an impartial adjudicator.  Given that financial investments and pensions are increasingly becoming intermingled, the merging of these two offices will provide a simpler process for consumers who will have a one-stop shop for complaints on the a wide range of products falling within the two general areas.<\/p>  <p>  Since the Government agreement on the outline heads of Bill, both offices have been physically merged in one location on Lincoln Place.  In addition, recent legislative changes under the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2015 have enabled the appointment of the Financial Services Ombudsman, Mr. Ger Deering, as Pensions Ombudsman in May of 2016.<\/p>  <p>  The detailed heads of Bill underwent pre-legislative scrutiny on 27 October 2016, along with a Sinn F&eacute;in's Private Member's Bill on the Financial Services Ombudsman, namely, the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland (Amendment) Bill 2014.  I welcome the scrutiny report of the joint committee which has provided a useful service to this House.  I am particularly glad that the report recognises the improvements for consumers the Government's legislation will bring to financial investments and pensions.  The report, in its analysis of the general scheme of the Bill, recommended changes in the heads that would bring further clarity to its proposals.  I have reviewed the committee's recommendations and I assure Deputies that these recommendations have been addressed in the published Bill, where it proved feasible to do so.  I look forward to discussing the detailed provisions on Committee Stage.<\/p>  <p>  In drafting this legislation, the Department of Finance reviewed the legislation underpinning the Pensions Ombudsman - the Pensions Act 1990, inserted by the Pensions (Amendment) Act 2002, and the Financial Services Ombudsman, Part 7 of the Central Bank Act 1942, as inserted by the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act 2004.   The published Bill is more comprehensive and provides for a number of improvements to the existing legislation.  First, it amalgamates the Offices of the Financial Services Ombudsman and Pensions Ombudsman.  Second, and most importantly, it consolidates and updates the legislation, including the extension of the time limits for complaints.  I will now outline the key features of the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  Part 1 deals with preliminary matters.  As is the normal practice, this Part contains definitions of terms used throughout the Bill.  An important definition is that of a financial services \"consumer\" which is defined as meaning in general terms individuals, small businesses - sole traders, partnerships and companies - charities, clubs and so on.  Small businesses are those businesses with an annual turnover of &euro;3 million or less.  Part 1 also sets out the power of the Minister for Finance to make regulations and outlines the type of regulations he can make, including the ability to specify additional classes of persons who may make a complaint to the ombudsman.<\/p>  <p>  Section 3 sets out the new dual funding structure of the merged body.  The existing levy on financial services industry is maintained, but it should be noted that moneys will continue to be received from the Oireachtas in so far as they relate to the investigation of complaints regarding pension providers, reflecting the current funding of the Pensions Ombudsman.<\/p>  <p>  Section 5 refers to Schedule 1, which lists all the legislation and statutory instruments to be repealed and revoked on the relevant commencement date.  We are repealing the Part VIIB of the Central Bank Act 1942 and Part XI of the Pensions Act 1990 which set up the respective ombudsman offices originally.<\/p>  <p>  Part 2 establishes the Office of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.  Part 2 also gives the Minister for Finance the power, by order, to appoint a day as the establishment day for the Office of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.  This Part provides that the power to appoint the ombudsman and deputy ombudsman will be the responsibility of the Minister for Finance, having consulted with the Minister for Social Protection, from a list of candidates following a Public Appointments Service competition.  This Part also sets out the functions of the ombudsman and deputy ombudsman, the terms of their employment, and the ability to remove the ombudsman from office on certain grounds.  Terms and conditions of the staff of the office, including consultants and advisers or both working in the office, are also dealt with under this Part.  Their obligation to deal with information confidentially is also covered.<\/p>  <p>  Section 18 outlines the power of the ombudsman to exchange information with the Central Bank of Ireland or the Pensions Authority as appropriate, which is a very important provision that we have reproduced from the original legislation.  Part 2 also sets out the accounting and reporting requirements of the office, including the accountability of the ombudsman to the Committee of Public Accounts and other Oireachtas committees.<\/p>  <p>  Part 3 sets out the functions that are to be dissolved or transferred to the new bodies, including transitional provisions pertaining to staff, accounts and the council.  Specifically, Chapter 1 dissolves the former Financial Services Ombudsman's Bureau, the Financial Services Ombudsman Council and the Office of the Pensions Ombudsman.  All of the functions that were vested in the Financial Services Ombudsman or the Pensions Ombudsman are, on and from the establishment day, to be transferred to the ombudsman.<\/p>  <p>  All reference in enactments to the Financial Services Ombudsman Bureau and the Office of the Pensions Ombudsman are to be taken as references to the new Office of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman upon establishment day.  All land and other property, and rights and liabilities, and records that belonged to any of the dissolved bodies are to be transferred to the office under Chapter 1 of this Part.<\/p><p>Chapter 2 transfers staff and superannuation from the dissolved bodies to the new office.  Chapter 3 deals with the final accounts and annual reports of the dissolved bodies.<\/p> <p> Part 4 establishes the new Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman Council.  To reflect the changing workload of the council, the Bill reduces its membership from a maximum of ten members to a maximum of seven.  One member is required to have pensions experience, while one will need to have financial services knowledge, and now at least two members must have knowledge of consumer protection or consumer issues.  The members will be appointed by the Minister from a short list of more than three persons following a competition by the Public Appointments Service.  One member with pensions experience will be nominated for appointment by the Minister for Social Protection.  The Minister for Finance shall appoint a chairperson from among members of the council.<\/p> <p> In the context of the amalgamation of the two bodies, the Minister for Finance has maintained the prominent oversight role the council plays but has made some changes.  He proposes to remove the regulation-making power of the council with respect to how the ombudsman operates.  Instead, the Minister, rather than the council, will have the regulation-making power under section 4 relating to the operation of the Office of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.  This can be done either on the Minister's own initiative or at the request of the ombudsman, having consulted with the council and the ombudsman.<\/p> <p> The council will continue to keep the efficiency and effectiveness of the office under review, but it will no longer be responsible for the appointment of the ombudsman or deputy ombudsman.  The council will maintain its role in approving the draft statement of accounts prepared by the ombudsman, before they are to be submitted to the Minister for Finance.  A notable change in the legislation is the new funding structure of the amalgamated body, part-industry for financial services complaints and part-Exchequer for pension complaints.  For that reason, the council will continue to determine and prescribe by regulation, the levies or fees to be paid to the ombudsman by financial services providers.  Further provisions in respect of the operation of the council are set out in Schedule 2.<\/p> <p> Part 5 outlines the type of complaints that can be made to the ombudsman and the format in which they should be submitted.  In the context of the conduct of a financial services provider, a person can complain about: the provision of financial services; an offer of financial services; or failure to provide financial services.  Regarding the conduct of a pension provider, a person can complain about financial loss or a dispute in respect of pensions.  Part 5 also sets out some practical arrangements such as the provision for a complaint to be continued on the death of a complainant.  This is a new provision for financial services complaints.<\/p> <p> Section 47 outlines the powers of the ombudsman regarding an investigation and section 48 sets out transitional provisions for the investigation of complaints that were made before establishment day.  Section 50 sets out rules in respect of the option of staying of court proceedings where a complaint is being investigated by the ombudsman.<\/p> <p> Part 6 outlines the complaints procedure that consumers will be subject to once the Bill is enacted, including the most significant change in the legislation.  This change relates to an extension to the time limits applicable for complaints to the ombudsman, which I will outline in a moment.  Section 50 outlines the matters within the jurisdiction of the ombudsman.<\/p> <p> It is worth noting that some significant changes are proposed in this Part of the Bill.  For example, it contains provisions for the ombudsman to adopt rules of procedure with regard to dealing with complaints and to publish the rules.  The changes have been proposed with the intention of providing more clarity and certainty for the consumer about the process for dealing with complaints and it will also help them to understand what to expect when the ombudsman is dealing with a complaint.<\/p> <p> The Bill outlines the steps involved in the resolution of a complaint ranging from internal dispute resolution to investigation of the complaint by the ombudsman.  There are related provisions in respect of mediation and adjudication.  The Minister for Finance is retaining the requirement for consumers to first try to resolve the matter with the internal dispute process of the provider of the financial or pension product.  However, the Minister is now allowing the Ombudsman to waive the internal dispute process in certain cases such as when the ombudsman determines a complaint is of such importance as to warrant waiving the process.  This also means that in cases where the provider may be seen to frustrate the process, the ombudsman can intervene.<\/p> <p> I wish to emphasise the fact that the Bill continues to provide for mediation as a tool for the ombudsman in cases where he sees fit, while at the same time strengthening the role of the ombudsman in promoting engagement in the mediation process.  A key feature of the legislation is the increased communication between the ombudsman and complainants.  Under the proposed provisions, once the ombudsman has considered a complaint, he may now issue a preliminary decision which will indicate the potential decision to be made and the evidence considered in arriving at this.  This will ensure that all parties to a complaint will be aware of developments in respect of it and will have the opportunity to ensure that the ombudsman has all evidence necessary for making a final decision.<\/p> <p> Part 6 also sets out the redress available to consumers.  The ombudsman can direct a financial services provider to pay compensation of up to &euro;250,000 and he can also direct other measures, for example, rectification.  Such rectification can be very significant as it can involve putting a person back to the position in which they previously were before the complaint arose.  Part 6 also details the manner in which the ombudsman can publicise decisions which is a new measure to increase transparency for consumers and providers.<\/p> <p> Section 51 sets out the new time limits applicable to complaints made to the ombudsman.  The current legislation prohibits the Financial Services Ombudsman from examining any aspect of a complaint where the conduct being complained of occurred more than six years from receipt of the complaint in his office.  Extensive research was undertaken by the Department into designing the most appropriate time limit achievable within the law that would provide the necessary protection to consumers over the longer term.  In this regard, my Department engaged with stakeholders, analysed views received from the public consultation process, and sought advices from the Office of the Attorney General on this issue.<\/p> <p> The Bill extends the time limits for complaints in respect of certain long-term financial services to the same time limit that currently applies to pension products, namely, six years from date of the conduct complained of or three years from the date the complainant knew or ought reasonably to have known about the conduct.  The rationale for this expansion is that those who have long-term financial services, may not become aware of an event to be complained of, until their service or product matures and they should have some access to the ombudsman at that stage.  Long-term financial services are, in basic terms, services that exceed five years and one month.<\/p> <p> The new time limits for long-term financial services will apply to complaints made to the ombudsman about conduct that occurred during or after 2002 and the service in which complaint is about must not have expired or otherwise been terminated more than six years before the date of complaint.  This 15-year period, that is, from 2002 to 2017, is inspired by the long stop recommended by the Law Reform Commission, which was considering a new discoverability time limit for personal injury claims.  The introduction of a long stop prevents the opening up of stale cases and gives some certainty to the parties as to the cut-off time for bringing actions.  The Bill also provides an extra discretion to the ombudsman to extend the time limit that would benefit consumers of long-term financial services and pensions in cases where it is just and reasonable, similar to the provision that currently exists for pensions complaints.<\/p> <p> Part 7 sets out the rules relating to appealing decisions of the ombudsman to the courts and court applications.  The steps involved in appealing a decision of the ombudsman to the High Court on a point of law are detailed under this Part.  Furthermore, Part 7 deals with the ability of the Circuit Court to enforce a direction of the ombudsman and the ability of the latter to refer a question of law to the High Court.  Finally, Part 7 includes transitional provisions for appeals in the court system of complaints already in the system before establishment day.<\/p> <p> Part 8 outlines some other transitional provisions for the saving of regulations made by the former council and the transfer of functions from the Financial Services Ombudsman Bureau to the Office of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.<\/p> <p> Part 9 contains consequential drafting amendments to the Central Bank Act 1942 and the Freedom of Information Act 2014.  Part 10 contains miscellaneous provisions such as the ability for the ombudsman to co-operate and exchange information with the Central Bank of Ireland, the Registrar of Credit Unions and the Pensions Authority.<\/p> <p> Part 10 empowers the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman to partake in the memorandum of understanding on a cross-border out-of-court complaints network for financial services in the European Economic Area, EEA.<\/p> <p> Schedule 1 sets out all the repeals and revocations that must be made to Acts of the Oireachtas and statutory instruments on foot of this new legislation.  Schedule 2 sets out the operational matters in relation to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman Council.<\/p> <p> To summarise, the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman Bill will amend, update, and consolidate into one Bill all of the legislation underpinning the Financial Services Ombudsman and the Pensions Ombudsman.  It has the aim of forming a unitary structure amalgamating the Financial Services Ombudsman and the Pensions Ombudsman into the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman, FSPO.  The measures I have outlined will strengthen the functions of the new ombudsman and improve the experience for consumers of both pensions and financial services.  As Members are aware, there are many consumers for whom this Bill is a pressing issue, particularly the proposed change to the rules regarding the period in which the ombudsman can investigate complaints.  With that in mind, I hope that this Bill can be sent forward to Committee Stage, at which point it can be discussed in more detail.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052500029#BB05700","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1495724400,"counter":253,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Topical Issue Matters","time":1495724400,"counter":254,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052500030#CC00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1495724400,"counter":255,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 29A and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Maurice Quinlivan - the concern expressed with patient safety issues at University Hospital Limerick;

There are many people on low or middle incomes who simply cannot afford to buy a house in the current context, especially in our capital city.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052500031#DD01100","speaker":"1325"},{"type":"speech","time":1495725000,"counter":267,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 4 and 5 together.<\/p><p>Of course we need to provide affordable homes for people.  The approach we are taking is different from the way it was done previously.  What ended in 2011 was an affordable housing scheme.  We are now trying to put together affordable housing projects as part of schemes on a case-by-case basis.  We have asked local authorities to publish, in a very transparent way and for everybody to see, the 700 sites throughout the State where local authorities own public land that is suitable for housing.  We have asked local authorities to produce a development plan for each of those sites.  We want the local authorities to design an affordable element within those plans.  Sometimes it will be a certain percentage of social housing, a certain percentage of affordable housing and a certain parentage of private housing.  Depending on where the site is in the country and the demand in that area, the construct of that affordable housing plan will be different.<\/p><p>Last week, after quite a lot of negotiation and discussion with Dublin City Council and even though Sinn F&eacute;in voted against it in the end, there was agreement among a majority of councillors on Dublin City Council on how, through a massive planning process, we would develop on the Poolbeg Irish Glass Bottle site, which is a privately owned piece of land.  This will involve some affordable and social housing.  It will also include some specialist social housing for older people and so on.  We are trying to ensure we have mixed tenure, diverse, healthy communities as part of many projects around the country.<\/p><p>Sometimes projects may be all affordable housing and sometimes they may be 10%, 15% or 20% affordable housing.  The prudent thing to do here is to demand of local authorities to come back to us with proposals that suit the area and the site.  We will then sign off on the affordable housing projects.  We need to give guidance to some local authorities around the thresholds under which and over which people will qualify for those affordable housing schemes.  Let us consider the docklands in Dublin as an example.  Affordable housing was provided through many of the apartment developments in the docklands and the affordable housing was allocated through the drawing of lots.  That is the kind of template we want to see as part of mixed tenure communities.<\/p><p>With regard to Deputy O'Sullivan's comment, we are not giving away sites to private developers; it is not happening.  We will ensure we will get a full State public interest dividend from every one of those sites.  The dividend may be in the form of affordable housing, it may be social housing or it could be something else.  If appropriate, it could be cash but in most cases I do not think it will be.  We are trying to do social housing differently from the ways in which it was done in the past.  We are trying to build stronger and more progressive communities than has been the case previously in how the State approached social housing.  It is in this context I encourage local authorities to be ambitious in their proposals around affordable housing schemes as part of how they use and develop landbanks we have throughout the country and which have the capacity to deliver 50,000 houses.  I believe it is about 5,000 acres over 700 sites.  It is a significant opportunity.  We are doing it differently from the way it was done in the past.  It will result in much healthier communities and a lot more affordable housing.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><\/p><p>The Government has no plans at this stage to introduce a new affordable housing purchase scheme of the kind that existed up to 2011. However, the Government recognises the housing affordability pressures in certain areas and is determined to see increases in the supply of high-quality social and affordable homes, to buy or rent, as quickly as possible, particularly in the major urban areas where demand is greatest.<\/p><p>At a strategic level, under the new 20-year national planning framework, there will be an emphasis on managing and utilising State lands to deliver housing and to ensure an active and healthy market for development land.  The opening up of State-owned lands for the development of mixed tenure housing is also a key objective under Rebuilding Ireland.  Rebuilding Ireland also commits to the introduction of an affordable rental scheme to enhance the provision of affordable accommodation for households currently paying a disproportionate amount of disposable income on rent.  As set out in the strategy for the rental sector, this commitment is being progressed through kick-starting supply in rent pressure zones and leveraging the value of State-owned sites to deliver units for rental, targeting middle income households.<\/p><p>On 27 April 2017, I published the Rebuilding Ireland housing land map, a vital initial step in the new strategic approach to State land management.  The datasets published on the map include details of more than 700 local authority and housing agency owned sites, totalling some 1,700 ha, as well 30 sites covering about 200 ha owned by State or semi-State bodies.  The map is available to view on the Rebuilding Ireland website.<\/p><p>It is crucial that much-needed housing for families and individuals on the social housing waiting list, and for those on low to middle incomes, is delivered from local authority and State-owned sites as soon as possible.  In the first instance, the specific approach to housing delivery on each site, including the optimum tenure mix, is a matter for the local authority concerned, the elected council members included, who best understand the housing needs in their area.  In this regard, I welcome the fact that two of the Dublin local authorities have brought forward four key large-scale sites capable of delivering 3,000 of these new homes, and I expect other local authorities to follow suit.<\/p><p>Mixed tenure development on publicly owned land provides the best way forward to deliver social and affordable housing quickly in a fully integrated and sustainable community. Importantly, it allows for risk-sharing and far quicker delivery of social housing and badly needed housing more generally as part of the full development of individual sites.  Opening up the supply of State land in this way, for mixed tenure housing, is a critically important intervention in addressing a situation where the pace of recovery in the house development sector is slower than we would like it to be.  In practical terms, the development of these sites will mean accelerating social housing delivery and securing more homes for sale and rent at lower and more affordable price points.<\/p><p>I am committed to ensuring the State secures the most beneficial use of its currently under-utilised assets for much-needed housing in the shortest possible timeframe and maximises the public good dividend through increased and speedier delivery of high-quality social and affordable homes.  My Department is working closely with local authorities and other State agencies to ensure that the optimum mix of social and affordable housing is delivered from public landbanks in the shortest possible timeframe and in a manner which achieves value for money and the best possible housing outcomes.  The approach to be adopted to individual sites will be decided case by case, taking account of the specific aspects of each site and the particular local housing considerations arising.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052500031#DD01200","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1495725000,"counter":268,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response.  I accept and acknowledge that there is potential in the future development of the sites the Minister spoke of.  I would have hoped for them to come on stream much earlier than this, but I accept the mechanism under which the Minister believes the development can take place and the benefit that can accrue to the State, as the Minister has said.  I would hazard a small warning on the Minister describing the projects as being assessed individually and case by case.<\/p>  <p>  It may be that we can derive benefit from the dividend in the provision of social and affordable housing, but I would advise against the provision of cash.  To be honest, the Part V scheme had that option and it did not prove fruitful for the local authorities.  More importantly, it did not prove fruitful for those who were hoping to acquire or receive the benefit of a home from the scheme.  I ask the Minister not to consider cash as a dividend in this respect.<\/p>  <p>  While I do see the merit, as private developments take place there are concerns.  This week Cairn Homes, for example, announced quite substantial profits.  It was public knowledge.  This says that the methodology of the Government, where it sets the bar in order to encourage builders into the market, is a dangerous one.  In the absence of a specific obligation on such private sector developers, a select few of whom have funds available again, it should be incumbent on them from a legislative perspective in the House to ensure there is a benefit to the State through Part V.  It was a mistake to decrease it to 10%.

What mechanisms and processes have been put in place to adjudicate the performance and reaction to the publication of the lists in regard to each local authority?  I accept each local authority's needs are different and that how sites will be developed will vary from authority to authority, place to place and so forth.  Aside from publication of the list, what processes and mechanisms have been put in place to ascertain what progress is being made?  In the event of proposals coming forward from the private sector, how quickly will these be responded to by the Department and local authorities?  As I have previously said on several occasions, those conventional methods have failed a previous plan sanctioned by the then Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly.  His plan was very ambitious and bold and money was not a problem either but yet the results expected were not achieved.  We all want to see this issue dealt with.<\/p>  <p>  I will reiterate one of the questions I asked earlier because the Minister did not answer it.  I accept he had a lot of questions to answer but in regard to the private developers whom, as I said, are posting large profits on foot of the Government policy which I believe increases house prices rather broadens the spectrum for which construction can take place and more houses can be provided - they are supply initiatives that we can discuss again - will the Minister give serious consideration to the re-introduction of the Part V affordable element that existed previously and ensured that where private development took place, it adhered to Part V social and affordable housing?  The issue of affordable housing must be addressed with as much gusto, effort and determination as the provision of social housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052500032#EE00400","speaker":"1217"},{"type":"speech","time":1495725600,"counter":281,"content":"<p>I agree with the Minister that funding is not a barrier and that there is need for more urgency and initiative on the part of local authorities.

Is the timescale for these projects five years?  Perhaps the Minister will clarify when he expects these projects to be completed.  Leaving aside that we need initiative on the part of the local authorities, we need to ensure that this type of passing the buck between the Department and the local authorities stops.  A site in my constituency, which I drive pass almost every day, which was supposed to be developed and inhabited in the middle of last year, is still full of weeds.

Some of them are in the assessment process, some are in the Part VIII process and others are on-site.  I agree there is a need for urgency.  When I became Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government I asked the same question that Deputy O'Sullivan just asked.  When I, or the Minister of State, Deputy English, visited local authorities, we were told that they could not get decisions from the Department.  I probed that issue in the Department.  It was not as straightforward as many people like to think.  It is a convenient excuse to blame the Department for everything.  There is a system in the Department that is about driving projects as quickly as is reasonable, while still carrying out a very robust assessment to ensure we get value for money.  Staff visit local authorities where they meet engineers, quantity surveyors and architects to get projects approved quickly.  That is happening.  If there are cases where it is not happening I would like to know about them and I will ensure they are addressed.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to the sites, two of the Dublin local authorities have already brought forward four key large-scale sites that are capable of delivering 3,000 new homes.  I expect other local authorities will follow suit fairly quickly.  The Dublin local authorities have already advertised with regard to those four sites.  In the coming months, I will be asking each local authority to produce plans for all the sites that are ready to go now.  It will not be possible to have movement on the 700 sites within the same year.  The target is to have delivery across all of these sites over a five-year timeframe.  There will be a significant ramping up of the volume of units that is being delivered.  As I said, on many of these sites the housing will be either all social housing or a significant portion of social housing.  Some of them are small infill sites and others are large sites which need proper tenure mix such that essentially what would be created is a new town centre and community of the type that exists in Poolbeg, Cherrywood or Adamstown.<\/p>  <p>  On Part V, I do not propose to repeat the mistake made in the past whereby a developer could buy out an obligation under Part V.  If I understood Deputy Cowen correctly, he agrees with me in this regard.  That was a big mistake at the time.  Although money was handed over it often was not spent on social housing.  Let us not forget that we are not building enough houses in Ireland.  Many developers are not making enough money to be able to justify building a lot more houses.  If I were to ask them to contribute more than 10% that would, in my view, slow down the momentum that is already starting to take hold in some parts of the country.  What is encouraging is that many developers are asking to provide more than 10% because based on the plans, they can get paid upfront by the local authorities, which can help them to finance the remainder of a project.  The level of social housing being provided by projects such as Poolbeg and O'Devaney Gardens, which is on State-owned land, is way beyond 10%.  Some projects are providing up to 25% social housing.  In the case of O'Devaney Gardens, 50% of the units are non-private housing.  Different sites require different solutions and local authorities should be able to deal with them on a case-by-case basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052500032#EE00800","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social and Affordable Housing Data","time":1495725600,"counter":285,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052500032#EE00900"},{"type":"question","time":1495725600,"counter":286,"qnumday":2,"qnumall":"[25050\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052500032#EE01000","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"the number of affordable housing units that will be built on a site (details supplied) in view of the fact that a number of housing development sites, including a site and other sites around the State, received a substantial amount of funding from the local infrastructure housing activation fund, which contained a requirement for affordable housing; the percentage of the units built which will be affordable; and the amount these homes will cost.

There were 508 projects going through the Departments.  Some 32 of those were for single units that are forced to go through a four-stage process.  The bureaucracy in that regard makes no sense at all.  Some 49% of the total projects were for fewer than ten units.  The whole programme of delivering social housing is quite small and it is not challenging.  A project with 100 units has to go through the very same process as that relating to one unit.  This matter must be examined.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052500035#HH00200","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speech","time":1495727400,"counter":325,"content":"<p>If I send the Minister of State the breakdown of Mel Reynolds' analysis, will he reply to it and counteract what Mr. Reynolds says in order to justify his own numbers?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052500035#HH00300","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speech","time":1495727400,"counter":326,"content":"<p>I did not get to answer the second half of the earlier question.

That worked quite well and everybody got on board with it eventually.  It was started by Noel Dempsey, and I totally accept that.  People should not be afraid of the risk associated with the single stage process.  All of us working for the delivery of housing know that there is a need to change the processes.  That is what we are trying to do.  That is why the interaction of our staff and the staff of the local authorities has increased dramatically and why on-site meetings are happening much more often.  The availability is there.  We have to eliminate the delays and the blame game associated with them.  That should not be there any more, because there is no excuse for delay.

It outlines locations and details for ten projects in Galway city, delivering 134 new social homes.  The council has also recently submitted further social housing proposals, including construction projects by the council and the approved housing bodies, AHBs.  These are being actively assessed and when approved will be added to the status report.<\/p>  <p>  The exact timing for the advancement of each of these projects will be a matter for the council.  However, I have been clear with the council that funding is available to support early delivery.  I was in Galway recently to meet members of the council and I made it very clear that we want these projects to move much quicker and that we also want the number of projects to increase.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the projects listed in the status report, 73 new social homes are planned for Ballyburke.  These were included in the second bundle of the social housing public private partnership programme.  Also in addition to the projects listed in the status report are new social homes that have been acquired either through purchase or long-term lease directly by the council or in conjunction with AHBs from various sources, including NAMA and directly from property owners.<\/p>  <p>  The development of new social homes under Part V arrangements will be dependent on the advancement of new construction projects in the private sector. While it is not possible to identify the precise numbers that will be delivered at this stage, I have assured all local authorities that funding will be made available to secure these units and my Department is in ongoing contact with the local authorities in this regard.  I understand that Galway City Council anticipates an escalation to between 30 and 40 Part V units per annum from 2018 onwards depending on the level of construction of developments of ten or more units taking place.<\/p>  <p>  Following my conversation with both local authorities in Galway, the lack of planning applications coming forward for both private and social housing is of major concern.  They have now fully engaged with us on the Ireland 2040 process to see if we can increase the figures.  We have also asked them to work with our Department to see if we can activate more sites in Galway.  I am very concerned at the lack of construction activity in Galway.  The councillors I met that day share the same concern.  The Department is open to working with the councillors on that.

The number one priority for us as Ministers and the Department is that people would be out of commercial hotels because they are not places to raise a family or to try to survive.  Some people are there for 18 months to a year, which is not on.  The aim is to get them into permanent accommodation.  The Deputy was right to say that some will still end up in further temporary accommodation.  While a hell of a lot better than a hotel, it is not the full answer for them.  We are working with families so that they can transition into their full house.<\/p>  <p>  I will give the Deputy some of the figures.  Last year under the homeless HAP scheme, which has been a major addition to help us house people from homelessness, we targeted approximately 550 tenancies.  We have reached more than 800 in 2016.  These are people who were homeless and got into a house.  This year alone there have been more than 600 new presentations that are now in a house under the HAP scheme.  These are people who would be in hotels but who are being accommodated in homes.  With new presentations and those in hotels, we will achieve these targets.  However, I wish to stress that it has been very difficult because of the number of new presentations.  While I am at it and given the Deputy was looking for them, I may as well give him the homelessness figures for April.  The number of homeless adults is 4,972.  The number of homeless families is 1,302.  The number of dependants is 2,708.  In Dublin only, there are 3,337 homeless adults, with the number of homeless families being 1,091.  Again, those figures are slightly up.  While we are making inroads in terms of our target of removing people from hotels, the overall number of presentations remain high.  That is for a combination of reasons.  We can look behind that story some day and see that.  <\/p>  <p> In the weeks and months ahead, there will be more than 550 new family places available.  These will help those who will present as homeless in the future.  They will no longer be going into hotels.  They will either enter a HAP situation or move into one of the family hubs and move on from there.  It is important to deal with the hotels today, as well as the number of presentations.

Therefore, I wish to stress that the scheme will not close.<\/p>  <p>  The pyrite resolution board, with the support of the Housing Agency, is responsible for the implementation of the pyrite remediation scheme. \u00a0The scheme is one of last resort and is limited in its application and scope. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The scheme is applicable to dwellings which are subject to significant damage attributable to pyritic heave established in accordance with - Deputy Daly probably knows the reference off by heart at this stage - I.S. 398-1:2013 - Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material &ndash; Part 1: Testing and categorisation protocol.  In this regard, it is a condition of eligibility under the scheme that an application to the board must be accompanied by a building condition assessment with a damage condition rating of 2.  This ensures that, having regard to available resources, the focus of the scheme is on dwellings which are most severely damaged by pyritic heave.  We have no proposals to amend the eligibility criteria for the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  At the end of the remediation works, each dwelling is provided with a certificate of remediation for reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material, which is completed jointly by the relevant builder and design professional in accordance with Annex B to I.S. 398-2:2013.  The certificate confirms that the dwelling has been remediated to the requirements set out in the national standard.<\/p>  <p>  A green certificate is issued in respect of dwellings that have been assessed, at the request of the homeowner, in accordance with the standard and considered to be free from pyrite.  This issuing of such certificates is a matter entirely for the homeowners and the professional they engage.  It is not part of the pyrite remediation scheme.  Where a house has been remediated under the scheme, a\u00a0certificate of remediation is provided and the issue of a green certificate does not arise.<\/p>  <p>  I know the issue relates to the new standard to be brought forward.  I had hoped we would have had it months ago.  When the standard will be agreed is outside the control of my Department.

I have been told by the NSAI that we are talking about another couple of months or before the end of the year.

Having raised the issue at every Question Time involving the Minister, I went to the trouble of drafting legislation to replace the present scheme with one that is based on remediation or certification.  The idea is that the scheme, if a house could not be remediated or did not require remediation, would offer a certificate so that the owner could move on with his or her life.  I was prevented from even giving that Bill a reading on the grounds that it would involve a cost on the Exchequer even though we had carried out a huge amount of work on it.  In other words, the only people who can change the scheme are those in government.  Backbenchers will be prevented from proposing legislation on this issue.  This is urgent.  The flaw in the scheme is that it was based on damage rather than the presence of pyrite.  This means that someone whose house has pyrite and is therefore valueless but is not deemed to have enough damage to be remediated is left in total limbo.  It is simply unacceptable.

The problem at the moment is that under some of the standards, the house is still reported to have a pyrite presence.  However, it might not be possible to see physical damage to the house.  I have been in houses that have been said to have pyrite although one cannot see anything wrong with them even ten to 12 years after construction.  No one will buy those houses and the banks will not give a mortgage to buy such houses.   However, it would probably be wrong to spend &euro;60,000 fixing the house to remove the presence of pyrite.

That is the difficulty.  Where a house must be remediated, the scheme is available.  Many houses have been fixed at this stage already.

Without the certificate, the only other remedy would be an actual remediation of the property.  Those are the only two options.  The problem is that we have a remediation scheme that is too restrictive.  A house has to be virtually falling down before a person can get onto the scheme.

I have been in houses that were built 30 or more years ago and pyrite is only now becoming a problem.  If there is a presence of pyrite, it is not as simple as being able to tell somebody they can get out of jail or, in other words, that their house is cleared.  That is why the standards are being looked at again to see if the testing procedures are right and to see if there is some way to say legitimately that the pyrite will never cause a problem.

However, communications with the European Commission as part of the infringement process have satisfied the Commission that 44 of those 82 agglomerations should be removed from the case.  While this indicates the progress being made, 38 agglomerations remain of concern to the European Commission.  Irish Water will continue to prioritise key projects in their capital investment plans to address the issues of non-compliance in the outstanding areas. <\/p>  <p>  To address all these concerns, in the various plans, would cost roughly &euro;1.7 billion.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052500039#MM00600","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1495729800,"counter":382,"content":"<p>Interestingly, the primary reason the European Commission initiated the infringement proceedings was because when Fine Gael took office in 2011, it slashed the capital budget for wastewater treatment plans.  Prior to that, particularly when John Gormley was Minister, the investment was between &euro;200 million and &euro;300 million on an annual basis.  When Fine Gael took office with Labour, it was slashed to figures such as &euro;150 million and &euro;124 million.  Clearly, the reason we are now facing potentially millions of euro of fines is because Fine Gael slashed the funding to those projects.

I said &euro;1.7 billion but that was the total spend.  From 2014 to 2024, about &euro;1.1 billion will be required to ensure the compliance for the 38 agglomerations.  That is the rough spend.  Of the &euro;1.7 billion, Irish Water plans to spend from 2017 to 2021, approximately &euro;623 million is planned for investment in the cited areas.  The planned investment builds on an investment of &euro;179 million for the period 2014 to 2016 to develop urban areas.  A projected requirement of &euro;286 million for the period beyond 2021 is required.  It will bring us to a total spend of &euro;1.1 billion.  The &euro;1.1 billion is an increase of &euro;100 million on the previous estimate of what it would cost to fix these.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy said the current Government and the last Government cut the funding in this area.  I do not need to give the Deputy a lecture on economics.  The money was not there to spend.  That is why we set up the process of Irish Water to be able to put us in a position to spend greater amounts of capital on investment in water and sewage facilities.  Trust me, if the money had been at our disposal in our first five years of Government, as in many other areas, we would have been happy to spend it.  The money was not there and there is no point in trying to say a previous Government left money in the kitty because it had not.

My question has still not been answered.  I want to know, year on year, from now to 2021, what the investment is.

Clearly the officials have not given the Minister of State the figures.  It would be good to let me know in writing, how much of that &euro;1.1 billion is being put in, year on year, next year, the year after and the year after that.

The pressures in this regard are borne out by the data published recently by <i>daft.ie<\/i>, showing that rent asking prices rose nationwide by an average 13.4% in the year to March 2017.  The report also shows that rent inflation in Dublin has slowed over the last quarter.  It is an early indication that the rent predictability measures introduced under the Government's strategy for the rental sector are having the desired effect.  The HAP is a flexible and immediate housing support that is now available to all eligible households throughout the State.  The increased rent limits introduced by the Government in the last year, together with the additional discretion available to local authorities to exceed the maximum rent limit where necessary, are allowing HAP households to find suitable accommodation and willing landlords.  On average in 2017, 325 additional tenancies are being supported by HAP each week, with 22,000 households currently having their housing needs met by HAP and some 17,000 separate landlords and agents are in receipt of monthly HAP payments.  Particular additional targeted supports are available to homeless households in the Dublin and Cork regions to assist them in finding accommodation in the private rental market, with the support of HAP.  A breakdown of the number of households supported by HAP in each local authority area at the end of March 2017 is available on our website.  I am satisfied the HAP scheme is working well, despite the challenging rental market, but we will keep its operation under review.<\/p><p>I will repeat what I said in a discussion here last week with Deputy Broughan.  <\/p> <p><i>5 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>While I understand the housing assistance payment does not work for everybody, it provides solutions for many, including in the short term.

The HAP scheme has achieved considerable success in Dublin where approximately 600 new HAP tenancies have been provided since Christmas.  Last year, more than 800 HAP tenancies were provided directly for homeless people.<\/p> <p> I accept Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith could cite specific cases and I cannot deny that the housing assistance payment does not work for everybody.  However, it works in many cases and is generally better than the rent subsidy scheme that preceded it.  For example, recipients of the payment can return to work and increase their income without being penalised. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052500039#MM01900","speaker":"1264","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1495730400,"counter":396,"content":"<p>Unfortunately, the time for questions has expired.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052500040#NN00200","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1495730400,"counter":397,"content":"<p>That is not fair.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052500040#NN00300","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1495730400,"counter":398,"content":"<p>I am trying to accommodate everybody.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052500040#NN00400","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1495730400,"counter":399,"content":"<p>I would not have bothered asking the question if I had known I could not contribute.

It says it wants to do something about it but when it is given an opportunity to do so, it votes against a Bill that would enact emergency measures to prevent people sliding into this dire position.

The 4% cap on rent increases introduced by the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, in December 2015 is not working.  Rents are going through the roof and have increased by 13.9% in Dublin in the past year.

Many of them are forced to self-accommodate, sometimes spending whole days ringing around to secure a temporary place to stay in a hotel, unsure where the place will be or for how long it will be available.  This practice, which cost the State &euro;39 million last year, creates a massive transfer of public wealth to private hands and is also a violation of the human rights of thousands of women, men and children.

The Government is absolutely committed to addressing the issue of homelessness.  There is now a focused and co-ordinated approach to tackling it across multiple Departments and agencies.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputies are aware, Rebuilding Ireland: Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness launched in July last year provides a multi-stranded, action orientated approach to achieving the Government's key housing objectives and tackling homelessness in a comprehensive manner once and for all. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to make clear that statutory responsibility for the provision emergency accommodation to homeless services rests with individual housing authorities.  The Department's role involves the provision of a national framework of policy, legislation and funding to underpin the role of housing authorities in addressing homelessness at local level.  Consequently, it does not play a role in operational issues.<\/p><p>When a family presents as homeless out of hours in Dublin, the dedicated family homeless action team will work with the family to secure hotel accommodation for the night, with a more detailed assessment of the family's requirements taking place the next day.  The family homeless action team is provided through Focus Ireland, which is funded by the four Dublin local authorities to provide this valuable service.<\/p> <p> Regarding the events that occurred in Dublin city on Tuesday night, 24 May, I understand that the demand for emergency accommodation was at unprecedented levels and there was a scarcity of available hotel or bed and breakfast accommodation.  As a consequence, Focus Ireland was unable to source hotel accommodation for all of the families that had been referred to it that night.  Dublin City Council's central placement service maintains a number of contingency spaces for families that are intended for use only in absolute emergencies when families present out of hours and no commercial accommodation can be secured.  I understand that, when the homeless action team was unable to source hotel accommodation on Tuesday, these contingency spaces were brought into play.  Given the unprecedented demand that night, however, these spaces were soon fully utilised, with a number of families remaining unaccommodated.  Accordingly, and in line with agreed working arrangements, Focus Ireland referred the remaining families to Garda stations as a last resort and with a view to their safety.<\/p> <p> I understand that the issue of contingency capacity for families was on Dublin City Council's agenda prior to Tuesday night and that the council had been working to increase the volume of its contingency spaces to 14 family units.  Unfortunately, this additional capacity only came on stream on Wednesday night.  While that was a day too late for the families in question, it is of some reassurance that this additional capacity now exists within the system.<\/p> <p> I have made it clear that I do not consider hotel accommodation to be appropriate for families for anything other than a short period.  The Minister has been clear on this as well and has committed to end the use of hotels.  The events of Tuesday night highlight that a reliance on hotel accommodation is not only inappropriate, but precarious.  It was with this understanding that Rebuilding Ireland included an explicit commitment to ensure that, by mid-2017, hotels would only be relied on for emergency accommodation in limited circumstances.  To meet this objective, there has been a focus on meeting families' long-term housing needs through housing supports such as the enhanced HAP scheme and general social housing allocations.  Significant outputs are being achieved in this regard and housing authorities achieved more than 3,000 sustainable exits from homeless accommodation into independent tenancies during 2016, which was a record level of exits in a calendar year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052500040#NN02800","speaker":"1264","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1495731000,"counter":424,"content":"<p>This morning, Mr. Mike Allen of Focus Ireland stated that emergency accommodation would not solve the crisis and, specifically, that we needed legislation to stem the flow of families into homelessness.

That shows how ideally located the area is.  The mail centre's 183 staff are extremely efficient, having won many awards for their work.  Not only that, but they have been flexible.

The Minister sends his apologies.  I accept the Deputies' point that many people are concerned and I will try to deal with the questions the Deputies have raised.<\/p>  <p>  As Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, has responsibility for the postal sector, including the governance of An Post, to ensure the company is fully compliant with the code of practice for the governance of State bodies and the governance functions included in the statutory framework underpinning An Post.  Day-to-day operational matters, including decisions in regard to the restructuring of An Post and the operation of the post office network, are matters for the board and the management of the company and not ones in which the Minister has any role or statutory function.<\/p>  <p>  It is Government policy that An Post remains a strong, viable company, in a position to provide a high quality, nationwide postal service, and that it maintains a nationwide customer-focused network of post offices in the community.  The post office network consists of just over 1,100 post offices nationwide.  The post office network is a unique social, cultural and financial institution that makes a vital contribution to the Irish economy.  That is the Government position.  The post office is regarded as a dependable, trustworthy provider of choice to a vast number of our citizens for State services and other commercial transactions.<\/p>  <p>  The Post Office Network Business Development Group was established at the end of 2014 by the then Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to explore the potential for commercial and additional Government services which could be transacted through the post office network.  Following publication of the final report of this group in January 2016, two working groups were established to progress the recommendations of the report.  These were the network renewal implementation group, chaired by Bobby Kerr, and the post office hub working group, chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ring.  On foot of the reconfiguration of Departments in July last, responsibility for the post office network transferred to the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  Arrangements are now in hand to transfer responsibility for the post office network back to the Minister, Deputy Naughten's Department, under whose remit the corporate governance of An Post rests.  Mr. Kerr submitted his report in December last.  The final report of the post office hub working group was published in March and its recommendations will continue to be finalised between both Departments.<\/p>  <p>  Colleagues in the House will be aware that An Post is operating in a very challenging environment and is facing a very difficult financial situation.  The An Post AGM was held today and the company published its annual report and financial statements for 2016.  The Minister has noted the fact An Post recorded an operating loss of &euro;13.7 million for 2016.  Clearly, this is a very significant loss and losses of this scale cannot be sustained.<\/p>  <p>  An Post is carrying out a fundamental review of the company with a view to identifying the strategic changes and restructuring necessary to maintain the company on a sound financial footing, and that review is nearing completion.  McKinsey is assisting An Post in this review but, as I stated, any decision in regard to the restructuring of An Post is a matter for the board and management of the company.  The Minister, Deputy Naughten, is of course closely monitoring the situation and the Government will be briefed once a definitive strategy has been agreed.

Previous redeployment of Government staff outside Dublin created real economic value and brought long-lasting sustainable employment.  Thousands of civil servants from Departments are located in counties outside Dublin.  Many of these positions have contributed to sustaining employment levels during the crisis period in smaller towns.<\/p>  <p>  There is huge potential for Sligo and Leitrim to be developed as the key growth centre for the north west.  We need to see viability and economies of scale in the north west.  Sligo-Leitrim is a large rural region and Sligo is the best located large urban centre to support development throughout much of the north west region.  With redeployment and recruitment of public sector jobs, along with effective links to other urban centres throughout the region and improved connectivity, Sligo can become a more effective regional driver, supporting a greater share of population, economic and employment growth in Sligo itself and the wider north-west region.  Furthermore, the most recent CSO figures show that Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim are among the counties in Ireland with the highest percentages of vacant dwellings.  Many properties could be brought back into use in these regions and this would boost local development and ease pressure on prices and rents in Dublin and other areas experiencing vigorous growth.<\/p>  <p>  There is clear evidence of a two-tier recovery with new job creation heavily concentrated in the greater Dublin area.  The reality in the north west is that any improvement is happening at an extremely slow pace.  There are serious barriers to job creation in this region that must be urgently addressed.  The greater Dublin area accounted for about 40% of total employment gains in 2016.  Disproportionate concentration in non-rural areas confirms that Government policy is skewed towards an unbalanced regional recovery.  The Small Firms Association, representing over 200,000 businesses, has stated that the recovery has not been consistent regionally or sectorally.  Many small businesses are still waiting to feel the upturn.  Unequal recovery has been backed up by a Department of Finance paper, which stated that economic recovery in Ireland has been uneven across the country, with the recovery thus far primarily concentrated in Dublin and other urban areas.<\/p>  <p>  There has been a clear failure by Government to create a balanced jobs policy towards the regions, with job creation concentrated nearly exclusively in the capital and commuter belt region.  The Government has still a long way to go to reach its 2020 target of ensuring every region's unemployment rate is within 1 percentage point of the national figure.  I wish to outline a few statics relating to IDA Ireland jobs.  Some 45% of all IDA Ireland site visits in 2016 were in Dublin and 50% of all IDA Ireland jobs were in the capital and commuter belt area.  In 2016, 48% of all IDA Ireland jobs were in the capital and commuter belt area.  The midlands, north east and north west have been almost ignored, with the number of IDA Ireland jobs there accounting for 2.1%, 2.6% and 2.9%, respectively.<\/p>  <p>  There is a very disproportionate concentration of our economy in one region which is not sustainable.  To put this into perspective, London accounts for 20% of the UK's total GDP.  The Irish concentration in our capital is over 40%.  I appreciate that IDA Ireland does not decide where an industry locates.  An industry locates in areas where it can get the things it needs to grow, with factors such as skill base and education being important.  The Government, however, can decide where to locate public jobs and there is no shortage of highly skilled, qualified and capable people in the north west who are actively seeking work but the jobs just are not there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052500043#QQ00300","speaker":"1344"},{"type":"speech","time":1495732200,"counter":446,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  As a Deputy from the west of Ireland, I understand his concerns about balanced regional development.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the decentralisation programme announced in December 2003 involved the relocation of over 10,000 civil and public service jobs to 53 locations in 25 counties.  Up to the date of the cancellation of the programme, approximately one third of the target numbers, over 3,400 staff, were decentralised.  While the decentralised offices account for less than 10% of serving Civil Service staff, taken together with the pre-existing regional and district offices of Departments the proportion of civil servants working outside Dublin is now just over 50%.<\/p>  <p>  Non-property costs of the order of &euro;30 million were incurred in respect of the decentralisation programme.  These included costs incurred by decentralising offices and the OPW's spend on dedicated staffing for the programme.  The staff relocation was accomplished on a voluntary basis without payment of removal expenses or incentives.  It was also accomplished with minimal disruption to the ongoing business of the Departments concerned due to the graduated approach and risk management strategies adopted.<\/p>  <p>  In November 2011, the Government agreed that the decentralisation programme should be cancelled in the light of the budgetary and staffing outlook.  It was also agreed that a review of 22 projects should be carried out.  Following completion of that review in January 2012, a total of 43 projects had been cancelled, while 50 were maintained, to be managed in the same way as other regionally based offices and Departments.  It was agreed that one project, the Defence Forces in the Curragh, should proceed, on a cost-effective basis, as soon as budgetary resources permit.<\/p>  <p>  There is a need to focus Government expenditure on programmes and projects that will best support economic recovery as well as the ongoing necessity to control public expenditure and pay, and the need to achieve efficiencies.  The Deputy will be aware that the general government debt forecast is 76% of gross domestic product.  Ireland is subject to the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact, which links public expenditure growth with the medium-term growth rate of the economy.  This means we have very limited resources or fiscal space for increased expenditure in the next four-year period.  For these reasons, there are no plans at present to introduce a further programme of decentralisation.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is firmly committed to the successful implementation of the PEACE and INTERREG programmes.  It is particularly proud of its role in securing EU funding for a fourth PEACE programme.  Along with its sister INTERREG programme, it will see investment of more than &euro;500 million in the region over the period between 2014 and 2020.  The programmes are important drivers of regional development in a cross-Border context.  Through EU-funded co-operation, a range of Departments and agencies, North and South, have engaged in and benefited from a variety of cross-Border and cross-community projects.  Support for the two programmes from the European Regional Development Fund is not only an important source of funding but also a key element of the European Union's continuing commitment to the process of peace building and reconciliation in the region over the last quarter of a century.  Since 1991, successive INTERREG programmes have collectively contributed &euro;1.13 billion to the economies of Northern Ireland, the Border region of Ireland and, since 2007, western Scotland.<\/p>  <p>  In February of this year, the Government launched Ireland 2040.  The plan is a discussion about how to secure sustained, long-term and regionally balanced progress on social, economic and environmental fronts.  It is now time to think about the longer-term future of all parts of Ireland and to plan for that future.  This is important and it is why it was included in our programme for Government.<\/p>  <p>  With the return of stability there are a number of projections and challenges that are likely to be realised and we need to start planning for them now.  This paper is the start of a major consultation process so that we can avoid the planning mistakes of the past.  All communities and regions need to have their say.  Decentralisation is not a panacea for the problems facing parts of Ireland, including the north west.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052500043#QQ00400","speaker":"1260"},{"type":"speech","time":1495732800,"counter":447,"content":"<p>I am disappointed to hear the Government is not even considering redeploying jobs into rural areas.  I agree with the Minister of State that decentralisation, which was first mentioned in 2003 to 2004, became a dirty word ultimately.  It was a very good idea and the only thing that was wrong with it is that the three-year timeframe was too ambitious.  It could not be done in three years.  What happened is that when the Departments went to buy property and sites, the gun was put to their head and they were asked for ten times the price.  If the plan was to be phased over a ten-year period, it would have given people a chance and senior civil servants could have had an opportunity for their children to finish school, for example.  If that had been done, decentralisation would and could have worked.<\/p>  <p>  There are motorways everywhere in the south of the country but there is nothing when one reaches Mullingar when travelling from Dublin.  Galway is fortunate to have a motorway all the way to the city, but the same is not true when one travels to Sligo.  When I spoke to the IDA, I was told that when it brings people to the north west, those who make decisions are not interested once they reach Mullingar and find there is only a single carriageway road.  They are not interested in travelling to Sligo or the north west because of the lack of a proper road structure.  Unfortunately, that is the reality.  It is not the fault of the IDA either.  The people who make decisions on location are company executives.  Whatever chance one has with proper infrastructure, one has no chance without it.  That is why the Government should reconsider its approach.<\/p>  <p>  I spoke to a friend of mine yesterday whose son is buying a house in Dublin - two up and two down with a ground floor bathroom.  The cost is &euro;415,000.  One could buy three houses for that amount of money where I live.  The quality of life would be totally different.  If people had an opportunity and time to make a decision and sort out their affairs, they would move because there is a good quality of life in the north west.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052500044#RR00100","speaker":"1344"},{"type":"speech","time":1495732800,"counter":448,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Scanlon for his remarks.

We must develop the Atlantic economic corridor, for instance, which is in the programme for Government, in order that we create a counterbalance to the east coast along the west coast from Cork to Derry.  We want to have equality in everything.  People living in Dublin who have to pay &euro;415,000 for a house are suffering and people in the west are suffering because we do not have economic opportunities for them.  The programme for Government is all about creating balanced development for this country and creating a counterbalance to Dublin.<\/p>  <p>  A total of 600 jobs were decentralised to Donegal, Mayo, Leitrim, Mayo, Roscommon and Galway in the previous decentralisation programme.  Jobs in the Department of Social Protection were decentralised to Sligo.  I agree with Deputy Scanlon that it is necessary to have infrastructure and to extend the roads and motorways.  That is our intention.  The vision for the Atlantic economic corridor is to create such infrastructure in order that we end up with a situation where our children can grow up in the west and north west, be educated, get jobs and raise our grandchildren there and that the future is safe for them all.  It is about creating a balance in society.  It is not a huge country but it will take a bit of effort to achieve and the programme for Government has set that out clearly.

This is the second time I have had a matter selected for the Topical Issue debate concerning University Hospital Limerick for which the Minister has not turned up.  On the previous occasion the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, substituted for him and she said she would come back to me with the answer but she did not do that.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, if he commits to it that he will ensure I will get a response from the Minister.<\/p>  <p>  The issue I raise concerns the imminent opening of the new emergency department in University Hospital Limerick, which is very welcome.  It is hoped to open the department this month.  I am delighted to see &euro;24 million is being invested in a critical piece of infrastructure for our city.  The amalgamation of Ennis, Nenagh and St John's hospitals was rushed and the promised centre of excellence was not delivered at the time.  To date, the amalgamation has been nothing but a disaster which has led to the present emergency department being described by the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, in recent years as unfit for purpose.  The situation remains the same today.<\/p>  <p>  While it is great that the new emergency department is opening, I wish to address some concerns surrounding the move to the new facility that the Minister will, I hope, address.  People in Limerick and the entire mid-west have waited a long time for the new emergency department which will benefit patient care and staff working conditions significantly.  Having waited for years for it, it is essential we get it right.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation has raised serious concerns about the move to the new emergency department.  According to HSE management, a minimum of 24 patients will be placed on trolleys and recliner chairs in the new emergency department.  That has come as a severe shock.  The use of trolleys in emergency departments is unacceptable.  We need to move away from that means of operation and not embed them into new plans.  It is unacceptable that HSE management in the hospital intends to transfer the existing trolley problem to the new emergency department rather than use it as an opportunity finally to solve the problem.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the INMO has suggested to management that space freed up in the old emergency department could be used to accommodate patients.  That would lead to less overcrowding and increased patient safety, but the suggestion has been rejected by management.  Other concerns raised by nurses working in the hospital include insufficient staff being assigned to the new emergency department and a lack of staff with an emergency department specialist qualification.  I have long campaigned for adequate staffing and funding for University Hospital Limerick.  I know how important the hospital is to Limerick and the wider mid-west, and I want to ensure the new emergency department is staffed and resourced adequately.<\/p>  <p>  I know the staff will do their best, as they always have done for many years, to ensure patients are properly looked after when they move into the new emergency department, but they need assistance from management and the Government to address issues they can foresee as they are on the ground.  Will the Minister of State ensure the Minister commits to addressing the concerns highlighted and that he will come back to me on them?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052500044#RR01100","speaker":"1327"},{"type":"speech","time":1495732800,"counter":458,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Maurice Quinlivan for raising this very important issue.  I know he cares passionately about the hospital in Limerick.  I will convey all his concerns to the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, who sends his apologies for not being present today.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome this opportunity to address the House on this issue.  Delivering the new emergency department at University Hospital Limerick is a key project for both the Department of Health and the HSE and is identified as a priority in the HSE National Service Plan 2017.  The building is now complete and should be ready to open shortly.  There is a bit of good news.  The emergency department in University Hospital Limerick is one of the busiest in the country, with approximately 65,000 attendances annually.  I am mindful too that demand for emergency department services at the hospital continues to rise.  In 2016, University Hospital Limerick experienced a 4.6% increase in new emergency department presentations and we have seen a further increase, of 1%, so far this year.<\/p>  <p>  The House will be aware that overcrowding at the emergency department in University Hospital Limerick has been a concern for some time.  I am well aware of the situation there as I have been in the hospital with family members in the past.  It is clear that the accommodation and resources in the existing emergency department are not sufficient to support a modern emergency department.  The emergency department in University Hospital Limerick frequently works above capacity and that contributes to inefficient ways of working and poor patient experience.  However, the end is in sight and there is no doubt the opening of the new emergency department will represent a significant boost for patients in Limerick, Clare, north Tipperary and surrounding areas.  Staff too will benefit from the very much improved working environment.  I am delighted, therefore, to confirm that the new emergency department will be three times the size of the current department and will provide modern, safe and fit for purpose facilities that meet the expectations of patients and families.<\/p><p>At the same time the new facility will provide high quality, comfortable accommodation that protects patients&rsquo; privacy and dignity.  This is a very important issue for patients and their families.  I understand that the new accident and emergency department has been designed on a pod-based system.  The design will improve efficiency and once patients have been triaged they will be assigned to different areas of the emergency department, depending on the seriousness of their condition.  Each of these units or pods will have its own waiting area which will accommodate patients waiting to be seen by a clinician following triage.  This is very important and is good news.<\/p> <p> Clinical teams will be assigned to these units and will be responsible for the treatment, discharge or admittance of patients, within their particular unit.  Because of these separate units, it is expected that the time from triage to treatment will be much improved, resulting in fewer patients waiting extended periods of time in the emergency department, and an improvement in the patient experience time.  It is also planned to open an interim short-stay unit for admitted patients in the area of the current emergency department, which was occupied by paediatric patients and the clinical decision unit.  This unit will have capacity for 17 patients and will dramatically reduce the number of patients waiting on trolleys in the emergency department.  The CEO of the UL hospitals group has confirmed that there is no basis for any suggestion that 24 patients will be accommodated on trolleys in the new emergency department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052500044#RR01200","speaker":"1359","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1495733400,"counter":460,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.

This emergency department will be a great benefit to many people.  I will be visiting the hospital tomorrow at the invitation of the CEO.  Limerick has waited long enough for this investment.  Everybody has agreed that the old emergency department was not fit for purpose but the concerns of the nurses working on the ground are worrying.  A new building and facilities will be of little use if there are no trained specialists there to staff them.  These nurses from the INMO are on the ground and know the issues better than anyone.  They know what works and what is needed.  I suggest the Minister of State listens carefully to their concerns and addresses the problems they raise.<\/p>  <p>  The nurses have also highlighted the need for more preparation for the move to the new facility.  Only one dry run of the new facility has been undertaken to date and problems were highlighted in this.  It is my understanding that normally two or three dry runs are done before a move like this.  Nurses want more preparation and more run-throughs before patients start coming through the doors.  Management is clearly not listening to the INMO, and that is why I must raise it here.

I have produced it in its current form to ascertain the views of the House on the matter.  If the House is prepared to support it I will then bring forward legislation to provide for a constitutional referendum so this prohibition can be written into the Constitution.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that we do not have the resources available to the Minister and the Government when we draft.  There may be technical flaws but I am not worried about this as we can iron those out as we go along.  This evening I am trying to ascertain the views of the majority of the House on the matter and on whether these types of levies should be prevented in the future.<\/p>  <p>  I shall provide the House with some context.  The State pension, relied on by many of those aged over 66, is coming under tremendous pressure and will come under more pressure as the years go by.  I will demonstrate this shortly.  We must try to encourage people to save to provide for themselves so they will not suffer penury in their old age.  To do this we must have incentives for people to save, but we must also remove the disincentives.  There is no doubt that this levy was a powerful disincentive to people who wished to put away part of their earnings to provide for their future.<\/p>  <p>  People are living longer, which is a good thing, but it presents huge challenges for the traditional type of pension the State provides for its older people in retirement.  This has already been recognised in the extension of the pension age to 67 as the age at which people become eligible for the State pension, and to 68 in future years.  Growing life expectancy and the increasing duration of retirement is ratcheting up the pressure on the State pension year by year.  CSO statistics published in 2013 predict that mortality rates will decrease and this will result in gains in life expectancy from birth.  For males this will be from 77.9 years in 2010 to 85.1 years in 2046.  For females this increase in life expectancy will be from 82.7 years in 2010 to 88.5 years in 2046.  These statistics also reveal that the total fertility rate is expected to decline by 1.8% by 2026.  The combination of decreasing fertility rates and increasing life expectancy will have serious implications for the State's ability to meet pension costs into the future.<\/p>  <p>  The national pensions framework in 2010 highlighted that currently for every pensioner there are six people at work to support the pensioner.  By 2060 the figure will be less than two people.  Expenditure on the State pension and related welfare schemes, which was discussed last week at the welfare Estimates, amounted to approximately &euro;7 billion in 2017.  This is 35% of the total current expenditure for the Department of Social Protection.  According to a report published by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, over the period 2016 there will be an average increase in the numbers of people collecting the State pension of more than 20,000 people per annum.  There will be an estimated increase in cost of &euro;233 million per annum, at current money values.  This is with no increase in rates.  The same report states that, even accounting for the rise in the eligible age of the State pension from 66 to 67 in 2021, the average increase in numbers collecting the State pension will increase by 22,600 per annum, from 2022 to 2026.  The estimated costs will increase by &euro;260 million per annum, again even with rates standing still.<\/p>  <p>  The CSO's quarterly national household survey, published in May 2016, revealed there was a fall in the number of people who had a private pension in the fourth quarter 2015 compared to the same period in 2009.  In the fourth quarter 2015, 47% of all workers aged between 20 and 69 had an occupational pension, personal pension or both.  This compares with 51% in the fourth quarter 2009 and 54% in the first quarter 2008.<\/p><p><i>6 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>The CSO statistics also revealed that pension coverage remained lowest among younger workers.  As I said, the State has sought to confront this problem in various ways, including, because of increasing longevity, increasing the age at which people would be entitled to the pension.  That legislation is in place and will come into effect in 2021 and 2028.<\/p> <p> The State has also been providing tax relief.  I do not have the exact figure for the total revenue foregone per annum by the State in respect of tax relief for people who contribute to their pension but it runs into billions of euro.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, in a reply to Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan on 26 May 2015 said that if we were to limit to the standard rate the relief that could be deducted for pension purposes in 2015, the amount gained by the Exchequer in 2015 would be approximately &euro;480 million.  That would be the amount accruing if the rate was standardised and is not the total cost of tax relief on pension savings.  On the one hand, we are spending billions of euro encouraging people to save and on the other hand we have a levy in place which is a discouragement to saving.  The Minister will be aware that I have brought forward a Bill on mandatory retirement - a similar Bill has been brought forward by Sinn F&eacute;in - which seeks to abolish mandatory retirement at the age of 65.  There is no law in this country that requires that a person must retire at 65 years of age but the contracts to which people sign up usually provide for retirement at the age of 65.  The legislation I have proposed seeks to make that illegal.  I would like the Minister to indicate when that legislation will progress to Committee Stage.  If enacted, it would alleviate the situation to some extent but more needs to be done.  <\/p> <p> There has been talk about auto-enrolment, which where one provides for a supplementary pension in addition to the basic State pension.  As for how it works, the employee, who is enrolled in the scheme but can choose to remain in the scheme or to opt out of it, pays a set amount, which is matched by the employer and similarly by the State.  That system has been introduced in the United Kingdom and I understand from a recent Mercer report that it is working very well.  As far as I am aware, 80% of people have not opted out thus far.  It also operates in Australia and other countries.  <\/p> <p> I have to hand a copy of a document issued following a press conference on 3 March 2010.  The conference was attended by the then Taoiseach the Minister for Finance, that is, the Minister himself and the Minister for Social and Family Affairs.  The announcement states that the Irish State pension system will be reformed and will remain as the fundamental basis of the pension system in Ireland but that a new supplementary pension scheme will be introduced to provide additional retirement income for employees who are not already in a pension scheme.  It is stated that in terms of operation, there will be a contribution from the employee who can choose to remain in the scheme or to opt out, a contribution from the employer and a contribution from the State.  This was supposed to happen in 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052500045#SS00500","speaker":"1227","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1495734000,"counter":465,"content":"<p>What is the date of the press release?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052500046#TT00200","speaker":"1326"},{"type":"speech","time":1495734000,"counter":466,"content":"<p>It is dated 3 March 2010.

To the best of my recollection, the Fine Gael-Labour Party programme for Government contained a similar commitment.  Deputy Burton, when Minister for Social Protection, mentioned this numerous times but we have seen no action on it.  The current Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Varadkar, in his recent campaign for the leadership of Fine Gael announced a new SSIA-type pension scheme for Ireland, which appears to be a new idea but is really the auto-enrolment system under another name.  As I said, this system as operates in Australia and the UK and so on.  Even if we do proceed to the auto-enrolment system it will not obviate the need for further savings.  We must continue to encourage people to save and we must also ensure that if such system comes into effect, it cannot be subject to a levy.  That pot of money must not be subject to a levy.<\/p>  <p>  The introduction of a levy on private pension savings was, therefore, the opposite of what we should have been doing.  In their lifetimes, Irish people today have seen two major financial crises, one in the late 1980s and another starting in 2008.  The response in both instances was to introduce a levy on private sector pension funds.  As a solution to a shortfall in national income, pension funds have proved an irresistible temptation to Governments that have an urgent need to secure ready cash.  This does not only happen in Ireland.  Argentina nationalised approximately &euro;30 billion of pension assets in 2008.  In 2013, the UK reduced its current budget deficit by taking &pound;24 billion of Royal Mail pension assets.  In Hungary, in December 2010, the Government seized &euro;14 billion to reduce public debt.  There is an ongoing situation in Poland.<\/p>  <p>  Private pensions are savings that hard-working individuals have carefully put away over the years in order that they can care for themselves in old age rather than rely solely on the State.  We are hearing an ever-growing refrain about the pension time bomb and the need for people to save for their retirement.  The levy imposed between 2011 and 2015 ran totally contrary to this.  We should be increasing rather than reducing a person's incentive to save.  This levy undermined faith in pension savings.  It is no wonder therefore that the participation rate is falling.  People do appreciate the need to save: they just do not trust the system.  Hence, the need to discontinue levying private savings.  It is akin to seizing part of a person's bank deposit.<\/p>  <p>  Between 2011 and 2015, the levy took approximately &euro;2,393 million from private savings and hit 750,000 people.  It undermined the principle of saving for retirement.  It had implications for the financial security of individuals in retirement.  It penalised those who were most prudent in saving for retirement.  It also had other consequences.  For example, it added to the difficulties of many defined benefit pension schemes already struggling to pay pensioners their entitlements.  The pension schemes were already in crisis before the levy was introduced and its imposition only served to increase the financial strain they were already under.  Hundreds of defined benefit pension schemes have either closed or are closed to new members.  The levy was a significant contributory factor in that regard.  There were other manifest injustices.  For example, pensioners in defined benefit schemes paid the levy, whereas those that had their pensions secured by annuities did not.  Individuals who transferred their benefits here from overseas, who had not benefitted from one penny of Irish tax relief, were nevertheless subjected to the levy.  <\/p>  <p>  A key feature of pension schemes is that the money is locked away until a person retires, which could be for 40 or more years.  For this reason, pensions are increasingly perceived by people as being highly insecure and susceptible to the whims of future Governments.  We need a pension system in Ireland that is secure, fair and straightforward.  Given the manner in which State benefits for the elderly have been eroded in recent times and will be even more difficult to provide for fully into the future, we must ensure that such a punitive disincentivising measure cannot be imposed on our citizens again without their acquiescence.  Public sector pensions were also reduced but these are in the process of being restored under the FEMPI legislation and they are secure, including the pensions of Members of this House.  It is time we focused on protecting and securing the pensions of workers in the private sector, which is the purpose of this legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052500046#TT00500","speaker":"1227"},{"type":"speech","time":1495734000,"counter":469,"content":"<p>I am pleased to speak to the Bill presented by Deputy O'Dea, which seeks to prohibit any future legislation that would impose a levy, or similar charge, on pension funds.<\/p><p>Specifically, the Bill proposes that, \"No legislation, Statutory Instrument, or Ministerial Directive shall be proposed or accepted which would allow the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999, the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, any amendments to those Acts, or any similar existing or future legislation, to provide for a Stamp Duty Levy, or any similar charge, to be unilaterally applied to pension funds legitimately set up under appropriate pension legislation.\"<\/p> <p> At the outset, I want to outline some important legal issues in relation to the Bill.  I am advised that the proposed fettering of discretion in this manner is contrary to the exclusive legislation-making power of the Oireachtas, contrary to Article 15.2 of the Constitution and the ability of the Oireachtas to amend law in the future.  The Bill is also arguably contrary to Article 17 and 28 of the Constitution as it fetters the power of the Executive to propose a money Bill to raise future funds.<\/p> <p> I am further advised that these two fetters on both the Oireachtas and the Executive would require a constitutional amendment to allow for such legislation into the future which would bind successive Oireachtas and the Executive.  It will also have a significant impact on the Executive as to how it proposes to raise public funds in accordance with the constitutional architecture for tax measures under Articles 11, 17 and 28 of the Constitution.  While it is a matter for the Ceann Comhairle to determine, I am advised that there is also an argument that the Bill is a money Bill, since Article 22 of the Constitution also refers to Bills which either repeal or relate to the remission of taxation.<\/p> <p> The Bill is a measure to prevent a type of taxation in the future and a way of raising money.  I note that Deputy O'Dea acknowledged, in his comments when he was initiating this Bill, that it would inescapably involve an amendment to the Constitution.  However, I note that the Bill he has presented for debate today makes no reference whatsoever to the Constitution.  It is not clear, then, how section 2 of the Bill would work as it provides that the Bill would become law 21 days after having been passed.<\/p> <p> More broadly, the function of our Constitution is to set out our fundamental legal provisions in areas such as how Ireland is governed and the rights of Irish citizens.  A hallmark of successful constitutional arrangements is that they provide both stability and the necessary flexibility.  Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann, like most basic laws, is a relatively rigid constitution in that it can be changed only by amendment or replacement entirely through a referendum of the people.  The necessary flexibility is achieved through decisions made by the Oireachtas and its constituent elements, the legislature and the Executive.  This flexibility is vital so that government, in the broader sense of the word, can be in a position to react appropriately and sometimes swiftly to changing circumstances and events in the life of the nation.  The Deputy's Bill would involve a deviation from that fundamental constitutional construct by requiring the placing of a provision directly into the Constitution in relation to a very narrow area, concerning a specific asset, namely, a pension.  That is not a sound legal practice and is not something, therefore, that the Government can support.<\/p> <p> The circumstances in 2011, when the stamp duty levy on pension schemes was introduced, were probably the most perilous economic conditions the State has experienced since its foundation.  It was necessary that every sector of Irish society made its contribution towards our national recovery.  It is an unavoidable fact that the unprecedented economic situation required extraordinarily hard and very often unpopular decisions.  Radical action simply had to be taken to preserve and boost jobs.  The pension levy was designed to claw back a small amount of the generous tax reliefs that those contributing to pension arrangements had benefitted from over many years.  Stamp duty levies applying to the assets of funded pension arrangements were introduced in 2011 to pay for the jobs initiative, the chargeable persons for which are the trustees of pension schemes and others responsible for the management of pension fund assets.  The original 0.6% stamp duty levy on pension fund assets ended in 2014.  The additional levy of 0.15% which I introduced for 2014 and 2015, mainly to help continue to fund the jobs initiative, also ended in 2015.  It is worth noting that annual tax relief on supplementary pensions is estimated at &euro;2.4 billion, while the total yield of the pensions levy between the years of 2011 and 2015 was &euro;2.4 billion.  The intention was to claw back some of this with times being so bad.  The alternatives were to go after the ordinary worker with income tax increases, more USC or more VAT and excise.  The recovery in the economy helped pension funds to grow subsequently.<\/p> <p> The position is that the equivalent value of all of the money raised from the stamp duty levy has been used to fund the wide range of measures introduced in the jobs initiative to protect existing jobs and to help create new jobs and the initiative has been a success in this regard.  The measures introduced include expenditure measures such as the JobBridge and Springboard schemes, as well as a number of tax and PRSI incentives such as the reduction in the VAT rate from 13.5% to 9% for the tourism and hospitality sectors and the temporary halving of the lower employer PRSI rate.  The funds raised by way of the pension levy have been used to protect and create jobs and this has helped to create the improving financial and economic position of the State.  Taxpayers to whom the impact of the levy may have been passed on by the chargeable persons responsible for the payment of the levy, that is the pension scheme trustees, etc., will benefit from the changes which I began in budget 2015 and which have continued in subsequent budgets to reduce the tax burden on low and middle income earners.<\/p> <p> I note the concerns expressed by Deputy O'Dea when he introduced his Bill in relation to the sustainability of pensions in Ireland having regard to an ageing population and the future ratio of workers to people aged over 65.  The Deputy will be interested to know that, consistent with the commitment in A Programme for a Partnership Government to work to make our older years better years, the Minister for Social Protection is currently developing an action plan for pension reform.  This is expected to set out a vision and a five-year plan to enable sustainable and adequate income for people in retirement.  My understanding is that the Minister is examining areas for inclusion in a comprehensive plan including reform of the contributory State pension, the introduction of automatic enrolment in a new earnings-related retirement savings system, measures to provide for improved standards and governance in existing schemes and the establishment of an interdepartmental pensions reform and taxation group.  The action plan is expected to be brought before Government before the end of the year.<\/p> <p> The Deputy will also be aware that the Minister for Social Protection recently announced that the Government had approved the publication of the general scheme of the social welfare and pensions Bill 2017.  That Bill contains key measures to increase protections for members of defined benefit occupational pension schemes, DB schemes, and to respond to the difficulties in defined benefit schemes.  First, it requires employers who sponsor DB schemes, whether or not those schemes are in deficit, to give 12 months&rsquo; notice of their intention to cease contributions.  For a scheme in deficit, the employers and trustees are required to enter into discussions to agree a funding proposal before the 12-month period expires.  The Bill also introduces a time limit of six months, from the date of the actuarial funding certificate for trustees of a DB scheme which is in deficit, to submit a funding proposal to the Pensions Authority.  The Bill further provides powers to the Pensions Authority to determine a schedule of contributions that will restore DB pension schemes which do not satisfy the funding standard, or the funding standard reserve, to an adequate funding position in circumstances where a funding proposal has not been agreed.<\/p> <p> Taking the various factors I have mentioned into account, including the legal and constitutional issues I mentioned at the outset of my speech, the Government cannot support Deputy O'Dea&rsquo;s Bill.  However, I thank the Deputy for initiating a very interesting discussion which I am sure he will continue to pursue with whoever is the new Minister for Social Protection.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052500046#TT00600","speaker":"1326","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1495734600,"counter":471,"content":"<p>It is not too often that Irish politics can still shock in its hypocrisy.<\/p><p>We have become immune to brass necks and parties brazenly pretending to be one thing when their record shows the opposite to be the case.  This Bill takes the biscuit.  The party that ploughed the National Pension Reserve Fund into the bad banks now wants to protect people's pensions.  The party that wrecked the economy wants to be responsible.  It is not credible.<\/p> <p> I do not think this is a serious Bill.  This is not how we make laws.  It is being suggested that we should put a law in place to prevent another law being introduced.  However, if the Government tomorrow decided to bring that law in, it would simply repeal this one.  This is not a serious Bill.<\/p> <p> At First Stage, Deputy O'Dea claimed this Bill would provoke a constitutional referendum.  I have read the Bill and see no evidence that it would cause a referendum.  Fianna F&aacute;il promised a constitutional referendum.  That being so, why does the Bill not do that?  The Deputy sees this as a test Bill.  If it passes, another piece of legislation will introduce the referendum.  Deputy O'Dea said that he brought this Bill forward to ascertain the views of the House.  That could have been done by means of a phone call or conversation.  This Bill smacks of a cynical and meaningless move by Fianna F&aacute;il, which made a promise it has no intention of keeping.  Nevertheless, I understand why such a move should be considered.<\/p> <p> The pension levy was a brutal and clever piece of austerity.  It took billions of euro out of people's pockets but, because of the way it was done, it did not register as the massive tax that it is and was.  Only recently have some have become aware that they are being charged a levy to make up for the hole the last Government scooped out of their pension pot.  Over 750,000 people are now directly affected by the pension levy.  When Members raise questions on this issue, the Government washes its hands, as the Minister has done repeatedly, by saying it is a matter for the trustees, as if it was not the Government's doing in the first instance.  Sinn F&eacute;in opposed this levy, as it opposed all austerity measures brought in by previous Governments.  On the introduction of the pension levy, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, stressed that it was a temporary measure but now, years later, it is becoming apparent that for many workers this levy will mean a permanent reduction in their pensions.<\/p> <p> When the levy was mooted, Sinn F&eacute;in called for extra safeguards to ensure it was not passed on to pensioners and workers.  Our proposals were rejected.  Years later, the bitter fruit is now ripening.  In 2015, Deputy Pearse Doherty persuaded the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach to write to the Pensions Ombudsman to express the anger of many workers who were getting letters telling them their pension would be cut for the rest of their lives.  The Ombudsman did not pull his punches when he said the imposition of the levy was legal, though not necessarily fair. <\/p> <p> At the time of the imposition of the levy, Government spokesmen expressed the hope, or even expectation, that employers could be requested or required by trustees to make good the levy.  That was never going to happen.  Approximately 80% of funded defined benefit schemes were already in deficit, as measured by the minimum funding standard under the Pensions Act, and the majority of employers were experiencing financial difficulty in any event, even disregarding the deficits already accumulated in the occupational pension schemes.  Consequently, most trustees of defined benefit schemes had no option but to pay the levy from the assets of the scheme.  Let us be honest: it is not the pension funds that are to blame - it is the wrecking austerity resulting from the scorched earth economic policy of Fine Gael.<\/p> <p> Deputy O'Dea mentioned the Employment Equality (Amendment) Bill 2016.  I acknowledge that he put forward a Bill which was due to be debated in the House and pulled that it in order to row in behind the Employment Equality (Abolition of Mandatory Retirement Age) Bill 2016 that I brought forward and which has gone through Second Stage and been sent for pre-legislative scrutiny.  We are now waiting on a money message from the Minister to allow that Bill move to Committee Stage.  Thousands of people are coming to the age where they will be forced out of employment not because of an inability to do the work but solely based on their age.  Many of them have the ability and want to remain in work.   There is cross-party support for my Bill, which is an important piece of legislation.  I ask the Minister to address that issue.  A money message is needed to allow that piece of legislation move to the next Stage.<\/p> <p> My party is not opposed to the Pension Fund (Prohibition of Levies) Bill but we are aware that in all likelihood it is not intended to be progressed in any serious way.  It certainly does not belong in the Constitution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052500047#UU00200","speaker":"1252","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1495735200,"counter":473,"content":"<p>Deputy O'Dea has expressed concern about pensions and their sustainability.  He has published a separate Private Member's Bill in regard to defined benefit schemes.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Varadkar, is conscious of the need for reforms in the area of defined benefit pensions schemes and in that regard he has published the general scheme of the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2017, as I mentioned in my opening remarks.  That Bill aims to change the current position whereby the employer can trigger events that wind up a scheme and have no responsibility for bringing a scheme back to a stable position.  The Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2017 provides for improved engagement between employers, pension scheme trustees and scheme members as well as providing a 12 month lead-in time in situations where an employer intends to wind up a defined benefit scheme.  This reform is very important in view of the unfortunate cases where employers ceased contributing to defined pension schemes with very little notice to scheme members.  The Minister's proposed amendments would give time for engagement and negotiation between trustees, scheme members and employers as well as giving time for trustees and scheme members to plan the wind-up of the scheme and discuss and consider alternative pension provisions.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill provides for more certain timelines than is currently the case.  Specifically, it proposes to introduce a six-month timeline for the submission of funding proposals for schemes in deficit and obliges employers sponsoring defined benefit schemes, whether in deficit or not, to give 12 months' notice of their intention to cease contributions.  The Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2017 will provide an incentive to employers to engage with trustees and to ensure employees and the Pensions Authority are informed of the employer's intention with a significant lead-in time.  This compares favourably with the current situation whereby employers can walk away from a scheme at any time.  The proposed amendments improve protection for members of defined benefit schemes while strengthening the obligation and incentive for employers and trustees to reach agreement to eliminate any shortfalls in the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister is also working to give practical effect to the commitment in A Programme for a Partnership Government to make our older years better years.  He will be bringing forward a five-year action plan for Government approval which will provide a blueprint for sustainable and adequate incomes for people following their retirement.  These measures demonstrate the Government's commitment to this area.  I thank Deputy O'Dea for giving us the opportunity to debate the important issue of pensions.<\/p><p> There are now no levies on pension funds.  The primary levy ended in 2014 and the smaller levy ended in 2015.  The Government has no intention of reintroducing the levies.  There is no issue arising from the programme for Government that would suggest that there is any prospect of a levy in the immediate future.  Consequently, the very far-ranging imposition on the Constitution proposed by the Deputy is disproportionate, in my view, to the prospect of a levy, which no one intends imposing, arising in the future.  While I thank the Deputy for the opportunity to debate the issue, I do not think he should proceed with this particular Bill.<\/p> <p> The levy was introduced in desperate times.  The option being pushed at us by the troika was to abolish the tax relief on pensions.  We refused to do that.  If one looks at the simple arithmetic of it, approximately one quarter of what was given to pension funds in terms of tax relief was taken back by the Exchequer over a very temporary period.  There is no intention of doing that again.  Very generous tax breaks are still allowed for those who save for pensions.  This will remain the case and it is the intention of the Government to continue on that basis.  The money collected at the time was put to very good use.  The hospitality sector and the tourist industry were restored by the drop in the VAT rate from 13.5% to 9%.  In the context of a wider economic framework, the restoration of economic growth and of so many sectors in the economy has underpinned pension funds in this country, has made such funds viable again and has increased the potential benefits to pensioners.  Taking it in the round, the levy was a good temporary measure in an emergency but not to be advocated as a permanent part of the tax code.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052500048#VV00200","speaker":"1326","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1495735800,"counter":475,"content":"<p>I appreciate that there is no levy in place now but we want to ensure that it will not, at some point in the future, be brought back in the format in which it previously existed.  No Government wants to bring in a levy like that, but the amount of moneys held by pension funds is an irresistible temptation to Governments when times are hard and when ready cash is needed.  The Minister mentioned the tax relief for pension contributions, which is very generous, but unfortunately the problem with the tax relief for pension contributions is that it operates in a very skewed way.  I saw figures recently which suggested that 70% of that tax relief went directly to the top 20% of earners and less than 0.5% went to the bottom 20% of earners.  We have to try to find a better way to do it.  In view of what the Minister said about the Constitution and in view of the advice he has got I will not push this Bill to a vote.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Brady said that this is not the way to go about making laws.
