It is good to see them.  We are now at a crunch phase.  It depends on the day of the week as to whether we can be optimistic or pessimistic about the outcome but let us hope that the utterings over the past 24 hours mean that there will be a deal in place.  Regardless of that, the truth is that even a deal scenario will present many challenges to ICSA and ICMSA members.<\/p> <p>  To follow on from some of the remarks in the statements, I will ask a couple of questions first of the ICSA.  As we will be meeting with Bord Bia later on, can the ICSA give us a view as to whether or not it thinks Bord Bia is doing enough for its members in identifying and supporting products at an international level?  In its statement the ICSA referred to the &euro;5 billion Brexit reserve fund as woefully inadequate.  That is a fund of which Ireland will receive only a portion.  Can the witnesses indicate what figures they think are required and how they should be pin pointed and addressed, either at a domestic or an EU level?<\/p> <p>  One of the big issues is going to be trade and we have spent much time in this committee talking about the potentially devastating impact of Mercosur.  If the ICSA has a position on the CETA trade agreement with Canada, could it share it with us?<\/p> <p>  The ICMSA expressed concern that much Brexit-related funding is directed towards State agencies and links further up the supply chain, as opposed to farmers who arguably need it more.  Can Mr. McCabe or Mr. Enright outline the types of supports they think need to be in place for farmers?<\/p> <p>  The ICMSA highlighted that the growth of agrifood exports since 2010 stands at 63%.  Does the ICMSA have an idea of how much of this related to the British market and how much of this has been generated since the 2016 vote on Brexit?  I welcome any views on how this can be mitigated.<\/p> <p>  How concerned are both organisations about the potential for delays when the land bridge is being used?  We have already seen delays at ports in Britain.  Do they think we have done enough to mitigate that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2020121500002#A00600","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607990400,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for the invitation and Deputy Carthy for the questions.  To answer the first one on whether Bord Bia is doing enough, it is impossible to say what enough is at the moment.  Since Brexit there has been some improvement in diversifying our exports into other markets.  Much effort was put, predominantly of course, into China but China has been disrupted in the past year because of its difficulty with animal disease.  That has been problematic.<\/p> <p>  Our export of beef to continental Europe has improved.  We have gained in volume in much of the European continental markets, so we have gone up in exports.  In 2015 before Brexit our exports to the Continent were around 219,000 tonnes of beef while in 2019 that was up to 253,000 tonnes.  There has been an improvement in terms of France, Netherlands, Scandinavia and Germany.  That is positive but these amounts are in the tens of thousands while 260,000 tonnes of beef went to the UK in 2019.  Clearly, we have not achieved enough diversification to date.  It is obviously very hard to see how we can find a market for even half of the beef if, for example, half of the beef to the UK had to be diverted.<\/p> <p>  We welcome that there was an agreement for the development for a suckler brand in the beef task force and we would hope the money there will be used.  We have a concern that the meat industry and some of the main processors are not showing all that much enthusiasm in  trying to develop suckler beef as a premium product.<\/p><p>Our view is that the suckler brand needs to be managed and owned by farm organisations, farmers and small companies as much as by Bord Bia or big business.  Similar remarks can be made about the PGI grass-fed standard.  We want to make sure that is controlled for the benefit of the primary producer in this country.  PGIs are meant to benefit primary producers.  That is set out in EU legislation but let us see what will happen on that. <\/p><p> The Deputy mentioned the Mercosur and CETA agreements.  The CETA deal like the Mercosur deal is one in which beef was sacrificed for the benefit of other sectors.  The only thing that can be said about CETA is that Canada has not been aggressive about taking up the quota under the agreement but we would have a concern that the agreement does not work for beef producers.  Overall, it is time to very much reflect on whether these trade deals which were done when there was no thought about Brexit are still appropriate.  Under the Mercosur agreement, there is the potential for 99,000 tonnes of beef to be brought into the European market.  That was entirely the wrong deal at the wrong time.  It was initiated when the gap in the market that could be used to justify it was the fact that the UK was short of beef.  If the UK is out of the European Union, there is no justification for bringing in additional beef to disrupt an already chaotic market.  We have to say it is a chaotic market if beef we would normally export to the UK without the imposition of tariffs is now struggling to find a home but if tariffs that could be imposed on exports to the UK cause a disruption to that market we cannot afford to be bringing in beef from outside the EU.  The logistics disruption through the landbridge is posing a big problem regardless of whether we will have a deal.  Some additional ferry capacity was announced in recent months by Stena Line and so on but there is not anywhere near enough ferry capacity to mitigate the disruption to the landbridge.  In our view there needs to be a serious discussion at EU level about subsidising additional ferry capacity direct from Ireland to Europe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2020121500002#A00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eddie Punch","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607990400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Would Mr. Lorcan McCabe or Mr. John Enright like to respond?

We are all aware of the fact that we are operating in a vacuum at the moment.  Much of what we will discuss could turn out to be hypothetical.  As was mentioned previously, it is not looking good.  Even the best case scenario being flagged would give rise to issues in January or in the early months of whatever agreement is made.  I have a few brief questions mainly seeking elaboration on points.  Most of questions are for both organisations but I will focus initially on the ICSA.  I have been trying to find positives in these deliberations.  I would like to hear the witnesses' opinions on the possibilities for an increased or an improved sheep market depending on the outcome of the negotiations.  We are all familiar with the quantity of Welsh sheep going to France.  If that was not as easy a flight or journey for the UK after the negotiations are concluded, would there be an opening there for our sector?  Have the witnesses' organisations any strategies among their members with an eye to that market or improved markets?  Rather than concentrating on the negatives, we need to look for any positives that may be available and we certainly need to be in a position to take advantage of those if they arise.  I would like to hear the ICSA's position on the possibility of an improvement for the sheep sector as we go forward.<\/p><p>The two organisations' submissions are very much about increased markets and new markets and putting the ball back in the political court and Bord Bia&rsquo;s court.  What interaction have they had with their membership?  Have they any strategies for diversification, changing farming methods or how their memberships can deal with possible outlooks?  Everybody here will be fighting for us to get as much as of the &euro;5 billion as is possible and for it to be spread out as best as it can be and to the most appropriate areas of need as possible.  What work have the organisations done with their membership or how are their members reacting to how they can, along with the aid, possibly overcome some of the hurdles that may appear?<\/p><p>The increased ferry capacity is to be welcomed but we could do with much more of it.  Has the ICMSA done any research taking account of the increased ferry capacity with regard to lairage for live calf exports?  Will lairage still be an issue or will the increased ferry capacity open up the lairage that will be available for use?<\/p><p>With respect to both organisations, but particularly the ICSA. I want to return to an issue highlighted by the Irish Co-Operative Organisation Society in its submission to the committee last week.  It relates to existing free trade agreements <i>in situ<\/i>between the EU and varying counties.  It highlighted the fact that irrespective of the Northern Ireland protocol Northern Ireland milk, in the small print in some of those agreements, could still  be seen as a third country product and that could be a potential major issue for countries to which we currently export under free trade agreements.  Because of the small print in those agreements, those countries may not be able to recognise Northern Ireland milk other than as a third country product, irrespective of the Northern Ireland protocol.  Has the ICMSA encountered that issue or has any work been done it, or what strategy would it have to overcome that if it were to become an issue?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2020121500002#B00300","speaker":"1651"},{"type":"speech","time":1607990400,"counter":13,"content":"<p>On the export of calves, has either organisation had talks with the shipping companies on the capacity they will have for calf exports?

The first concerned supports for farmers.  On that issue, when beef prices collapsed in 2019, while some supports were put in place for farmers, and we acknowledge the beef exceptional aid measure, BEAM, scheme, many farmers did not receive support for the losses they suffered.  That includes many dairy farmers who had more than 40 dairy cows, which we thought was very unfair.<\/p> <p>  Ultimately, supports come down to farm income and what income farmers have from their farm enterprises.  In a no-deal scenario, obviously, we would be concerned about the beef side, in particular, but there could also be a negative impact on the dairy side of things.  We believe the &euro;5 billion Brexit adjustment fund needs to directly address losses which may occur.  We hope losses do not occur, but we hope farmers will be properly compensated if they do, because this problem has not been caused by farmers and they should not take the hit for it.  We made the point that there was a great deal of support for people further up the supply chain.  The reality, however, is that any losses which occur will eventually be passed down to the primary producers and we will take the hit as farmers.  Deputy Carthy also asked me about the growth in agrifood exports of 63% since 2010.  In 2018, exports of food to the UK amounted to &euro;4.8 billion.  Growth in exports to the UK will continue, although there will probably be better growth outside it.  We cannot, however, understate the importance of the UK market for our farmers, whether they are in the beef, sheep and-or dairy sectors.<\/p> <p>  Turning to ferry capacity, our deputy president addressed that issue.  The Chairman asked us about our contact with the shipping companies.  We have been in constant contact with the live exporters in that regard.  The major concern is that if there are delays across the land bridge, lorries will go direct to the Continent and then there is the question of whether that will impact on capacity during the key period from February to late April.  We simply do not know the answer to that now, given all the uncertainty.  Everybody hopes a deal will be done, but this issue will have to be watched carefully.  The new year will be a critical time for our trade in our calves.  There is a market for them and we can supply good quality calves to that market.<\/p> <p>  Regarding Senator Paul Daly's point concerning existing free trade agreements, there are issues with them.  Hopefully, a Brexit deal will be concluded.  In that context, we will have to return to the issue of certification of products, because there is a long-standing relationship between North and South in respect of processing, etc., and it is important that we retain that relationship.  Our deputy president has strong views on that matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2020121500002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Enright"},{"type":"speech","time":1607990400,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses.

If there are going to be queues of a day or two days at Dover, then there is no way that calves can go that way.  If there is rough weather during the spring, I would be worried about whether the transport of calves would be allowed to go across the Bay of Biscay.  I do not know if that would be possible, and it is something which will have to be watched.  It is vital, however, that the calves get out of the country, because there will be a knock-on effect on the beef industry if too many of them stay here.<\/p> <p>  Moving on to sheep, in one sense this situation might actually help sheep farmers in the short term, because up to 450,000 to 500,000 lambs from Northern Ireland and the UK come into Ireland and are slaughtered here every year.  That puts pressure on the price that Irish farmers get.  Much of the lamb produced in the UK goes to France now.  There may be positive aspects in that area, therefore.  The major areas for us, however, are beef and dairy, and they are going to take a hit.  Looking at the overall tariffs being discussed, the estimate for the food industry is &euro;1.35 billion or something in that ballpark.  That is more than the total amount that comes into the country in respect of the single farm payment, so that puts things into perspective regarding how much farmers will be affected on the ground.  We know all these difficulties will end up being passed back to the primary producers.  Mr. Punch will now deal with the figures on the more technical side of this situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2020121500002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Edmond Phelan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607990400,"counter":24,"content":"<p>There are also many known unknowns in this area.  We can calculate what the value of tariffs will be.  In reality, however, a negotiation must happen between processors and purchasers of beef in the UK.  There will also be impacts in respect of the currency exchange rate movements.  Much damage was done to the beef sector in the past four years, because as soon as the Brexit vote went through the value of sterling dropped significantly and it has never recovered.  We hope that that aspect has been built into the price, but if the ongoing talks end badly, there could be further weakening of sterling and could add more damage to the saleability of our beef in the UK than just tariffs.  We must also consider the impact of economic negativity, combined with potentially dearer beef for UK consumers.  That is assuming there would be a hit to UK consumers and that would impact on the overall consumption of Irish beef in the UK market.<\/p> <p>  It is hard, therefore, for anybody to forecast the exact outcome.  It is clear, though, that this is not just a matter of tariffs.  It also involves potential exchange rate movements, impacts on consumption in the UK and logistics costs, whether in respect of delays at ports or additional customs clearance bureaucracy.  All of that adds to costs.  One thing we are concerned about even if a deal is got across the line, which we still hope will happen, is that it is now looking like it is late in the day to have this situation sorted out for January.  We might, therefore, have a temporary period of chaos until the deal kicks in.  That may imply trading on WTO terms at the start of the new year, but we do not know yet.  There is also a problem in respect of the European Parliament having to ratify a deal.  Therefore, there is a great deal of potential for uncertainty.<\/p> <p>  We think significant efforts have been made to get product across to the UK before the end of the year.  That has perhaps helped the trade for beef in marts, and we have seen a great deal of purchasing of beef cattle from Northern Ireland, in particular.  There is a slight concern, however, that that development will have an impact on the price of beef early in the new year.  I refer to the stocking up of products in the UK in anticipation of disruption early in the new year.  All those things point to many difficulties for farmers early in 2021.  The other side of that equation, though, is that some farmers I know of have slowed down finishing cattle because they do not want to have too many cattle for beef markets in January.  That is leading to a problem with the BEAM scheme as well, because we are going that bit slower with finishing cattle.  We had a meeting with officials from the Department yesterday regarding the BEAM scheme 5% reduction, which we see as being increasingly problematic in the context of everything going on with Covid and Brexit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2020121500002#C00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eddie Punch"},{"type":"speech","time":1607990400,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Punch.

We must ensure these animals get to the Continent in an appropriate timeline.  It is debatable, to say the least, whether we can guarantee that in the current environment.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the calf exporters, this committee did a report on this topic several years ago.

Farmers are going up to 200 or 400 cows.  Where does it stop?  Are we going to go to a New Zealand scenario?  That has knock-on effects for beef as we have overproduction and that is why prices are very poor for beef at the moment.<\/p> <p>  The calf issue is, again, more of a question for the ICMSA but it does affect us.  I do not know the answer.  The Wicklow Calf Company has said that flying the calves out is just not an option.  The cost is out of the question so that will not work.  It will have to be some ferry, whether direct to the Continent or through the land bridge.  I do not know.

We talked to some Brazilian exporters who are seeing somewhat of a boom in exporting Brazilian beef to China at the moment and there is a slight hope that they will focus on China and keep away from Europe.  There is clearly still a lot of opportunity in China and we have to work very hard with the Chinese to get over the temporary little setback in terms of the atypical case.  It is still a big challenge.  We have gone from exports of just over 500,000 tonnes of beef in 2015 to 560,000 in 2019.  That is a significant increase in beef and we are not going to have less beef in the next few years.  This is a big challenge for us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2020121500002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eddie Punch"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607990400,"counter":30,"content":"<p>As Mr. Phelan alluded to, it is just not feasible to export calves by plane.

As the land bridge is going to be a problem, hundreds more trucks will be heading for the ferries in Ireland, thereby putting the exporters of calves at a disadvantage.

Have farm organisations met with the banks regarding farmers who have issues with borrowings?  I hope it will not be the same situation as that of the pub sector.  Many publicans had the moratorium on payments and have gone back to negotiating because their businesses are not open but they are being told to forget it and that there are no more deals on the table.

I believe it is an anti-competitive practice but it is not a regulatory problem.  EU regulations on labelling require country of origin on every specific portion of beef.  Traditionally, the view of UK supermarkets has been that to use a label stating \"Born in Ireland, finished in UK\" would be too complex for supermarket consumers to understand.  They have simply refused to do it.  The interesting thing is that the Italian consumer, apparently, is more intelligent than the British consumer because they are able to understand it.  In our view, it is an anti-competitive practice in the UK imposed by supermarkets.  There is a question mark in our view about whether processors have been too willing to accept that particular answer at UK level.<\/p> <p>  I will go back to the question of PGI and what was discussed at the beef task force.  Considerable time was spent fighting to ensure the PGI application and the suckler brand application were controlled by a monitoring committee with majority farmer representation.  It was agreed in the discussions that the monitoring committee would have the final say on how the suckler brand and PGI would be organised.  Obviously, at the moment there is no PGI status, but as soon as it is agreed the monitoring committees have the final say on the use of these.<\/p> <p>  There is an element of a grey area around this.  Traditionally, PGI status has been sought by co-operatives or groups of farmers or primary producers.  For example, Connemara hill lamb was secured by a co-operative of primary producers in Connemara.  This is tricky because Bord Bia is the applicant.  We want the monitoring group to have a complete say over it.  However, nothing is written in stone.  There is agreement that the monitoring committee for PGI status will be majority farmer represented.  Until such time as the application is passed at EU level, the PGI monitoring committee will not be up and running.  That is all we can say about that.  In private discussions with the Department and Bord Bia we have spent considerable time insisting that the use of PGI status had to be within the control of the monitoring group.  That means the use of the logo.<\/p> <p>  There are difficulties with PGI.  The EU regulations state that PGI status is available to any primary producer that meets the standard set out in the PGI document.  This is difficult.  Let us suppose some farmers set up a given PGI status and then ICMSA sets up PGI status.  Then, let us suppose another group of farmers meet the standard set out in the PGI status.  We would have difficultly in saying they cannot use it.  That is the EU regulation aspect of it.  If a producer meets all the standards set out under the PGI, it is not permitted, as we understand it, for a group or co-operative of farmers to claim it is theirs alone.  That is why there are challenges in respect of a national PGI status.  Such difficulties might not arise if there was a localised PGI status.  For example, it is obvious that a farmer in Waterford cannot benefit from a PGI called Connemara hill lamb.  However, when there is a national PGI, there are questions marks about restricting the its use.  That will not be solved even after the PGI is granted.  We will have to see what the EU says about it first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2020121500002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eddie Punch"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607990400,"counter":38,"content":"<p>Can I come in?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2020121500002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Lorcan McCabe"},{"type":"speech","time":1607990400,"counter":39,"content":"<p>I will let Mr. McCabe in shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2020121500002#E00600","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607990400,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I will also comment on the nomad issue.

Will Bord Bia give us an update on the protected geographical indication, PGI, statuses?  I have been speaking to a number of people in Europe who I know would have an interest in this.  In terms of PGIs bringing added value, the narrower the scope the more value they bring to those who fall within them.  A balance always has to be struck, however, because clearly everybody would want to be part of them, but that would bring no additional benefit.  Is Bord Bia confident that the balance is right in the PGI statuses that are being proposed?  Will the farmers who fall within it in terms of their product see a return in terms of a price increase?  Outside of that, a PGI will mean nothing to them, except additional bureaucracy perhaps.

I have gone through some of the revisions that have been set out and it appears that the internal IT system, the internal audit and the issues around the companies that operate as nominating agents are technical issues.  Will there be a drive to address those as speedily as possible so that we do not have a situation in which, after all the issues we have raised and the capital we have expended in setting out the importance of having an all-Ireland sector, the first thing we would do is submit a PGI status that eliminates the all-Ireland element?<\/p><p> Bord Bia referenced horticultural companies as being focused on their existing markets.  That is true, but having dealt with a number of people in that sector, they are also particularly concerned about the availability of peat products.

There is no obvious solution from the perspective of a replacement product, and there is a quality challenge if peat has to be imported or if a substitute for it must be found.  A paper has been created on that with the industry and this has been shared with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  This paper has been discussed by our board and at the horticulture forum.  We are looking, in partnership with the industry, to try to navigate towards the solutions to that.  However, I would not underestimate the challenge of that either.<\/p> <p>  That was a fair question on the European-specific exports and why that research is only being launched now.  We have been doing lots of other things and we are being very transparent on what we do, when we do it and why we are doing it.  The first piece of work we have been focusing on, especially at the prepared foods industry, has been to look at its capacity first and its prioritisation.  We have looked at a significant lead generation opportunity for those industries as well and the Deputy would have seen detail of that in the Committee of Public Accounts.  Then we were looking at the broader picture to see if we were missing a trick.  This was the further sense check we did with industry to try to navigate who exactly is engaging with the British product.  As it is becoming more and more obvious that the negative scenario may be a more evident solution, we are looking to see if there is any stone we can turn within that.  In the past two sessions, Senator Paul Daly has been consistently asking us to find the opportunity in Brexit as much as the negativity, and that is exactly what that research is about.  The timing of it is related to the resources available to us but we would always challenge ourselves to do more faster, bigger and better.  That is why we are transparent on when we do everything.<\/p> <p>  I will bring Mr. Brennan in on the PGIs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2020121500002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Tara McCarthy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607990400,"counter":55,"content":"<p>Deputy Carthy's question was about the balance in the PGI application and the potential, if we are to be successful in the application, for any PGI to extract a premium from the marketplace.  We were challenged from the outset on what that balance needed to look like.  On the one hand, we needed an application that would hopefully be robust enough to get beyond the European Commission in its criteria and in its assessment of it.  At the same time, given the challenges the beef sector is facing in Ireland, particularly at farm level, we sought to ensure that the maximum number of farms could benefit from any PGI if we were to be successful.<\/p><p>That was the balance we were trying to strike.  There were many conversations through the beef task force meetings over the past number of months as we tried to finalise that.  We got consensus on that at the October meeting of the beef task force.  There was general agreement that the application was robust and ready to be put forward to Brussels.<\/p><p> When we look across Europe in terms of premia for protected geographical indication, PGI, products, it varies a little by market and by product but if we take examples, we are looking at products carrying a premium typically of between 5% and 20%.  Some of them are on a much smaller scale in terms of the level of output, as the Deputy rightly highlighted, but there is a premium position for a product that carries a PGI label.  In terms of the way we are looking at it, if we were lucky enough to be successful with the PGI application for Irish grass-fed beef it would allow us build a much stronger position for Irish beef than we were able to do heretofore in that we can call out the Irishness in a much more open way and build a brand around Irish grass-fed beef.  We believe that gives us the opportunity to deliver a premium over time.  It may not be overnight but over time we believe it would have the potential to do that.<\/p><p> In terms of the Deputy's second question around the technical IT systems, the other element of the application was, and based on engagements we had with the European Commission throughout the 20-month process or whatever it was, that we had to have a robust verification system in place.  In terms of the Irish grass-fed beef PGI application, therefore, we have been anxious to be able to demonstrate that to strengthen the application as much as possible.  <\/p><p> In terms of the technical IT systems in Northern Ireland, we have had ongoing engagements with our counterparts in Northern Ireland over the past number of months sharing how we approach it and the infrastructure that we have in place.  The application that has been submitted to Brussels contains the application itself and an accompanying cover letter discusses the interest and the approach in terms of Northern Ireland being part of that over a period of time.  It is about trying to strike that balance on that element of it also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2020121500002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Padraig Brennan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607990400,"counter":57,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for coming before the committee.

Are the delegates happy with the work being done at the ports in the South in light of Brexit?  Is there capacity to avoid the traffic delays and to ensure it will be possible to get in and out of ports?  Regarding ports such as those in Ringaskiddy and Foynes, and even Dublin Port, are the delegates happy that it will be possible to get in and out appropriately with raw materials?  Could I have some clarity on this?<\/p> <p>  Regarding Brexit and the involvement of Bord Bia, I wish to ask about the Brexit barometer published over the past three years, if not four.  It has been very interesting to see how the industry has been working on Brexit.  The delegates might elaborate on that process, including the benefits and pitfalls, and on how they believe industries have been engaging with the process, particularly over the past four years.  What is the position of the next phase?  Without a shadow of a doubt, there will be some element of disruption.  How can we work on getting back into the UK market?  The UK is still our nearest neighbour and we will still be dealing with it.

This will be very topical in the next few weeks and months.  I welcome the remark that I may have been wrong in saying there was no calf forum in place.

I understand one of the most significant calf exporters is outside the loop and that this was creating issues.  It might be appropriate to have clarity on who the forum members are.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the levy on live exports, what is the levy per animal?

We have been running the Brexit barometer since 2017.  We have run three Brexit barometers and in 2020, we launched what we called the \"readiness radar\", expanding the scope beyond Brexit to Covid-19 to sustainability, talent and all the other matters currently facing the sector.  We are confident the Brexit barometer and readiness radar are the most robust and detailed risk diagnostics in respect of Brexit anywhere.  These diagnostics are recognised as such and won European risk awards because of the detailed data sets.<\/p> <p>  Essentially, this allows us to work with a client on a bespoke one-to-one basis and to identify sector-level trends around Brexit preparedness, whether it is on supply chain and logistics, customs, customer relationships, finance, market diversification and so on.  As it evolved over the year, client preparedness and confidence on certain Brexit matters have climbed significantly.  One example is confidence in supply chain design and partners, and their preparedness has climbed a lot.<\/p> <p>  We have seen jumps in the gathering of economic operators' registration and identification, EORI, numbers, which is an issue for the sectors outside food and drink.  These are needed to do business with a third country.  Our clients registered for EORI numbers very early on in 2017 and 2018.  We have not seen as much progress as we would have liked in customs compliance, largely because of the distraction around tariffs and companies have missed the fact that customs compliance, which is an inevitability come January, will add cost as well.  All these non-tariff barriers are a concern for companies.  What we have really focused on this year on the back of the Brexit barometer and readiness radar is looking at the hidden costs of declarations, including transit declarations, health certificates and so on, or the cost of hiring a customs agent.<\/p> <p>  There are other areas that we have not been able to benchmark year on year because the nature of those questions has changed.  We would always have been looking at whether a client has engaged with UK customers on Brexit and outlined issues with respect to delays in the supply chain.  This year we have seen a major jump in the commercial scope of those discussions.  We have moved away from possible delays in the supply chain to looking at the cost of those non-tariff barriers and tariffs, as well as how this might affect commercial contracts.  That is largely how it has evolved over the past four years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2020121500002#L00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Shane Hamill"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607990400,"counter":99,"content":"<p>Perhaps I can build one final piece on that.  We have used that information to guide the work we do to ensure what we are doing is hitting the pain points of companies.  One part we probably have not spoken enough about is that we have also used this as a toolkit to show confidence to the market.  It is really important that when we speak to our UK customers, they do not have the impression that Ireland is not prepared and their supply chain may be at risk.  We and our team in the UK have been very diligent at making sure that our customers know that if they are looking at anywhere in Europe, the Irish food industry is best prepared for the obvious disruption that may occur.  We have used that data set at every meeting we run to give that confidence, and we are hearing back that it is working.<\/p> <p>  Many retailers may be frightened about having no product on a shelf because it loses money, in effect.  We can go in with this robust data set to market Irish food, which is fundamentally what we are trying to do, and we are using it for that purpose as much as we are using it to guide our way through any gaps we perceive or getting signals from the industry about.<\/p> <p>  Even when we speak about the agri-food industry's readiness etc., it is the responsibility of all of us to ensure we do not create jitters in the market.  The market should know the huge level of preparedness, although this does not undermine the huge risks we are facing.  We are very conscious of that but we would never leave an occasion go past without saying that our industry has put huge effort into this.  We can benchmark against any country around Europe and even the level of preparedness, investment and focus on this topic in the UK has been nowhere near ours.<\/p> <p>  On exports, it is not a \"calf exporters association\" but a live exporters association.  We have not got involved in who is in or not in it.  We put in a request to the industry so that we and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine could engage with the association.  We have not got involved to the level of who is in it or not.  We did not think it was within our remit.  We wanted to ensure it was representative so there was an efficiency and the committee's report would have suggested it was a requirement for the industry to advance.

There was mention of trade missions for livestock exporters and there have been four of those trade missions in the past three years to international markets.  It is a big focus of growth.  There is also the question of inward buyer visits in the livestock trade.  Buyers want to see animals and how they are produced on a farm so over the past number of years, we have had a series of inward buyer visits from six international markets, as well as all our major European markets, including Spain, Italy, the Netherlands etc.<\/p> <p>  Another area in which we have put more investment is Africa and the committee is aware that Algeria has come aboard as a new market for Irish livestock.  We have a dedicated market expert on the ground working for us in that region and that is important as we try to grow our trade to the region over the years to come.<\/p> <p>  There is also the area of trade shows, particularly in our main European markets.  These are the livestock shows that are really important for exporters and ourselves to engage with buyers or people who have bought from us in the past.  There is also the area of advertising and promotion.  From a welfare and transport perspective, it is important we are able to demonstrate the quality and integrity of the systems in Ireland for livestock.  These are a number of key areas on which we focus.<\/p> <p>  The trends in live exports vary annually but this year we are on track to export approximately 260,000 animals.  Our calf exports have been very negatively affected by the fall away in the veal sector in the Netherlands as a consequence of Covid-19 and a massive drop in the food service sector.  The majority of veal is sold through that food service sector.  Even allowing for that, there were 260,000 animals exported this year, we can compare this with approximately 150,000 animals per year in 2015 or 2016.  There has been progress made over the past five years in the numbers of animals exported and I hope we can make further progress.<\/p> <p>  There is no doubt but there are challenges coming down the track for 2021 as the veal sector is in a very difficult position.

We could have anything from 10% duty on horse feed under World Trade Organization rules and even up to 32% on pet foods.<\/p><p>Many of our transport people ask us what we do about traffic and preparedness.  We would have to go back and ask the Department if it can give us more help.

Good quality grain has the same land requirement as good quality grass.  The competition between grass and grain is high.  There is a better return for the beef and dairy sectors for grass, so the competition for land is difficult.

However, we were not sitting at home, looking out the window and wondering what was happening either.  We pivoted with regard to how we did our business.  We invested differently.  Many trade fairs that we planned to go to were cancelled.  We had already undertaken a trade mission in February and had planned another three throughout the year but we were grounded.<\/p> <p>  We have invested in virtual trade missions.  We do not believe it is a replacement for the real thing but it is much better than doing nothing.  We have invested in lead generation to identify who the buyers are and profile the buyers to know who we are targeting.  We have invested in communicating with those buyers so that they know that Ireland is open for business.  We have invested in getting those buyers to come to a virtual platform to meet Irish industry.  We are all experiencing a different world of engaging virtually rather than physically.  We trained companies about how to make a virtual pitch.  One normally gets a feel for a room but cannot do that virtually.  How does one create virtual pitches and what are the key messages that one gives?  How does one bring Irish agriculture to life when doing it on a video or digitally?  We have invested significantly in that to create the assets that the Irish food industry needs, whether in dairy, seafood or any other sector.  We have experimented in that space, attending virtual trade fairs and creating our own virtual trade missions.<\/p> <p>  Every time we changed a penny in how that fund was allocated, we brought it to our board to ensure that we had the rigour of governance behind it.  We never looked to squirrel away money or such but always went to the board when there was a change of priority or what was available to us, and a resulting change in activities or programmes.  I confirm that in every board meeting from April to December, we came back all the time with new ways of working and new platforms.  In November, we did five days of virtual trade missions.  We were the first organisation in the State to deliver virtual ministerial trade missions throughout the world.  We did virtual top-to-top meetings and had global trade meetings with our global customers.  We have substituted for being unable to go to market in our ways of working and invested accordingly to have the assets to do that.  I hope I have addressed the budget movements over Covid.<\/p> <p>  Looking at our productivity and how we are looking to return value for money, we have strict governance to ensure there is no opportunity for Bord Bia to hide from any key performance indicator or any deliverable.  We have five subsidiary boards and a main board which can interrogate our accounts and activities, receive advance plans of everything that we do, and receive presentations of what we have achieved and its impact.  We are proud of the productivity of the organisation with regard to the key performance indicators that we work towards, every part of which is shared with our board, on which there is significant farmer and industry representation.<\/p> <p>  We recruit for every trade fair.  One rule that we have for trade fairs is that only Irish products go on a Bord Bia stand.  If a company wants to sell a product that does not come from Ireland, we would prefer that it is not on our stand.  It is simple.<\/p><p>I have a question about the future, outside Covid and Brexit.  We do not know; it is crystal ball stuff.  Will Bord Bia be publishing a new smart food strategy in 2021 for the future and will it bring it before the committee at some stage so we can have a outline of what is proposed?

While good progress has been made to date, especially in renewable electricity, where we have achieved 36.5% in 2019 as against our target of 40%, it is projected that a shortfall of between 3% and 4% is likely by year end.  In terms of renewable heat, Ireland is projected to achieve approximately 50% of the 12% target by 2020.  Ireland is not alone among member states that will fall short of their binding renewable energy targets.<\/p> <p>  To meet the 2020 target and ensure compliance with the directive, my Department has negotiated international agreements with Estonia and Denmark to purchase statistical transfers for 2020.  Following Government approval on 24 November, I signed both agreements in Dublin earlier this month and they will enter into force subject to ratification by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.<\/p> <p>  In terms of costs, the State will pay &euro;37.5 million to Estonia for the purchase of 2.5 terawatt hours, TWh, of energy and &euro;12.5 million to Denmark for a volume of 1 TWh of energy.  In total, the State will procure 3.5 TWh of renewable energy at a cost of &euro;50 million.  This is a significant cost to the State but it is important to point out that the funds received by both Estonia and Denmark will be used to accelerate deployment of renewable electricity in their jurisdictions in line with their national energy and climate plans.  While it was not our preference to achieve compliance via this mechanism, which is available to all member states under the directive, we have exhausted all alternative options for compliance through short-term action.  This mechanism is part of the European architecture under the 2009 renewable energy directive designed to allow member states meet their targets.  Ireland is not alone in that Luxembourg, Malta and the Netherlands have all concluded similar arrangements in recent years.<\/p> <p>  Since the Government took office in June, it has launched the first auction under the transformational renewable electricity support scheme.  This will see a major upscaling in renewable energy projects connecting to the grid from 2021, with, for the first time, solar energy and community-owned projects supplying homes across Ireland.  Similarly, we are rolling out schemes to decarbonise and electrify our heat and transport sectors and combine these with a renewable electricity supply that is the envy of the world.  Already, Ireland has surpassed Denmark as the number one in onshore wind power in Europe and soon the first offshore wind farms will be connecting to our grid, charging our electric vehicles and powering heat pumps throughout the country.  Through the support scheme for renewable heat, substantial progress will be delivered in decarbonising our heat sector and weaning ourselves off fossil fuels.<\/p> <p>  Unfortunately, these policies and programmes will not be deployed in time to contribute significantly towards our 2020 targets, and it is important for Ireland to demonstrate its commitment to meeting renewable energy targets and honouring its EU commitments as part of the wider aspirations of the EU Green Deal.  The necessary funds are available in my Department's Vote this year.  It is important to point out to committee members that the money will be used by the member states concerned to promote renewable energy projects within their countries.  I am confident other opportunities may be afforded to Ireland in future to work closely with our EU partners on meeting renewable targets.<\/p> <p>  Both of the agreements are with EU members states with which Ireland shares a common commitment to taking robust climate action, to accelerating the roll-out of renewable energy to supply our grid, to heat our homes and to move our people as part of an integrated transport network.  Like Ireland, Denmark and Estonia are small countries with a strong European identity which have a shared ambition in developing offshore wind resources as well as a strong commitment to the digital economy.<\/p><p>I hope that these agreements will strengthen future co-operation between Ireland and its fellow member states to tackle the climate emergency and put citizens at the heart of the climate transition.    <\/p><p> Regarding the setting of climate targets more broadly and future compliance costs, I stress that the overarching context of the 2030 climate targets was Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to the goals and objectives of the 2015 Paris Agreement and regard for the evolution of climate and energy policy at EU level.  The negotiations led to an EU-wide binding renewable energy target of 32% by 2030, with national contributions to be identified through the national energy and climate plan process.  The solution to avoiding future costs for statistical transfers or other such measures is not to reduce ambition; it is to accelerate delivery across all the Departments and State agencies concerned.  These costs to the State act as a reminder of the shared EU commitment to climate action and the failure to deliver.  <\/p><p> The programme for Government acknowledges the increased effort required at national level to meet the global climate challenge and commits Ireland to a 7% annual average greenhouse gas emissions reduction between now and 2030.  When compared with the new EU-wide target in the European Green New Deal, the level of ambition in the programme for Government comes out at between 55% and 60%.  The overall objective of the programme's climate and energy commitments is to underpin the long-term, sustainable competitiveness of the economy as we transition from a redundant fossil-fuel based economic model to a carbon-neutral one.  The transition will support further job creation through the development of new and emerging sectors.  The climate action plan, which will be forthcoming next year, will further step up our ambitions with necessary actions to ensure that the cross-government effort required is being implemented and monitored effectively. <\/p><p> The green economy, including the retrofitting and renewable energy sector, the circular economy, clean mobility, green and blue infrastructure, sustainable agriculture and the bioeconomy, will all create high-quality employment opportunities that will be a source of significant employment growth over the coming decades.  I am confident these enduring benefits will outweigh any short-term costs and I look forward to working with the committee in future on delivering on this ambitious agenda.  I thank the committee for its attention, and I am happy to take questions. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12020121500002#A00300","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607990400,"counter":129,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his statement.

To say it is not ideal is a bit of an understatement.  We are where we are, however.  If anything, this agreement underlines and further emphasises the need for immediate action in respect of our goals regarding the reduction of emissions and meeting our targets.  The figure of &euro;50 million is one we could use here in our economy and put into our own infrastructure, but this is what we have met with.  The point I am trying to make is that this necessity underlines and re-emphasises the importance of meeting our goals.<\/p> <p>  In that regard, I have some questions concerning updates on particular steps.  The first is marine planning legislation, which is going to be vital in stepping up our ambition in offshore wind energy.  Where does that legislation stand and what kind of timelines can we expect for a Bill coming through the Houses?  I would also like to get the thoughts of the Minister regarding wind energy.  The possibilities of offshore wind are spoken about a great deal, but there is also a major part to play for onshore wind in reaching our renewable energy goals.  It has huge part to play in helping us to do that, although I know it is difficult and can be contentious.  I believe, however, that there should be an emphasis on continuing onshore wind projects, where possible.<\/p> <p>  Turning to retrofitting, which is obviously a major part of the programme for Government and how we achieve more efficient heating, could the Minister update us on where that scheme stands?  As we know, the current Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, scheme is caught up in administration.  There are some long waiting times, up to six months in some instances, where people are put in applications for the SEAI grant to retrofit their homes.  That needs to be addressed.  Is there a plan to bolster the staff complement administering that scheme so that applications can be dealt with faster?<\/p> <p>  Finally, and this is not quite under the remit of the Minister, but he might have answers to this question since he is in Cabinet. A robust, extensive and significant agri-environmental scheme is absolutely vital in ensuring that in some years' time we are not facing these types of penalties again.  It is not only that aspect which is important, but also bringing the farming community and the industry with us in reaching our goals.  One of the most important elements of the programme for Government is the introduction of  results-based agri-environmental schemes, where farmers are being encouraged to not only protect but enhance and increase biodiversity on their land.  The sequestration element of native woodlands must also be considered.  Where do we stand with that?  I appreciate that the Minister may not be able to provide a detailed update on that, but I would just like to emphasise its importance.  I have probably gone a bit over my time, I am sorry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12020121500002#B00300","speaker":"1545"},{"type":"speech","time":1607990400,"counter":131,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

I refer to investing in our own country and ensuring that we meet our targets.  The Deputy is also absolutely right that the marine planning and development management Bill is critical legislation in that regard, because we have potential in offshore wind to deliver.  I think there is agreement across most parties on that, and the outgoing Oireachtas agreed it in the climate action plan.  There was a target of 70% renewable electricity, and broad agreement that something like 35 GW of offshore wind could help us to deliver that target.  The full 35 GW will probably happen at a later date, but the path to achieving that will allow us to meet the 70% target of renewable electricity.<\/p> <p>  The Government has three clear legislative priorities.  I heard the Taoiseach state this on several occasions and he is correct.  We need the climate Bill as the governance structure; we need the Land Development Agency because the housing crisis is a central problem; and the third Bill mentioned as top priority is marine planning and development management legislation.  It needs to be in place so that by the end of next year we go to having an auction system for that offshore wind.  There will probably be some 2.5 GW of offshore wind in the Irish Sea, and then subsequent options in short order after that development to roll-out that offshore wind aspect.  <\/p> <p>  The planning legislation is critical in this regard so that we can have good environmental planning, manage our agriculture and fisheries and other elements at the same time and ensure that we get certainty, reliability and predictability in bringing costs down.  My understanding is the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, has responsibility for delivering it.  Every effort is being made to publish that legislation early in the new year, as I understand it.  The heads of the Bill came to Government a few weeks ago and it is getting top priority from the Office of the Attorney General.  I expect the Bill to be ready, therefore, early in the new year.<\/p> <p>  Moving on to the issue of onshore wind, the Deputy is correct that it will continue to have an important role, particularly because we have a comparative competitive cost advantage.  It is a lower cost system.  The recent auction where we approved a range of new onshore wind farms, as well as, importantly, solar farms, is critical in this regard.  Going on memory, and my officials will correct me, the contract price we struck was approximately &euro;74 per MWh, which is approximately 20% below that of the existing renewable support schemes.  I want to see the price come down more.  It can and will and should.  Onshore wind energy, therefore, has a critical role to play.  <\/p> <p>  There is a limit, however, and that is why we are looking at what is possible offshore.  There are planning constraints on that, as we saw recently in Donegal, and we must, therefore, be careful in that regard.  I agree with the Deputy, however, that onshore wind has a critical role to play in this area.  The development of community ownership of onshore wind is also critical, and we are also looking to promote that element.  We did it in the latest auction, and we will do so again.  We also want there to be community gain from onshore wind projects, which is stitched into the auction process.<\/p><p>The Deputy is correct that the SEAI was limited in its capacity.  Part of our difficulty in the heat sector is that we have not been able to ramp up in both commercial and domestic heat.  That is one of the reasons in the recent budget we sought approval for a significant increase of more than 50 new posts for the SEAI.  This recognises that we do not face this situation in future.  We have seen a massive expansion in the retrofitting budget and the SEAI's management of it.  The company is currently filling those places.  We have significant plans for next year.  We have a budget agreed this year of more than &euro;750 million, most of which is targeted towards local authority housing and the warmer home schemes, where some of the specific backlogs to which the Deputy referred are arising.  The scheme is popular, not surprisingly because it is a 100% grant.  It gives significant health and comfort benefits as well as benefits to the buildings.  It is key.<\/p><p> I agree with the Deputy on the need for a much wider agri-environmental scheme.  Again, it started in this budget with an allocation of &euro;70 million to a new environmental scheme.  It is well structured in the sense that it will fund a lot of investment in training, soil analysis and scientific preparation for the supports we will need to give to pay farmers for environmental services such as improvements in water quality, storage of carbon and improving biodiversity, as well as food.  These nature-based solutions, coming in tandem with the climate solutions, are absolutely critical to where we want to go.<\/p><p> Last but not least, we must pay for new forms of forestry such as closer to nature and continuous cover forestry, which are rich in employment, promote rich biodiversity and have a much longer term timeline but have real benefits in terms of high-quality woods for a range of different uses, including renewable heat which will help us meet future targets.  I agree with the Deputy on the need for that.  That will be the start of a big scale-up in our ambition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12020121500002#B00500","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607990400,"counter":134,"content":"<p>I congratulate the Minister on his appointment.

We had an Oireachtas joint committee which worked collectively before.  This was backed up by an approach from the then Minister, Deputy Bruton, which put much of the thinking into the 2019 climate action plan that he devised.  His previous experience with the jobs action plan and in different Departments also went into it.  As I said at the time and have said publicly since, the structure and the approach was the right one.  We are looking to continue that.  We actually submitted that existing plan, as required under European legislation, at the start of the summer.  At the time, we said we were looking to use those structures and the governance approach but, as per the programme for Government, increase the ambition.  The jobs action plan, climate action plan and multiproject timetabled systemic approach is the right approach and a real credit to Deputy Bruton.<\/p> <p>  Within that, the European Council decision last week to go to a 55% ambition is significant and progressive step.  I will have to come back to talk to Deputy Bruton after this Thursday because I am due to go to the European Council meeting in Brussels on Thursday.  Some of those details of where we will go next with effort-sharing decisions will only be worked out then.  We could not really decide on that in advance of the climate conclusions.  Just as the committee is finalising its report on climate legislation, there is real urgency in the European Council that we turn the Heads of Government agreement into climate law in the European Union and set out the effort-sharing mechanism for each member state.  That will apply to climate emissions.<\/p> <p>  I also expect it to apply to both renewables and the energy efficiency targets which are 32% and 32.5%, respectively, in the plans to date.  These will be different from what we are dealing with here in that to date they have not been country-specific targets.  We can expect significant ramping up of both the climate emissions targets, the energy efficiency targets and renewable energy targets.  That is in tune with the programme for Government.  It is appropriate we made that decision back in June and July because it puts us in line with where the European Union and similar states are going.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the RESS auctions and the community pot, it has been difficult for us and it has taken a long time to develop community energy projects.  In truth, the Templederry community wind farm is the one notable example of a project at scale.  It was welcome in the recent RESS auction system that seven projects were approved in the process.  We are restricted under European Union competition rules as to how much of the auction process can be allocated for a community pot.  It is a 2% overall limit.  We are one of the few countries that has got an agreement from the European Union to allocate a specific community fund within the auction system.  We are looking to continue that with the next auction next year.  It may well evolve towards a 100% community-owned project approach.  We have had a push to date for community projects where private developers can row in with a share of the project.<\/p><p>I am keen, given the small allocation within that overall pot, for there to be as much community ownership as possible but we will continue to monitor and address that and consider other mechanisms.  This is something that is evolving.  It is not only on the energy side.  We always focus on the generation but forget that efficiency comes first.  The first most important fuel is energy not used.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland's work on sustainable energy communities has been significant.  More than 200 plus communities engaged with it to devise plans.  Many of them relate not only to energy generation but to potential energy savings, co-ordination around retrofitting or other mechanisms to go into energy saving.<\/p><p> On the community energy side, I expect within the coming weeks to issue a public consultation on the switch towards a mechanism for us to be able to sell power back to the grid and to promote what we have been talking about for a long time but which has not taken off at scale yet, namely, the ability particularly for solar power to be done at a community level, with easy access to the grid and a price guaranteed for power that is exported where existing demand has already been met.<\/p><p> The Deputy raised a wide range of issues.  The development of offshore wind will require a great deal of State involvement in a variety of ways.  First, we will have to look at our ports to see how we can support the development of the offshore wind industry that is coming into play.  That can include in certain ports operations and maintenance facilities, which will be an important part.  In others, it may be a deployment facility where an area is needed to store, assemble and prepare for the installation of wind farms and beyond that, thinking bigger, looking at the generation of a new industrial supply chain around not only the development, particularly in the long run, of the offshore floating wind energy but the development of the use of the power that comes back in, where there is massive potential for economic development in our port areas and regional development.  <\/p><p> Increasingly, people are considering hydrogen as a storage mechanism for conversion by electrolysis of offshore wind to such power supplies which provide the potential for our ports not only to be assembly or development points for offshore wind but to be the capture point of the energy and the deployment of the energy in new industrial uses close to the source of the power.  That is the long-term prize and the reason the marine planning and development legislation is such a priority for the Government.  It will be a long process and we expect the first auction of offshore wind energy will be at the end of next year.  It will be targeted in the Irish Sea area and will involve some 2.5 GW of offshore wind.  It will deal with many legacy projects which have licensing, in some instances, going back a decade.  In the first instance, because of the short distances involved and many of the existing licensing and other arrangements are in place and grid offers and connections are organised, it will involve tiebacks to the system, particularly being close to Dublin where much of the demand is, that makes sense.  We would be tying industrial development with renewable power.  We have that in terms of offshore developments that will occur on the east coast.  That auction at the end of next year will be followed by other auctions, where we start to move into the Celtic Sea and look at the western coast and offshore floating wind energy.  The scale of power there is beyond compare.  If we were to develop that initial target of 30 GW of offshore wind, particularly floating offshore wind, it would be six times peak demand at the moment, which gives a sense of the scale of opportunity.  However, in this instance to get it right, the State has a key role to play not only in the ports to support that but in the management and development of the grid.  The question at issue is how do we collect, share, distribute and use that power.  In that instance, companies like EirGrid will have a critical role to play.  <\/p><p> Interestingly, I will be going to the Environment Council meeting on Thursday but I spent most of yesterday at the European Energy Council meeting and I also attended a meeting with the North Sea countries' offshore grid initiative, which is something I was proud to sign ten years earlier.  This is centre stage in European economic plans.  This is what every country is talking about as their main focus.  Most of the meeting of the energy ministers yesterday was taken up with the development of offshore wind and the use of the power using new power supplies like hydrogen.  We have a comparative competitive advantage.  We have the wind dislocation and a sea area ten times our land area.  I spoke to the Norwegian Minister and heard that Norway has already deployed an 80 MW floating offshore wind field.  We can expect the cost to come down and, subject to that, we can expect a major new industrial opportunity to open up for our country, in which the State will have to be centrally involved, particularly on grid planning.  <\/p><p> I hope I have addressed most of the questions.  Regarding the national energy climate action plan, as I said, we submitted the outgoing 2019 plan to meet our European obligations and they allowed the European Union to close the book, as it were, on the existing national energy and climate plans, NECPs, and to do a new impact assessment on what additional capabilities there are for each country.  The Commissioner is in the middle of that process.  We go into the new year with the aim of having an updated climate action plan which goes with at least a 7% reduction a year in a decade, a 51% reduction over the decade, and set that as our goal.  We aim to engage with all Departments and agencies to have that plan by summer next year.  It will be quite a tight timeline to get the plan completed in that time, as the former Minister, Deputy Bruton, will know, but one of the reasons we have that timeframe is to fit into the European NECP process and for us to be able to go to Glasgow next year with a clear understanding of what our role is in this transformation.<\/p><p> One of the urgencies around the climate action Bill is that I am keen that work is done in tandem with our ability to have a new climate advisory council in place for it to feed into and for its budgeting and three five-year process to be in sync with that same timetable.  They will not be exactly in sync but that makes sense.  Another reason it makes sense is that I expect those first six months next year to be critical for the review of the national development plan.  It is critical we have the new climate action plan in tandem with the national development plan review.  That is the reason this timing is as tight as it is but it is appropriate in my mind.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12020121500002#C00300","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607990400,"counter":137,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply.

I note the Minister said this money will be going to Estonia and Denmark and will be contributing to them investing in their public infrastructure in renewables.  My preference would have been that it stayed in Ireland and would have been invested in contributing to us meeting our targets.  That would have been a much better use of the money.  The sum of &euro;50 million is a considerable amount of money to be transferring overseas.  It could have paid for 5,000 solar panels on schools or retrofitted 2,500 homes.

We are one of a smallish number of member states that are going to be in deficit so we are, unfortunately, at the mercy, if I can put it that way, of the supply and demand in terms of the costs that are being charged.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12020121500002#E00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eamonn Confrey"},{"type":"speech","time":1607990400,"counter":148,"content":"<p>Is the price of &euro;15 per megawatt hour the most expensive statistical transfer that is happening at the moment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12020121500002#E00900","speaker":"1627"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607990400,"counter":149,"content":"<p>No.  My understanding is that the Maltese did a deal with a member state - I will not say the name in case I get it wrong - at a cost of &euro;20 per megawatt hour.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12020121500002#E01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eamonn Confrey"},{"type":"speech","time":1607990400,"counter":150,"content":"<p>I also have a broader question.  The Minister was talking about how we are going to make sure that we do not miss targets on the infrastructure.  It is important that we get moving on the infrastructure.  There is a significant lag time in developing that kind of renewable energy infrastructure.  One of the points that really struck me with the programme for Government is that the target for something relatively simple like retrofitting homes was a 2030 target.  Why was the target back-loaded?  A regulatory framework must be put in place for wind farms and then the engineering of the infrastructure will take a considerable period.  I would have thought retrofitting could have been front-loaded and that we could have invested heavily in it, allowing us to create jobs, plus reduce emissions.  I am just wondering why that was the case.  What I find most difficult about addressing our climate responsibilities is our speed of action for even simple things.  The roll-out of electric vehicle, EV, charging points or smart meters seems difficult.  Does the Minister think that is a barrier to doing the big infrastructure programmes?<\/p> <p>  My two questions are on why the retrofitting of houses was not front-loaded and on the speed of our implementation.  Does the Minister see it as a significant barrier?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12020121500002#E01100","speaker":"1627"},{"type":"speech","time":1607990400,"counter":151,"content":"<p>The retrofitting of 50,000 houses is probably going to be one of the most complex targets because we are talking about 50,000 families and 50,000 different types of house.  Sometimes it is easier to do one big project than 50,000 individual ones.  They are not small projects.  We are talking about deep retrofitting.  The cost is not insignificant at between &euro;30,000 and &euro;50,000 a year depending on the house.  The key will be public buy-in and that it is seen as a good investment and it is the right thing to do.  One of the reasons it may take time to ramp up is due to the fact that at the moment we do not have the workers in place with the necessary skills to do the work at that scale.  As part of the summer economic stimulus package and again in the budget we significantly invested in new apprenticeships and education and training programmes for people with the necessary skills.  The Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, spoke earlier this morning about how we are going to ramp that up.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions estimates that we need something like 30,000 jobs in the area.  In truth, a year ago, if one talked to people in the industry, they could not get anyone as there was a labour shortage.  That has changed now because we have such high unemployment but even then, it will take time for us to ramp up the skills to be able to do that work, which is skilled and labour intensive.  It will also take us time to set up and put in place, but I am confident we can do it in the early to middle part of next year in terms of providing the necessary finance and other mechanisms.  It will be a case of learning from neighbours.  That will help to determine our ambition, which is that it will build up and ramp up very significantly.  That is not a small challenge, and in some ways, it is probably bigger.  It would be much easier to deliver 5 gigawatts of offshore wind in the next ten years than it would be to retrofit 50,000 houses because we are talking about seven or eight projects and one client compared to 500,000 projects.<\/p> <p>  Increasingly, one of the reasons it seems to take very long to do anything in the country is the planning process.  The timeline for a project of any scale is at least ten years.  That hinders flexibility, speed, action on climate and so on.  On the other hand, one wants to get the planning right.  One wants to get consultation right and to have public support and engagement.  There is an issue regarding resources and planning officers within the planning system.  It is very frustrating for all concerned, whether one is an objector or a developer.  It is a ten-year process one is engaged in whether one is worried about one's local community being affected or what one's investment prospects are.<\/p><p>In this instance the issue is more about resources the State controls, but the key obstacle to further speed is resources in the planning system.  I will be pushing and supporting my colleague, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, in every turn to get those supports.  Investing in planning resources allows us to maintain the twin objectives of getting good planning but not having a ten-year wait for everything.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12020121500002#E01200","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607990400,"counter":153,"content":"<p>My thanks to the Minister for the presentation.  I want to comment on what we are doing today.  Most people will look at this and ask what we are buying for &euro;50 million.  In the past, at least, the Minister would have agreed with me that these accountancy tricks - that is basically what they are - completely fail in the attempt to deal with our climate challenge and crisis.  This is a failure and we should acknowledge that it is a failure.  Since we have failed to reach our legally binding targets we are buying fantasy energy credits from Denmark and Estonia.  This energy will not heat homes or help to produce power that will run factories or anything else.  The energy is fantasy but the money - the &euro;50 million - is absolutely real.  That real &euro;50 million could have paid student nurses or could have been involved in all manner of community projects.  As was mentioned, it could have been used to help retrofit homes and solar power schools.  We should spend some time thinking about why we failed.<\/p> <p>  I do not believe it is simply an oversight or a technical matter.  Ministers may pat each other on the back for what they have done to reach renewable energy targets, but the case remains that we are still overwhelmingly reliant on fossil fuels in every category, including electricity, heating and transport.  It is worth noting that our targets are percentages of the overall electricity and energy demand.<\/p> <p>  The Minister talks about the drive to industrialise and develop the ports and create all this new economic energy.  Our demand for electricity will go up and, therefore, the overall percentage will go up that is allocated to fossil fuels.  It could actually mean a larger volume of carbon dioxide and greenhouse gas emissions.<\/p> <p>  My main point is that the failure of the last Government, the previous Government of Fine Gael with the Labour Party, the Government of Fianna F&aacute;il and the Labour Party and all the combinations of Governments is something that we need to be cautious about when we are being given commitments that new targets will be set and that they will not fail.  We hear that the reason they have failed is because of planning difficulties and upsets in the markets.  Although it has not been said explicitly, we hear that maybe even community opposition to some renewable projects is a cause.<\/p> <p>  I fear that the root cause is none of these.  The reason for past and future failures is the reliance on private enterprise to deliver the targets we need in renewable energy.  Deputy Bruton mentioned the climate action plan, as did the Minister.  We worked and looked at this.  One of the recommendations we made, although I have no doubt it has not been acted on, was that we would look at the possibility of a State-run, State-led renewable energy company that could be invested in to deliver the targets we need to reach instead of always relying on the investment decisions of private corporations and actors which are sometimes nudged and guided by State incentives.  The failure rests ultimately on the policy that holds that we have to rely on the private sector.<\/p> <p>  This raises an interesting current question for us.  If we continue to do this, if we continue to rely on a sector that may or may not invest or may or may not expand on this area, depending on how profitable it is, then how are we to handle the sector in a situation where we sign off on the CETA agreement?  We did not do it today but I note the intent of the Government to do it in the next month or so.  That would really copper-fasten the idea that the State cannot and will not see any prospect of taking ownership of the kind of decisions we may need to guarantee that we could reach our energy targets in future.  It would really make it impossible for the State to set up publicly owned renewable energy companies if the private sector was already in place.  The legal challenges would be so great.  I would appreciate if the Minister would comment on that and on my overall contention.  I believe we need an ESB-style determined State company, like we had in the past when we had few or no resources in the country.  Such a body could really drive forward the switch to renewables, just as the ESB turned on the lights in every corner of the country in decades gone by.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12020121500002#F00200","speaker":"1486"},{"type":"speech","time":1607990400,"counter":154,"content":"<p>I have assurances from the Danish and Estonian ambassadors - I have no reason to doubt them - that this money will be going into specific projects, including renewable electricity generation projects that will contribute to the decarbonisation we need as a matter of emergency.  I have faith in that because I have faith in our European system.  It is something we committed to under the renewables directive in 2007, when it was originally framed.  It was designed to provide what was not a get-out or accounting trick but a mechanism or stick for states.  The idea was that if a state is not meeting its targets, it will have to meet them another way and pay.  This is a stick.  At the same time, I believe it is an appropriate stick that promotes or encourages those who have met targets.  In a sense, it rewards them.  They get the cash, but it can only be invested in renewable projects.  I agree with the European directive.  I was involved in framing it, so I suppose I would, but I believe it was an appropriate mechanism.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Smith is absolutely right about electricity and energy demand being the key and first priority.  There is always a focus on generation.  That is why, in some ways, the heat target is especially important.  One key project we are going to do involves electrifying the generation of heat through the use of heat pumps.  We all know that heat pumps do not work if they are not deployed in a building that is efficient.  The dual tack involves insulating, and therefore promote energy efficiency, as well as using electricity to power heat pumps, which is a highly efficient use of electricity.  This is where we are going to go.  This is ending the use of fossil fuels in oil-fired and gas-fired burners and heating systems and ending the burning of coal or other smoky fuels.  It means radically investing in energy efficiency first and heat pumps to warm far more efficient buildings.<\/p> <p>  I want to give a sense that this is possible.  There are many examples of where we are not delivering it.  There is one key issue around electricity demand in the past ten years.  People will know that we recently reached a new peak in electricity consumption.  Two weeks ago, electricity consumption peaked at 5,100 MW or 5,200 MW on a Thursday evening.  In truth, that is the same level, effectively, that had been in place over ten or 12 years ago.  Our economy has grown significantly in the intervening period.  It is possible for us to create employment and run our economy without necessarily having a vast expansion in our electricity use.  Our economy in the intervening ten-year period must have grown by between 50% and 80% if we do the mathematics based on 5% or 6% growth each year, on average.  Electricity demand did not grow commensurately.  Thus, we can promote energy efficiency in everything we do.<\/p> <p>  Why is it that we did not meet targets?  Why is it that we do not compare well with Denmark or other countries that clearly have done so?  It is demonstrated by the fact that we are paying them or Estonia for their projects.  They have a tradition at it.  They have been going at it for approximately 40 or 50 years.  The Estonians and others, especially the Danes, responded to the first oil crisis in the late 1970s by investing in wind generation.  They developed a comparative competitive advantage in this as well as in district heating.  They developed real efficiency around district heating.  The significance and importance of that area is underestimated in terms of how we meet the next targets.  The 40-year advantage is what those countries have in the sense of understanding that this is going to be good for us as an economy.<\/p><p>A whole range of companies developed in the areas of energy efficiency, heat management and district heat management out of that strategic decision made 40 years ago in Denmark, and not just Vestas Wind Systems in wind turbines.  We must develop in the same way and have the same widespread public understanding that this is the better solution and the direction in which we are going to go.  I think the Irish people are there.  I agree with the Deputy, and blaming communities is not the approach I would take in this regard.  I think Irish people are waiting for the correct signals, supports and regulatory systems that will deliver this new energy-efficient heating system.  The climate action plan can and will deliver the required systemic approach.<\/p><p> Turning to the aspect of public versus private enterprise, both will be involved.  The State has a role, as do community energy projects.  Large-scale interventions by the State, such as by the ESB and Bord na M&oacute;na, have real scaling efficiencies in energy systems and logistics.  I am committed to supporting Bord na M&oacute;na as it moves from being a brown company to a green one and to defining itself as a climate solutions company, endeavouring to use its resources and expertise in engineering, which it has in abundance, in furthering our renewable energy future.  It is the same with the ESB and any other public bodies moving into this space.  That does not preclude private companies being involved, however.  Those 50,000 homes will be retrofitted by a host of Irish building businesses of different sizes, and that is appropriate.  Many Irish companies have expertise in this area.  We want to encourage that and allow them to flourish so they can grow to become major exporting companies for us, in the same way those Danish companies did in the 1970s.<\/p><p> In that regard, my clear understanding of the policy of the European Union, in respect of CETA or any other policy, is that public policy aims in respect of the environment are protected.  DG Competition keeps a close eye on whether there is inappropriate market manipulation or state aid which undermines the competitive market, but it is not a matter of ruling differently concerning private or public enterprise in that regard.  In that context, it was interesting that much of the discussion at the meeting of the Energy Council yesterday concerned the need for DG Competition to be aware that we need flexibility in how we apply competition rules so that we can get innovation and development.  A key issue across Europe, as well in the trade negotiations with the UK, concerns how we can maintain a level playing field while at the same time protecting our environmental and social standards.  We need to do that, because this is the future economy and we must ensure that it is not a race to the bottom.  It must allow communities, State companies and private enterprises to work in a fair way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12020121500002#F00300","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607990400,"counter":156,"content":"<p>I again ask the Minister to comment on how CETA might impact on our ability to run State renewable energy companies if we first tender out to the private market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12020121500002#G00300","speaker":"1486"},{"type":"speech","time":1607990400,"counter":157,"content":"<p>I do not see the State having any restrictions in respect of CETA which will constrain the policy decisions we need to make.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12020121500002#G00400","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1607990400,"counter":158,"content":"<p>I refer to the possibility of litigation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12020121500002#G00500","speaker":"1486"},{"type":"speech","time":1607990400,"counter":159,"content":"<p>I do not see where that would come from and how it would be successful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12020121500002#G00600","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1607990400,"counter":160,"content":"<p>That is fine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12020121500002#G00700","speaker":"1486"},{"type":"speech","time":1607990400,"counter":161,"content":"<p>It has been in operation for three years.

This is a &euro;50 million fine for failing to meet agreed targets, and we should be explicit about that.  It is slightly more complicated in respect of the mechanisms, but we should be straight in this regard.<\/p> <p>  For clarification purposes, a small number of European states are in the same boat as ourselves, including Malta, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands.  Are there others, or is it only those countries?  Regarding the targets, the Minister touched on some of the reasons he thinks we missed them.  It is important that we think about that aspect and seek to address it.  He also mentioned that Denmark more or less had a 40-year head start on us in this area.  Are there other reasons, however, he thinks we have missed these targets?  Were those targets fair and reasonable at the outset?  In the briefing note, it is stated that our starting point was 2005, when it was 3.1%, and we had to make up 12.9% over the 15 years.  When did we commit to that?  Was it in 2009 or later?  I am just trying to get a sense of what the expectation was for us.  Was it to achieve about 1% in reductions per year?  That strikes me as reasonable, and gives some perspective on the scale of our failure, for want of a better phrase.  Regarding the 2.5 TWh of energy, is that the equivalent of the 3% to 4% and is it a direct comparator?<\/p> <p>  Turning to the Minister's opening statement, and the 55% to 60% equivalence with the EU-wide target, I raise this in respect of the programme for Government commitment and the figure of 51% which has been widely mentioned in public.  Is the difference there in the comparable baseline figure?  Are we talking about a 2018 baseline figure compared with a 2019 baseline figure, for example?  I ask that because it is generally helpful to be clear and consistent in respect of our terminology and how we report these things.  Otherwise, it can seem as if we are massaging figures or using them in different ways.  I am not suggesting that is what is happening here.  I just think there is a benefit in a consistency of approach.<\/p> <p>On a related issue, the guidelines for onshore wind farms are long out of date.

It is a structure, as I said, which has been designed to be a deterrent and a way of enforcing the targets so that people have something to fear and avoid.<\/p><p>That is the reason we would aim for it.  The Deputy is right.  With those added complications the fine does not just go into a bunker, so to speak.  It is deployed in a way that is beneficial to the wider environment but there are no two ways about it.  There is no Orwellian mixing-up of language here.  This is not good.  This is not what we want to be doing.<\/p><p> In terms of other states, Luxembourg, Malta and the Netherlands were mentioned earlier.  France and Poland as well, I understand, are in a similar position.  I presume some of them may be close to their targets.  As I said, it is a 2020 target so in terms of those states reaching their targets, whether they will be there or thereabouts remains to be seen.  Other states may be included but they are the ones I see.<\/p><p> As to whether that 12% target was fair and reasonable, there are different views on that.  If I recall correctly, that was in 2009 or 2010 - I am advised it was 2007 or 2008, in the run-in to the end of the decade.  Some people would argue that Ireland's was too stringent.  One may see this as a burden but I believe the moving away from fossil fuels is an economic benefit.  It creates benefits in terms of employment and balance of payments as well as environmental benefits.  It develops the local economy.  Having an ambitious target, therefore, is a good incentive.  It is not punitive.  We are going to have to stop burning fossil fuels anyway.  The sooner we do it the better we will become at it and the more economic savings we will make from it.<\/p><p> If I was to give one reason we have not been good at this it would be that within our wide public, administrative and other systems, for too long we have looked at this as a cost and a burden to be avoided rather than as a necessity and an opportunity to be attained.  One could apply that to the energy efficiency target and the overall climate emissions target.  I could look at specific examples.  There is a further target in terms of our public buildings.  I recall being in this committee room a year or two ago when the Office of Public Works, OPW, witnesses were asking why it was that on that target, where one would think we would have full control in terms of the efficiency in our public buildings, we will not meet it.  It is because in a succession of policy decisions it was seen as a sunk cost or a wasted burden and therefore to be avoided.  We did all the behavioural energy efficiency measures in terms of the public use of buildings, and achieved a fair bit by doing that, but we reached the limit of what was possible in that regard and did not spend the money on the building fabric.  What Deputy Whitmore said is true.  If we were spending this &euro;50 million, my preference would be to spend it on the 5,000 solar panels, water heating systems and so on in our schools to help us meet our renewable heat target.  However, that philosophical perspective of how those targets impinge on us has been one of the real difficulties.<\/p><p> With regard to the target, unfortunately, this is complicated.  In terms of the Government's target of a 7% reduction in emissions per annum, with a 51% reduction over the decade, that target was based on science.  It was based on taking the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, report and saying that that is what we need to do over the next ten years.  For us, the target was best done on the basis of when will be the first year, starting from early this summer.  It was a 2018 target because those were the first statistics we had in terms of where we are and we had to start from somewhere.  Unfortunately, there were further variations in that.  The European Union tends to set its targets from 2005.  The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC, and the Chairman can correct me if I am wrong, sets its target year from 1990.  To make it even more complicated, the UNFCCC includes land use policy and land use changes, although the rules on that are evolving and need a good deal of tightening.  The European Union does not include many of those but in the middle part of this decade need to start to include that, or even sooner depending on political decision-making.  It is a horrifically complicated variety of different targets.<\/p><p> The reason I said that that 55% target is a positive development, which was welcomed yesterday at the Council meeting, is because it signifies a significant increase in ambition from the 30% original outcome.  There were even further complications in that with the target within the emissions trading system, ETS, and non-ETS sectors.  We have had many targets deployed in a variety of ways and it will require many countries to significantly scale up their ambition.<\/p><p> Many countries are further along than Ireland.  Having failed to meet our 2020 targets, we are a good 20% behind where we should be now.  For us to meet a 51% target or anything like it is an incredibly more ambitious target than that of almost all other European countries because most other countries are starting off having already achieved a 20%, 25%, 30% or 40% reduction.  It is akin to going into a 55 m sprint race when the other teams have a 20 yd start on us.  That is the scale of the problem.  The ambition we are setting is very significant.  That is appropriate because this is the new economy.  Other economies will be looking to get what the Danes and others have done from being first mover advantage of having the economic capability in heating, transport and energy systems that they then sell to the rest of the world.  We should aim to do the same.<\/p><p> In that regard, I accept and agree that the slow pace of the development of wind farm guidelines has been a real failing for both those communities that are concerned about wind farms and those people involved in the industry.  It suits no one&rsquo;s interests.  I had hoped we would have them agreed by the end of this year.  That looks unlikely now but I commit to presenting them very early in the new year because as several Deputies said, we need to start acting more quickly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12020121500002#G01000","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607990400,"counter":165,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

To explain, three or four years ago when projections were being made about what the cost might be, Sustainable Energy Authority Ireland, SEAI, had projected that it could be somewhere between &euro;65 million to &euro;130 million per percentage point.  They were very preliminary figures and were guesstimates at that time.  We then had a couple of the other deals come into the markets.  Luxembourg was probably first into the pool in 2017.  More recently, on the &euro;110 million figure the Chairman referenced, the Comptroller and Auditor General issued a report in September of last year in which he and his team had estimated the figure at approximately &euro;110 million.  The Chairman rightly asked how we arrived at a figure of &euro;50 million now.  As I said in an answer given earlier, part of the reason is because of supply and market force.  The Danish deal that had come into the public arena at &euro;12.50 euro per megawatt hour put a frame on the price.<\/p><p>Everyone has commented that although a very significant amount of money is being paid over, it could have been an awful lot higher given that we are one of a number of member states that is in deficit.

This is the first important thing to recognise.  The large number of solar projects that bid in was also significant.  The role of the auctions has impacted the development of a variety of things including the critical constraints around grid, access to grid, and the ability of the ESB and EirGrid to deliver grid connections.  Critical in this is the issue of constraint or curtailment and grid constraints.  This is not very glamorous but we are already starting to see a significant amount of curtailment of the wind we do have, because of grid restrictions.  That is one of the limiting factors in it.  I expect it to be, if not annual, certainly very regular.  Similarly, offshore would not be annual, but not multiannual gaps.  It takes a long time to go from the auction to delivery of the projects.  We have ambitious targets to meet and we want to go further and faster if we can.  Doing it in a step basis where there are regular auctions is much better than betting it all on one big auction system.  I would expect in each case maybe two or three auctions within the lifetime of this Government for each area, if not more.  That is the sort of timeframe.  Effectively it would be annually, but with a variety of different approaches, onshore or offshore.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is right with regard to biofuels.  Most of the generation of the target was reached with the use of blending in bioethanol and biodiesel.  On the ethanol side there are technical limitations as to how much the engines can actually cope with.  On the biodiesel side the real constraint is around environmental constraints such as land use implications and long-term or major expansion in fuel supplies.  We absolutely want to use waste materials and convert them to biofuels.  While there may well be further developments in that regard it is limited.<\/p> <p>  The original directive, from memory, included electricity as a renewable fuel in meeting that renewable target.  We see the real potential in the switch to the electrification of transport.  Another key point, and going back to the argument of efficiency being everything, is that the key metric should be how to reduce the amount or volume of travel needed.  Nobody looks for a long distance commute as a quality of life measure.  There is nothing low-carbon in having a really sprawled development model.  There is everything to be gained from a 15 minute city with services in close reach of community.  This is for social and community reasons as well as for zero carbon reasons.  Our first key target should be looking to see how we can reduce the amount of long-distance commuting as a quality of life measure as well as to reduce the use of fuel.  With Covid there is now a strange opportunity to deliver on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12020121500002#J00200","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1607990400,"counter":170,"content":"<p>Would anyone wish to come back in, as we have time?

Before we begin, I request that members sit only in the permitted seats and in front of available microphones to ensure they are heard.  This is important as not doing so causes serious problems for broadcast, editorial and sound staff.  I remind those present to please maintain social distancing at all times during and following the meeting.  Before we start, I invite those attending the meeting virtually to unmute their devices to allow the sound to feed into the committee room.<\/p> <p>  Our meeting today is to discuss consideration of the Ombudsman for Children report, entitled Unmet Needs, with the Minister of State at the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy Anne Rabbitte, who has responsibility for disability.  I welcome her to the committee.  This is her first time to address the committee.  She has been in her role for several months, but I wish to formally congratulate her on being appointed as Minister of State.  I also extend a welcome to the officials accompanying the Minister of State, Ms Jenny Andersson, assistant principal officer, and Mr. Noel Byrne, special adviser to the Minister of State.<\/p> <p>  Before I invite the Minister of State to deliver her opening statement, I wish to advise her of the following in relation to parliamentary privilege.  She is protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation she makes to the committee.  That means that she has an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything she says at the meeting.  However, she is expected not to abuse the privilege and it is my duty, as Chair, to ensure it is not abused.  Therefore, if her statements are potentially defamatory to any identifiable person or entity, she will be directed to discontinue her remarks and it is imperative that she comply with any such direction.<\/p> <p>  The purpose of the meeting is to discuss with the Minister of State the issues identified in the report published in October 2020 by Dr. Niall Muldoon, Ombudsman for Children, and entitled Unmet Needs.  The report identified serious shortcomings in how assessments of needs of children are now conducted and the unacceptable waiting lists that face children who require an assessment of their needs.  Before I invite the Minister of State to commence her opening statement, I wish to remind members that, when putting their questions to the Minister of State, they should adhere to the agenda item scheduled for this meeting, which is to examine the contents of the report by the Ombudsman for Children.

The assessment of needs backlog has been a top priority for me since taking up office as Minister of State with special responsibility for disability.<\/p> <p>  To put it simply, the current waiting times for services for children with disabilities are totally unacceptable and they need to be improved dramatically.  I have made that clear to all in my meetings with the HSE on this very issue.  I have watched previous meetings of the committee on this subject and many valid points have been made by various people on the many aspects of the assessment process.  Most importantly, the impact on children and families left waiting for assessments and interventions has really been brought to the fore.  From the sheer volume of representations from families to my office, I am very aware of the delays in the assessment of need process and the incredible stress and upset this has caused children and their families.<\/p> <p>  I agree with the ombudsman when he says steps must be taken to fix this problem.  We are on the exact same page in that regard.  In order to fix the problem, we must ensure that a permanent solution can be found; not just a temporary one.  We must develop a sustainable and child-centred model of service.  This will ensure timely access to assessments and interventions for all children who require them.<\/p> <p>  The key to providing responsive children&rsquo;s services lies in the rolling out of progressive disability services for children and providing services based on need rather than diagnosis.  A report on assessment of need published in 2011 by the National Disability Authority found that the assessment of need process worked better and in a more streamlined way in areas that had reconfigured into network teams.  In those areas, there was also less emphasis on using the assessment process to develop a diagnosis as a means to access services.<\/p> <p>  The report of the ombudsman is an honest and thorough examination of where the State stands in terms of its provision of appropriate intervention therapies for children by way of the assessment of need process.  There is no doubt that we have failed many children and their families in this process.  However, I hope that several steps I am taking within my remit will dramatically improve access to services within 12 months of my appointment as Minister of State with responsibility for disability.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of resources, the report of the ombudsman states that, \"a much greater resource commitment is required in the longer term\".  Even before taking office, it was clear to me that this requirement needed to be pursued.  This is why one of the first things I did as Minister of State was to secure an allocation of &euro;7.8 million Sl&aacute;intecare funding to eliminate the unacceptable backlog of assessments of need that has built up in recent years.  I am sure the committee will agree this is very welcome news.<\/p> <p>  To ensure that real and tangible progress is being made in clearing the backlog, I have been holding monthly meetings with all the community healthcare organisation, CHO, heads of disability services.  The most recent meeting took place on 8 December.  I can confirm to the committee that of the 6,558 overdue assessments of need as of 30 June 2020, a total of 1,798 have been completed through September, October and November.  This means that by the end of November, the backlog had already been reduced to 4,760.<\/p> <p>  Of course, that is only one part of the solution as there is no point having an assessment of need completed if one cannot then access the therapies.  The elimination of the backlog will free up therapists to devote more time to providing much-needed interventions for children.  The more time therapists can spend with children, the more they can help them.<\/p><p>Beyond that, I also secured additional funding in budget 2021 to add another 100 therapy posts to children's disability services next year.  That is on top of the 100 therapy posts secured last year.<\/p><p> The ombudsman's report also makes a recommendation for an interdepartmental group on children with disabilities to be established.  I would like to point out to the committee that such a cross-sectoral group already exists and meets quarterly to discuss significant issues on children with disabilities.  The group comprises members from the Departments of Health, Education and Children, Disability, Equality, Integration and Youth, as well as associated agencies.  In addition, there is, at any given time, a number of cross-departmental and cross-agency initiatives being pursued. <\/p><p> In conclusion, I remind the committee that the Government as a whole has committed to a range of actions in order to improve services for children with additional needs and it is my absolute intention to deliver on that.  I am proud to hold the office of the Minister of State with responsibility for disabilities and I hope that over my time in this position, I will, once and for all, bring an end to the constant breaches of the Disability Act when it comes to assessments of need.  If that is achieved, the Ombudsman for Children will not, I hope, have a need to publish such a report on unmet needs ever again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2020121500002#A00300","speaker":"1484","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607990400,"counter":180,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

I understand that she is relatively new in the role but it is great to hear her determination to get this right for children.  I imagine that in her previous role as a party spokesperson for children and as a Deputy, she has had an awful lot of interactions with parents and children on this issue, as have we all in our offices.  I am sure the Minister of State has a thorough understanding of the difficulties that are faced by parents in not only trying to get the assessment but thereafter trying to get the services.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State has, unfortunately, inherited a broken system.  She says that steps must be taken and the ombudsman has said the same and we all agree with that.  However, it would appear from what we have heard and the information we have received over the past number of meetings, the path that she is going down is completely the wrong one.  I am not sure if the Minister of State had an opportunity to listen to last week's committee meeting or to review the transcript.  A representative from the Psychological Society of Ireland, Mr. Mark Smyth, was before the committee.  He also was representing the Association of Occupational Therapists of Ireland and the Irish Association of Speech and Language Therapists.  Mr. Gareth Noble, family courts lawyer, and parents from Enough is Enough were also before the committee.  Each and every one of them spoke about how the current system is failing children and their families.  I will read out some of the discussion with Mr. Mark Smyth about the new procedure that is being implemented to try to address the problems with the assessment of needs process.  He said \"The implementation of the new [standard operating procedure, SOP] has proceeded despite our professional bodies clearly stating that it is not in the best interests of children\" and that it \"will, in many cases, prove detrimental to children and their families\".  He noted the clinicians are also \"concerned that compliance with the SOP could lead to them being in breach of codes of conduct and ethics\".  He also said that in the majority of cases, it will not be possible for a clinician to answer the questions or to feed back to parents \"within the maximum timeframe permitted within the SOP of 90 minutes\" or to come to a determination as to whether the child has a disability.  Those are stark statements for someone representing the Psychological Association of Ireland and the other groups to make.<\/p> <p>  What is the response or feedback of the Minister of State to those statements made last week about the SOP?  It is clear that it was always envisaged that this SOP was going to be difficult.  The previous committee directed the HSE to consult with these groups but it did not do so and we are now seeing the result of that, which is a system being established that is not going to meet the needs of parents or children and will cause difficulty for clinicians.  I will cut to the chase.  Will the Minister of State agree to suspend the roll-out of this new operating procedure until the consultation can happen with the clinicians and parents to ensure that procedures that are being put in place will actually do what they need to for children and not further disadvantage them or stick them onto another waiting list to languish for another three or four years?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2020121500002#B00300","speaker":"1627"},{"type":"speech","time":1607990400,"counter":182,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Whitmore for her questions.  I watched the meeting last week.  I have watched the committee proceedings for the past number of weeks, to be honest.  I compliment the committee on all the speakers it has brought in because it is getting a wide flavour of all the challenges that are there.  I was a spokesperson for children and youth affairs and a week never went by in my constituency office in Portumna or Loughrea when I did not have families come before me who were awaiting an assessment of need and it was not weeks or months but years that we were talking about.<\/p> <p>  When I took office in July, the standard operating procedure or SOP as it is known, had come into operation in January of this year.  It had started before I ever arrived in office.  In actual fact, the SOP is there now but because of Covid-19, it is probably not up and running to its full potential.  As far as I was concerned when I took office, my issue was to address that backlog of 6,500 people.  I want to crack the nut on this.  I want to get to the stage where we are talking about interventions.  We do not want to be in the position of facing the sorts of cases that Mr. Noble talked about last week around the country.  We should be delivering on time and getting straight to the intervention piece.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked if I will pause the SOP for further engagement.  I have asked what is happening with the SOP and was told that F&oacute;rsa was the staff representative organisation with negotiating rights for clinicians involved in the assessment of need process.  I was told that the SOP was implemented in January following successful conclusion of the HSE engagement with F&oacute;rsa.  That is exactly what has been presented to me.  I have heard what Mr. Mark Smyth said last week about the clinicians.  We absolutely need to listen to all parts of this discussion.  I will make a suggestion, if the Chair does not mind.  The committee needs to bring before it Professor MacLachlan, the disability clinical lead of the HSE, Dr. Cathal Morgan, head of disability services of the HSE, and Ms Angela O'Neill, national disability specialist and national lead on the assessment of need of the HSE.

It is not based on an idea of protecting the State from the requirement to meet the needs of the child or protect the State from litigation but because is the right thing to do.

It is good to hear her say that she wants to end the constant breaches of the Disability Act.<\/p><p>The backlog of assessment of need is coming down quite dramatically.  On the face of it, that is a very good thing.  These are assessments that have been caught up under the terms of the new standard operating procedures, SOPs.  As we have seen in previous weeks, the standard operating procedures are just not up to scratch.  They do not provide a quality assessment and they themselves appear to be in breach of the Disability Act.  Will the Minister of State commit to reviewing them?  It seems we are playing with smoke and mirrors in reducing the backlog of assessment needs but not actually meeting the needs of the young people who are being assessed.<\/p><p> Constituents have asked me to raise a few things with the Minister of State when they heard she was coming before the committee.  One was the availability of therapists.  Many front-line staff have moved on to Covid tracing.  When will they return to their work?  Constituents asked if the Minister of State thinks it is acceptable that these people are being moved from therapeutic services to Covid tracing when there is a backlog in therapeutic services?  Are we making the best use of clinicians?  A senior psychologist might be doing a parenting course which could equally be delivered by a social worker or social care worker on a multidisciplinary team whereas a social worker or social care worker could not do the same work that the senior psychologist can.  Tied to this is parents' frustration at a lack of consistency.  Often, when they go to services, it is with a completely new person.  We all know that a lack of consistency can be a problem for many reasons which I do not need to go into.<\/p><p> Will we ratify and follow through on the optional protocol for the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2020121500002#B00700","speaker":"1570","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607990400,"counter":187,"content":"<p>On the backlog and the SOP, the reason I sought the funding was that, as of 30 June, there were 6,500 children on a backlog and only a very small proportion related to the SOP at all.  They were historical.  They were not sick for three or six months but for nine or 12 months.  That is primarily what the funding was for.  The proportion of those on the SOP was minute.  The first would have gone on in June because it only came in on 1 January.  There would be children who are only six months on it, but the majority was the backlog.<\/p> <p>  I agree on the therapeutic services.  I totally understand parents' frustration, and there is no doubt of that, that a therapist could be out contact tracing or swabbing.  It is unacceptable that it would have continued for so long.  There are still people on it, but between the disability teams and the primary care team, 189 therapists are still part of it.  They are not on contact tracing now, but they are on swabbing.  When I came into office, the number was twice that if not a hell of a lot more.  It has reduced considerably.  I met with Paul Reid on 5 October on the issue and met with the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, twice on the matter.  There has been a recruitment plan to address it and get the clinicians back to the front line of doing what they are supposed to.

If the answer is that they are, then, given evidence that has come before the committee, I have serious concerns about that.  The case for CHO 4 can be extrapolated to all the CHOs in the country.  I need some words of comfort from the Minister of State for the families and children whom I represent so that they do not come back to me in a matter of months, having received the initial assessment of need, to say there has been no follow-up of services, or saying the assessment of need, as previous witnesses have suggested, is a sub-par method by any international standard of assessing a child with needs.

As part and parcel of that, they had to engage with private providers to have the assessments done in a timely fashion because this is time sensitive.  They went out and spoke to other section 38 and 39 organisations and some private providers.  They also spoke with the HSE, which had given staff the option of working extra hours or overtime if they wanted.

She said she listened in to this committee and she would have heard the ombudsman talking about a three-card trick and how he felt that children were being moved from list to list without getting adequate services.  One issue that has been mentioned relates to the SOP.  We heard last week from the Psychological Society of Ireland that a child may incorrectly be deemed not to have a disability as the disability is not evident or fully reported by parents or carers at the screening assessment.  We also heard from the parents' group, Enough is Enough, and those parents are absolutely terrified that they may miss something that will delay their child's developmental needs and the services they need to develop.  These parents are under enough pressure without adding any more.  As they said last week, parents are not therapists.  They are parents and they want the best for their children.<\/p> <p>  I will probably ask some questions that have been asked.  Does the Minister of State think the SOP is adequate?  Will it be reviewed or can it be suspended?  She can correct me if I am wrong but she said that of the 1,798 assessments completed since June 2020, the vast majority were standard comprehensive assessments of need.  If we have gotten that many done since June 2020, why do we need a standard operating procedure?  If we are getting through them comprehensively, why are we putting parents under this pressure?<\/p> <p>  I want to touch on two more areas.  This year, there were 691 investigations into complaints by parents to the HSE, under the Disability Act 2005, that their children did not get their assessment in a timely manner, and 634 of these were upheld.  That is 92%, which is a damning indictment of the AON system.  However, it is a good indication that the complaints system is working.  That leads me to the second part of my question.  Since late 2018, 115 cases have been taken to court by parents.  Those parents had to go to court for an enforcement order for the assessment of need.  Defending this system must cost the HSE a significant amount when it knows that 92% of the complaints are being upheld.  Why is the HSE making parents who are already under enough pressure go to court to get enforcement orders instead of providing the services they need?<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State mentioned that the &euro;7.8 million in Sl&aacute;intecare money that is being AONs is time sensitive.  Will that time run out?  If the money is not used, can we get a guarantee that it will be ring-fenced and that it does not go back into a black hole of the HSE or some other area?  If it is not used in time, will it still be there to be used for assessments of needs going forward?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2020121500002#D00600","speaker":"1469"},{"type":"speech","time":1607990400,"counter":199,"content":"<p>The Deputy asked many questions and I was very slow at writing them down.  I will start at the end.  He asked me if the money will go into a black hole if it is not used.  It will be used because every one of those 6,500 children is going to get their assessment of need.  This money is going to be used.  That is why I am holding monthly meetings and that is why I can tell Deputy Sherlock what has happened in his CHO in the past three months.  I can tell every member what is going on in his or her CHO because my finger is on the pulse as regards assessments.   The money will be spent in a timely fashion and it will be delivered, so we will clear the backlog.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy's first question is well-put.  He asked why we need a standard operating procedure if the backlog is being cleared.  I said at the beginning that this is a nut we need to crack.<\/p><p>I want to get to the intervention element.  By spending as much time as we have been in simply addressing backlogs, we would not deliver on intervention.  For the information of some members who may not be aware of this, when one get an assessment of needs and, say, it relates to speech and language therapy, one has to go a speech and language therapist to get an assessment.  One then gets a first round of therapy and that could continue for six weeks and if one needs further follow-up one is directed to a list of speech and language therapists further up the line.  I am trying to get to the intervention piece.  That was the reason I sought funding to clear the backlog so that everybody concerned could get to the space where we are discussing intervention. <\/p><p> Regarding 92% of the cases being upheld, they were being upheld because they were not being dealt within a timely fashion.  We all know this.  The Act clearly stipulates one has a right to an assessment within six months.  If one does not get it, the law will uphold that right.  That is enshrined in law since 2005.<\/p><p> It is important to realise that 100 therapist posts were sought under the confidence and supply agreement in last year's budget.  Some of those therapists who came on stream never hit the network disability teams because they went straight into contact tracing and swabbing.  They are only starting to come back to this work now.  I have also sought another 100 therapist posts in this budget.  If I am fortunate enough, and with the support of the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, I would like us to block book the funding for those posts whereby we would recruit the therapists in one block.  I would like that to happen in quarter 1 rather than over quarters 1, 2 and 3 and in that way, we could populate our network disability teams and the intervention could continue at an accelerated rate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2020121500002#D00700","speaker":"1484","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607990400,"counter":201,"content":"<p>I have a follow-up question.

The Minister of State said 1,978 comprehensive assessments of need have been carried out since June of this year.  Why do we then need to go from the comprehensive assessment of needs process to the standard operating procedure exercise?  They are two different things.

First, the reason we have to deliver on the comprehensive assessment of needs is that the backlog was there before 2020.  That is what has to happen.  To my understanding, the reason the standard operating procedure was brought forward was to streamline the entire procedure.  People are of the opinion that the standard operating procedure, SOP, is a desktop exercise.  That is not what I am led to believe.  It is a face-to-face exercise.  I acknowledge the role of the Chairman and the members of the committee in bringing in various speakers.  The committee needs to have a conversation in the entire round by bringing in HSE lead personnel in this area to get their vision of the roll-out of the SOP and whether it is another layer, is it a face-to face appointment, whether it has the same value and if it gets us to the intervention element quicker.  The final question I would ask, which must be asked, is why are so many of the clinicians not in favour of it.  While we need to have those conversations, the important element that needs to be addressed is whether it gets people to an intervention at a direct point of access quicker.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2020121500002#E00300","speaker":"1484"},{"type":"speech","time":1607990400,"counter":203,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2020121500002#E00400","speaker":"1469"},{"type":"speech","time":1607990400,"counter":204,"content":"<p>We hope to have the HSE officials in before the committee at our first meeting in January.

I have a few questions and I might ask them together, if the Minister of State can take note of them and reply to them together.  To follow on from Deputy Ward's point on pre-assessment, the Minister of State said it is her understanding that was brought forward for it to be streamlined.  What exactly does \"for it to be streamlined\" mean?  That is a word that is used and everyone says the process is streamlined but what does that even mean?  To be honest, the comprehensive assessment is what children need and \"streamlined\" is a made-up word that is used for people to think something is happening but it is not happening.  I would like the Minister of State to explain what she means by &ldquo;streamlined&rdquo;.<\/p> <p>  I have a question related to the pre-assessment, that is, the 90-minute exercise.  We spoke on foot of Deputy Costello's question on the ratification of the optional protocol.  It feels like that 90-minute pre-assessment exercise is a breach of the Disability Act, which leaves us further away from meeting the requirement to have the optional protocol in place in time.  We want to remove obstacles for people to be able to take cases but there is a sense we have created the 90-minute assessment to stave off court proceedings rather than have a system that is streamlined.  <\/p> <p>  The report also explains where the Disability Act 2005 covers assessment for health needs.  The Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs, EPSEN, Act covers assessment for special needs assessment.  The report outlines how essentially, both Acts go hand in hand.  However, due to the fact that different sections of the EPSEN Act were deferred because of financial constraints in 2008, the provision of a education service to a child is often neglected or not pursued.  For example, where the assessment of needs identify the need for an education service for a child, the assessment officer would refer the matter either to the principal of the child&rsquo;s school to practically meet the educational needs of the student concerned or for a special educational needs assessment.  However, the second option does not exist since the relevant sections of the EPSEN Act have not yet commenced.  This means that despite the fact that the need for additional education services are stated in this statement of assessment, the child could potentially never receive the appropriate supports because the relevant actions of the Act have not commenced.  The question I have for the Minister of State in that respect is whether the Department has looked at implementing these relevant sections of the EPSEN Act to ensure children are receiving an adequate assessment of needs process, as outlined in both Acts. <\/p> <p>  Through the assessment of needs, the only gateway to access services is through a disability finding.  This means if an assessment officer finds that a child does not have a disability, a liaison officer cannot provide a service statement, regardless of the child&rsquo;s other identified needs.  This makes the 2005 Act a diagnosis-led rather than needs-led model.  The question I have for the Minister of State in that respect is whether the Department has looked at different ways of reconfiguring the current regime to adopt to a more needs-led model.<\/p> <p>  Finally, what is the cost of providing the SOP system?  Would that money have been better spent in going with the funding she allocated to address the backlog?  Have we redirected funding?  What is the cost of the funding to do the pre-assessment?  Would it have been better spent in helping the Minister of State to continue to address the current backlog with a more comprehensive model?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2020121500002#E00600","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"speech","time":1607990400,"counter":206,"content":"<p>I have noted everything Senator Ruane raised.

To reverse back to 31 December 2019, it was not the case that all CHOs in the country operated at the same level with respect to how they did an assessment.  The idea of the SOP was to streamline it.  I have to be clear with the Senator.  Certain CHOs are getting through their backlog is a very timely fashion but that is not the case for other CHOs.  I ask them what is the story, that they told me last month this would happen but it did not happen and they reply that consultation is taking place or conversations are happening where teams have to meet to come to a final decision about assessment.<\/p><p>That is part and parcel of where the SOP ended up and what has added to the backlog.  I am not ascribing blame to anybody in making that statement; I am stating a fact.  The idea was to have streamlined assessments.  The idea was that every CHO would have the same.<\/p><p> The Senator made a valid point, asking if it came in just to save the State a fortune not to end up in court cases.  It is part and parcel of it and I will not deny that.  It is important to qualify it by saying that the HSE sought legal advice on it.  When the HSE is before the committee, it is important and integral to ask if it was about the legal bill or about delivering a standard of intervention at the same level across the country.  Was it part of putting a tool in place that every clinician could work to?<\/p><p> The Senator mentioned the EPSEN Act.

I am trying to get to a point where we do not have a backlog for assessments of need and timely intervention and therapy become the priority.  The Senator and I have both seen the letters to say that a person is on a two-year waiting list for speech and language therapy.  That is unacceptable.  We have to stop that and we have to get to the root of delivering therapy.  The Senator talked about people in contact tracing and swabbing.  At the moment, there is nobody from the network disability teams involved in contact tracing and there are nine from primary care.  Last September and October, when I started to have these conversations, there were 866 involved in swabbing.  That 866 is down to 189.  It is still 189 too many and I will not justify it, but at the same time, I want to demonstrate where we have come from and what we are trying to get back into the teams, for the simple reason that that leads directly to the unmet need of the children and families, the frustration of families and how they must feel, that nobody is thinking of their child or their child's education.  That is why I have met with Mr. Paul Reid and spoken with the Minister, Deputy Donnelly.  In fairness to the HSE, the Department of Health and the Minister, they are acknowledging it and getting a turnaround.<\/p> <p>  My next step in that is to ensure, in the roll-out of the vaccines, that our front-line clinicians do not become a casualty of delivering the vaccination.  After we got disability acknowledged as an essential service in September, clinicians have returned to posts and the reconfiguration of the children's network disability teams is taking place.  We are down to the last seven team leads in the 91 different positions around the country.  That is right across the country.  We should build on those teams and ensure that those staff do not become part of the vaccination programme.  They need to stay to address the unmet need and support the families that the Senator speaks about.  We do not want to see those families left for another year without timely intervention.<\/p> <p>  Regarding CHO 8, as of 30 June, it had 764 children awaiting an assessment of need.

I thank her office for being so engaged and accessible.  I really appreciate that.<\/p><p>My home constituency is Dublin South-Central, taking in a little of Dublin 6 and Dublin 6W.  In that there seems to be exceptionally long waiting lists and it has been considered quite the black hole.  One of my emails to the witnesses argued there is a postcode lottery and this area is particularly badly hit with very long waiting lists.  I welcome comments on where we are at in that regard.  I received a briefing from the Minister of State, Deputy Frank Feighan, indicating who was deployed where or redeployed into services but figures were missing for the community healthcare organisation, CHO, 7.<\/p><p>Within the area there are a number of families with children with Down's syndrome.  There is a commonality of experience.  One of the families has been advised that a new ophthalmology service is beginning in April 2021 and I would appreciate an update on that.  The family has been placed on a waiting list so what length of time are we looking at for an assessment?<\/p><p>One of the difficulties of being on such a long waiting list is that a child may be in second class is ready to go to a school with an autism spectrum disorder, ASD, unit but if that child has not been assessed, he or she does not qualify to get into the unit despite obviously requiring such support.  The lack of assessment is having a detrimental effect on educational needs of children.  In such a case, a paediatrician may have written to the HSE to say that an assessment is urgently required but has not occurred.  Parents in such cases are getting quotes of &euro;1,850 to get a private assessment but do not know if such an assessment would be accepted.<\/p><p>Children with Down's syndrome are much more likely to suffer from arthritis, at one in 50 children as compared with one in 1,000 for the rest of the population.  Such children need an MRI done under a general anaesthetic.  If a child has pain now, the earliest appointment for the diagnostic is apparently January 2022.  That type of delay is quite common and a recent article in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>indicated a delay in waiting times of between four and seven years, which sounds astounding.<\/p><p>I appreciate that there are many questions but I would not mind an update on where things stand with section 39 organisations.

It is one of the main reasons I am meeting the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, tomorrow.  It is to get an understanding of our roll-out plan for classrooms not just in Dublin and the areas identified by the Senator but right across the country.<\/p> <p>  The Senator spoke about children with Down's syndrome being affected with arthritis.  She mentioned a ratio of one child in 50 being affected as opposed to one in every 1,000 children who do not have Down's syndrome.  The last time I inquired about this I was told there is a recruitment problem.  It is a major difficulty but it is not new.  It is something that needs to be prioritised.  There are six posts that deal with rheumatoid arthritis but only two are filled.<\/p> <p>  The Senator spoke about section 39 organisations.

The report from the ombudsman was a real indictment of the State's failure of children with special needs, their families, carers and supporters.<\/p> <p>  I really welcome the Minister of State's appointment.  As a spokesperson for the Opposition she demonstrated passion and energy and she has brought that to her office.  I am greatly encouraged.<\/p> <p>  I will not go over everything that has been discussed because it has been well articulated.  The Minister of State knows these challenges.  I can make a couple of suggestions for the committee.<\/p><p>I absolutely agree with the Minister of State that the HSE has to come into the committee, which is scheduled, and that we, as a committee, engage very energetically.  We need to challenge it on behalf of all the children and families and we will do that.  The Minister of State could help the committee if it could be provided with a monthly report to give members a breakdown of how the assessment of needs is progressing.  That would be useful for this committee to have.  The Minister of State clearly has the information and the data are available.  The committee should be looking at that once a month so that the issue is on our minds not just at a committee meeting such as this.<\/p><p> I am very mindful that it is distressing for parents.  They demonstrate love, energy and care for their children but it is very distressing for them to have to battle for an assessment of needs to start with, and then the therapies and supports.  Does the Minister of State have a report, similar to the one available on the assessment of needs, on waiting lists for therapies and supports?  Again, perhaps this could be provided to the committee monthly.  It is important that this committee would track that and engage with the HSE on it.  It would also create for the committee the transparency on how children and families are being responded to in every area.  It may give us an opportunity to assess whether there is a uniformity to the quality and timeliness of the response, and to the appropriateness of the supports provided to the children and their families.<\/p><p> With regard to the ongoing support and care, I am very aware that when parents and their children have overcome the initial challenge of getting their assessment of needs, the young child - hopefully but not always - will get the required supports, therapies and interventions.  As that child becomes an older child, a teenager and then a young adult - this is my experience from dealing with families - every time there is a developmental change there can be a kind of disconnect in the ongoing and projected assessment of needs, and especially into adulthood.  In the Minister of State's short time in office has she had a chance to examine that, or is it something she could take on and examine into the future?<\/p><p> I would also appreciate the Minister of State using her office to raise the issue of the appropriateness of the housing needs assessment that takes place with local authorities in the State for families who have a family member with special needs.  The local authorities generally do not take intellectual needs into account.  Very often a key requirement to cope with intellectual challenges can be having an appropriate built environment within which to live.  I would appreciate it if the Minister of State could also look at that.

I do not wish to bring up again the standard operating procedure, SOP, in the context of assessment, but different local authorities view disabilities on different levels.  A particular local authority in the State, for example, did not view autism as a disability, so when families applied to the local authority it did not see autism or having a child with autistic needs on the housing list as a priority, or even take autism or intellectual disabilities into consideration from a space point of view.

I like the approach Deputy Rabbitte takes in the Department.  The Minister of State has been backed by Government with an increase in budget which always helps but it is not only about money.  It is about how measures are rolled out.  The Minister of State is certainly taking a hands-on approach with the Department and I appreciate that.<\/p> <p>  There are a few points I would like to raise.  As the Minister of State will be aware, up until February of this year, before I was elected to this House, I was a teacher.  There are some overlapping functions, both for Deputy Rabbitte's Department and, indeed, her colleague, the junior Minister, Deputy Madigan.  There is an acute shortage of autism spectrum disorder, ASD, units in County Clare.  At present, the incidence of autism among children in Ireland, which depends on the level of diagnosis and assessment, is between 1.6% and 2%, but our availability of ASD units is grossly short of that.  In a town such as Ennis with a population of 30,000, or Shannon with a population of 10,000, there is only a handful of places.  When a unit opens, it only caters for six children.  There is a huge shortage.<\/p> <p>  Increasingly, special educational needs organisers, SENOs, have been going around to schools, speaking with and writing to principals saying that they want them, in September 2021, to open ASD units in their schools.  That is brilliant, but there is no accommodation.  They are saying to principals that they should find some place in their schools.  Some of these schools have not a place for a mop bucket or their physical education, PE, equipment.  Suddenly, they are expected to clear out cupboards and find a place for an ASD unit.  It will require joined-up thinking, both within the Department of Deputy Rabbitte, as someone who is a champion for disability, and that of the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan.  Ultimately, the Department of Education has to also step up and say that this school is willing to provide an ASD unit and it will need additional accommodation.<\/p> <p>  The next issue I wish to raise is that of SENOs.  They wield an awful lot of power when they come into schools.  With the Education Act 1998 and the Disability Act 2005, there are many legislative pieces that empower youngsters living with disability and there are many parents who go out and battle for them.  I have seen it on many occasions.  One sees parents come into one's classroom knowing that they have to fight a battle and they realise pretty quickly that the teacher is onside because we are fighting that battle too.  The reality is volumes of paperwork go before a SENO.  There is every type of psychological report.  There could be occupational therapy reports.  With a stroke of a pen, they can strike out many of these recommendations.  I made this point in this very room a few weeks ago.  In the case of many of the recommendations they are striking out as being invalid or not reaching a threshold, they are not qualified to make that interpretation.  I am not an educational psychologist.  I am, by profession, a teacher.  I am not qualified to go in, dissect a report, and say that makes sense and that does not.  There is something wrong in that and Deputy Rabbitte's Department and, indeed, the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, should look at that.  They do the same with assistive technology recommendations.  They will approve some laptops and some devices and they will strike out others.  That is fundamentally wrong.<\/p> <p>  In March and April, there was a need for speech and language therapists and others to be reassigned to tracing and testing roles.  The same occurred with orthodontists and others within the broad spectrum of health services.  There was a need for them to be redeployed.  They simply had not the caseload coming into their offices.  That has changed now.  Testing and tracing has changed.  There is still a small few, certainly in the mid-west, I know of who are still testing and tracing and we need them back offering the service that they are most qualified to do.<\/p> <p>  The final question I wish to ask the Minister of State is about the waiting lists in CHO 3, County Clare, and the neighbouring counties of Limerick and Tipperary.  I am hoping the Minister of State can give some good news about waiting lists for children who have been awaiting assessments or appointments in that locality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2020121500002#J00600","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speech","time":1607990400,"counter":239,"content":"<p>Before the Minister of State responds, some of the issues, such as that around SENOs, would relate to the Department of Education.

I will turn those figures on their head.<\/p><p>One can see that CHO 3 had completed 30 in September, 56 in October and 54 in November.<\/p><p> Last night, I participated in a Zoom call with pals from Loughrea in County Galway.  They said they are experiencing the same ASD issues that Deputy Crowe mentioned.  There is an acute shortage of ASD units.  Many schools do not have enough space for a mop bucket never mind trying to convert a classroom, which is a very serious issue.  This seems to be happening across the country because any of these units can only cater for six people.  <\/p><p> Last night, I also heard the following and it is something that I have heard on a regular basis in addition to being well articulated by the Deputy.  Parents must continually do battle for services, the teachers assist them in their battle but the reports are shredded when they have been completed, which is a situation that needs addressing.  Parents and teachers have articulated to me their belief that barriers have been put in the way of progress to assist their children in educational and development spheres.

I do not want to tar everyone with the same brush but the organisation wields way too much power.  It is in the realm of education, in which it plays a major function, but it also delves into the realms of occupational therapy and educational psychology.  The organisation is empowered to interpret large volumes of assessment paperwork but it can strike out elements with devastating effects thus denying a child access to key enablers such as educational supports, occupational therapy supports or assistive technology.  The parents are absolutely infuriated at times and there needs to be standardisation across the board.    The issue comes down to a very moral and possibly legal argument that I cannot go into a person's realm and challenge him or her about a report if I am not equally, if not more, qualified yet the organisation does so.  An educational psychologist will have spent between four and six years studying for a degree and his or her Master's qualification yet his or her report can be torn asunder by someone who is not equally qualified.  I am not being snobbish when I say that and there is a legal point to be made.  I could not disregard an assessment by a plumber, mechanic, doctor or an accountant because I am not qualified in any of those disciplines yet a SENO can dissect everything in a report that has been submitted by a school and an educated psychologist or occupational therapist thus denying a child key supports that would enable him or her to live a more structured life in education.

I am joined by Ms Gr&aacute;inne McEvoy, director of consumer protection at the Central Bank.  We very much welcome the opportunity to appear before the committee today and discuss banking matters and hear the committee members&rsquo; views on the sector.<\/p> <p>  I would like to address the committee&rsquo;s invitation to discuss the NatWest strategic review of Ulster Bank&rsquo;s future direction.  In order for us to supervise effectively and for connected legal prohibition reasons we are not able to publicly discuss our engagement with individual firms on confidential matters.  In the same vein, it would be inappropriate for us to appear at a hearing with a regulated firm.  This is why we respectfully declined the request to attend last week's meeting.  We indicated in our response that we remained available, as always, to the committee on all matters relating to our mandate.  We take our engagement with this committee and our accountability to the Oireachtas very seriously.  Such engagement is one of several ways in which we demonstrate accountability for the work we undertake in safeguarding monetary and financial stability, and working to ensure that the financial system operates in the best interests of consumers and the wider economy.  We would welcome the opportunity to discuss further how we can improve our engagement with the committee such that we can help support it in meeting its objectives.<\/p> <p>  I will now briefly outline some of our current areas of focus in respect of the retail banks in Ireland, with households, businesses and the wider community as a whole to the forefront of our minds.  Much of the Central Bank's focus this year has been on mitigating the unprecedented impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.  The Central Bank's intertwined responsibilities of consumer protection, monetary policy, prudential regulation, payments and so on have strong interconnections with each other.  This positions us well to understand and mitigate the effects of the pandemic through monetary policy, macro prudential tools and supervision. <\/p> <p>  A key priority for us is that there are suitable supports in place to help borrowers affected by income shocks caused by the pandemic and that lenders continue to seek to sustainably resolve borrowers' longer term distress.  We have made our expectations clear on how borrowers should be treated and how lenders should engage constructively with distressed borrowers to ensure appropriate and tailored solutions to borrowers' circumstances are put in place.  We expect all lenders to have appropriate strategies, the necessary financial and operational resources and a suite of appropriate sustainable solutions to resolve distressed debt, whether it arose before or as a result of the pandemic.  We are also continuing to engage with a range of stakeholders on this issue and have been listening closely to borrower representatives such that our work continues to evolve.<\/p> <p>  The culture of firms is important in delivering our aspiration of a financial system that sustainably serves the needs of the economy and its consumers.  The failures of the past decade or so, notably relating to the tracker mortgage scandal, demonstrate this importance and also highlight that more progress is required.  We expect to see boards taking responsibility for the culture of their firms, overseeing product development and usage, actively promoting diversity and inclusion at all levels to improve decision-making and ensuring that robust internal systems are in place to drive effective cultures, including well-developed risk management frameworks.  Where this does not occur, we will take appropriate supervisory action.  Where serious or egregious breaches occur, we take enforcement action.  We are also seeking to strengthen the regulatory framework.  We are currently working with the Department of Finance to progress the individual accountability framework.  This seeks, among other things, to enhance the accountability of senior individuals in banks.<\/p> <p>  For the consumer and the taxpayer, safeguarding financial stability is one of the most important ways in which the Central Bank works to protect their interests, including seeking to ensure that the banking system operates in a safe, sound and sustainable way.  Banks need to be in a position to absorb shocks and have the ability to build buffers to withstand future shocks in order that they can serve the economy and consumers over the long-term.  The Irish banking system entered this crisis with substantial buffers of loss absorbing capital and considerably more robust business models, less risky loan books and better operational resilience than compared with the situation before the global financial crisis.  This ensured that they have been better able to continue to support their customers and the real economy through the pandemic.<\/p> <p>  The shift to digitally enabled services within the retail banks is already profound and is accelerating, including due to the behavioural changes arising from the pandemic.  As we look to the future of the retail banking sector, we see a rapidly changing landscape.  During the pandemic we have seen changes in consumer behaviour around use of cash, including significant increases in online transactions.  This acceleration of existing global trends is connected with consumers moving away from using banks in a number of ways.  Challenger firms, for example, providing payments services, often specialise in one service meaning they can be more agile and responsive to customer needs in that area. This is putting increasing pressure on banks to improve their digital offerings and change their approach to engaging with their customers.  While there are many benefits to this development for many people, it does increase the risk of financial exclusion, for example, due to age or income factors.<\/p> <p>  We recognise the importance of the credit union sector in this regard, with its wide network of community-focused and highly trusted co-operatives.  Irrespective of how retail banks choose to serve their customers they must, at a minimum, meet the standards we have in place for protecting consumers.  While decisions about the provision of services and branch networks are commercial matters for individual institutions, we have clear expectations on the need to take a consumer-focused approach.  The consumer protection code sets out the requirements on firms to ensure clear, timely communications with customers regarding any such permanent changes to a bank&rsquo;s branch network and to have alternative channels available to consumers to avail of banking services.<\/p> <p>  In the event that a regulated entity intends to withdraw from the Irish market, the withdrawal must be undertaken in accordance with the provisions of Irish financial services legislation, including the Central Bank's statutory codes of conduct.  Where a loan is sold or transferred, the protections that were available to borrowers prior to the transaction continue to be in place with the new loan owner.  This ensures that borrowers whose loans are sold or transferred maintain the same regulatory protections, including under the various Central Bank's statutory codes of conduct, such as the consumer protection code and the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.<\/p><p> There are, of course, many other issues relevant to the Irish banks.  We have also been continuing to work to mitigate the risks posed to the economy, consumers and the wider financial system of the UK&rsquo;s departure from the EU.  Brexit has already led to a significant growth in the size of the internationally focused banking sector in Ireland.  Going forward, we will be increasing our work on climate change, which is relevant to all banks operating in Ireland.  I look forward to our discussion on these and other important issues and developments relating to the banking sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020121500002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ed Sibley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607990400,"counter":259,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Sibley for his presentation and, more importantly, his responses to the queries raised previously.  There are two matters I would like to address separately, the first of which picks up on the issue we discussed at the previous meeting and Mr. Sibley's correspondence in regard to Brexit and its impact on the Irish financial system.  Mr. Sibley referred to significant growth and mentioned that the issuing of banking licences or the reallocation of staff is not necessarily the best indicator in that regard.  Is it possible to get a breakdown of the areas within banking or the business models in respect of which we are seeing that growth?  For example, is it focused in one particular area or is it spread evenly?  Which spreads are more important?  Mr. Sibley also referred to the strategy to avoid empty-shell policy on the part of banks.  Can he provide a little more detail on that?  I will refer to the second matter following Mr. Sibley's responses to those questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020121500002#B00200","speaker":"1473"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607990400,"counter":260,"content":"<p>The change in the banking landscape is primarily focused on international activity and investment banking-type activity rather than on retail banking or Irish customers.  Brexit has necessitated that the banks operating out of the UK and providing services into the EU across a range of areas, be that corporate lending, investment banking, transaction services and so on, need to locate in EU countries.  As a result, here was a movement of part of the banking services from London to Dublin, Frankfurt, Paris and Amsterdam.<\/p> <p>  On the second aspect of the Deputy's question, we seek to ensure that the hearts and minds of the organisation are operating out of Dublin.  If they are authorised here, they need to have boards, strong management capability and effective risk management here.  We recognise that they are interconnected.  They are typically part of wider international groups so there is a reliance on other parts of those groups for the provision of services such as, for example, those relating to IT.  There has been a transition process for capability to move from London to other parts of the EU.  Some of that transition has been slowed by the pandemic but we continue to expect that there will be hearts and minds here.  I would add that we operate very much as part of the Single Supervisory Mechanism.  We are party to the European approach to banking supervision and there is a strong degree of consistency regarding how we expect entities to operate.  We expect firms to operate in Dublin as they would be expected to operate in other parts of the eurozone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020121500002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ed Sibley"},{"type":"speech","time":1607990400,"counter":261,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Sibley for his responses.

I know there are specific cases Mr. Sibley will not go into and I do not expect him to do so.  However, I would welcome the general opinion of the Central Bank on how well the banking system in this State is currently operated and serviced for consumers in terms of it being a viable market for other markets.  Is there any concern that, perhaps, it is over-dominated by certain institutions or, more worryingly, that certain entities looking at the model in Ireland are concerned that it could force them to make decisions in the coming 12 months or so which would have major consequences?

By international and European standards, the Irish retail banking market is somewhat concentrated.  It is more concentrated than in other jurisdictions in terms of the level of competition in the market.  There are definitely more competitive banking markets.  That said, we have seen more competition across and between the Irish banks over the past few years.  We are seeing some degree of competition coming in from outside, either from other banks or from other types of more specialist financial services providers.  In addition, the retail banking market is, from an SME perspective, even more concentrated.  There are primarily three banks that are providing services to SMEs of any real scale within Ireland.  The other two provide some such services but not of particular scale.  That potentially is an even more concentrated market.<\/p> <p>  In terms of our role if a firm decides to leave, in the system we operate we expect firms to be able to enter the market and, also, exit the market.  If they are to exit, it is important that they do so in an orderly fashion and without too much risk of externalities or cost to the taxpayer or the State.  Whenever there is a significant business change for a large institution, we would engage extensively with that firm about the approach it is taking to that change and how the risks associated with the change would be managed.  We do have particular requirements under the consumer protection code in terms of engagement which, my colleague, Ms McEvoy, will provide a little more detail on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020121500002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ed Sibley"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607990400,"counter":263,"content":"<p>First and foremost, our expectation is that firms adopt a consumer-focused approach in terms of their engagement and their interaction and that all communications are clear and transparent to the customer regarding the actions they are taking.

The tracker mortgage examination has taken up a large part of this committee's work in previous years.  Unfortunately, we have not concluded with it.  These are statements I would have made to the Central Bank when it issued its final report in July 2019.  I know the Chairman was also very vocal in saying that there were outstanding cases.  When the Central Bank closed off on the tracker mortgage examination in July 2019, its final report outlined that 40,100 customers were affected with &euro;683 million paid out by lenders.  A total of 99 family homes and 216 buy-to-let units were lost.  A number of months roll on and what happens?  AIB had to pay out millions of euro to 5,900 other victims when it had to announce in April that it also denied these individuals tracker mortgages, following a single case taken to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman which upheld the finding.<\/p> <p>  We talk about cohorts of people in different types of contracts.  Nearly 6,000 people in this type of contract were missed by the Central Bank.  Claims that were being made went through the independent process with AIB and were refused.  The Central Bank oversaw that and signed off a final report stating that it was done and dusted, although it was going to continue to monitor the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.  That does not absolve it from its responsibilities, in terms of the consumer protection role that the Oireachtas has given the Central Bank.  In the middle of such a serious examination how could it miss that nearly 6,000 customers were also denied and wrongly impacted by AIB over their tracker mortgages?<\/p> <p>  If that were not good enough, three months later, in July last, AIB announced that there were another 1,000 victims of the tracker mortgage scandal, again as a result of an examination following a complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.  Each of those affected through EBS and Haven, which are subsidiaries of AIB, were paid approximately &euro;6,000.  The earlier group of 6,000 victims were offered &euro;1,650.  We discussed this at the previous committee.  Members of the previous committee said that these people were entitled to a tracker mortgage and the &euro;1,650 did not deal with the issue.  I am baffled that the Central Bank continued to miss this, despite warnings from me and other committee members and from advocates arguing for it.<\/p> <p>  How did the Central Bank miss seeing that one bank had more than 7,000 additional victims of the tracker mortgage scandal, which the Central Bank, when it signed off on the report in July 2019, believed did not exist?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020121500002#C00200","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607990400,"counter":268,"content":"<p>We are deeply concerned by what happened with the tracker mortgage scandal and we have done a considerable amount of work to try to rectify the situation.

Has anybody in KBC been asked to resign by the Central Bank given that in the middle of the examination, it continued to repossess homes?

We think the individual accountability framework can be improved.  We are working with the Department of Finance and are keen for that to be in place as quickly as possible.

Promontoria then said that it does not do that type of arrangement and would not do anything that Ulster Bank was offering.

Part of it is a factor of the crisis we had.  We still have the legacy of that crisis today.  It is evident that mortgage lending in Ireland has historically been riskier.  That results in banks having to hold more capital relative to that lending, which also has an influence on price.  We are comparing averages, but there are significant differences in different markets around the eurozone, including length of mortgage lending, for example, and having longer-term fixed rate mortgages in some jurisdictions and, atypically, non-interest costs in some jurisdictions.  There are multiple reasons for the differences, but competition is evidently part of the reason that banks can charge higher interest rates in Ireland than those in other countries.<\/p> <p>  What we have done is to seek to address some of the fundamental issues affecting the functioning of the mortgage market, including trying to address the longer term mortgage arrears and trying to put in place a more resilient system, with business models as well as macroprudential rules to enhance the resilience of borrowers.  We have sought to encourage and facilitate greater switching.  We are doing some more work on the behavioural triggers that could be applied to facilitate a greater degree of switching.  That will not only have an impact in terms of the individual borrowers but will help to drive greater competition into the market.

I, like others in this room, have been critical of the Central Bank over a long period in the past.  This is not personal and I do not want any of the witnesses to take it as personal, but there are issues which public representatives have had to face which were unusual, to say the least.  They still continue.  To put it in the vernacular, the banking system in this country still punishes borrowers above and beyond other borrowers across Europe for something they did wrong during the crash, and I will come to that momentarily, or for something they are about to do wrong on the basis that they are a higher risk than those elsewhere.<\/p> <p>  There is no such thing as risk-free lending anywhere in the world.  It does not exist.  However, we were led to believe during and immediately after the financial crash that it should have been risk free.  It is not, never can be and never will be, nor should it be.  That is why there is speculation in markets and so forth.  I also realise, like everybody here, that we must have a stable banking system.  That is fundamental to an open economy, and we must be sure there are good practices that protect the economy and protect the consumer.  Reference has been made to this at length.<\/p> <p>  One of the problems I and all of us have faced is sitting down across a table from the representatives of banks which had lent money to borrowers, knowing they should not have done so.  They knew it was impossible to meet the demand at a later stage but, clearly, they were of the mind that it would be all right because there was an inflationary situation and property prices would exceed all expectations.  What in God's name was going on at that stage?  Nobody would think like that and presume that it was going to continue.  It could not happen.  I am sure you, Chairman, other members of the committee and I advised countless people that under no circumstances should they borrow in the way that was being suggested to them.  Obviously, people did not always take that advice.  It was harsh advice at the time, and they saw people like us as impeding them and their progress.  In the long run, we were speaking for their well-being.  To outline what happened, no worthwhile regulations were applied at that time.  Hence, the full extent of the problem.<\/p> <p>  What happened next was worse.  The banks retrospectively applied good conduct on borrowing after the event.  It was the most amazing performance.  When the horse was well and truly bolted and galloping down the far end of the track, suddenly the banks said they were going to apply good banking practice and good regulations on the borrower, who had already borrowed far in excess of what his or her capability of repayment could and should be.  On the one hand, there must be good confidence in the banking system, but on the other we must restore public confidence where the consumer is concerned.<\/p> <p>  There has been reference to the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  That has been quoted to me several times.  The code of conduct benefits the bank over the borrower to a great extent.  The bank tells the borrower his or her borrowings are unsustainable and, as a result, this is how we must proceed.  The limit is that it repossesses the property.  It might take a while, but the bank will repossess it.  It will pile on interest and so forth, in many cases piling on the interest with no regard to what it is doing to people, to such an extent that there is no other way out except to liquidate the debt and repossess the property.  I will not go into the emotional situation of the thousands of people who found themselves in the extraordinarily sad position of having lost or losing their homes.  That was on the cards for perhaps six months or a year or whatever the case may be.  It is still happening.<\/p> <p>  Does the Central Bank have the power to impose on what are now regarded as vulture funds some type of recognition for the fact that they acquired the loan books at a knock-down rate in many situations, with a discount of 30%, 40%, 50%, 60% and up to 80% in some cases?  Of course, the borrower never knows what the full discount was, but the borrower must pay for it.  The borrowers are now falling into what is known as distressed debt, because they have not been able to repay or discharge the loan.  That is because they were never going to be able to repay it.  It was not possible from the outset.  The unfortunate borrowers include business borrowers and the businesses involved, who gave personal guarantees in respect of their households and so forth.  They ended up in tragedy.  I and everybody else in the committee have sat in front of vulture fund representatives while men and women cried openly, sought mercy and got none.  That is a very sad thing with which to conclude.  However, that is the way it happened.<\/p> <p>  All the time, members of the committee were tabling parliamentary questions.  We could not ask too many questions in case we would cause a flight of funds, and we could not ask too many pointed questions.  We asked questions as to whether the banking system and the economy were based on sound economic fundamentals.  As to the number of times we tabled those questions, I sometimes dream about them.  The reply was \"Yes\", they were.  In fact, it was \"No\", they were not.  However, nobody recognised what we were trying to say at the time.  Nobody cared.  There were financial regulators, ombudsmen and the Central Bank.  That was presided over by all these agencies, without demur, and we know what the consequences were.<\/p><p>The Chairman will be glad to know I have come to this conclusion.  We need some hope for those who are in what are called distressed loan scenarios.  We need some recognition that the banking system, whether a vulture or original lender, is going to take into account the circumstances.  They say to us \"that was then and this is now\".  In other words, it was fine then but the banks are not part and parcel of the previous regime and the new rules will be applied now, whether people like it or not, and nothing can be done about it.<\/p><p> We may not be able to do anything about it now but we might have to.  Instead of a continuing reference to the code of conduct and the last review of the code of conduct in 2018, I ask that the code be urgently reviewed again with greater recognition of the hardship caused to many borrowers.<\/p><p> Incidentally, we all know these borrowers as people who ran their businesses and homes very effectively for many years, borrowing money and paying it back, never leaving money owing to anybody.  They were always able to pay it back, except when there was a convergence of a massive amount of overhang of borrowing at the same time and place, which rendered the State and the banks insolvent.  It was an incredible performance but nobody accepted responsibility.  Nobody came with us to the table to speak on behalf of the people who find themselves with distressed mortgages.  It is within the capacity of the banks and the Central Bank to oversee a system that is fair to these people.  It is a matter for the Central Bank at this stage.<\/p><p> A final point relates to banking competition.  A number of raiders introduced themselves to this jurisdiction before the banking crash, undermining the banking system in the country by undercutting others, offering mortgages and borrowings at a rate never known before.  Loans were granted on interest-only terms, so what sort of system were we in?  This was meant to be the system for the foreseeable future, and it was seen as good banking according to the system that applied at the time.<\/p><p> I am not asking the witnesses to comment on an individual bank but if a bank moves from our system now, it will not be in the interest of the consumer or the business people served by that bank, particularly if that bank's loan book is to be transferred to a vulture fund.  There is now a conundrum that the Central Bank must resolve.  We cannot do it.  These controls are in the hands of the Central Bank.<\/p><p> I would like to see us retain the level of competition within the banking system in this country and on a sound footing.  Everything must be done to ensure it continues without interruption, and that in the event of vulture funds deciding they can seize an opportunity to take over a major chunk of the banking system in the country, we must remind them that they are only here in sufferance and they are only partially accountable to the Central Bank.  We have asked all these questions before and there are unregulated third parties involved with borrowing in this country and taking over loan books.  We asked the questions many times and were told they would be subject to usual rules and regulations but these bodies are not subject to such rules.<\/p><p> It is all fine to complain about this but somebody must do something about it fairly soon.  I have gone long over my time, for which I apologise, but at any time in future if the Chairman wishes members to attend a meeting with the Central Bank or representatives of banks or vulture funds, we will be more than happy to attend and support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020121500002#F00500","speaker":"1584","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607990400,"counter":326,"content":"<p>Do the witnesses wish to comment on any of the remarks made by Deputy Durkan?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020121500002#G00200","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607990400,"counter":327,"content":"<p>I certainly welcome the opportunity to comment and he has covered a large amount of ground.  I am conscious of the time limits but I am certainly happy to engage within this committee and bilaterally if helpful.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy spoke about the financial crisis and the behaviour, business models and approach in the entire system failed leading into the financial crisis.  I have no disagreement there.  We have worked very hard over the past decade or more to both deal with the crisis that enveloped the country and to put in place a much more resilient system that protects the country, borrowers and consumers from any recurrence.  It very significantly enhanced the regulatory framework both from a resilience perspective but also from a consumer protection perspective.<\/p> <p>  We have also undertaken much work to try to address the level of distress that resulted from the banking crisis.  There has been much progress over many years on that.  We can looked at the level of restructuring that has taken place across mortgages; approaching a quarter of loans that existed at the time of the crisis have had some degree of restructure.  More than 130,000 loans were restructured to address elements of distress and another approximately 60,000 were addressed pre-distress.<\/p> <p>  When I reference numbers I am acutely conscious that I am talking about individuals and households.  Unfortunately, there is still a legacy of distress, primarily with mortgage holders, the majority of which are now more than two years past due on mortgage repayments, both sitting within the banking system and some outside the banking system.  We are absolutely committed to continuing to try to address that to the greatest extent that we can.<\/p> <p>  The majority of these borrowers are paying something and about half are deemed to be co-operating.  There are potential solutions within the financial system for many of those borrowers but there are also challenges that go beyond the financial system where the borrowers are not co-operating or making repayments.  We must consider the safety nets available for those types of borrowers.<\/p> <p>  Even right up to the courts system it is never too late to engage and we can see that with what comes out of the courts.  We are pushing hard from a lender perspective to ensure they continue to strive to engage and we have also taken the hard lessons from the financial crisis into how we deal with the distress evident from the Covid-19 pandemic.  We are trying to ensure the issues that arose immediately after the financial crisis do not arise again.  This relates to borrowers whose incomes have been affected by the pandemic, and they should be supported to the greatest extent possible so they do not go into longer-term arrears.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy referred to raiders coming in and affecting the market.  For any firm authorised in Ireland and any bank authorised within the eurozone able to branch into Ireland, we expect it to have a robust business model that is likely to be sustainable over the long term.  It should have sufficient financial resources, including in times of stress, and it should have a good grasp of its risks.  It should be well run and be able to be resolvable in the event that it fails.<\/p> <p>  I hope this addresses some of what the Deputy raised but as I said I am happy to engage bilaterally if that is helpful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020121500002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ed Sibley"},{"type":"speech","time":1607990400,"counter":328,"content":"<p>I was taken by Mr. Sibley's statement that Ireland's banking market is somewhat concentrated.

Our banking market shows enormous supplier power.  The banks exert far more power than they normally would if there were healthier competition within the market.  We have two pillar banks, in the words of the Government, and they have about 80% of the market.  Instead of seeing that much increased competition, we are seeing one of the significant players probably leave the market over the next while.  Is it not therefore a significant objective of the Central Bank, given its responsibilities to consumers, and a significant objective of the Government to see a radical transition from this overly concentrated market - dangerously concentrated, in my view - to a functioning competitive market over the coming years?  For example, banks have enormous power over interest rates.  Ireland has either the highest or the second highest mortgage interest rate in the European Union.  I understand that the banking difficulties we have had play a part in this, but the banking structure also plays a radical part in it.  There is no doubt that if there were tighter competition, it would chase those interest rates down somewhat.  Consider even the way the banks interact with customers.  The banks can determine most elements of the engagement with customers because they have this enormous supplier power.  The locations of banks and the banks' closing down of their units in smaller provincial towns and throughout the country have an enormous effect on enterprise, families, etc.  Is it not a very negative element of the banking industry that it is so concentrated?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020121500002#H00200","speaker":"1504"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607990400,"counter":331,"content":"<p>I agree with the Deputy that there is a high degree of concentration in the industry.

We have, though, issued warnings for consumers on our consumer hub and bringing to their attention the likelihood of the format that such attacks can take.

We have worked closely with our industry in recent years to ensure that it is fully <i>au fait<\/i>with the requirements of PSD2 and that those companies concerned have updated their IT systems and channels of interaction with consumers to ensure compliance with the requirements of the direct, particularly in the area of strong customer authentication.<br\/><br\/>That aspect is increasingly common and, as a consumer himself, the Senator will probably have experienced situations, when seeking to complete a transaction online, where an additional code might have been required, or a security question may have needed to be answered, or, depending on the technology, a fingerprint might be required.

Last week, we had representatives from the Financial Services Union, FSU, before the committee.  Unfortunately, it was only representatives from that union who were available to speak to us then.  I feel strongly about the future of Ulster Bank, because it supports 3,000 people in jobs on a regionally-balanced basis.  We are concerned about the major impact of any change in that regard.  In 2019, Ulster Bank provided new lending of &euro;3.1 billion into the southern economy, with deposits of &euro;22 billion.  Ulster Bank is the third largest mortgage lender in this State and provides 20% of lending to our SMEs.<\/p> <p>  We are concerned about its future.  The parent company of Ulster Bank, NatWest, has stated that it will undertake a strategic review of the operations of Ulster Bank, including the potential closure of the bank's operations in this State.  It was also reported recently that Goldman Sachs has been employed to undertake that strategic review.  The witnesses will be aware that Goldman Sachs itself has been involved in the Irish mortgage market, namely, in setting up vulture funds which have bought up distressed debts from our retail banks and then selling on those debts, without paying a cent in tax on its profits, through section 100 structures.

I know that Deputy Pearse Doherty wrote to the Central Bank on 25 November about the withdrawal and the impact that would have, and that the Central Bank said in response that the exit of one entity from such a system, all other things being equal, could contribute to upward pressure to lending interest rates and could potentially lead to weaker credit availability.

If one of the larger banks, or any of the banks, given their number and the amount of competition in the market, was to exit, clearly, there is the potential for that to have significant implications.  I completely empathise in terms of the concerns of and uncertainty for those people working for an organisation where there is this type of strategic review ongoing.  There was a similar example previously in connection with KBC.  A strategic review was undertaken in regard to KBC a couple of years ago and there was similar speculation.  At the end of that, KBC decided to stay.  I cannot comment or speculate on what will happen with Ulster Bank but it is not a total given that it will leave.  I appreciate that there is uncertainty for people who are working for Ulster Bank, and that must be challenging.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the competition point the Deputy makes, and she referred to my letter, where I would be most concerned is in regard to SMEs.  We are seeing a degree more competition in the mortgage market, so the trend is downward and one measure would be interest rates.  There has been an increase in competition and we are, as I touched on earlier, seeing signs of potential other competition coming into the market, both from banks and non-banks in mortgages.  However, the SME lending is more concentrated again because, of the banks, there are only three banks that are lending to SMEs at any kind of scale.  In terms of potential implications were Ulster Bank to decide to leave, that would be the area that is most concerning in terms of the functioning of the market.<\/p> <p>  There are other options out there for SMEs, and the other two banks and the credit unions are able to lend to smaller SMEs, but none of that is approaching the scale of Ulster Bank&rsquo;s lending to SMEs.

I thought it was quite an interesting point by the FSU and, in that sense, if that were to happen, I think a greater importance would be set on the credit union sector.  Mr. Sibley stated that he recognised the importance of the credit union sector.  Specifically, we need to recognise the help it can provide people in terms of increasing financial exclusion and, obviously, that would be a great concern with the increasing digitisation of banking.  We know there are huge swathes of the country that just do not have broadband, so that is not a factor for them, and there are people who are not able to undertake online banking, as well as the fact we are, unfortunately, moving away from community-based branches.<\/p> <p>  The Central Bank said recently in regard to the banks that there can be a distance between what they say and what their customers experience.  Many credit unions have contacted me because they are concerned about their future.  They would be concerned about what the Central Bank says and what they themselves experience, and this is what they have come to me about.  They are concerned about the scale of the crisis facing them in the next five years.  They have said the regulations being placed on the sector at the moment put them at a competitive disadvantage to the banks, and that this has stymied their ability to lend and, therefore, is strangling the customer's ability to borrow.  At the same time, we see that Ulster Bank could potentially exit the market, which would add to that.  We cannot underestimate the huge opportunity that credit unions have and the positive impact they can have if there is this move towards the closure of local bank branches.<\/p> <p>  I want to refer to a number of concerns the credit unions raised with me in regard to-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020121500002#L00400","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speech","time":1607990400,"counter":380,"content":"<p>We are running out of time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020121500002#L00500","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speech","time":1607990400,"counter":381,"content":"<p>Do we not have until 3.30 p.m.?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020121500002#L00600","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speech","time":1607990400,"counter":382,"content":"<p>We do, but I have to come in.

Larger credit unions can lend up to 15%.  This was seen as an advancement of regulation but the credit unions are quite concerned about it.  We know that in large, developed credit union movements in other countries, credit unions are allowed to lend up to 60%.  We also know that over half of the consumer credit market in Ireland is for mortgages.  How can credit unions provide a real alternative with this kind of restriction in place?  Given that they feel they are stymied in terms of having a more balanced loan book, is this creating a greater risk for credit unions?  Some credit unions have come to me and stated that they want to set their own limits for what they can lend.  I would be interested to hear Mr. Sibley's views on that.

There has been a lot of hard work done by the credit unions and the membership bodies.  The Central Bank has done a lot of hard work in terms of supporting the credit unions over the past decade or so.  There has been a significant amount of consolidation in the sector and some growth of some much bigger credit unions, while at the same time maintaining much of the credit union footprint around the country.

The word \"abhorrent\" was used with regard to KBC.  The other side won a court case against the bank.  It was to pay out on that basis but still has not done so.  It just refuses to pay.  Deputy Doherty will be aware of a particular case regarding Bank of Ireland.

Threshold has worked with and supported tenants living in the private rented sector since 1978.  Threshold advocates for increased security of tenure, affordability, improvement in standards and a sustainable private rented sector.  We are working toward a vision whereby private rental is on an equal status of tenure to other tenure options in Ireland, and we believe housing is a right.<br\/><br\/>The housing assistance payment, or HAP, is a form of social housing support available since 2014 to eligible persons living in the private rented sector.  I want to note that HAP is a massive improvement from a policy and a practice point of view compared to rent supplement, not least because tenants can increase earnings and still be eligible for the housing assistance payment.  Through Threshold&rsquo;s work with tenants, we identified that many were struggling to pay rent even with the support of the housing assistance payment.  To meet the rent they were paying top-ups to their landlord.  This is rent paid directly by the tenant to the landlord in addition to the rent the landlord receives from the housing assistance payment.  Many others were struggling to find a landlord to accept HAP.  In 2019, Threshold carried out research into this issue and surveyed 116 tenants in receipt of or eligible for HAP.  Our colleagues in the Society of St. Vincent de Paul were observing similar trends among the households they work with.  We came together to publish the report and recommendations, with which the committee has been provided.<br\/><br\/>I will give the committee an idea of the scale of the housing assistance payment and then set out our findings from our research.  Marcella Stakem will then set out our joint recommendations.<br\/><br\/>There are approximately 59,000 households currently supported by HAP.  The Department plans to support an additional 15,000 households with HAP in 2021.  Almost &euro;560 million has been allocated for HAP in budget 2021.  The 2019 expenditure was &euro;382 million so it is an ever-increasing bill.<br\/><br\/>In terms of HAP limits, the maximum monthly rent limits payable for a household under HAP are set out in statutory instrument.  These limits have remained largely unchanged since July 2016.  As such, they fall far short of market rent in many instances.  The national average rent increased 27% between Quarter 2 2016 and Quarter 2 2020.  The HAP caps did not.  One of the greatest obstacles faced by tenants is finding a place within the cap.  Where they cannot, the tenants pay the shortfall in the form of a top-up to the landlord.<br\/><br\/>There are enormous shortfalls in HAP caps for single people looking to rent a one-bed property.  A single person looking to rent a one-bed apartment in Cork city, Dublin 15 and Limerick city could potentially pay a top-up of &euro;760 to make up the shortfall.  A single person living in County Limerick or County Carlow may have to pay up to &euro;350 in the form of a top-up to the landlord to secure a home.  It is a similar story for families with three children who are looking to rent a three-bed house.  Again, a potential top-up of &euro;400 or more for families in these areas may apply.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the 20% discretionary uplift, local authorities may approve a discretionary 20% uplift in the HAP payment to help meet the rent.  However, this is not guaranteed and is not practised consistently across all local authorities.  This is often one of the challenges that Threshold advisers assist tenants with.  In Quarter 4 2019, 36% of households, excluding homeless HAP, were receiving some degree of uplift in their HAP payment.<\/p><p>Even with the full 20% uplift, the HAP payment can often be insufficient.  In a 2019 report from the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, IGEES, it is estimated that the payments, inclusive of discretionary uplifts, fall short for 28% of HAP tenancies, meaning these tenants are paying a top-up to the landlord.  A number of recommendations are made in the IGEES report.  It is not surprising, then, that almost half of the HAP recipients we interviewed were paying a top-up to the landlord.  These top-ups ranged from &euro;100 or less to more than &euro;500, and the average top-up was &euro;177.  Tenants of varying incomes paid top-ups across the range.<\/p><p> With regard to affordability, it is generally accepted that we pay up to 30% of our income on housing costs.  This is a rough rule of thumb to calculate affordability and anyone who has applied for a mortgage knows the bank will apply a similar affordability test.  However, among the tenants we interviewed, 20% were paying more than 30% of their income on rent and 10% were paying more than 40%.  What was common across the board was that the Threshold clients we interviewed were struggling with day-to-day expenses as a result of the top-up.  This is because tenants will prioritise rent over everything else.  Rent arrears can accrue quickly, resulting in a notice of termination, and so are avoided at all costs.  Almost half of those who participated in the Threshold survey said they struggled to pay the electricity or heating bill, buy groceries or cover childcare and school costs.  To have a home, heat and food are the basics we all require to live and to have a chance to achieve our potential.  The tenants paying more than 30% of their income do not necessarily have these.<\/p><p> As a form of social housing, which it is regarded as by some, HAP lacks the security of tenure tenants of local authorities and approved housing bodies, AHBs, have.  A HAP tenant can be evicted through no fault of their own.  The most common query brought to Threshold is about notices of termination, representing a third of all queries each year.  More than three quarters of these were issued where there was no wrongdoing on the tenants&rsquo; part.  A landlord can issue a notice of termination if they wish to sell the home, need it for their own use or that of a family member, wish to renovate or on grounds of section 34(b), whereby a Part 4 tenancy is coming to an end.<\/p><p> A requirement of HAP is that the property meets the minimum standards for private rented dwellings and all HAP properties are meant to be inspected to ensure this.  Unfortunately, some tenants reported the inspections had not happened after a year in the property and, on occasion, when the local authority directed the landlord to undertake repairs, this was never done and the local authority did not follow up.  Worryingly, stories of mould, damp, broken heating systems and ill-health were commonplace.  This is not surprising as queries about standards and repairs are among the most common issues dealt with by Threshold&rsquo;s advisers.<\/p><p> The second greatest obstacle for HAP tenants was the difficulty in finding a landlord to accept HAP.  Under HAP, tenants must source a property themselves.  Despite the fact the Equal Status Act 2015 prohibits discrimination against those in receipt of HAP, tenants reported instances where landlords refused to accept HAP or sign the paperwork.  In some cases, landlords never returned the paperwork, resulting in the tenants falling into arrears and they can be evicted for these arrears, notwithstanding the recent Covid-19-related legislation.  Some groups in society are vulnerable to further discrimination by certain landlords such as members of the Traveller community, migrants and persons with disabilities.  As such, these groups are even further excluded from access to housing.  Tenants can take cases to the Workplace Relations Commission to challenge such discrimination, and Threshold supported 11 households in such cases last year.  While the WRC generally finds in the tenants&rsquo; favour, this does not always guarantee access to housing.<\/p><p> With regard to HAP in practice, as with all systems, there are areas which work well and those where improvements can be made.  The payment of rent in arrears from the day the HAP application is processed as opposed to the day the tenancy started is highly problematic.  Landlords expect rent to be paid upfront and in advance.  Tenants can fall into severe financial distress in an attempt to make these upfront payments.  The treatment of arrears has presented issues for HAP tenants.  Once arrears accrue, tenants are required to pay the arrears within eight weeks.  If they are unable to do so, the HAP payment to the landlord is stopped and the tenancy deemed lost.  This is in stark contrast to the treatment of arrears for other social housing tenants &ndash; mainstream social housing tenants, in other words - where a more client-centred, homeless prevention approach is taken.<\/p><p> The fact that tenants can still work and benefit from HAP is a hugely positive element.  When their income increases, their rent contribution to the local authority increases, as with any social housing tenants.  Those tenants who were afforded the 20% discretionary uplift in the HAP payment found it a lifesaver.  Many of the tenants spoke highly of the staff in the HAP offices, finding them very helpful.<\/p><p> I thank members for their time.  I will hand over to Ms Stakem of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul to talk through the recommendations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020121500002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John-Mark McCafferty","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607990400,"counter":427,"content":"<p>We welcome the opportunity to make a presentation to the committee on behalf of our respective organisations.  The unprecedented housing crisis that is impacting the well-being of individuals, children and families, forcing people into a constant state of insecurity and driving poverty among those in the private rented sector, continues.  Our research shows that HAP is providing an important short-term housing support and preventing more people experiencing homelessness.  However, it contains a number of design flaws which need to be reformed if this support is to meet the needs of low-income households in the private rented sector.<\/p> <p>  As outlined by Mr. McCafferty, HAP limits are currently insufficient in meeting market rents, making it very difficult for low-income households to access private rented accommodation.  It fails to provide sufficient security of tenure and cannot meet the needs of people who have a long-term housing need.  In practical terms, this means they are households in a constant state of worry about where and how they are going to live.  Society of St. Vincent de Paul members see this experience through their home visitation work, where they see families struggling to make ends meet, cutting back on essentials such as food so their rent is paid on time.  It also fails to recognise the difficulties and discrimination facing some vulnerable households trying to access housing in the private rented sector, who must compete with other prospective tenants who may be seen as more desirable by landlords.  This is evidenced by the fact that the second highest number of queries to the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission regarding the Equal Status Act relates to the housing assistance ground.  Both Threshold and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul work with tenants who find themselves in this situation all too regularly.<\/p> <p>  Ultimately, what is needed for the clients we support is a broader choice of housing, real affordable rental, real affordable purchase and an increase in local authority and AHB building and acquisition.  These are vital ingredients to address the issue of housing supply and render the private sector more affordable.<\/p> <p>  We have outlined a number of other recommendations that we feel would make HAP a workable short-term housing solution until such time as there is sufficient social housing provision.  Our research recommends that a complete review of HAP and its interaction with the private rented sector is required to determine the next steps for HAP, given the changed landscape of housing and renting in Ireland since its introduction in 2014.  We recommend a strategy to introduce minimum energy efficiency standards in the private rented sector, which will ensure that all accommodation meets an energy rating of at least C1 or higher by 2030.  This is urgently required as Society of St. Vincent de Paul members who visit people in their homes find that many tenants are living in substandard and possibly unsafe accommodation, and are unable to force their landlord to improve the standard of their living conditions in case they are asked to leave.<\/p><p>If a tenant who is engaging with a local authority falls into arrears on his or her differential rent or top-up, a realistic repayment plan should be worked out to clear the arrears over time with the local authority and the landlord.  In the interim, the local authority should continue to make the housing assistance payment to the landlord to prevent the household entering homelessness.<\/p><p> We also recommend a protocol similar to the interim tenancy sustainment protocol for HAP to prevent homelessness.  We have witnessed through our work an increase in the number of clients getting into difficulty with their rent in recent times.  This is occurring as households cannot continue to pay unaffordable top-ups in addition to their rent contribution through HAP.  The roll-out of an information and awareness raising campaign to educate landlords on HAP and the equality legislation is needed.  An investigation into landlord and agent refusal to accept HAP should also be included in the review.  As shown, some local authorities are not awarding the 20% uplift, despite recipients receiving it in previous tenancies.  All local authorities should provide the 20% uplift where a household requires it to improve affordability and as a homelessness prevention measure.  On a practical level, there are steps that could be taken to improve how HAP works in practice.  The length of time to process applications, the payment of rent from the date the application is processed as opposed to the date the tenancy commenced, the payment of rent in arrears and the non-payment of a deposit must all be addressed to reflect the reality of the private rented sector.<\/p><p> Through our work we see the devastating impacts that insecure housing has on people's physical, financial, social and emotional well-being, all of whom now have the added pressure that Covid-19 has brought to people's lives.  We are delighted to have had the opportunity to complete the report with Threshold, which also works with households that are dealing with significant stress and insecurity relating to their housing tenure.  We thank the committee members for listening to us today and we look forward to working with them to progress the necessary policy and practical changes required to make HAP fully fit for purpose.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020121500002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Marcella Stakem","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607990400,"counter":429,"content":"<p>Thank you.

If we look in 2020 at a survey from back in 2019, Covid has had a dramatic impact.  Our homes and living space have become more important to all of us.  There has been a big change in Dublin, in particular.  A year ago people could not get landlords to take the HAP or they could only do so with great difficulty.  With the arrival of the Covid pandemic, foreign students disappeared, students from the country went back home to study from home and people working in Dublin who came from the country and who were advised to work from home moved home.  In the past three to six months I have seen a big increase in the availability of private rented accommodation on a HAP basis.  Do the witnesses agree with that?<\/p> <p>  Second, in terms of the other issues the witnesses addressed, security of tenure is a very difficult issue to get around when it is private rented accommodation.  How do the witnesses think that could be addressed without removing control of the property from the landlord?  On the deposit and the first month's rent, I agree with the witnesses.  That is a big issue for many people in securing the HAP tenancy.  Homeless HAP provides that.  In my experience in Dublin over the past 12 months, the homeless HAP payment has made it significantly easier for private rental tenants to secure accommodation, but they are almost being forced into becoming homeless to qualify for homeless HAP and to get the 20% uplift and the first month's rent and deposit.  Do the witnesses agree with that?<\/p> <p>  Regarding discrimination, did I hear correctly that 11 cases were taken?  If so, out of 60,000, is that accurately reflecting a very small problem?  I agree that a full review must be undertaken and that is why I asked how many people had participated in the survey.  While 116 is certainly informative, it is not a huge sample out of a potential tenancy base of 60,000 to 70,000.  When suggesting a review of HAP, what sample size is suggested for it to be comprehensive?  I agree that the review must be undertaken because we will have the HAP in the future and half a billion or more is being spent on it.  We need to manage this quite effectively.  I would appreciate answers to those questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020121500002#C00600","speaker":"1656"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607990400,"counter":434,"content":"<p>Covid-19 has been an absolute game changer in all aspects of our lives, including housing.  A couple of things are striking.  In some ways we are surprised that there is less of an increase in availability than had been anticipated.  In the short lettings, for example, there is some, but it is very modest.  As there had been such a demand there that was unmet, with a relative softening in the market, there was a long way to go and a need for a great deal of capacity.  We have seen moderation in rents.  In the Cork city and county area, because we also have an access housing unit that sources and facilitates access to social rented housing and private rented housing, the situation is as challenging as it ever was.<\/p><p>In Dublin, there has definitely been a softening but not necessarily the kind of embarrassment of riches that one might assume with such a shock to a housing system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020121500002#C00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. John-Mark McCafferty","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607990400,"counter":436,"content":"<p>I am sorry to interrupt but we need to keep questions and answers to five minutes.

We have HAP, the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, the rent supplement and long-term leasing.  For next year, the Government has provided &euro;1.05 billion for the rent supplement.  There are currently 100,000 tenancies subsidised by the State.  That is one third of all tenancies in the rental market.  Next year, both the amount of money and the total number of people subsidised will increase significantly.  Part of the problem is that rental subsidy started out as a short-term stopgap with rent supplement.  Government policy currently regards the rental accommodation scheme, HAP and long-term leasing as forms of social housing, not as temporary measures to meet the cost of private rental while waiting for adequate social housing.  That, in itself, is a problem that needs to be reviewed.<\/p> <p>  I absolutely share both organisations' concern over the current operation of HAP.  I want to highlight a couple of issues that are of particular concern to me.  The first is that it now takes many local authorities about ten weeks to process HAP applications.  Very few private sector landlords, particularly those who are semi-professional or who are accidental landlords with a mortgage payment to meet, can wait ten weeks before getting a payment.  It is causing a real difficulty.  Neither the Department nor the authorities in Limerick, which manage HAP, will give us a straight answer as to why that is the case.  Is the delegates' experience reflective of that?<\/p> <p>  I fully agree that the change of practice involving HAP being backdated to the date of application rather than the date of tenancy commencement is really problematic.  It is not unusual for three or four weeks to pass before documentation comes in, leaving the tenant in very vulnerable circumstances.  Have the witnesses further thoughts on that?<\/p> <p>  I have two other concerns.  Homeless HAP, which is a necessary support, is having a distorting impact in Dublin.  We have to be honest about it.  Standard HAP applicants are being priced out of the market because landlords know that homeless HAP is available.  Local authorities are now providing homeless HAP four to six weeks in advance of a notice to quit being issued.  I am not arguing against that.  It is a necessary function but there is a distorting impact that we have to name and start thinking about.<\/p> <p>  Another group of people affected by this comprises those households whose income is just above the threshold for social housing supports and who are now competing with people on HAP and homeless HAP.  Their income levels might not be very different.  Have the delegates any thoughts on that?<\/p> <p>  I am firmly of the view that the HAP was badly designed.  A review is needed urgently.  Organisations such as those of the witnesses cannot carry out a huge survey of thousands of applicants as that is the responsibility of the Housing Agency and the Department.  Most of us who deal with many HAP applicants will have had many experiences like the ones the witnesses have expressed here today.<\/p> <p>  My one concern is that if we raise the HAP limits, either by having a 50% discretionary limit across the State rather than the 50% limit for Dublin and 20% outside Dublin, or if we index link HAP to something else, there is an incentive for landlords to keep pushing the rents up.  Dublin rents are flatlining, according to Daft and the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, but rents in other urban centres are increasing.  In Cork, Galway, Sligo and Waterford, the rate is between 3% and 5%.  The more money put into rental subsidy, the more rent goes up.  I am not arguing against the increase but I would always have been of the view that there needs to be a cap as well as an increase.  Where an increase is provided, there should be a cap of some level on the entire rental market.<\/p> <p>  I have a question for both witnesses.  Maybe this is the first one they could answer.  It is all very well for us to have this discussion, express concern and sympathy and agree with the witnesses, but what do they want us to do?  That is the important point.  The witnesses are here in front of the committee.  Is there specific action they would like us to take on foot of the evidence they have given us?  I refer to taking an action from today rather than just discussing an issue that most of us have some experience of, although we appreciate the work the witnesses are doing and the research they have presented to us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020121500002#D00300","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607990400,"counter":438,"content":"<p>We would really like to see a complete review of HAP.

The limits are really quite restricted with regard to facilitating their access to the market.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also mentioned the households just above the social housing thresholds.  I hope that initiatives such as affordable rental will grow over time, starting from a very small baseline.  We are mindful of the first project between Respond and Tuath on the Enniskerry Road.

It meant they could get on with other aspects of their lives.  While some had the top-up, and that posed a challenge, having HAP was a huge improvement.  It is a matter of streamlining the process and paying the rent from the date on which the tenancy starts, not from the date it is processed.

Do the witnesses have further figures relating to the impact of Covid on HAP tenancies?  I would be interested to know more about the increase in HAP tenancies during Covid-19 and the impact reduction of income has had on those tenants.  Obviously, extra supports have been made available to people who have lost income or had their income reduced as a result of Covid.  Has that assistance provided by the State been effective?<br\/><br\/>Mr. McCafferty noted that when the income of HAP tenants increases, their rent contribution increases too.  Does he find that that happens in practice?  My understanding is that it is not an automated process and it relies on people self-declaring an increase in their income.  Is that happening on the ground?  <br\/><br\/>Ms Stakem spoke about the wider housing problems.  I reiterate that all present are very much committed to resolving those wider issues.  We get that this is a piece of that puzzle.  Security of tenure, which she mentioned in terms of long-term leases, is critical not just for HAP tenants, but also for private tenancies and those availing of rent supplement.<br\/><br\/>I agree with many of the remarks of Ms O'Reilly around streamlining the process in terms of the application, as well as increasing it.  I also agree with her on the issue of paying rent from the day a rental agreement comes into effect.  She referred to a root-and-branch reform or review of the HAP system.  I am not hesitant to do that, but if we have recommendations that we believe would reap benefits, that is something we could look to pursue now, rather than wait until another report is prepared.  I believe that would be kicking the can down the road.  I am anxious to see what we can do currently to improve the situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020121500002#D00900","speaker":"1566","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607990400,"counter":445,"content":"<p>I will start off and then hand over to Ms Stakem.  I thank the Deputy for her questions.  She asked about discrimination.  It goes back to a point made by Senator Fitzpatrick.  We assist with representing tenants who face discrimination at the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.  The numbers are relatively low.  However, our experience is that tenants generally cannot hang around.  They need to be housed and if they are facing barriers, they will move to the next landlord to try to source accommodation.  We asked ourselves whether this is an issue that is raising its head.  Many of the tenants just need to move on.  It is only in certain circumstances, such as tenants having sourced housing elsewhere, that they have, if one likes, the \"luxury\" of pursuing such a course.<\/p> <p>  We welcome the increase in units.  The impact of Covid-19 on tenancies generally is the stuff of research really.  We will be seeking to carry out further research in the coming year because what we are seeing and what the ESRI indicated earlier this year is that the sectors in which renters work are those that have been disproportionately affected in terms of lay-offs and redundancies.  However, there has been a significant protective effect from the pandemic unemployment payment and access to rent supplement.  I am struck by the low take-up of rent supplement this year, given the circumstances.  I wonder why that is the case because a much more pragmatic approach was certainly taken in terms of the processing of applications and access to the supplement.<\/p> <p>  I wonder also about the issue of arrears.  There is a natural assumption that arrears are building, yet there is a low number of arrears coming through the new legislative system that is dealing with arrears.  There are several things to which we need to pay further attention.<\/p> <p>  I too would be interested to know what is triggering or not triggering those changes.  The principle of HAP is that it incentivises work and it should be responsive to changes in income and rents because there is a big issue facing the wider social housing sector and the local authority sector where local authorities are kind of hobbled by rent levels.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020121500002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John-Mark McCafferty"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607990400,"counter":446,"content":"<p>I will address the question in respect of the impact of Covid on HAP tenancies.

In approximately 90 of 350 cases reviewed, the tenant stated that had been an issue.  However, as Mr. McCafferty stated, not every tenant will take a case in such circumstances.  In some instances where we contacted the landlord or the agent and made them aware that they may not discriminate against a HAP tenant, the issue was resolved.  Only 11 cases were taken to the WRC but that is just the tip of the iceberg.  As Ms Stakem stated, it is the second most common complaint lodged to the WRC.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of a review of HAP, I understand the comments of Deputy Higgins.  None of us wishes to wait for another few months for another review to be done.  There is a significant amount of information available already.  It would be worthwhile to speak to the other stakeholders.  For example, one could speak to landlords to find out why they do not accept HAP.  We need to find out what they are thinking and what their reasoning is.  Many landlords will accept rent supplement but they will not accept HAP.  We do not know why that is the case.  There is a need to speak to the people working in local authority HAP offices.   I have spoken to them, as have committee members who previously served as councillors.  The staff of those offices encounter these issues and they see where the blocks and challenges are and why it takes so long to process payments.  From what I understand, it is a very paper-intensive process.  There are many things that probably could be freed up to make HAP work better.  It certainly can be an effective support, but those who are a bit more vulnerable and really need the payment are sometimes badly let down.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020121500002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Ann-Marie O'Reilly"},{"type":"speech","time":1607990400,"counter":448,"content":"<p>Ms O'Reilly referred to discrimination being an issue in 90 of the 350 cases reviewed.

It is very much based on delivery of a rights-based approach and it is always consistent.<\/p><p>I was a member of this committee for the previous four years.  The witnesses have also spent a lot of time analysing the problems.  I clearly hear the issues relating to the witnesses' capacity from Senator Fitzpatrick and Deputy &Oacute; Broin and having a bigger, wider and more comprehensive review.  That is what is clearly emerging.  It is not that anyone is questioning or doubting but when one is making a case politically for these sort of reforms, it always needs to be evidence-based.  I am of the view that HAP was temporary by nature.<\/p><p> I was very taken by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul's visitation programme.  I know there is less of this with Covid.  The society is meeting very vulnerable people.  The very fact that they are in the HAP programme and are seeking support and that some, though not all, of them are unemployed - a high percentage of them are employed - all boils down to affordability in terms of a home for oneself.  It is important that we acknowledge that and the witnesses' rights-based approach because it is really important.  <\/p><p> The witnesses touched on section 34 of the Residential Tenancies Act where a landlord is permitted to evict a tenant for the purposes of sale, refurbishment, owner use or change of use and the difficulties around that.  I was a councillor for many years.  When I finished up, particularly when HAP was being talked about more in the past few years, the lack of secure tenure came up.  This is one of the biggest problems with regard to why people do not want to be in HAP.  Can Ms O'Reilly tell us why landlords are resisting HAP?  There are reasons behind that.  Is it to do with bureaucracy and red tape?  Is it to do with issues around revenue?  Is the issue the fact that they are tying up their properties for too long?  Remember that an awful lot of people in this area are involved in investment accommodation.  They were there to make a buck.  Many of them have been stopped in their tracks.  I would like Ms O'Reilly to tease that out so that we get an understanding of the typical landlord and why he or she resists HAP.  I know that Threshold continues to advocate for the removal of no-fault evictions.  Could the witnesses elaborate on that?  <\/p><p> It goes back to the same old story.  There is the urgent need for real affordable rental housing where rent reflects the ability to pay.  That says it all in a nutshell.  That is the kernel of the problem.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin spoke about what the witnesses' ask was.  We are here and are policy makers.  What is the witnesses' ask?  It is really important for the witnesses to state their ask as concisely and clearly as possible.  I cannot thank both organisations enough because I have worked with both of them on the ground and know the importance of their work.  They are a real source of encouragement.  We are lucky to have these organisations advocating for people who need affordable homes.

I do not have the full answer.  A small number of them do not want their places inspected.  That might be something that would be put them off.  For a very small number, it could be the tax issue as well.  For possibly a wider group, it is that interaction with officialdom when heretofore things were a bit looser.  They might see an administrative burden.  Those are what I imagine some of the reasons might be.  They are not justifications in my mind but they are probably some of the reasons that might be cited.  Far be it from me to speak on behalf of landlords.<\/p> <p>  Regarding no-fault evictions, I named a number of areas.  Here is that delicate balance between the fact that it is a landlord's property and a tenant's home.  The legislation being deliberated on by this House is very much around looking at that in the context of a prolonged Covid period.  Clearly, it is that balance of rights, for example, if a family member needs to move into someone's house or a landlord is required to sell.  I know things have been really tightened up in terms of renovation.  If we go back three or four years ago, the renovation clause was used as a trigger for the end of a tenancy.  That legislation has been tightened substantially so that a landlord now has to do a very substantial job that involves complying with energy efficiency regulations to end a tenancy on those grounds.  No-fault evictions are dealt with in section 34(b) of the Act where at the end of a six-year period, the tenancy simply comes to an end.  I guess the reason we are talking this morning about security of tenure is because public policy frames HAP as a de facto social housing support yet it does not provide the same security of tenure.  We know that the private rental sector does not provide the same security of tenure generally.  When HAP is claimed as a social housing support, it is quite different in its look and feel from a tenure security point of view compared to local authority or approved housing body housing.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020121500002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John-Mark McCafferty"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607990400,"counter":455,"content":"<p>I will address landlords' reluctance to accept HAP.  I thank Senator Boyhan for his comments.  He referred to landlords possibly not wanting to be tied up in a tenancy.  There is a misunderstanding among landlords that they are expected to take on a HAP tenant for a minimum of two years.  That is not the case.  The tenant is expected to stay in a tenancy for a minimum of two years before looking for somewhere else or moving.  This is possibly to reduce the administrative burden on the HAP office.  If within six, eight, nine or 15 months, that landlord decides to end a tenancy because he or she is selling the property or his or her daughter is moving in, he or she can.  There is no obligation on him or her so there is a misconception out there.<\/p> <p>  As Mr. McCafferty said, there are other reasons.  I will check the figures I am providing to members of the committee.  When we rang landlords and agents and made them aware that they were breaching the equality regulation, many of them then accepted HAP so clearly those obstacles are not that much of an obstacle.

I know we discussed this previously.  This is a legacy issue from Part V.  While the intention of that device was to create communities where all types of people could live together, it failed during the recession.  Developers instead of local authorities were tasked with providing housing.  When they stopped building, no social housing was built.  Typically, the local authorities would build during recessions because it was cheaper.  This is has left us in the space in which we find ourselves.  HAP and other measures are filling that gap.  I think something close to &euro;700 million was spent each year, which could build quite a few houses.  I have said previously that the State should not be fuelling the private market, which is what it is doing.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin spoke about capping the rental market and how we fix that problem.

This is not an issue of the housing assistance payment, HAP, but of the protections in place for renters.  People who qualify for social housing are more vulnerable members of society because they are not able to meet their housing need as a result of affordability issues.  Being in the private rented sector adds another layer of stress, unaffordability and unpredictability.<\/p> <p>  I have a number of questions, some of which may have already been asked.  Perhaps the witnesses can come back to me on them.  What are the organisations' experiences of differential rates throughout the country?  Each local authority sets its own differential rents.  We have been expecting a national differential rents scheme.  How does that affect the operation of HAP throughout the country?  Are there any particular hotspots in which there are problems or issues with differential rents and HAP limits?<\/p> <p>  I am also interested in top-up payments and the impacts they have had on people who have been financially impacted by the Covid pandemic.  In the presentations, we saw that people are topping up by up to &euro;760 in Dublin and &euro;350 in Limerick and Cork.  I am dealing with somebody who is paying a top-up of approximately &euro;700 a month.  He has now run into rental arrears with his landlord.  He owes approximately &euro;5,000 and his landlord is threatening him with eviction.  He does not want to register with the Residential Tenancies Board as having financial difficulties.  He feels his top-up is very large and he is at risk of homelessness.  Have situations like this been coming up in the organisations' work?  How are they advising such people?  Have they been raising this issue?  The issue of people falling into arrears because of top-up payments is not being discussed.<\/p> <p>  As I have said, there are wider issues in the private rental sector.  I am glad to see the issue of standards addressed in the presentations.  I got a reply to a parliamentary question on the number of inspections by local authorities and it is extremely low and not only this year.  With regard to inspectors and follow-ups, how many inspections and follow-ups do the organisations see local authorities doing?

I know it is beyond the focus of HAP but the very different approaches different local authorities take to the differential rents scheme appear to be quite problematic.  This presents a barrier for people who want to move between local authority areas.<\/p> <p>  On top-up payments and the financial impact of Covid-19, as I was saying earlier, this issue requires further examination.  There has been some softening and unofficial arrangements made between landlords and tenants during this time.  When people were earning during the economic vibrancy that was present up to approximately ten months ago, they were highly geared in terms of their rent payments so that, if anything went wrong, they were left in a really difficult position.

Whether a person is on a small income or a big income, that is a sizeable difference.  Having the same policy across the State would make a lot more sense.<\/p> <p>  In respect of local authority inspections and follow-ups, Threshold has a proposal for a national car test-style system for housing.  The purpose of this is not only to get as many inspections done as possible but to allow local authorities to engage with landlords to bring properties up to standard where they do not meet minimum standards.  We could inspect 100% of properties and find that a given percentage does not meet the standards, but we need to allow for the next step as well.

However, as the rent increases came in each year, the tiny amount of income they had left evaporated and they were left in a situation where they could not pay for the bare necessities having already made tough sacrifices.

Two things need to happen.  If a person falls into arrears with their local authority or landlord as regards a top-up, the main mechanism must be about homeless prevention.  The rent should continue to be paid to the landlord.  The HAP payment should continue and a repayment plan set up between the tenant and the local authority so that the tenancy can continue.  That is really important and something we really need to see happen.  We have seen an increase, not only in HAP arrears but also in rent supplement arrears in the past couple of years in particular.  I think we will see that when we do our analysis after Covid, and it will also rise in January because of Covid.  There need to be more protections around rent arrears and support for tenants.  We have recommended the interim tenancies support sustainment protocol, similar to what is already in place for rent supplement, to be put in place for HAP.<\/p> <p>  We need to understand and investigate why landlords are not accepting HAP, considering that over 20% now rent in the private rented sector and that will continue to grow.  We must have a private rental sector that is fit for purpose and landlords who want to accept HAP and work with local authorities.<\/p> <p>  On the 20% uplift, there needs to be consistency among all local authorities about accepting and using the HAP and giving the 20% uplift.  Our research found that some tenants were able to receive it in previous tenancies and then were not accepted for the 20% uplift when they moved to a new tenancy, which caused great difficulties for them.  We could see no reason that was the case because, on paper, their circumstances had not changed and the new tenancy had the same rent.  We are not sure why it is happening and it needs to be examined and investigated.

There are two elements to them.  Practically the whole country is a rent pressure zone.  Landlords can only put up the rent by 4% except in very specific circumstances.  If the rent pressure zone legislation is working correctly, then increasing the HAP caps should not inflate prices in the market.  Maybe we need greater liaison between local authorities and the RTB where a rent review comes in to the local authority for a HAP property or a HAP property that had previously been on the books comes in under another tenancy and it is seen that the rent has increased beyond the 4%.  The local authority lets the landlord know that is not permissible, and if the landlord does not reduce it, the local authority may report it to the RTB.  The RTB now has powers to inspect and sanction landlords for such breaches.  We have that mechanism that would counteract any chance of increasing the caps and inflating the rents in the private market.<\/p> <p>  Alternatively, we could scrap the caps and let the market level itself out.  A cost-benefit analysis would be worthwhile on what impact removing the caps would have.  Threshold does not have the resources to undertake such an analysis but that is an alternative.

I see all the committee members are reacting to that, so it is clearly a common problem.  Has either organisation instigated or been party to equal status cases?  I am interested to know how that has been used or deployed.<\/p> <p>  That brings me to the second point.  I value the witnesses' views on the mechanism where a family member may be used as a reason for an eviction notice.<\/p><p>It has always struck me as establishing a hierarchy of tenants because if someone is a relative of a landlord he or she is more important as a tenant than someone who is not.  There is an inherent injustice in that.  That is not an issue where there is an abundance of accommodation but where there is not and where there is a challenge with accommodation, it is an issue.

If a relative is suddenly produced and if the landlord is compliant with the legislation, there is very little that can be done.  That is if there is indeed a relative, as defined in the legislation, who needs to be housed.  There is a delicate balance to be struck because in certain circumstances there might be a family member in need of a home.  We need to be very clear and acknowledge that, currently, the private rented sector does not have secure tenure relative to, say, social housing.  It is also less secure than owner occupation.  If people do not pay their mortgage there are steps and processes in place to deal with that.  Massive forbearance was, understandably, shown over the years of recession and there are very different timescales and so on in comparison to the non-payment of rent.  That goes to the crux of HAP because HAP is predicated on being a <i>de facto<\/i>form of social housing, although that is debatable when there are such factors at play which mean a people's tenure can end relatively quickly, through no fault of their own, by virtue of a relative needing to move in.  That might be a completely legitimate action but the implications for a family are huge because they could be facing having to live in emergency accommodation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020121500002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John-Mark McCafferty"},{"type":"speech","time":1607990400,"counter":471,"content":"<p>Would Ms O'Reilly care to comment on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020121500002#J00300","speaker":"1682"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607990400,"counter":472,"content":"<p>Of the notices of termination with which we assisted tenants last year, just over one third were issued on the grounds that the landlord intended to sell.

There is an element of having to take the landlord's word for it that there is a family member moving in and that there is a genuine need.  Some 70% of landlords own between one and three properties and they may have very well intended for a family member to move in down the line or in years to come.  A Bill was brought forward last year to limit which family members a landlord could use as grounds for eviction.  It is difficult and it is a tricky issue to tackle because of the nature of the rented sector we have in Ireland, where so many landlords are just once-off landlords.  While they have bought some property they may not really see themselves as housing providers.  In a way, HAP has turned people into housing providers who never intended to be.

I know from my constituency the work that is being done.  For me, housing is the single biggest issue we face.  I was a councillor for 11 years and now, as a Deputy, HAP just keeps coming up.  HAP meets some people's needs but from what I am hearing, and have been hearing for years, HAP does not meet the needs of the majority of people for a number of reasons.  A big issue at the moment is the difference between the HAP and the actual rent and so people have to top it up.  That is causing serious difficulties for people and families and, as the witnesses mentioned, is pushing people into arrears and further into poverty.  That goes back to putting a cap on rents to protect people from getting into rent arrears.  I checked this morning and a couple with three children get &euro;950 in HAP.  Even if they got the extra 20% there is no property in Cork - not one - they could rent.  They could not even rent a two-bedroom property for the money HAP gives them.  That goes back to the points made earlier.  There might have been some softening of the market in Dublin but for Cork, which I represent, the situation is worse.  Covid-19 has highlighted how the housing crisis is getting worse.  The witnesses know that because they are on the front line and are talking to people about these issues.<\/p> <p>  I come from social housing, from Knocknaheeny.  My family came from Gurranabraher and my mother came from Curraheen, which were all big social housing estates in Cork.  People want that kind of security of tenure.  They want to be able to build a home and they cannot do that in a HAP property because of the way HAP is designed.  I am just looking to get some of the witnesses' thoughts on that.  I will make two points.  Vulnerable people and families are most affected by HAP.  As Deputy &Oacute; Broin asked earlier, what can we do to help them and to help the witnesses' organisations deliver for these people?  I propose that we write to the Minister looking for a full review of HAP because from listening to the contributions this morning that is urgently needed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020121500002#J00500","speaker":"1453"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607990400,"counter":474,"content":"<p>I am conscious that Senator Moynihan asked about overcrowding and I will go back to that question if I may.

Such people are quite hard to reach by services like ours.  They may not know we exist and may be part of migrant groups.  There is a challenge there for all of us, both statutory and voluntary organisations, as regards how we reach those groups, how we promote our services and get the message across that there are supports and services available.<\/p> <p>  To respond to Deputy Gould's questions, the report exposed in a very sharp way some of the top-ups people have to pay on HAP and the impact that has on their income, leading to either a possible eviction or people going without other things.

I also acknowledge how difficult it is to balance those two things.<\/p> <p>  There is a commitment in the programme for Government to reduce the reliance on HAP but, equally, we have a commitment to ensure that HAP and rent supplement levels are at an adequate level to support housing needs.  That is the crux of the issue.  We want to continue to use this source of housing as a way of providing much-needed housing to people.  We know, however, that changes need to be made.  The statistic of 75% of people being happy with HAP in many ways shows how dysfunctional the current system is in that people are happy in tenancies that are subsidised by the State to a massive extent and which last only 12 months.  That says a lot about where we are.  Equally, however, we have spent, according to the figure I have, &euro;422 million as of December 2019.  There is &euro;422 million being spent on 50,000 tenancies, involving more than 30,000 landlords, and instead of having a crack team of public procurement experts ensuring we have value for money, we have 50,000 of the most vulnerable people in the State negotiating that spend with individual landlords.  All the social elements aside, and I do not wish to undermine any of the contributions made so far, the public procurement issues with this alone and the value for money for the State are an indictment.  Some of this has been because rent supplement was the absence of a policy, but the failure to embed the rental accommodation scheme, as opposed to the housing assistance payment, in 2014 was a real failure to provide security of tenure, which I think the RAS provides.  It also embeds the local authority as a procurer of the service rather than a bystander.<\/p> <p>  In the time the witnesses have available, could they talk about any experience they have had with the rental accommodation scheme and the way in which different local authorities manage security of tenure?  I know that in Dublin city a RAS exit list comes on top of any other allocation, and that provides good security in general if not to the specific home.  Furthermore, do the witnesses have ideas as to how the State might move towards using its dominance in the market?  I think one third of all tenancies are supported.  We are doing the exact opposite.  We are not taking any benefit.  Could that dominance in the market and our size in procuring from landlords be a better way of managing value for money rather than an arbitrary cap?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020121500002#K00300","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607990400,"counter":479,"content":"<p>In Threshold we do not have many people coming to us who have RAS tenancies.  I am not sure how many RAS tenancies there are but it is certainly not to the scale of HAP.  I would have to look to be sure.  I think that when issues with RAS arise there is good engagement with the local authority to resolve them.  That is where the tenant on RAS is viewed as a different type of tenant from the HAP tenant, who is very much in the private rented market.  As the Deputy said, they have to negotiate with the landlord directly, so having the local authority involved in the RAS tenancy certainly creates an extra level of security and that little bit of support, perhaps, when it is needed.  We all may need at different times in our lives that little bit of extra support, and for HAP tenants that is not really there unless they know of the likes of Threshold or the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and come and ask for the assistance.<\/p> <p>  As to how the State could use its dominance in the market, I have been giving quite a bit of consideration to that.  Despite the fact the State is paying the rent on one third of properties, as Deputy McAuliffe said, and I presume that includes rent supplement and RAS, the landlords seem to hold all the cards.  Perhaps we could stop some of the churn through the market, with tenants receiving notices of termination, whether for sale, refurbishment or whatever else, and having to move on to the next place and another tenant quite possibly moving into that home after the first tenant perhaps a month or a few months later.  This means tenants are constantly on the back foot and constantly having to look for properties, so the landlords can dictate terms and set the agenda.  It also means the State, as the body that pays that rent, is also on the back foot.  Improving security of tenure is one way of changing that and giving a little bit of the power back to the tenant and the State, as the body that pays the rent, by imposing strict caps on rents and effective solutions in the medium or long term.  The moratorium on evictions this year certainly helped rejig the playing field to a degree.  Such interventions can help but they need to be made with the larger scale provision of affordable housing options as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020121500002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Ann-Marie O'Reilly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607990400,"counter":480,"content":"<p>In the Society of St. Vincent de Paul we do not generally get a lot of queries about RAS.

If there are any difficulties with rent arrears, the local authority should take a more proactive approach and its first port of call should be to keep those tenants in those tenancies.  That not only saves the tenant much stress and worry but also saves the State a lot of money because the next port for the person concerned or for the whole household could be emergency accommodation.

We really appreciate it.  I will take it from where my colleague, Deputy McAuliffe, left off.  He is right in what he said, and the witnesses' answers have probably given the response to the question he has posed in that they do not get people coming to them with issues with RAS because there is security of tenure there.  That should perhaps be fed into the review.  As we are here to discuss HAP, however, I will stick to that for the time being.<\/p> <p>  There is sometimes simplistic commentary to the effect that we should abolish HAP and pour all the money into building houses.  That is a fine aspiration, but the question is never asked, what happens to our existing tenants in HAP tenancies?  We cannot just forget about the fact that 60,000 people are in receipt of HAP.  Mr. McCafferty said this will be a medium-term solution.

One of the things that was cited was what one of the witnesses had cited regarding single person tenancies.  In Waterford, when those rent caps were set, it was a very different housing market from the market we have now which, thankfully, is thriving.  There is a limit of &euro;430, and with the addition of 20% it is &euro;516.  A person would not rent a one-bed tenancy in Waterford for anything less than &euro;750 per month.  While that rent may seem small to a tenant renting in Dublin, it is all relative.  What they asked for was a 40% discretionary.  I am torn on the issue of increasing the limits.  Despite what Ms O'Reilly said, namely, that because of the rent pressure zones, we should not see an increase, I believe we will see an increase, and that is the reality.  I would agree with what they asked for, which is a higher percentage on the discretionary and that it would be utilised on an individual basis.  Rather than increasing it for all the tenancies, because, for example, a family with a three-bed property in Cork need might need a higher increase than a single person in Waterford, if the discretion were given to the local authorities to vary it further than 20%, is that something that should occur and should it be fed into the review?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020121500002#K00700","speaker":"1647","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607990400,"counter":484,"content":"<p>The Senator is absolutely right.

I guess for whatever reasons, RAS is less of a thing than HAP.<\/p> <p>  I also want to respond to Deputy McAuliffe.  The public procurement element is key.  That is at the crux of the matter.  Many individuals are trying to negotiate procurement on rents.  In terms of tenancy protection, the service Threshold provides is our way across the stay of assisting tenants who are in arrears and disputes.  We are not saying in any way that HAP should be disbanded.  Rather we are saying let us review it.  It has been a step change in how we put resources back in a tenant-landlord relationship to procure and access housing and have families remain in housing, even when a family's income is increasing, which removes some of the poverty traps.<\/p> <p>  We run a similar service to place finder in Cork through our access housing unit.  It was very welcome to see place finder services rolled out in 2017.  The challenge for them, like Housing First, is the supply of private rented accommodation and social rented accommodation.  That is the crux of the issue.  Thankfully, it is beginning to come on stream, but that is from a relatively low baseline.  With the larger local authorities and the bigger approved housing bodies, we are seeing a level of volume, and that is to be welcomed.

If anything, it is more the other way in that locality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020121500002#L01700","nonspeaker":"Mr. John-Mark McCafferty"},{"type":"speech","time":1607990400,"counter":500,"content":"<p>I accept the majority would want that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020121500002#L01800","speaker":"1647"},{"type":"speech","time":1607990400,"counter":501,"content":"<p>I wish to ask the witnesses about standards and inspections, which we touched on earlier.  Where a new private property enters into the local authority under HAP, the local authority will inspect that property before taking it on, but for properties that have been in the system for quite some time, the inspection rate is probably not as rigorous.  Is that why we see residents&rsquo; dwellings falling into disrepair?  Are there enough resources put into that aspect to ensure dwellings that have been long-term in the system under HAP or the local authority payments are being maintained properly?  It probably also feeds into the earlier question on where a relative being moved in is a cause for eviction.  Are there the resources in place to check that the person who has moved in is a relative?  How often is that done?  Are there enough resources at local authority level to manage those two aspects?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020121500002#L01900","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607990400,"counter":502,"content":"<p>There are a couple of issues.  There has been a ramping up of resources with regard to local authority inspections, but that is from a very low baseline.  They have gone for a risk-based approach.  They are going for the more obvious places, the more obvious postcodes in Dublin or neighbourhoods in the cities, where they believe they will identify less compliant dwellings, but it is a lower inspection regime than certainly we would like.<\/p> <p>  What is probably underpinning this as well as resources to pay for that service is the consideration of supply.  Unfortunately, because supply is still very constrained in the private rented sector, probably a pragmatic approach is being taken at local authority level to the effect that they know many of these properties are quite low quality.  However, they are at least houses or apartments that are in the market rather than not being in it.  There is that type of pragmatic trade-off.  With the longer term rentals, there is a legacy of mostly houses and some apartments that are of lower quality.  That continues to be the trade-off, even when we talk about wider energy efficiency considerations.  We are balancing off higher quality dwellings for everyone with the threat of landlords leaving the market.  It is not a justification for a landlord leaving the market but it is certainly a consideration.  The RTB has, as Ms O'Reilly mentioned, more resources and more legislative clout to inspect and impose sanctions.  The Chairman asked a good question regarding to what extent there is a revisiting of those cases where family members moving in has been cited.  I do not know if Ms Stakem or Ms O'Reilly have any insights on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020121500002#L02000","nonspeaker":"Mr. John-Mark McCafferty"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607990400,"counter":503,"content":"<p>I believe that the RTB has been doing some work checking notices for sales to see if those properties were eventually sold.  As to whether it is doing the same in terms of checking where a family member moves in, I am not so sure.<\/p><p>I do not know if it will become an established part of its ongoing work.  As it stands, it is very much up to the tenant to police what is going on.  It is up to the tenant to keep an eye on the old property he or she was in to see if a family member moved in or if it was rented to somebody else.  If someone sees that occurring, he or she can lodge a dispute or notify the inspection team in the RTB.  Unfortunately, by the time a person packs up, gets somewhere else, moves house and settles down again, he or she is not bothering with that.  I do not think there are any established mechanisms for undertaking that follow-up.<\/p><p> In respect of the resources to inspect private rented housing, there has been an increase in resources, in particular in the past two to three years, and a move to establish specialist inspection teams in some of the local authorities.  I spoke to some of the staff responsible for that across a number of local authorities.  Some local authorities are far more experienced than others.  Not only do they need the resources to carry out the inspections, but they need the resources to continue to engage with the landlord and to get the landlord to bring the property up to standard.  That requires a certain skill set, apart from just knowing what the minimum standards are.  There are instances where the landlord does not have the finances to upgrade the property and, in such cases, perhaps they could be steered into the repair and lease scheme.  More money has been put into this area in recent years, but we have a proposal whereby we believe a greater structure could be put in place to get the properties brought up to standard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020121500002#L02200","nonspeaker":"Ms Ann-Marie O'Reilly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607990400,"counter":505,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for the presentation.  I have listened to the speakers.  I am living in County Limerick very near the Cork border and there is no affordable housing in the area.  I am a father of four and recently I became a grandfather.  We went into the property market to look for a house for my son, his partner and my grandchild.  I have a very good knowledge of County Limerick.  There were no suitable properties to rent.  There was some rental accommodation that I would not put anyone into because it was in such a poor state, yet the rent being sought for those inhabitable properties was outrageous.  The first question asked was whether the prospective tenant was on HAP.  The HAP payment in Cork is higher than the HAP payment in Limerick.  It was suggested that the family should move to Cork, but there are no properties.  Recently, social housing has been developed in Kilmallock and Hospital but the council has reached the maximum of social housing that can be provided.  There are 24 people for each of the houses that are being built at the moment.  The list of people trying to get into good properties is endless.<\/p> <p>  We have many good landlords and a lot of very good tenants.  We have a minority of bad landlords and a minority of bad tenants.  What Covid has shown us is that all the funding is going into cities where there is accessibility to sewerage capacity to build social housing.  The council wanted to build 25 units of housing in Hospital, but it only had capacity for 15.  A private sewerage system had to be put into each of the remaining houses it wanted to build, in the hope that the sewerage system would be updated.  Askeaton is waiting for a sewerage system for 30 years.  Kilmallock recently got a sewerage system, so now it can expand.  Croom is expanding and a lot of housing is due to be built.  People cannot build in any of areas where they want to live in towns and villages or in the countryside because there is no infrastructure.  That is a major problem for people like me who are from the country, and please God I always will be.  People call us culchies.  I am happy to be there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020121500002#M00200","speaker":"1499"},{"type":"speech","time":1607990400,"counter":506,"content":"<p>We are all from the country originally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020121500002#M00300","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1607990400,"counter":507,"content":"<p>Exactly.<\/p> <p>  The new 2040 plan will make it harder again, as it is forcing people into certain settings.  HAP is not our biggest problem.  I deal with MABS on a daily basis.  Our problem is that we do not have properties.  We do not have the infrastructure to build properties.  Derelict properties in towns and villages are on the sewerage system but it is too expensive to renovate them because the regulations are too extensive.  It depends on what town they are in.  The properties are left derelict and they are not being renovated but they are being taken into account in working out the capacity of the sewerage system in the context of building new houses.  In one area, one might have 21 derelict properties that could be invested in.  The infrastructure is there and they are on the system.  We must get people back into towns and villages.  We must get people into derelict properties.  Funding must be allocated.  We need to relax the restrictions.  Iconic buildings should be retained, and the streetscape maintained but houses should be built in towns and villages where we currently have infrastructure.  Otherwise, people in County Limerick will not get to live in a house near their area because there is no infrastructure.  All the infrastructure seems to be put into the cities.  HAP is not the issue: infrastructure is the issue.

The one fact that has not been mentioned is the number of rental properties being lost to the market every year.  According to the RTB, since January 2017 to September this year we have lost 20,000 rental units.  That is the single biggest loss of rental units in three decades, which obviously means there is additional pressure on the system.  According to Dublin City Council, we have only had 900 short-term lets come into long-term letting, so we have not seen a significant move there.  The Government has a target of another 15,000 HAP tenancies next year.<\/p> <p>  I have never heard anyone say that HAP or rental subsidies should be abolished.  One could not do that to the 100,000 families depending on them.  The concern is that Government policy views them as long-term social housing support and the total number is increasing every year.  That means the bill will forever increase, rather than seeing rental subsidies as, for the most part, temporary, while people are waiting for secure accommodation.  That is a concern because if the kinds of changes many of us from all sides and the witnesses are discussing are not made, next year will be much more difficult than this year for all the reasons that we know.<\/p> <p>  I do not have a question, but I support Deputy Gould's request that the committee should write to the Minister and call for a short time-bound review.  Perhaps the Housing Agency would be best placed to do it.  All of the issues that have been raised here could be considered.  I do not think anybody is saying the system is perfect and that it could not benefit from change.  I second Deputy Gould's proposal.  It would be at least one practical outcome from today for us to request the Minister to ask the Housing Agency to do a report and perhaps to send a transcript of the exchange of the committee to inform the work of the Housing Agency in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020121500002#M00600","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1607990400,"counter":510,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCafferty, Ms Stakem and Ms O'Reilly for their attendance this morning.  It has been most helpful and informative for us and I have some takeaways from what they said.<\/p> <p>  I note that Deputy &Oacute; Broin has seconded Deputy Gould's proposal that while HAP is here for the medium term it needs a full review.  Some partial work has been done on it, but there has not been the capability to do a full review.  We will request the Department to review and assess the HAP.  That makes perfect sense.  It is the provision at the moment.<\/p> <p>  I have noted a number of issues that were raised regarding HAP.<\/p><p>The streamlining of that process and the administration that goes with it needs to be addressed and hopefully it can be in the review.  On the security of tenure issue, the point was made about constant changing and constant turnover of tenancy, the backlog and the stress that creates for people who are constantly moving home and not knowing when their tenancy is going to end.  It has one of the worst impacts on people's stress, quality of life and their children.  Everybody is aware of that and it is definitely something we need to look at.  The discretion variability, which I think Senator Cummins raised, is an important point.  Flexibility should be given so that people are not constrained when dealing with different aspects of different tenancies and with their differing needs at various stages in their life.  <\/p><p> One thing I heard today about which I am concerned is that rental supports are not being taken up. I believe Ms Stakem raised that point.  This is something we need to address in order that we are not looking at severe arrears in six to 12 months' time or that is has a real impact on the quality of people's life in other areas because they are trying to meet rent when there is rental support available but they are not availing of it.  <\/p><p> Unfortunately, we must finish now because of Covid restrictions, which means we have to finish on the hour at 1 p.m.  The meeting stands adjourned until 9 a.m. on Thursday, 14 January 2021.
