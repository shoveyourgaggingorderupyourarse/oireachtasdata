I am joined by Ms Gr&aacute;inne McEvoy, director of consumer protection at the Central Bank.  We very much welcome the opportunity to appear before the committee today and discuss banking matters and hear the committee members&rsquo; views on the sector.<\/p> <p>  I would like to address the committee&rsquo;s invitation to discuss the NatWest strategic review of Ulster Bank&rsquo;s future direction.  In order for us to supervise effectively and for connected legal prohibition reasons we are not able to publicly discuss our engagement with individual firms on confidential matters.  In the same vein, it would be inappropriate for us to appear at a hearing with a regulated firm.  This is why we respectfully declined the request to attend last week's meeting.  We indicated in our response that we remained available, as always, to the committee on all matters relating to our mandate.  We take our engagement with this committee and our accountability to the Oireachtas very seriously.  Such engagement is one of several ways in which we demonstrate accountability for the work we undertake in safeguarding monetary and financial stability, and working to ensure that the financial system operates in the best interests of consumers and the wider economy.  We would welcome the opportunity to discuss further how we can improve our engagement with the committee such that we can help support it in meeting its objectives.<\/p> <p>  I will now briefly outline some of our current areas of focus in respect of the retail banks in Ireland, with households, businesses and the wider community as a whole to the forefront of our minds.  Much of the Central Bank's focus this year has been on mitigating the unprecedented impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.  The Central Bank's intertwined responsibilities of consumer protection, monetary policy, prudential regulation, payments and so on have strong interconnections with each other.  This positions us well to understand and mitigate the effects of the pandemic through monetary policy, macro prudential tools and supervision. <\/p> <p>  A key priority for us is that there are suitable supports in place to help borrowers affected by income shocks caused by the pandemic and that lenders continue to seek to sustainably resolve borrowers' longer term distress.  We have made our expectations clear on how borrowers should be treated and how lenders should engage constructively with distressed borrowers to ensure appropriate and tailored solutions to borrowers' circumstances are put in place.  We expect all lenders to have appropriate strategies, the necessary financial and operational resources and a suite of appropriate sustainable solutions to resolve distressed debt, whether it arose before or as a result of the pandemic.  We are also continuing to engage with a range of stakeholders on this issue and have been listening closely to borrower representatives such that our work continues to evolve.<\/p> <p>  The culture of firms is important in delivering our aspiration of a financial system that sustainably serves the needs of the economy and its consumers.  The failures of the past decade or so, notably relating to the tracker mortgage scandal, demonstrate this importance and also highlight that more progress is required.  We expect to see boards taking responsibility for the culture of their firms, overseeing product development and usage, actively promoting diversity and inclusion at all levels to improve decision-making and ensuring that robust internal systems are in place to drive effective cultures, including well-developed risk management frameworks.  Where this does not occur, we will take appropriate supervisory action.  Where serious or egregious breaches occur, we take enforcement action.  We are also seeking to strengthen the regulatory framework.  We are currently working with the Department of Finance to progress the individual accountability framework.  This seeks, among other things, to enhance the accountability of senior individuals in banks.<\/p> <p>  For the consumer and the taxpayer, safeguarding financial stability is one of the most important ways in which the Central Bank works to protect their interests, including seeking to ensure that the banking system operates in a safe, sound and sustainable way.  Banks need to be in a position to absorb shocks and have the ability to build buffers to withstand future shocks in order that they can serve the economy and consumers over the long-term.  The Irish banking system entered this crisis with substantial buffers of loss absorbing capital and considerably more robust business models, less risky loan books and better operational resilience than compared with the situation before the global financial crisis.  This ensured that they have been better able to continue to support their customers and the real economy through the pandemic.<\/p> <p>  The shift to digitally enabled services within the retail banks is already profound and is accelerating, including due to the behavioural changes arising from the pandemic.  As we look to the future of the retail banking sector, we see a rapidly changing landscape.  During the pandemic we have seen changes in consumer behaviour around use of cash, including significant increases in online transactions.  This acceleration of existing global trends is connected with consumers moving away from using banks in a number of ways.  Challenger firms, for example, providing payments services, often specialise in one service meaning they can be more agile and responsive to customer needs in that area. This is putting increasing pressure on banks to improve their digital offerings and change their approach to engaging with their customers.  While there are many benefits to this development for many people, it does increase the risk of financial exclusion, for example, due to age or income factors.<\/p> <p>  We recognise the importance of the credit union sector in this regard, with its wide network of community-focused and highly trusted co-operatives.  Irrespective of how retail banks choose to serve their customers they must, at a minimum, meet the standards we have in place for protecting consumers.  While decisions about the provision of services and branch networks are commercial matters for individual institutions, we have clear expectations on the need to take a consumer-focused approach.  The consumer protection code sets out the requirements on firms to ensure clear, timely communications with customers regarding any such permanent changes to a bank&rsquo;s branch network and to have alternative channels available to consumers to avail of banking services.<\/p> <p>  In the event that a regulated entity intends to withdraw from the Irish market, the withdrawal must be undertaken in accordance with the provisions of Irish financial services legislation, including the Central Bank's statutory codes of conduct.  Where a loan is sold or transferred, the protections that were available to borrowers prior to the transaction continue to be in place with the new loan owner.  This ensures that borrowers whose loans are sold or transferred maintain the same regulatory protections, including under the various Central Bank's statutory codes of conduct, such as the consumer protection code and the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.<\/p><p> There are, of course, many other issues relevant to the Irish banks.  We have also been continuing to work to mitigate the risks posed to the economy, consumers and the wider financial system of the UK&rsquo;s departure from the EU.  Brexit has already led to a significant growth in the size of the internationally focused banking sector in Ireland.  Going forward, we will be increasing our work on climate change, which is relevant to all banks operating in Ireland.  I look forward to our discussion on these and other important issues and developments relating to the banking sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020121500002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ed Sibley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607990400,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Sibley for his presentation and, more importantly, his responses to the queries raised previously.  There are two matters I would like to address separately, the first of which picks up on the issue we discussed at the previous meeting and Mr. Sibley's correspondence in regard to Brexit and its impact on the Irish financial system.  Mr. Sibley referred to significant growth and mentioned that the issuing of banking licences or the reallocation of staff is not necessarily the best indicator in that regard.  Is it possible to get a breakdown of the areas within banking or the business models in respect of which we are seeing that growth?  For example, is it focused in one particular area or is it spread evenly?  Which spreads are more important?  Mr. Sibley also referred to the strategy to avoid empty-shell policy on the part of banks.  Can he provide a little more detail on that?  I will refer to the second matter following Mr. Sibley's responses to those questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020121500002#B00200","speaker":"1473"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607990400,"counter":9,"content":"<p>The change in the banking landscape is primarily focused on international activity and investment banking-type activity rather than on retail banking or Irish customers.  Brexit has necessitated that the banks operating out of the UK and providing services into the EU across a range of areas, be that corporate lending, investment banking, transaction services and so on, need to locate in EU countries.  As a result, here was a movement of part of the banking services from London to Dublin, Frankfurt, Paris and Amsterdam.<\/p> <p>  On the second aspect of the Deputy's question, we seek to ensure that the hearts and minds of the organisation are operating out of Dublin.  If they are authorised here, they need to have boards, strong management capability and effective risk management here.  We recognise that they are interconnected.  They are typically part of wider international groups so there is a reliance on other parts of those groups for the provision of services such as, for example, those relating to IT.  There has been a transition process for capability to move from London to other parts of the EU.  Some of that transition has been slowed by the pandemic but we continue to expect that there will be hearts and minds here.  I would add that we operate very much as part of the Single Supervisory Mechanism.  We are party to the European approach to banking supervision and there is a strong degree of consistency regarding how we expect entities to operate.  We expect firms to operate in Dublin as they would be expected to operate in other parts of the eurozone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020121500002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ed Sibley"},{"type":"speech","time":1607990400,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Sibley for his responses.  Before I move to my second substantive point, can he tell me, in the context of growth, if there are entities from certain jurisdictions whereby it is recognisable that there is a particular emphasis?  That feeds into my wider question, which is not necessarily Brexit-related but which relates, rather, to resilience and banking provision in the State as much for the consumer as for employees.  I know there are specific cases Mr. Sibley will not go into and I do not expect him to do so.  However, I would welcome the general opinion of the Central Bank on how well the banking system in this State is currently operated and serviced for consumers in terms of it being a viable market for other markets.  Is there any concern that, perhaps, it is over-dominated by certain institutions or, more worryingly, that certain entities looking at the model in Ireland are concerned that it could force them to make decisions in the coming 12 months or so which would have major consequences?  If so, what role is the Central Bank playing in that regard?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020121500002#B00400","speaker":"1473"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607990400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>As I understand the question, it relates to the banks that are serving the economy, businesses and consumers here rather than those that are coming to Ireland as a result of Brexit.  By international and European standards, the Irish retail banking market is somewhat concentrated.  It is more concentrated than in other jurisdictions in terms of the level of competition in the market.  There are definitely more competitive banking markets.  That said, we have seen more competition across and between the Irish banks over the past few years.  We are seeing some degree of competition coming in from outside, either from other banks or from other types of more specialist financial services providers.  In addition, the retail banking market is, from an SME perspective, even more concentrated.  There are primarily three banks that are providing services to SMEs of any real scale within Ireland.  The other two provide some such services but not of particular scale.  That potentially is an even more concentrated market.<\/p> <p>  In terms of our role if a firm decides to leave, in the system we operate we expect firms to be able to enter the market and, also, exit the market.  If they are to exit, it is important that they do so in an orderly fashion and without too much risk of externalities or cost to the taxpayer or the State.  Whenever there is a significant business change for a large institution, we would engage extensively with that firm about the approach it is taking to that change and how the risks associated with the change would be managed.  We do have particular requirements under the consumer protection code in terms of engagement which, my colleague, Ms McEvoy, will provide a little more detail on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020121500002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ed Sibley"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607990400,"counter":12,"content":"<p>First and foremost, our expectation is that firms adopt a consumer-focused approach in terms of their engagement and their interaction and that all communications are clear and transparent to the customer regarding the actions they are taking.

The tracker mortgage examination has taken up a large part of this committee's work in previous years.  Unfortunately, we have not concluded with it.  These are statements I would have made to the Central Bank when it issued its final report in July 2019.  I know the Chairman was also very vocal in saying that there were outstanding cases.  When the Central Bank closed off on the tracker mortgage examination in July 2019, its final report outlined that 40,100 customers were affected with &euro;683 million paid out by lenders.  A total of 99 family homes and 216 buy-to-let units were lost.  A number of months roll on and what happens?  AIB had to pay out millions of euro to 5,900 other victims when it had to announce in April that it also denied these individuals tracker mortgages, following a single case taken to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman which upheld the finding.<\/p> <p>  We talk about cohorts of people in different types of contracts.  Nearly 6,000 people in this type of contract were missed by the Central Bank.  Claims that were being made went through the independent process with AIB and were refused.  The Central Bank oversaw that and signed off a final report stating that it was done and dusted, although it was going to continue to monitor the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.  That does not absolve it from its responsibilities, in terms of the consumer protection role that the Oireachtas has given the Central Bank.  In the middle of such a serious examination how could it miss that nearly 6,000 customers were also denied and wrongly impacted by AIB over their tracker mortgages?<\/p> <p>  If that were not good enough, three months later, in July last, AIB announced that there were another 1,000 victims of the tracker mortgage scandal, again as a result of an examination following a complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.  Each of those affected through EBS and Haven, which are subsidiaries of AIB, were paid approximately &euro;6,000.  The earlier group of 6,000 victims were offered &euro;1,650.  We discussed this at the previous committee.  Members of the previous committee said that these people were entitled to a tracker mortgage and the &euro;1,650 did not deal with the issue.  I am baffled that the Central Bank continued to miss this, despite warnings from me and other committee members and from advocates arguing for it.<\/p> <p>  How did the Central Bank miss seeing that one bank had more than 7,000 additional victims of the tracker mortgage scandal, which the Central Bank, when it signed off on the report in July 2019, believed did not exist?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020121500002#C00200","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607990400,"counter":17,"content":"<p>We are deeply concerned by what happened with the tracker mortgage scandal and we have done a considerable amount of work to try to rectify the situation.

That includes access to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman which ultimately ruled in their favour, as the Deputy rightly cited.<\/p> <p>  It is important to reiterate Mr. Sibley's point that while the supervisory phase of our work had concluded last year, we continued and still continue to monitor the decisions in appeals out of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman and, ultimately, if any of those cases are escalated to the courts system in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Almost all - more than 99% - of the redress and compensation has been paid, amounting to &euro;710 million paid to 40,500 customers.

Promontoria then said that it does not do that type of arrangement and would not do anything that Ulster Bank was offering.  It called in the full loan on 23 October 2020, and has since issued a repossession order, asking the family of two adults and three teenagers to vacate their family home in the mouth of Christmas, before 21 December.<\/p><p> We hear from the Central Bank all the time that the same regulations and oversight apply to vulture funds as to main street banks.

Part of it is a factor of the crisis we had.  We still have the legacy of that crisis today.  It is evident that mortgage lending in Ireland has historically been riskier.  That results in banks having to hold more capital relative to that lending, which also has an influence on price.  We are comparing averages, but there are significant differences in different markets around the eurozone, including length of mortgage lending, for example, and having longer-term fixed rate mortgages in some jurisdictions and, atypically, non-interest costs in some jurisdictions.  There are multiple reasons for the differences, but competition is evidently part of the reason that banks can charge higher interest rates in Ireland than those in other countries.<\/p> <p>  What we have done is to seek to address some of the fundamental issues affecting the functioning of the mortgage market, including trying to address the longer term mortgage arrears and trying to put in place a more resilient system, with business models as well as macroprudential rules to enhance the resilience of borrowers.

I, like others in this room, have been critical of the Central Bank over a long period in the past.  This is not personal and I do not want any of the witnesses to take it as personal, but there are issues which public representatives have had to face which were unusual, to say the least.  They still continue.  To put it in the vernacular, the banking system in this country still punishes borrowers above and beyond other borrowers across Europe for something they did wrong during the crash, and I will come to that momentarily, or for something they are about to do wrong on the basis that they are a higher risk than those elsewhere.<\/p> <p>  There is no such thing as risk-free lending anywhere in the world.  It does not exist.  However, we were led to believe during and immediately after the financial crash that it should have been risk free.  It is not, never can be and never will be, nor should it be.  That is why there is speculation in markets and so forth.  I also realise, like everybody here, that we must have a stable banking system.  That is fundamental to an open economy, and we must be sure there are good practices that protect the economy and protect the consumer.  Reference has been made to this at length.<\/p> <p>  One of the problems I and all of us have faced is sitting down across a table from the representatives of banks which had lent money to borrowers, knowing they should not have done so.  They knew it was impossible to meet the demand at a later stage but, clearly, they were of the mind that it would be all right because there was an inflationary situation and property prices would exceed all expectations.  What in God's name was going on at that stage?  Nobody would think like that and presume that it was going to continue.  It could not happen.  I am sure you, Chairman, other members of the committee and I advised countless people that under no circumstances should they borrow in the way that was being suggested to them.  Obviously, people did not always take that advice.  It was harsh advice at the time, and they saw people like us as impeding them and their progress.  In the long run, we were speaking for their well-being.  To outline what happened, no worthwhile regulations were applied at that time.  Hence, the full extent of the problem.<\/p> <p>  What happened next was worse.  The banks retrospectively applied good conduct on borrowing after the event.  It was the most amazing performance.  When the horse was well and truly bolted and galloping down the far end of the track, suddenly the banks said they were going to apply good banking practice and good regulations on the borrower, who had already borrowed far in excess of what his or her capability of repayment could and should be.  On the one hand, there must be good confidence in the banking system, but on the other we must restore public confidence where the consumer is concerned.<\/p> <p>  There has been reference to the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  That has been quoted to me several times.  The code of conduct benefits the bank over the borrower to a great extent.  The bank tells the borrower his or her borrowings are unsustainable and, as a result, this is how we must proceed.  The limit is that it repossesses the property.  It might take a while, but the bank will repossess it.  It will pile on interest and so forth, in many cases piling on the interest with no regard to what it is doing to people, to such an extent that there is no other way out except to liquidate the debt and repossess the property.  I will not go into the emotional situation of the thousands of people who found themselves in the extraordinarily sad position of having lost or losing their homes.  That was on the cards for perhaps six months or a year or whatever the case may be.  It is still happening.<\/p> <p>  Does the Central Bank have the power to impose on what are now regarded as vulture funds some type of recognition for the fact that they acquired the loan books at a knock-down rate in many situations, with a discount of 30%, 40%, 50%, 60% and up to 80% in some cases?  Of course, the borrower never knows what the full discount was, but the borrower must pay for it.  The borrowers are now falling into what is known as distressed debt, because they have not been able to repay or discharge the loan.  That is because they were never going to be able to repay it.  It was not possible from the outset.  The unfortunate borrowers include business borrowers and the businesses involved, who gave personal guarantees in respect of their households and so forth.  They ended up in tragedy.  I and everybody else in the committee have sat in front of vulture fund representatives while men and women cried openly, sought mercy and got none.  That is a very sad thing with which to conclude.  However, that is the way it happened.<\/p> <p>  All the time, members of the committee were tabling parliamentary questions.  We could not ask too many questions in case we would cause a flight of funds, and we could not ask too many pointed questions.  We asked questions as to whether the banking system and the economy were based on sound economic fundamentals.  As to the number of times we tabled those questions, I sometimes dream about them.  The reply was \"Yes\", they were.  In fact, it was \"No\", they were not.  However, nobody recognised what we were trying to say at the time.  Nobody cared.  There were financial regulators, ombudsmen and the Central Bank.  That was presided over by all these agencies, without demur, and we know what the consequences were.<\/p><p>The Chairman will be glad to know I have come to this conclusion.  We need some hope for those who are in what are called distressed loan scenarios.  We need some recognition that the banking system, whether a vulture or original lender, is going to take into account the circumstances.  They say to us \"that was then and this is now\".  In other words, it was fine then but the banks are not part and parcel of the previous regime and the new rules will be applied now, whether people like it or not, and nothing can be done about it.<\/p><p> We may not be able to do anything about it now but we might have to.  Instead of a continuing reference to the code of conduct and the last review of the code of conduct in 2018, I ask that the code be urgently reviewed again with greater recognition of the hardship caused to many borrowers.<\/p><p> Incidentally, we all know these borrowers as people who ran their businesses and homes very effectively for many years, borrowing money and paying it back, never leaving money owing to anybody.  They were always able to pay it back, except when there was a convergence of a massive amount of overhang of borrowing at the same time and place, which rendered the State and the banks insolvent.  It was an incredible performance but nobody accepted responsibility.  Nobody came with us to the table to speak on behalf of the people who find themselves with distressed mortgages.  It is within the capacity of the banks and the Central Bank to oversee a system that is fair to these people.  It is a matter for the Central Bank at this stage.<\/p><p> A final point relates to banking competition.  A number of raiders introduced themselves to this jurisdiction before the banking crash, undermining the banking system in the country by undercutting others, offering mortgages and borrowings at a rate never known before.  Loans were granted on interest-only terms, so what sort of system were we in?  This was meant to be the system for the foreseeable future, and it was seen as good banking according to the system that applied at the time.<\/p><p> I am not asking the witnesses to comment on an individual bank but if a bank moves from our system now, it will not be in the interest of the consumer or the business people served by that bank, particularly if that bank's loan book is to be transferred to a vulture fund.  There is now a conundrum that the Central Bank must resolve.  We cannot do it.  These controls are in the hands of the Central Bank.<\/p><p> I would like to see us retain the level of competition within the banking system in this country and on a sound footing.  Everything must be done to ensure it continues without interruption, and that in the event of vulture funds deciding they can seize an opportunity to take over a major chunk of the banking system in the country, we must remind them that they are only here in sufferance and they are only partially accountable to the Central Bank.  We have asked all these questions before and there are unregulated third parties involved with borrowing in this country and taking over loan books.  We asked the questions many times and were told they would be subject to usual rules and regulations but these bodies are not subject to such rules.<\/p><p> It is all fine to complain about this but somebody must do something about it fairly soon.  I have gone long over my time, for which I apologise, but at any time in future if the Chairman wishes members to attend a meeting with the Central Bank or representatives of banks or vulture funds, we will be more than happy to attend and support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020121500002#F00500","speaker":"1584","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607990400,"counter":75,"content":"<p>Do the witnesses wish to comment on any of the remarks made by Deputy Durkan?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020121500002#G00200","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607990400,"counter":76,"content":"<p>I certainly welcome the opportunity to comment and he has covered a large amount of ground.  I am conscious of the time limits but I am certainly happy to engage within this committee and bilaterally if helpful.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy spoke about the financial crisis and the behaviour, business models and approach in the entire system failed leading into the financial crisis.  I have no disagreement there.  We have worked very hard over the past decade or more to both deal with the crisis that enveloped the country and to put in place a much more resilient system that protects the country, borrowers and consumers from any recurrence.  It very significantly enhanced the regulatory framework both from a resilience perspective but also from a consumer protection perspective.<\/p> <p>  We have also undertaken much work to try to address the level of distress that resulted from the banking crisis.  There has been much progress over many years on that.  We can looked at the level of restructuring that has taken place across mortgages; approaching a quarter of loans that existed at the time of the crisis have had some degree of restructure.  More than 130,000 loans were restructured to address elements of distress and another approximately 60,000 were addressed pre-distress.<\/p> <p>  When I reference numbers I am acutely conscious that I am talking about individuals and households.  Unfortunately, there is still a legacy of distress, primarily with mortgage holders, the majority of which are now more than two years past due on mortgage repayments, both sitting within the banking system and some outside the banking system.  We are absolutely committed to continuing to try to address that to the greatest extent that we can.<\/p> <p>  The majority of these borrowers are paying something and about half are deemed to be co-operating.  There are potential solutions within the financial system for many of those borrowers but there are also challenges that go beyond the financial system where the borrowers are not co-operating or making repayments.  We must consider the safety nets available for those types of borrowers.<\/p> <p>  Even right up to the courts system it is never too late to engage and we can see that with what comes out of the courts.  We are pushing hard from a lender perspective to ensure they continue to strive to engage and we have also taken the hard lessons from the financial crisis into how we deal with the distress evident from the Covid-19 pandemic.  We are trying to ensure the issues that arose immediately after the financial crisis do not arise again.  This relates to borrowers whose incomes have been affected by the pandemic, and they should be supported to the greatest extent possible so they do not go into longer-term arrears.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy referred to raiders coming in and affecting the market.  For any firm authorised in Ireland and any bank authorised within the eurozone able to branch into Ireland, we expect it to have a robust business model that is likely to be sustainable over the long term.  It should have sufficient financial resources, including in times of stress, and it should have a good grasp of its risks.  It should be well run and be able to be resolvable in the event that it fails.<\/p> <p>  I hope this addresses some of what the Deputy raised but as I said I am happy to engage bilaterally if that is helpful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020121500002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ed Sibley"},{"type":"speech","time":1607990400,"counter":77,"content":"<p>I was taken by Mr. Sibley's statement that Ireland's banking market is somewhat concentrated.

Our banking market shows enormous supplier power.  The banks exert far more power than they normally would if there were healthier competition within the market.  We have two pillar banks, in the words of the Government, and they have about 80% of the market.  Instead of seeing that much increased competition, we are seeing one of the significant players probably leave the market over the next while.  Is it not therefore a significant objective of the Central Bank, given its responsibilities to consumers, and a significant objective of the Government to see a radical transition from this overly concentrated market - dangerously concentrated, in my view - to a functioning competitive market over the coming years?  For example, banks have enormous power over interest rates.  Ireland has either the highest or the second highest mortgage interest rate in the European Union.  I understand that the banking difficulties we have had play a part in this, but the banking structure also plays a radical part in it.  There is no doubt that if there were tighter competition, it would chase those interest rates down somewhat.  Consider even the way the banks interact with customers.  The banks can determine most elements of the engagement with customers because they have this enormous supplier power.  The locations of banks and the banks' closing down of their units in smaller provincial towns and throughout the country have an enormous effect on enterprise, families, etc.  Is it not a very negative element of the banking industry that it is so concentrated?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020121500002#H00200","speaker":"1504"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607990400,"counter":80,"content":"<p>I agree with the Deputy that there is a high degree of concentration in the industry.

We try to look at the biggest issues in the system as a whole, from an overall functioning perspective, a borrower service perspective and a consumer perspective, and how best we can help address them.  We cannot force lenders to lend.  We cannot force new entrants.  We do not have a direct role from a competition perspective.

There is no public banking system here but, between An Post and the credit unions, surely if there were the policy will to develop An Post and the public banking system on the model of the Sparkasse system in Germany, for example, or to empower the credit unions to operate within that space, they could offer a significant competitive opportunity for people throughout the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020121500002#H00800","speaker":"1504"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607990400,"counter":86,"content":"<p>I would tend to agree with the Deputy to a very large extent in that the overall functioning of the market is not just about the banks.

What we have done, and continue to do, as appropriate, from time to time is to apply restrictions on licences for various reasons, for example, if we have concerns regarding the safe operation of an institution, its business model, its financial stability or aspects of how it might be interacting with its customers.  We do that from time to time, and beyond banks.<\/p><p> Moving on to loan sales, typically, they are sold on a portfolio basis.  They are dealt with in commercial terms and the lenders, typically, decide to not share that information.  To my knowledge, those portfolios would not be valued, from a mortgage loan perspective certainly, on an individual loan basis.  What I would expect to happen is for a purchaser to do a level of due diligence, which would probably be sample based rather than looking every loan, and then offering a price based on that due diligence, which would also include forecasting of future performance and the like, as well as underlying property values.  It is a matter for those purchasers concerned whether they choose to disclose are not.  Typically, the prices are overall aggregates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020121500002#J01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ed Sibley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607990400,"counter":104,"content":"<p>Are the purchasers obliged to write and provide notification?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020121500002#K00200","speaker":"1652"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607990400,"counter":105,"content":"<p>Yes, they are.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020121500002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ed Sibley"},{"type":"speech","time":1607990400,"counter":106,"content":"<p>Which they do, that is fine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020121500002#K00400","speaker":"1652"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607990400,"counter":107,"content":"<p>There is a requirement on the seller to give notification, and then on the buyer to-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020121500002#K00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ed Sibley"},{"type":"speech","time":1607990400,"counter":108,"content":"<p>Yes, to notify who is buying the loan.

We have certainly acknowledged that we have seen an increase in this practice.  I have a great deal of sympathy for those consumers who have been impacted by phishing attacks and alerts.  This happens, however, in an environment outside of the regulatory parameters.  We have, though, issued warnings for consumers on our consumer hub and bringing to their attention the likelihood of the format that such attacks can take.  I refer to informing customers to not click on links which they do not recognise, and all those kinds of things.  That is in the area of trying to enhance consumers' awareness of, and educate them about, the risks contained within those kinds of email attacks.<br\/><br\/>At a broader level, a European directive entitled the payment services directive, EU 2015\/2366 PSD2 is in play.  It has existed since 2015 and has since been amended.  The premise of that directive and the background behind it is to increase security in respect of transactions online and to minimise, as far as possible, fraud or other types of attacks which may arise.  We have worked closely with our industry in recent years to ensure that it is fully <i>au fait<\/i>with the requirements of PSD2 and that those companies concerned have updated their IT systems and channels of interaction with consumers to ensure compliance with the requirements of the direct, particularly in the area of strong customer authentication.<br\/><br\/>That aspect is increasingly common and, as a consumer himself, the Senator will probably have experienced situations, when seeking to complete a transaction online, where an additional code might have been required, or a security question may have needed to be answered, or, depending on the technology, a fingerprint might be required.  All those enhancements seek to strengthen how consumers interact with online transactions and to minimise, insofar as is possible, the risks of fraud or attacks.

Last week, we had representatives from the Financial Services Union, FSU, before the committee.  Unfortunately, it was only representatives from that union who were available to speak to us then.  I feel strongly about the future of Ulster Bank, because it supports 3,000 people in jobs on a regionally-balanced basis.  We are concerned about the major impact of any change in that regard.  In 2019, Ulster Bank provided new lending of &euro;3.1 billion into the southern economy, with deposits of &euro;22 billion.  Ulster Bank is the third largest mortgage lender in this State and provides 20% of lending to our SMEs.<\/p> <p>  We are concerned about its future.  The parent company of Ulster Bank, NatWest, has stated that it will undertake a strategic review of the operations of Ulster Bank, including the potential closure of the bank's operations in this State.  It was also reported recently that Goldman Sachs has been employed to undertake that strategic review.  The witnesses will be aware that Goldman Sachs itself has been involved in the Irish mortgage market, namely, in setting up vulture funds which have bought up distressed debts from our retail banks and then selling on those debts, without paying a cent in tax on its profits, through section 100 structures.  Can the witnesses tell us what contact there may have been between them, the FSU and Ulster Bank staff in respect of NatWest or Ulster Bank regarding terms of reference of this strategic review?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020121500002#K02300","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speech","time":1607990400,"counter":125,"content":"<p>We covered that earlier.

Can Mr. Sibley explain what impact this will have on Ulster Bank borrowers, customers and mortgage holders?  He stated earlier that there should be no place in Irish banking for vulture funds.  I would be interested in hearing if he would support Deputy Pearse Doherty&rsquo;s No Consent, No Sale Bill, which would prohibit the sale of mortgage loans to vulture funds without the consent of borrowers.<\/p> <p>  Another question concerns the impact of the withdrawal on the Irish market.  I know that Deputy Pearse Doherty wrote to the Central Bank on 25 November about the withdrawal and the impact that would have, and that the Central Bank said in response that the exit of one entity from such a system, all other things being equal, could contribute to upward pressure to lending interest rates and could potentially lead to weaker credit availability.  For Mr. Sibley, what would the withdrawal of Ulster Bank mean for the Irish banking sector and consumers?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020121500002#L00200","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607990400,"counter":127,"content":"<p>Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell may have picked up my opening statement a little wrong in terms of one of the matters to which she referred.  If one of the larger banks, or any of the banks, given their number and the amount of competition in the market, was to exit, clearly, there is the potential for that to have significant implications.  I completely empathise in terms of the concerns of and uncertainty for those people working for an organisation where there is this type of strategic review ongoing.  There was a similar example previously in connection with KBC.  A strategic review was undertaken in regard to KBC a couple of years ago and there was similar speculation.  At the end of that, KBC decided to stay.  I cannot comment or speculate on what will happen with Ulster Bank but it is not a total given that it will leave.  I appreciate that there is uncertainty for people who are working for Ulster Bank, and that must be challenging.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the competition point the Deputy makes, and she referred to my letter, where I would be most concerned is in regard to SMEs.  We are seeing a degree more competition in the mortgage market, so the trend is downward and one measure would be interest rates.  There has been an increase in competition and we are, as I touched on earlier, seeing signs of potential other competition coming into the market, both from banks and non-banks in mortgages.  However, the SME lending is more concentrated again because, of the banks, there are only three banks that are lending to SMEs at any kind of scale.  In terms of potential implications were Ulster Bank to decide to leave, that would be the area that is most concerning in terms of the functioning of the market.<\/p> <p>  There are other options out there for SMEs, and the other two banks and the credit unions are able to lend to smaller SMEs, but none of that is approaching the scale of Ulster Bank&rsquo;s lending to SMEs.  Clearly, that potentially is an area where both the provision of service and lack of price competition might well be a factor.  I would agree with the Deputy on her concerns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020121500002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ed Sibley"},{"type":"speech","time":1607990400,"counter":128,"content":"<p>I would be very interested in the credit union issue as well, and I know Mr. Sibley talked to Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n about that.  When the FSU was here, it stated that one concern it had was that if the branches close, and I appreciate we do not know and, hopefully, it will not be the case, we would lose local knowledge.  As Mr. Sibley knows, if there is a banking branch, there is that local knowledge of the people, of the farmer and of the local business, so that is one issue that would be concerning.  I thought it was quite an interesting point by the FSU and, in that sense, if that were to happen, I think a greater importance would be set on the credit union sector.  Mr. Sibley stated that he recognised the importance of the credit union sector.  Specifically, we need to recognise the help it can provide people in terms of increasing financial exclusion and, obviously, that would be a great concern with the increasing digitisation of banking.  We know there are huge swathes of the country that just do not have broadband, so that is not a factor for them, and there are people who are not able to undertake online banking, as well as the fact we are, unfortunately, moving away from community-based branches.<\/p> <p>  The Central Bank said recently in regard to the banks that there can be a distance between what they say and what their customers experience.  Many credit unions have contacted me because they are concerned about their future.  They would be concerned about what the Central Bank says and what they themselves experience, and this is what they have come to me about.  They are concerned about the scale of the crisis facing them in the next five years.  They have said the regulations being placed on the sector at the moment put them at a competitive disadvantage to the banks, and that this has stymied their ability to lend and, therefore, is strangling the customer's ability to borrow.  At the same time, we see that Ulster Bank could potentially exit the market, which would add to that.

We know that in large, developed credit union movements in other countries, credit unions are allowed to lend up to 60%.  We also know that over half of the consumer credit market in Ireland is for mortgages.  How can credit unions provide a real alternative with this kind of restriction in place?  Given that they feel they are stymied in terms of having a more balanced loan book, is this creating a greater risk for credit unions?

Should it not do so to allay public fear or to ensure public understanding and to give the public a better grasp of what is going on?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020121500002#M00600","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607990400,"counter":144,"content":"<p>We do not necessarily challenge all inaccurate reporting on the Central Bank.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020121500002#M00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ed Sibley"},{"type":"speech","time":1607990400,"counter":145,"content":"<p>These particular articles were significant in that, if what they stated is true, they would create serious doubt in the minds of those leading banks and central banks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020121500002#M00800","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1607990400,"counter":146,"content":"<p>I recall the articles coming out but I cannot recall the precise details.

Within the complaint of the EBS tied agents is the detail that EBS knowingly misrepresented its financial position to the markets, creditors and the Central Bank.  Knowing that this is part of the complaint, surely it is the Central Bank's job to investigate.  I am not asking about individual EBS agents or specific instances related to the ongoing challenge.  I am asking whether the Central Bank has looked at the complaints made by the EBS agents, rather than acting on any one individual case.  Has the Central Bank looked at the matter of the flawed accounts used to exploit the very same loophole about which we talked earlier on?

Ms McEvoy was talking about consumer protection.  I correct her on the following issue every time.  It is impossible to deal with Start Mortgages.  Customers find it impossible, as do I as a third party.  One cannot get through to the company on the phone.  There are issues and concerns it will not address.  The word \"abhorrent\" was used with regard to KBC.  The other side won a court case against the bank.  It was to pay out on that basis but still has not done so.  It just refuses to pay.  Deputy Doherty will be aware of a particular case regarding Bank of Ireland.  It was specifically mentioned in correspondence that an individual had a tracker mortgage but the bank has refused to acknowledge this.  It has conducted internal investigations.  The way the banks are handling issues is bizarre and they are getting away with it.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Doherty raised the issue of evictions and repossessions.  How many repossessions have occurred over the past while?  How many occurred during the pandemic?  People continue to be brought to court and dragged all over the place, even at Christmastime, with regard to their mortgages.  It seems that no one is intervening.  Deputy Doherty put the letter on record and he was right to do so.  What legal practice or bank in its right mind would tell people to be out by 21 December?  Somebody, perhaps the consumer protection unit, should intervene.  I will say it again; the protections do not travel with the loan or with the customer.<\/p><p>That just does not happen.  In the cases I have come across, of which there have been quite a few, Deputies Durkan and Doherty have been at pains to point out at every meeting that this does not happen.  Usually, it applies to those who are not well heeled with lawyers.  In the case of lay litigants, who may have a damn good argument, the bank just kicks them around the place, showing them no respect whatsoever.  We have to find somewhere we can turn.  I apologise for ending the meeting abruptly but I am obliged to conclude it because we have reached 3.30 p.m.  As Chairman, I will write to our guests because the matter in question has been raised during the meeting.
