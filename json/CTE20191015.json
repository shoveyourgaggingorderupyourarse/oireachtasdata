Ireland&rsquo;s natural gas network can play a major role in decarbonising our society, while still maintaining the security and cost-effectiveness of our energy supply.  While natural gas emits nearly one sixth of Ireland's emissions, through a combination of technologies, we will create a carbon-neutral gas network and reduce Ireland's total CO2 emissions by one third across key sectors, including electricity, industry, heat, transport and agriculture.  This will be achieved by using proven technologies such as renewable gas, compressed natural gas, CNG, carbon capture and storage, CCS, and hydrogen.  Our goal is that by 2050 half of the gas on Ireland&rsquo;s gas network will be renewable gas and hydrogen.  The other half will be abated gas, which is where carbon dioxide has been removed through the CCS process, preventing emissions from entering the atmosphere.<\/p> <p>  We have been on a journey developing a range of initiatives to reduce Ireland&rsquo;s carbon footprint and to ensure that Ireland has indigenous and sustainable energy solutions for a number of years.  This decarbonisation journey has become even more significant with the publication of the Government's climate action plan, which sets out an ambitious trajectory to address climate disruption over the coming years.  We have started delivering on our vision.  Renewable gas, for example, was successfully injected into our network for the first time earlier this year.  Planning for the first full-scale renewable gas facility in Mitchelstown, Co. Cork, is under way.  This project will provide renewable gas for 56,000 homes or 8% of Ireland&rsquo;s residential gas demand.<\/p> <p>  The opening of Ireland's first public CNG refuelling station in December 2018 marked another important milestone in our plan.  CNG offers an immediate reduction of more than 20% in CO2 emissions when compared to diesel and will facilitate the introduction of renewable gas into transport, offering a fully decarbonised transport fuel.  With a further six CNG stations currently in construction and development, our ambition is to ultimately have a network of 172 public and private stations.<\/p> <p>  We are fulfilling our role under the climate action plan to explore the feasibility of CCS in Ireland.  We are providing key support to the Government&rsquo;s CCS steering group and we recently signed a memorandum of understanding with CCS technology leaders Equinor in Norway to explore carbon export and storage options.  Hydrogen, the fourth pillar of Vision 2050, is fast becoming the decarbonisation fuel of choice around the world.  With zero emissions, hydrogen is an extremely flexible energy source that can be deployed across transport, heating and electricity generation.  We see hydrogen as an exciting opportunity for Ireland, especially in light of its potential to act as an energy store to maximise the utilisation of renewable electricity.<\/p><p>The Irish State has invested more than &euro;2.6 billion in Ireland's gas network, which is one of the safest and most modern gas networks in the world.  The network has effectively no capacity constraints and it can be used to facilitate renewable energies, including renewable gas and hydrogen.  We believe that the gas network has a long-term role to play in meeting our nation's energy demand and that Ireland cannot achieve its climate ambitions without it.  As an energy source, natural gas is of key strategic importance to Ireland, representing 30% of our country's primary energy mix.  Importantly, approximately 50% of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity is generated by natural gas.  The Climate Change Advisory Council's recent statement to the Government highlighted the importance of natural gas.  If we are to decarbonise the Irish economy by 2050, there will be a need for significant deployment of carbon capture and storage, CCS, with natural gas as a component of Ireland's energy system.  This view is aligned with Vision 2050.<\/p><p> We are strong advocates of renewable energy and believe that climate action and future energy policy will require a suite of technologies and renewable solutions.  A move to a 70% reliance on renewable sources such as wind and solar for electricity generation is planned by 2030 as part of ambitious national climate action targets.  However, while Ireland has excellent renewable energy sources and potential, including wind and solar sources, this renewable energy is intermittent and needs the reliability of gas to facilitate its development.  Achieving these targets will require a significant reliance on gas-powered electricity generation to provide the balance of requirements and to ensure Ireland has a secure energy supply at all times.  Our vision is a carbon-neutral gas network and it is through CCS and other technologies that this will be achieved.<\/p><p> In conclusion, Vision 2050 outlines the role that the gas network and key technologies such as renewable gas, compressed natural gas, CCS and hydrogen will play in tackling climate change, while also ensuring that Ireland has a sustainable, affordable and secure energy future.  The combination of these technologies will result in a carbon-neutral gas network by 2050 and the reduction in Ireland&rsquo;s overall CO2 emissions by one third.  We are committed to working with Government and policymakers across all sectors to ensure we maximise the contribution this State-owned asset can make to reducing Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions while also maintaining sustainable energy solutions in the least disruptive and most cost-effective way.  I look forward to the committee's questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019101500002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Denis O'Sullivan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571094000,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Sullivan.

As I mentioned, the plan has four pillars.  I will start with compressed natural gas, CNG.  We have rolled out the first station and at present, four stations are operating in the country.  Another public station on the M7 motorway will open in the coming weeks.  A further six stations are in development and there is a pipeline of about 40 stations at the moment, with a trajectory towards the complement of 176 that I mentioned.  There is significant demand on the part of haulage companies for us to take up this technology.  To develop the industry we made available a grant fund which is part funded by the European Commission to support the transition from diesel-powered trucks and buses to CNG.  When that was deployed, it was immediately taken up and sourced.  Those trucks are now coming into use.  Just last week our first international haulage firm, a Cavan-based company called Virginia International Logistics, which has been at the forefront in rolling out this technology, made the first delivery to France using CNG technology fuelled here and in France.<\/p> <p>  We have developed all the regulatory and safety frameworks required for renewable gas.  We have also developed a renewable gas certification scheme, which is an important element in the development of renewable gas.  We have injected the first renewable gas from an initial plant we built in Cush in County Kildare.  <\/p> <p>  Moving on from that, our plan is to have several anaerobic digester plants directly connected to the network, while also grouping them into a centralised injection facility.  The first centralised injection facility is currently being considered under Cork County Council's planning process.  A decision on this is imminent.  I will defer to Mr. Murphy on carbon capture and storage. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019101500002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Denis O'Sullivan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571094000,"counter":13,"content":"<p>We have done a lot work on carbon capture and storage in the last couple of years.  We are looking at two different models.  The first would involve using the Kinsale field, which will soon be depleted.  We have done a lot of work to examine both onshore and offshore infrastructure to see what parts we should keep.  We now have a very good sense of exactly what parts of that infrastructure we want to keep.  We also have a lot of data about the field itself.  We have done a lot of work to understand the field's compatibility with the storage of CO2.  The challenge will concern the wells that have been drilled into the field.<\/p> <p>  We have also done a lot of work with the European Union.  Several grant funds for CCS work are available in Europe.  In particular, I refer to the emissions trading system, ETS, innovation fund, which is worth &euro;11 billion.  Its administrators are planning to offer up to 60% funding for CCS projects in Europe.  We have done a lot of work with the EU and we are very much on its radar at this point. <\/p> <p>  That is the position with the Kinsale field.  The other model we are looking at is the export model.  As Mr. O'Sullivan mentioned, we have signed a memorandum of understanding with Equinor, a Norwegian company.  Equinor is developing a bespoke field north of Norway where it will store up to 5 million tonnes of CO2 per annum.  We have signed a memorandum of understanding with that firm to explore the potential for us to ship CO2 to the field off the coast of Norway.  We have more work to do in that regard. <\/p> <p>  Hydrogen is still in the early stages although it is gaining huge momentum and is being spoken about much more.  The UK's Committee on Climate Change has talked a lot about the need for hydrogen as part of an overall zero-carbon model.  In the past few weeks the German Chancellor has said that a national hydrogen strategy should be in place by the end of 2019, while the Austrian Chancellor has said that hydrogen is the fuel of the future.  There is a lot of momentum behind it, but it is still at a relatively early stage. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019101500002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Brendan Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1571094000,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for the presentation.  Mr. O'Sullivan spoke about Gas Networks Ireland's strategy for 2030 and 2050.  Has that been costed and independently assessed?  Carbon capture and storage is phenomenally expensive.  Given where we are going, I wonder why Gas Networks Ireland is not putting a greater emphasis on hydrogen.  There is a sustainability issue with carbon capture and storage.  Planning permission is also a concern.  The nuts and bolts of telling people in that region that we are going pump CO2 into the nearby caverns will not be straightforward.  There are issues there.  Since we are a small country in the scheme of things, I would have thought we should really push towards the hydrogen mix as a solution.  Can the witnesses comment on that?<\/p> <p>  This committee has discussed the liquefied natural gas, LNG, facility planned for Ballylongford.  Gas Networks Ireland is to some extent responsible for energy security.  Its representatives can take my previous remarks in that context.  Based on Gas Networks Ireland's long-term planning, is an LNG facility necessary from an energy security point of view?<\/p> <p>  Turning to decarbonisation generally, we all recognise that gas has to be a transition fuel.  However, Gas Networks Ireland's strategy seems to be absolutely dependent on making carbon capture and storage operational by 2050 in order to achieve carbon-neutral status.  Some might argue that this is not the best way to go, and that we should reduce our dependence on gas as part of that transition.  When we talk about gas as a transition fuel, it is not a replacement for other fossil fuels.  It is a way for us to make greater use of renewables.  I note that Gas Networks Ireland has done a lot of work on renewable gas from the agricultural sector, which is helpful, but at the end of the day that does produce emissions.  There is a significant hole in the strategy if carbon capture and storage does not become financially feasible.<\/p><p>Will our guests comment on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019101500002#D00500","speaker":"1274","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571094000,"counter":16,"content":"<p>We have costed the overall plan and I will break it down into its component parts.  We have not sought any form of support for the roll-out of CNG or related infrastructure, which we will do on a commercial basis.  We advocate for supports to be put in place for the uptake of CNG vehicles.  Similar to what has been done in the case of electric vehicles, when haulage and bus companies wish to transfer from diesel to CNG, and to renewable gas via CNG, a support mechanism will be required, although we will do our costing on a purely commercial basis.<\/p> <p>  On renewable gas, like any other renewable technology, a support is required for the industry.  To develop it, we advocate along the lines of what the Government announced in the recent budget, namely, that carbon tax placed on natural gas should be used to decarbonise gas.  Doing so will cover the cost of developing the industry.  We have set out a trajectory for year-by-year volumes, costs and so on in that regard.  The support is not a support for GNI.  We will not produce the gas and, in fact, we are prohibited from doing so under legislation, as part of the third energy directive.  The support will go directly to rural communities where anaerobic digestion plants are constructed and where the feedstock comes from.  We will facilitate it coming onto the network, as we do in the case of natural gas.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Murphy might comment on the carbon capture and storage, CCS, costs.<\/p> <p>  On LNG, any additional source will provide additional security of supply.  Nevertheless, I remind the committee of our proposal in Vision 2050.  Our dependence on natural gas will decrease as we increase the level of renewable gas and hydrogen on the network.  While we would like to bring hydrogen forward, sufficient work simply has not been done to develop the technologies needed for hydrogen.  We are rolling out a project to verify and test our network and to ensure that will meet all the regulatory requirements as we increase the level of hydrogen on the network.

For clean, dispatchable power, it is just what we need.  While we need wind, we also need dispatchable power for when the wind does not blow or the sun does not shine.  By any measure, the cheapest way of providing that is with CCS and it is not just us who say that.  The International Energy Agency has predicted that the cost of decarbonising the power sector will be $3.5 trillion more without CCS, while the European Commission has estimated that it will cost &euro;1.2 trillion more to do the same in Europe.  The UK Committee on Climate Change recently published a report on achieving net zero carbon emissions for the UK that found that CCS is a \"necessity not an option\".  The UK Department of Energy recently launched a consultation on how to incentivise CCS for power, industry and so on.  It indicated that the cost of power would be between &pound;70 and &pound;77 sterling per MW\/h for clean, dispatchable power, which is a cheap price by any measure.  There is much evidence that CCS will be very cheap and competitive compared with any alternative dispatchable power, which is crucial.<\/p> <p>  There are two ways of producing hydrogen.  One, which is often called blue hydrogen, involves splitting natural gas into hydrogen and CO2, after which the latter is stored.  In that case, CCS will nonetheless be needed to store the CO2 and it is likely to be much cheaper than the alternative, namely, green hydrogen, although in the long term, that will be an important part of the mix.  It involves, for example, using wind turbines to produce electricity or using electrolysis to make hydrogen.  In the long term, that is, after 2100, it will doubtless become an essential part of the economy.  It is a matter of timing.  I would like to think that over the next 20 to 50 years, the switch will be from blue to green hydrogen.  All the evidence suggests that to increase scale in the next 20 years, blue hydrogen will have to be used.

Deputy Dooley talked about the planning and infrastructure challenges presented.  The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, has said there is evidence to substantiate the claim that carbon capture and storage are cheap and competitive.  Will our guests present the evidence which I have not seen to the committee?  Can it be produced in written form because I do not think they will have time to present it here?  Will they present the evidence that they are cheap and competitive?  Does the process of carbon capture lead to a reduction in carbon emissions and, if so, how?

I strongly believe that it is cheaper, but my opinion is not important.  The point I have made is that the International Energy Agency, IEA; the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC; the European Commission; the UK Government and the UK Committee on Climate Change are all stating decarbonising the power sector will be much more expensive without carbon capture and storage.  It is not just me who is saying it; all of those bodies are stating it.  The numbers are very big.  That is the evidence I can provide straightaway.<\/p> <p>  There is no question that we need to maximise the use of wind energy.  The other question is how can we decarbonise the other 30% in meeting our energy needs.  Of all the options available, the only one that will have a meaningful impact is using gas-fired power plants and carbon capture and storage.  That is my overall point.  We can come back to the Deputy with more information and particular numbers, if he wants.<\/p><p> How the process works is simple and it can be done in several ways.  For a gas-fired power station, emissions are captured and put through a chemical process that strips out the CO2, cleans and compresses it.  It is then either shipped to an offshore field - in the case of Kinsale, it is shipped 56 km offshore - or compressed into liquid form and shipped out for processing.  In the example of Equinor ASA, it would be brought by ship to Norway and injected into a field designed specifically for that purpose.  Depending on exactly how it is done, up to 100% of the CO2 emissions from a power station can be captured by that process.  It is happening around the world.  None of the technology for carbon capture and strategy is new; it is proven technology.  The issue up to now has been economics, specifically cost and who owns the associated risk.  The process is without question technically feasible.  The question is whether it is economically feasible.<\/p><p> It is crucial to note that one cannot simply compare wind energy production with a CCS power plant.  We should, of course, maximise wind energy generation.  However, when wind does not blow, there has to be a back-up, the cost of which will be more than the cost of the power produced when the wind is blowing.  Taking that into account, dispatchable CCS power is significantly cheaper than any alternative.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019101500002#F01500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571094000,"counter":42,"content":"<p>The witnesses might provide the follow-up information we discussed to the committee.

As for the section of their presentation on the use of compressed natural gas, I reiterate how proud we are in my area of Virginia International Logistics, the Cole family transport company which has converted its trucks to compressed natural gas, CNG and went to the Continent recently using CNG.  It is a great breakthrough and I congratulate the firm on its initiative.  In their presentation, the witnesses made the point that the first CNG refuelling station was opened in 2018.  They stated that:<\/p><blockquote>CNG offers an immediate reduction of over 20% in CO<sub>2<\/sub>emissions [which would be extremely important] when compared to diesel and will facilitate the introduction of renewable gas into transport, offering a fully carbon neutral transport fuel.  With a further six CNG stations currently in construction and development, our ambition is to ultimately have a network of 172 public and private stations. <\/blockquote> <p>That is a great ambition around which I want to ask some questions.  For the regular, small transport companies that dot our country and on which we depend so much, margins are quite tight as the witnesses are aware anecdotally if not otherwise.  How financially realistic is it for them to make this conversion?  What level of support exists at present?  From Mr. O'Sullivan's knowledge, which is quite deep, obviously, of CNG and conversion to its use, what kind of grant aid or support should exist that does not currently exist?  Is that level of grant aid realistic in terms of the national climate change plan and the overall economics around the climate change agenda?  Is it a realistic option?  I would like to believe that it is but I would like the witnesses' clarification there.  Is there a question of economies of scale in this regard?  Is it really the big fleets that can do it?  How do we manage the popularisation or the spreading of it?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019101500002#K00400","speaker":"1397"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571094000,"counter":127,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.  If I have not got all of his points he might please flag them to me.  I might just make one clarification on the CNG station that was opened in 2018 in Dublin Port.  It was the first publicly accessible CNG station.  In fact, the company the Senator referenced, Virginia International Logistics, has been utilising CNG for a number of years and was one of the pioneers of CNG as a fuel.  In terms the viability of CNG for smaller operators, it is certainly viable.  At the moment there is no support mechanism other than the grant support that GNI provides, which is a limited grant, part funded through the European Union, for the uptake of vehicles.  Our intention is to roll out a suite of publicly accessible stations, essentially refuelling forecourts, which will allow operators who have one vehicle or multiple vehicles to refuel at those points.  Our view is that we will have a combination of private and public stations in the 172 stations.  Many of the large haulage companies at the moment, including the one the Senator referenced, have their own refuelling infrastructure.  We want to accommodate them as well as the smaller operators in private stations.  In terms of its viability, we advocate that some supports need to be put in place to support the transition from a diesel vehicle to a CNG vehicle for all operators.  In terms of cost of abatement of CO2, it is a low cost of abatement and one we believe should be supported for truck, bus or commercial vehicle operators.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019101500002#K00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Denis O'Sullivan"},{"type":"speech","time":1571094000,"counter":128,"content":"<p>What roughly is the cost per truck of conversion to CNG?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019101500002#K00600","speaker":"1397"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571094000,"counter":129,"content":"<p>For a large heavy goods vehicle, there is a differential of approximately &euro;15,000 and the payback on that for obviously depends on utilisation.

I am grateful for the opportunity to appear before the joint committee in my capacity as chairman designate of the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB.  If it is acceptable to the committee I will first highlight my career as it is relevant to the role of the RTB.<\/p> <p>  I qualified as a chartered surveyor in the late 1970s and worked for ten years in one of Ireland's leading firms of surveyors, valuers and estate agents, gaining experience across a wide range of property consultancy, management, valuation and investment areas.  In 1980 I joined the Dublin Institute of Technology, now the Technological University of Dublin, TU Dublin, as lecturer in urban economics and property evaluations where I have spent the bulk of my career, retiring recently as the head of the school of surveying and construction management.  This is a large school in TU Dublin with some 1,000 students across 14 academic programmes from degree to post-graduate levels, including PhD students.  That was a senior appointment in the university and it required an active role in public sector management, including participation in committees, boards and councils at the highest levels in the university and outside it.<\/p> <p>  During my career I lectured in variety of areas related to property, including property valuation techniques and housing.  My research interests included property taxation, urban economics, housing and, in particular in later years largely because of my involvement in the Residential Tenancies Board, in the private rental sector.  I have also engaged with professional and commercial organisations, including the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, and the Irish Property and Facility Management Association.  These engagements have given me a wide range of experience in the management and governance of organisations with a public service remit and an active membership.  This involved chairing many committees with those organisations and included a term as the president of the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Internationally, I have served for eight years on the governing council of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which is a very large professional body based in London with members in a large number of countries around the world.<\/p> <p>  Of particular importance in terms of my consideration of my role as chairman of the RTB is my lead role in the Commission on the Private Rented Residential Sector, which I chair.  In 1999 I was asked by the then Minister of State with responsibility for housing and urban renewal, former Deputy Robert Molloy, to chair the commission and it reported in 2000.  The purpose of the commission was to examine the working of the landlord and tenant relationship with regard to residential tenancies, and to consider key issues such as security of tenure, the supply of accommodation, investment return, market considerations and constraints on the development of the sector.  The terms of reference were deliberately wide, as the private rented sector had been neglected for many years and was in need of reform.  The commission's report informed the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, which provided for the creation of the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, now the RTB.  From 2004 to 2009 I chaired the PRTB, as it then was, during the period it was established.  Also of note in the context of my experience across housing is my role in 2003 in assisting the all-party Oireachtas committee on the Constitution in the preparation of its ninth report on property rights.<\/p> <p>  It is 15 years since the now RTB was established and 19 years since the Commission on the Private Rented Residential Sector reported.  The sector has changed significantly in this time and the remit of the RTB has also expanded and devolved considerably.  I believe I will be able to contribute positively to supporting change.  The important changes I oversaw as the chairman of the commission and subsequently as chairman of the RTB created a new regulatory framework and a quasi-judicial service to replace the courts for landlords and tenants.  The implementation of the recommendations from the commission was significant at the time and I believe this experience gives me a particular understanding and insight, which I bring to the RTB.<\/p> <p>  I now turn to what I see as the priorities important for the role of the chairman and for my approach as the chairman of the RTB.  There are core tasks with regard to the leadership and effectiveness of the board.  I have summarised a number of key priorities.  One is to oversee the effective implementation of the considerable programme of change on foot of recent legislation.  This expands the remit of the board to all student-specific accommodation.  I am sure that members of the committee will be aware of much of this.  It will also give the organisation extensive new powers that give the RTB the ability to proactively investigate and regulate the sector.  This is an important development for the regulation of the overall rental market.  It is important that the approach to doing this is sensitive and that we focus on supporting and informing people in complying with regulations, as well as empowering people with knowledge.<\/p><p>The ultimate goal is compliance, not punishment.  We need to support landlords in fulfilling their obligations.  <\/p><p> Second, the RTB has an important role to play in using and developing data and research to provide evidence and intelligence on the rental sector.  We will continue to grow and invest in this area.  It was an important aspect of the recommendations in the original commission's report because at the time it was seen, from the State's perspective, that a lack of information was one of the deficiencies in analysing what was going in the sector.  It still happens to some extent.  <\/p><p> Third, it is important that the RTB can deliver in a challenging environment.  The organisation is supporting a significant proportion of the population and demand for its services continues to increase.  Maintaining existing services, organisational supports and adequate resources to ensure effective delivery is a core priority.  <\/p><p> Fourth, the RTB has an ambitious five-year strategic plan, underpinned by a vision, to support and develop a well functioning rental sector that is fair, accessible and beneficial to all.  I believe in this vision and will work with the board, the director, the executive and stakeholders to support the delivery of the strategic priorities of the RTB.  <\/p><p> Fifth, if appointed, I intend to strive to achieve the highest standards of good governance and adhere to best practice, consistent with the RTB's position as a public body and our important mandate.  I will support the organisation and monitor our performance in delivery and achieving the planned outcomes within the strategy.<\/p><p> There are significant changes affecting the rental sector, with restricted supply alongside increasing demand for accommodation, affordability issues, with rents at an all-time high and significant legislative and regulatory change and uncertainty.  The RTB plays a critical role in working to resolve the crisis.  It does this through an enhanced regulatory function, education and awareness which empower people with knowledge on their rights and responsibilities, as well as our data which provide a robust evidence base to inform policy.  <\/p><p> I again thank the Chairman and committee members for inviting me to meet them.  I assure the committee that I have a genuine interest in this role and believe I can make an effective contribution to the important work of the RTB.  I look forward to engaging with the committee again in the future if appointed to this important role.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101500002#E00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Dunne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571094000,"counter":209,"content":"<p>If members wish to contribute, I will call them in the order in which they indicate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101500002#F00200","speaker":"1304"},{"type":"speech","time":1571094000,"counter":210,"content":"<p>I congratulate Mr. Dunne on his appointment which I have no doubt will be ratified.

Effectively, it was not working because if a landlord wanted to deal with a tenant, it was difficult to get the matter before the courts because it was very expensive.  Solicitors were charging a lot of money because the issues were contentious and there were many difficult issues under landlord and tenant law.  From a tenant's perspective, he or she could not access justice effectively because court procedures were complex and he or she would have to be supported by a solicitor.  The intention of the original Act was to take all of it outside the courts and create a dispute resolution process which would enable landlords and tenants to come to some conclusion on their differences.  Importantly, even at the time it was seen that tenants might be in their accommodation for longer than the norm.  They were mostly in place for one year at the time, but the commission foresaw a period when that might change and tenants would spend longer in tenancies and that as a result, they would have an ongoing relationship with their landlord.  The intention, therefore, was to create a structure which would allow disputes to be resolved in a way that would not sunder the relationship between the landlord and the tenant.<\/p><p>Tenants, therefore, would have to leave the accommodation and that is why the idea of mediation was brought in, adjudication followed by tribunals.  Senator Conway calls the RTB a watchdog and while it has that function, it is more a dispute resolution service.  It has to be impartial to maintain the integrity of that role.  Landlords and tenants might not see it as being impartial but it is.  One of the most important issues the chairman and the board of directors need to keep an eye on is making sure the dispute resolution service is seen as being as impartial as the courts in resolving disputes between landlords and tenants. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101500002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Dunne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571094000,"counter":213,"content":"<p>We have all seen on television and have witnessed in person the appalling standards of some accommodation and the RTB certainly has a job to do to ensure that is properly policed.

They have difficulty evicting tenants and find their properties wrecked.  The only comeback they have is the deposit.  I am not talking about big landlords with multiple properties because they just take the good with the bad but where people are struggling to pay the mortgage on a property and thousands of euro worth of damage is done, they feel disenfranchised.

It is a business risk that a landlord takes when taking on a tenant that the tenant may not work out.  The important point to bear in mind is that in any business or sphere of life, a few people will always cause many problems.  If the incidental landlord has borrowed money, perhaps to create a pension fund for himself or herself, or has inherited a house or has a dwelling that he or she put on to the market and the tenant acts in a disruptive way and proves difficult, that costs him or her an enormous sum.  That fear is one reason incidental or accidental landlords are getting out of the market.  One of the intentions of the legislation was to try to empower landlords to deal with tenants in a timely way.  The board has a focus on making sure that the landlord gets a tenant out in as timely a fashion as possible but the board has to work within the law as laid down.  That law originates in landlord and tenant law and is influenced by the Constitution where there are strong property rights and rights to protect the home, which people forget.  It is difficult for the State to create a law that covers a situation where a landlord can get a tenant out very quickly.  I do not think that will ever happen.  It remains a business risk for landlords.  All the board can do is try to make its dispute resolution processes as efficient and effective as possible and in the event of there being a tenant who has caused trouble that costs the landlord a lot of money-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101500002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Dunne"},{"type":"speech","time":1571094000,"counter":215,"content":"<p>What are Mr. Dunne's views on rent pressure zones, RPZs?

The board has an important role in advising the Government on RPZs.  However, any system of rent certainty one brings in is going to contain some anomalies and that is one of them.  That might be examined in the current RPZ system.  Rent certainty and rent control are fraught issues.  Getting the model right is difficult the world over.  The model we brought in here has been pretty cleverly constructed, given all the constraints that are brought to bear in trying to construct a model of rent control.  I take the point, and the board and I are certainly conscious that there are anomalous situations in which benign landlords lost out in the formula that was brought in to deal with these zones.

We are supportive of the Government's albeit belated introduction of some of those powers in the recent legislation.  One of the main priorities is to ensure the new legislation hits the ground running as quickly as possible.  Recruitment and IT issues have to be resolved but the sooner all of that is in place, the better.  While it is not all completely under the control of the RTB and some of it was time-lined by the Department, it is something we would all like to happen as quickly as possible.<\/p> <p>  From a policy point of view and in respect of the RTB's role of offering policy advice, one of the issues that is not getting enough attention in government or in the Department is the considerable loss of rental properties that occurred in 2017 and 2018.  Over that two-year period, 12,000 rental properties were lost from the market.  The most recent figures from the RTB indicate that 3,000 new rental properties were gained in the first quarter of this year but we will have to wait to see if there is a trend indicating that the loss has stabilised.  My big fear last year was that we were seeing a disorderly exit of accidental and semi-professional landlords who were availing of the upturn in property prices to get out of the market.  There is not an awful lot we can do about that in terms of those people wanting to leave, but sitting back and doing nothing is the worst option.  The RTB could usefully lead a conversation informed by the evidence, as we get more data quarter on quarter, as to whether we are seeing a disorderly exit and what the most appropriate policy responses would be to ensure that, if it happens, this exit has the least damaging impact on tenants and the rental sector overall.  Much of it is driven by accidental landlords simply wanting to get out.  Now that property prices have recovered to their original mortgage purchase prices, it is the opportune moment to go.  However, we do not know if that is the case and we do not know what other factors are influencing this.  Perhaps some research, data and discussion on that would be useful.<\/p> <p>  That leads to a broader conversation on the fact that we have too many accidental and semi-professional landlords.  It is not that we cannot have professional landlords with one or two properties.  Germany and other countries show that we can.  The work that the RTB has been doing on attempting to assist landlords to become more professional needs to be accelerated, as I am sure the officials will agree.  What that looks like, how we do it and whether it should be compulsory or voluntary is a conversation we need to have.  It needs to be ensured that landlords fully understand that this is not a passive investment or something they can do in their spare time.  It is almost a full-time job in many cases.<\/p><p>This committee might want to return to that as a key issue some time next year. <\/p><p>The third issue is security of tenure.  While Part 4 tenancies give the impression of security of tenure on paper, section 34 is filled with problems.  This committee has returned to that repeatedly.  Many of us, including Deputy Mick Barry, myself and others, have tabled legislation to remove many of the section 34 grounds such as sale and the use by a family member.  If we want to professionalise the sector, we need to ensure that people who want to rent can do so for very long periods without that insecurity.  With the rental market in a period of transition, maybe now is the time to grapple with that.  We cannot continue with a drip-feed of amendments to the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 because that destabilises the market, but some of these things need to be tackled.  <\/p><p> I wish to discuss the rent pressure zones, RPZs.  Without opening a broader policy conversation I note that according to the latest Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, information new rents in Dublin have increased by 8.8%.  While the policy might have been well-crafted, there is not much evidence the RPZs are working effectively.  The fact that more and more areas are being included in the RPZs confirms one of the fears many of us originally had, namely, that there would be a ripple effect pushing up rents in the areas adjoining them.  We will have to return to the conversation on rent certainty, rent management and a more effective way to guarantee them.<\/p><p> The great difficulty of our current system is that both the landlord and the tenant are the losers at both the low point and the current high point of rental price.  That huge volatility is built into the system.  The RPZs were a temporary measure, one which I did not support and I do not think is working.  If we are going to reform the rental sector over the long term, how can we get the balance right between tenants' legitimate rights and expectation to reasonable rents that they can manage over the course of their life cycle and landlords' reasonable expectation of a fair return on their investments as long as they are fully compliant with the law and are providing a good service to tenants?  I am a tenant and I have a good landlord, so I have experienced this directly.  We have not fixed that yet.  That is another policy conversation we need to have.  We would welcome the opportunity to come back to that discussion next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101500002#H00300","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571094000,"counter":220,"content":"<p>I will comment on some of those points.  Very briefly, I agree with the Deputy on the need for the Residential Tenancies Board to support landlords.  As has been said, many landlords are incidental or accidental landlords and are not as aware as they might be of the risks they undertake when they become landlords or of the procedures and policies.  That points to one original intention of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004.  It had to be complex.  There were 202 sections in that Act.  The Residential Tenancies Board started out with the intention of ensuring that the experience of landlords would not reflect the complexity of the Act.  There was enough information on the website so that if a landlord looked at it, he or she could find out how he or she should behave as a landlord.  We intended to support landlords in that way.  We must continue with that work.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is probably right about what has happened in the marketplace.  Many of those incidental and accidental landlords are finding the going a bit tough.  They appreciate the risks associated with residential investment.  They live in fear of a boiler breaking down, a roof coming off or some other major event which would require them to fund repairs.  They do not have the resources to do that.  As such, they are a very vulnerable class of people.  That is one of the motives for getting out.  That points to a wider debate which is perhaps not for this committee.  This committee can look at the rental sector, but if I may say so there is a need for the State to look at housing in a very broad way.  I would advocate the State sitting down to examine the housing system and how it interacts with the social welfare system, the planning system and all the other systems.  This could be done in a somewhat similar way to what was done for the health service.  We might get a rental sector that works better out of that.<\/p> <p>  As Deputy &Oacute; Broin pointed out, one of the problems with the current legislation is that because there have been several amendments it is getting very complex.  Many landlords see the complexity, do not know how to handle themselves and decide they need a solicitor.  That in itself is a deterrent against getting involved.<\/p> <p>  The issue security of tenure occupied more of the Commission on the Private Rented Sector's time than perhaps any other issue.  If the committee members are looking for pointers on that, the back of the original commission report contains some very good discussions of the reasons for the mechanism that was put into the legislation.<\/p><p>There are some good discussions in the back of the original commission report on why the mechanism was put into the legislation.  It is very difficult to bring in a measure of security of tenure.  If one rents from a professional landlord, a REIT or a company one has stronger security of tenure than if one rents from a private landlord.  A REIT cannot recover possession on the basis of wanting a family member to occupy the accommodation, nor will it recover possession on the basis of wanting to refurbish because the properties have probably been kept at a higher level and it will be longer before they need to be refurbished.  Property investment companies put money in for the long term and are generally not going to sell a property.  Indeed, an amendment to the rules stipulates that if such a body wants to sell a block of flats, it has to do so in phases.  A tenant gets better security of tenure when they rent from an institution than if they rent from a private landlord.<\/p><p> If we move from the present situation where there are a lot of accidental landlords to one where there are more professional landlords, that will help security of tenure.  Professional landlords anywhere in the world will say they want to keep tenants because changing tenants costs money and it is a disincentive for them for tenants to be moving all the time.  It is very hard to give security of tenure when market rents are volatile because, as soon as rents exceed the controlled levels, there is pressure to get tenants out and this can be nasty, as we have seen in other countries.  It is a very complex area and the safeguards put into legislation represent a delicate balance.  If we brought in a measure of security of tenure that did not allow a person to retrieve his or her property for their own use or that of their family, it would deter people from bringing their properties to the marketplace, thus reducing supply.  If a person goes to work abroad and fears they will not get possession of the property again, they will not rent the house.  It could have the effect of reducing supply and this needs to be thought about in great detail before we move from where we are at the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101500002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Dunne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571094000,"counter":222,"content":"<p>I wish Mr. Dunne the best of luck.

Every member has had different views on the RTB be it from the point of view of a tenant or a landlord in terms of having had bad experiences and if they have not got the outcome they wished to achieve.  It is the case that most landlords see the RTB as the enemy, as opposed to the board taking a more proactive role, which it could do.  The challenge for the RTB from a landlord's point of view is to prove that it is there to assist him or her as well; that it is not the enemy but is are part of the solution.<\/p> <p>  Equally, as we transition from accidental or small landlords to the more commercial landlords, how does Mr. Dunne see the board promoting the interaction with both tenants and landlords?  As he said, the entire area has become much more complex and that is causing problems for the accidental or small landlord.<\/p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Broin referred to resources and IT systems.  We inquired about that when the legislation was going through.  We all know of significant, bad experiences concerning the roll-out of IT in the public sector.  We are asking landlords to upload their rents on an annual basis.  Equally, we have recruitment problems in the country now.  What impact will it have if there are problems with IT and resources?<\/p> <p>  As a country, we have depended on the small landlord with one or two properties and there seems to be a move to the more commercial operation.  According to my understanding, commercial landlords are looking to the higher income level of the rental market rather than the lower and middle income levels.  Will that be a challenge in the future if they do not get involved in the lower end of the market?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101500002#L00200","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571094000,"counter":226,"content":"<p>The Deputy is correct.  Many landlords see the RTB as an enemy.  My answer to that when I was chair is that was not the board's position.  Where a landlord will most likely come up against the board's operations will be in a tribunal or adjudication.  That is not the board.  The people involved are independent and they are employed by the board.  Often, they are similar people to landlords such as solicitors, auctioneers and accountants.  Many different professions are involved and they sit and make a judgment on the cases before them.  The board does not do that, as such.  It is not the board that is against them, if one likes.  That is a mistake, but I can understand it.<\/p> <p>  I did it when I was there previously and I am pleased to know the board has been trying to make the information available on the website as accessible to landlords as it can.  That is important given the complexity of the legislation.  The board must support landlords in setting down guidelines for how they should behave so that, first, they will be less likely to get in trouble and, second, if they do get in trouble then they can get out of trouble.<\/p> <p>  I will give one particular example of that.  One of the things that landlords do not tend to do is monitor the rent coming in as assiduously as they should.  Professional landlords do that.  They check the rent coming in every Monday or whenever it is.  That is the first sign that something might be going wrong with the tenancy, and they are on top of that.  They will check and ring the person, because it is not personal.  A private landlord is often embarrassed to ring up a tenant to say the rent did not come in, ask why and refer to giving two weeks notice.<\/p><p>It is seen as coming on heavy.  That is the way the systems work.  Landlords need to be given the confidence to work the system and not to be afraid to tell tenants how it works and that if they do not manage it or do certain things, they will lose out very badly.  Landlords have to be helped and assisted in that regard.<\/p><p> Commercial landlords will be a feature of the future.  This is happening worldwide.  It is happening for macro reasons beyond Ireland as a State.  Funnily enough, commercial landlords fear regulation and legislation less than the private landlords.  They are quite happy to operate within systems of rent certainty and regulation.  The more professional landlords we have in the sector, the better the sector will be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101500002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Dunne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571094000,"counter":228,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Dunne for his presentation.  I read the opening statement.  I apologise for being delayed getting to the meeting.  I wish Mr. Dunne well on his appointment, should it happen.<\/p> <p>  I am greatly concerned about resourcing, which my colleagues have mentioned.  While there has been a rush towards additional regulation and giving the RTB more responsibility, there has not been the same rush to provide additional resources and IT systems.  Regarding annual registration, are those systems in place and robust right now?<\/p> <p>  I would like Mr. Dunne's view on co-living.  I do not support co-living at all, as it is not a solution, or even a partial solution, to our housing problem.  I was greatly concerned when reading the legal submission to an Bord Plean&aacute;la on a certain planning application.  It argued that co-living would not come under the RTB or any of its legislation because club membership would be set up.  People were to be regarded as lucky enough to be club members of the new developments and would, therefore, not be covered under the RTB legislation or any of the amendments thereto.  Has Mr. Dunne a view on that?  Has he looked into the area of co-living?  How can it be ensured people are not being exploited in such circumstances?<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to the investors.  I agree there is a role for them but the problem, which may be more at policy level, concerns the proportion and location.  In certain parts of this city and county, the market is saturated with investor and investment fund landlords.  They can effectively set the rent for the area, particularly with new units.  There was a recent application to develop 1,200 units in six apartment blocks between Dublin city and Fingal.  Almost 1,100 of the units will be build-to-rent.  That is going to a REIT or pension fund.  While there is a role for them, we certainly have to watch where the units are located and ask whether they are saturating or taking over certain parts of the market in the city.  We need to do the same for purpose-built student accommodation.<\/p> <p>  My other question is on the licence to reside.  The amendment to the RTB legislation, with which many of us present were involved, tries to ensure students have the protection of the board.  Is Mr. Dunne happy that they have the requisite protection now?  Has the board the resources to deal with the thousands of students who will come to Dublin city, generally for a nine-month period, year on year and then move to other areas?<\/p> <p>  On the proportion of renters, I was looking at figures from 1991.  Nine percent of people were in the private market whereas now the proportion is 21%.  It is of concern to me and my party that there has been such a massive move towards the rental market.<\/p><p>Others would have us believe in a further push towards public housing.  I support such a move but they argue there should be more renting of both public and private, with cost-rental models and so on.  It seems to be a continuation of the trend of reduction in home ownership and in giving people an opportunity to own their own homes.  That is probably another policy issue, given there has been a distinct move towards pushing people into the private rented sector.  <\/p><p> On enforcement of determinations, Mr. Dunne has some previous experience in the role.  It is the most frequent complaint or feedback we receive from both sides after going through the process with the RTB, which can be extensive and time-consuming, as he will know.  The enforcement aspect does not take place until the end of the process.  We debated the matter with the Minister.  A judicial determination is ultimately needed to enforce an RTB order.  While the Department argued against quasi-judicial orders, people can ignore these determinations, and I am aware of such cases currently before the RTB.  Has Mr. Dunne a view on the matter?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101500002#M00200","speaker":"1228","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571094000,"counter":230,"content":"<p>On the resources, I was happy, albeit unhappy on another level, that the recent budget has given the board an additional &euro;2 million, although it sought &euro;2.5 million.  I certainly see a case for additional resources to be given to the board.  I have reviewed the workplace plan for the board.  It has expanded its roles in the recent past to the point where I expect it to be an issue that will face me as a chairman.<\/p> <p>  In the first couple of years when we were trying to set up a system to register landlords, PPARS was in the back of our minds.  We spent a small amount setting up a rudimentary system to learn how it would operate.  The board has a great deal of intelligence in respect of how the system would operate.  As I understand, it has a programme - RTB 360 - that will implement a new management system.  I have some concern about its introduction because I share the Deputy's view that whenever one starts touching IT systems, they can be problematic.  I will have to keep an eye on the matter in the future.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of co-living, the commission spent some time examining circumstances where people shared houses and examining the relationships between them.  Often, a tenant had let somebody stay in a room and maintained his or her position as a tenant, but what was the status of the other person - a tenant or what else?  It was a form of co-living.  The formula in the Act is curious in that regard because the tenancy is the tenancy, and people become licensees within that tenancy and then can become enjoined to the tenancy.  It is quite complicated and is probably often ignored, although trying to legislate for it is complex.<\/p> <p>  The licences and other contrivances that people raise to try to keep tenants out of the agreement have to be examined in the particular case that presents before a dispute resolution.  I am sure it will happen that somebody will take one of the licences to the RTB.  The disposition of the courts in the past was always to penetrate that and determine the nature of the relationship.  If it was one of landlord and tenant, and if the written wording used between the parties was a contrivance to avoid the reality, adjudicators and the courts usually found such a contrivance was not acceptable.  Such an arrangement was found to be a tenancy, or what it claimed to be.  To some extent, that will have been an amelioration of the matter and there will doubtless be a few court cases relating to it.  When people live together in other forms of accommodation such as student housing, where they share a great deal of the accommodation, it becomes problematic because the legislation deals with a dwelling, which is defined as being capable of being lived in independently.  The co-living experience might cause some concern and may lead to some review of the issue.<\/p><p>I do not know how it will go.  It is a very small sector and I am not sure it will grow to a size where it becomes a problem.  It will always be a niche sector.<\/p><p> On the question of the move to rental, the Deputy made a good point about something I was trying to point out earlier.  These Houses, and the parties in it, must think about housing more broadly.  They need to sit down and look at the shape our housing sector will be in ten or 15 years hence.  They should take a view through the cycle and into the future.  We can use economic instruments to influence how much home ownership there is in society, how many people will be in the private rental sector and what we want in the social rental sector.  We can influence that through taxation, the social welfare system, traditions and the situations with which we all live.  We must think about this issue.  Maybe all the parties can get together, sit down and think about it.  I was part of a group of people who got together approximately a year and a half ago and we all said that the housing situation needs to be solved.  We recognised it as an acute problem and saw the issue of its cyclical nature.  The conclusion we came to was that there needs to be a collective view on how we manage housing.  I will talk to Deputy O'Brien about that again.<\/p><p> It should be remembered that the role of dispute resolution was taken from the courts and given to the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB.  That was a significant change because there is a question mark over the issue of administrative law and whether the State can create entities like the RTB to carry out functions that might be seen as the bailiwick of the courts.  There is always a tension between these Houses and the courts.  The formula that the Act came up with was that of a determination order, DO.  The intention behind it was that if the courts had confidence in the board, they would accept the DO.  The board established that in its first years and that enabled the Legislature to move the enforcement of DOs from the Circuit Court to the District Court, which makes it much easier to do. <\/p><p> It is a complex area.  My own disposition is that the DOs should be enforced by the courts and they should not look behind the issues.  That is a confidence issue.  It is important that the RTB retains the confidence of the Judiciary because otherwise the whole scheme under which it operates could fall apart.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101500002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Dunne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571094000,"counter":232,"content":"<p>I have a short and simple question.

I would add a note of caution to Mr. Dunne's optimistic view of the real estate investment trusts, REITs, on two grounds.  First, there is a growing body of evidence here and internationally that where a real estate investment trust, REIT, purchases tenanted properties, there can be an even greater insecurity because it wants to get those tenants out and replace them with a more lucrative set of tenants.<\/p><p>That is something we need to be very concerned about.<\/p><p> More importantly, given the very generous tax benefits of real estate investment trusts or Irish Collective Asset-management Vehicles, ICAVs, not just here but internationally, there is growing evidence to suggest that their involvement in the rental market, particularly those that are more short-term in nature rather than the older longer-term pension fund investors, can lead to real affordability problems.  That is something we are seeing in big cities.  I mention that as a caution.<\/p><p> On security of tenure, in section 34, we have to make a decision at some point about whether we want amateur or professional landlords.  I often use the following comparison.  If I get into a taxi and halfway through the journey, the taxi driver stops the car asks me to get out because he has to go to pick up his daughter, nobody would think that was normal but that is what we allow landlords to do.  They can enter into a tenancy agreement, but halfway through that tenancy agreement they can ask one to leave because they want to look after a family member.  I understand why that was done when it was done.  The difficulty is that it incentivises a lot of semi-professional accidental landlords.  Many of those landlords should not be in the market but we need them to stay.  At some point, however, we need to have a conversation about what it means to be professional landlord.  There is a level of regulation and certification that applies a taxi driver or a door person but that does not apply to a landlord.  I ask the witness to think about that.<\/p><p> If the budget allocation for the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, is &euro;500,000 shy of what was requested, does the witness know at this stage what will not be covered by the &euro;500,000 that has not been provided?

I will be asking that question.<\/p> <p>  On the security of tenure issue, I am not sure that kind of analogy is the same here.  The original legislation was constructed to ensure that there is nothing in the marketplace that stops a landlord offering a tenancy for 20 years or 30 years, or whatever.  The tenancy can be as long as the landlord and tenant choose.  I, as a landlord, can offer a person a house for 21 years or for the rest of the person's life and we could agree a rent.  There is nothing in the legislation to prevent us from agreeing a fixed rent for the rest of the person's life.  That is an institutional thing in the marketplace.  A very important point to remember is that if one takes on a lease, one takes on a liability and a contract to pay the rent until it is over.  It is a complex one.  There is a culture in this country that we rent for a short time and not for long time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101500002#P00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Dunne"},{"type":"speech","time":1571094000,"counter":238,"content":"<p>Is this a culture or a consequence of a legislative framework?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101500002#P00300","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571094000,"counter":239,"content":"<p>We could have a debate about that.

In fairness to Mr. Dunne's contribution, he made the point that the commercial landlord is more tuned in, more aware and is watching for things, and is mindful if the rent not coming in.  What the commercial landlord, however, does not do, that the amateur landlord does, is that it does not have the same relationship with the tenant.   The RTB has said that it is critical that there is a relationship between the tenant and landlord, so that when there is a crisis with the tenant, sympathy can be expressed, or if there is an issue, they can work things out.  That does not necessarily work in the commercial field but it works with the amateur or accidental landlord.

I am grateful for the opportunity to appear before the joint committee in respect of this Bill, which I believe is very important.  I agree that an agency such as that envisaged by the Bill should be established as one of the tools available to the State to address the complex necessities of creating a sustainable housing sector.<\/p> <p>  Development land does not just exist.  Rather it is created by putting together parcels of land, legal rights, technology in the form of infrastructure and planning rights to produce a developable site on which accommodation can be provided for housing and other purposes.  This process of site creation usually takes place in response to market signals such as high prices, which provide the incentive to people to produce the sites demanded in an active property market.  However, in housing as with all forms of property, the process whereby this happens is complex.  Importantly, each parcel of land is heterogeneous and will have a singular set of circumstances to be addressed to create a developable site.  Putting together complexity with uniqueness results in the need for bespoke processes, which is one reason property development takes time. <\/p> <p>  If one thinks of a property development site as a product used by developers, a useful insight can be grasped.  It is only one of the inputs required to produce accommodation, the others being materials and labour.  With such an insight, it can be appreciated that someone or some entity must perform the function of pulling the inputs together.  These inputs, the land, accessible infrastructure, permissions and the finance needed to fund the creation of a developable site must be drawn together in the right way so that development on the site will be optimum.  <\/p> <p>  The State in the normal course of its operations will use land and, at times, an individual parcel of land may cease to be used for the original function.  Such land surplus to previous requirements should be put to new uses according to the priorities of the time and as efficiently and effectively as possible.  For instance, right now, housing is a priority and any surplus land could be made available to provide for housing.  In the past, for instance, the acquisition of industrial land was a priority and IDA Ireland had some functions in this area.  One way of doing this is simply to sell the land on the market and allow market forces to work to produce housing.  However, the property market, more than other markets, is not sufficiently effective to enable this simple strategy to work as well as it might if the market was efficient.  Hence the requirement for some agency to act as the conductor of the process whereby any particular site will be provided to property developers in a form that will allow them to do what they do best, namely, develop property.  Often that conductor will be a developer putting together a site as part of their pipeline of projects to keep them in business.  Given the finance costs and risks, speculators perform this function but may fail for some time to assemble the right blend of inputs or be thwarted for an uncertain period by something outside their immediate control.  <\/p> <p>  The State will always need development sites to produce social and, depending on market conditions, affordable housing.  Acquiring sites in competition with more agile and well resourced market participants, however, will often pose a problem and can result in the state increasing development land prices if it competes in a vibrant market.  Taking a longer through the cycles approach, and in the interests of the common good, it can be a properly empowered agency of the State that is best positioned to draw the inputs together to produce development sites, particularly in the case of surplus State land.  The creation of an agency such as the one envisaged in this Bill, therefore, will provide the state with one of the tools it needs to facilitate a properly functioning housing sector and I support the creation of this agency.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101500002#R00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Dunne"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571094000,"counter":251,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to attend this session as part of scrutiny of the Land Development Agency Bill.  I will outline the policy context, then expand on specific objectives of the Bill and whether they are met.  There is little detail in the heads of Bill and some of my commentary is based on statements made in this House, in the media and at public events.<\/p> <p>  The fundamental issues are housing affordability, sustainable growth and a resilient construction industry.  All are critical to competitiveness and economic stability.  Missteps come at high environmental, social and economic costs.  All three are areas of significant past failures where Government policy calls for reform.<\/p><p> In 2016, the National Competitiveness Council pointed out that a well-functioning housing and construction sector is critical to the overall health of society and the economy.  It warned: \"The current escalation in residential property costs represents perhaps the greatest threat to Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness.\"<\/p><p> Since then the median price of a new-build home nationally has increased from under &euro;250,000 to &euro;355,000, or by 44%.  The prohibitive cost of housing is a barrier to urban growth, which is a priority of Project Ireland 2040.  Furthermore, if our cities are not affordable to families, the direct result is sprawl, which undermines the climate action plan, reduces productivity and limits opportunities for employment and education.<\/p><p> Last year, the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, identified land management as key but, more critically, the council pointed out that it is not only about land; it is about fixing Ireland's broken system.  Land is one lever for change, but the housing system is broken.<\/p><p> Last week, the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, informed the committee that rising house prices can be explained by disposable income, demographics, jobs being created and the cost of finance.  However, unaffordable prices are also a factor of limited capacity, little competition and high barriers to entering the sector.<\/p><p> Housing supply tied to a speculative market in a boom-bust cycle results in overpriced housing and uncertain supply.  Solving this problem requires specific action to support capacity building in the sector, to open markets to competition, to raise standards, and to support employment and training. <\/p><p> In this context, the LDA proposal raises a number of specific issues.  On its remit, the proposed powers are wide ranging and removed from direct Government controls.  It is unclear whether the LDA is bound by current and future Government policy.<\/p><p> On governance, commercial property development and construction involve large sums over long periods, which expose the State to significant financial and political risks.  It is critical to have high levels of specific expertise, robust governance, transparency, external oversight and means of intervention. <\/p><p> Freedom of information is essential for ensuring public confidence, transparency and accountability.  Given that lobbying legislation has specific provisions for planning because of the risks of corruption and the significant sums in land transactions and development contracts, the activities of all personnel of the LDA should be included in the statutory lobbying register.<\/p><p> The Bill proposes a new land registry. Setting up this land registry in another State agency with relevant expertise on a statutory basis would reduce administration, mitigate the potential for conflict of interests, and ensure alignment with best practice.<\/p><p> On spatial planning, the Bill includes lands in urban centres with a population in excess of 10,000.  This extends to 41 towns in regional centres such as Cavan, Tullamore and Killarney, and in commuter belts such as Ashbourne, Greystones, Cobh and Skerries.  Twenty seven of these 41 towns are in Leinster, with nine in Munster, three in Connacht and three in the three Ulster counties.  This arbitrary classification has implications for transport, infrastructure and regional development.<\/p><p> I will elaborate on a number of issues, specifically those not mentioned by other witnesses.  On construction reform, the Construction 2020 plan reflects on the \"speculative greed, short-term thinking, poor planning and low standards\" of the boom that resulted in \"unmanageable mortgages, debt overhang, negative equity ... and sub-standard apartments\".  It recognises the \"need to develop an overall strategic approach to housing supply\".<\/p><p> This proposal for 150,000 homes is a planned investment of more than &euro;50 billion in the construction industry.  It has the potential to be transformative.  However, indications are that there is no strategy for construction, other than to outsource development to large entities, as a means to lever social and discounted housing in a package of 60%, 30% and 10%.<\/p><p> An approach that outsources control of price, delivery speed, housing mix, quality and profit margin is high risk and it comes at a premium, as has been seen in other capital projects.  Large entities that control local markets can also lead to high prices, low quality, and suboptimal conditions for construction subcontractors and suppliers.<\/p><p> In the current conditions, it is not sites that are unviable; traditional speculative development is unviable.  This is what is broken, and it is potentially the Achilles heel of the LDA proposition because the objective of optimal use on a commercial basis for individual sites is the business of traditional speculative development.<\/p><p>It seeks to extract the maximum value from land through high market prices and minimal standards and is very vulnerable to market fluctuations.  This is unlikely to lever reform or bring stability in output and price.  Relying on speculative markets for delivery is also very uncertain.  The Rebuilding Ireland target of 125,000 new homes in five years lacked the levers to ensure delivery and in the first three years only 47,000 new homes have been built, which is 38% of the target.<\/p><p> With regard to construction costs, where land is available and actual construction is derisked from speculative markets and high cost finance, it is affordable.  This is confirmed by the figures of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government for competitively tendered social housing.  In most urban centres production costs of &euro;220,000 are achievable.<\/p><p> Solutions to the supply and affordability challenge lie in design, procurement and finance.  I do not intend to comment on the issue of finance other than to say evidently &euro;1.25 billion will not build 150,000 homes; it will build fewer than 5,000.  However, housing, unlike other capital projects, can be built incrementally and seed funding rolled over by phasing and strategic procurement.  State-led master planning and infrastructure can de-risk development, mitigate delays and reduce costs and finance for SME developers.  Unbundling, which means making small lots for SME design teams and builders, can open new markets, raise standards, drive innovation and create more competition.  Public contracts in small lots for SME builders can allow them to recapitalise, re-equip and undertake other private developments, which builds capacity in the sector.  Mass procurement of building components, standardising details and investment in research can lead to efficiencies, productivity and skills.  Affordable housing is defined in the Planning and Development Act.  It is based on production costs, not on a discount on market value.  These are more resilient and recession proofed strategies that accord with best practice in procurement, value for money and faster delivery.  These market reforms and efficiencies have the potential to deliver truly affordability housing without State subsidies or reduced quality.  The Land Development Agency's proposition does not respond to this opportunity.  In fact, the recent redefinition of affordable housing as a discount, or subsidy, on market prices is regressive because it will profit developers, rather than improve access to housing for those on middle incomes, or incentivise efficiency in the sector.<\/p><p> At the rate at which we are building homes, every new home needs to be future-proofed for 100 years.  Only 1% of housing stock is being replaced annually.  A short term objective of commercial returns is wholly inappropriate in assessing the long-term social, environmental and economic needs and life cycle costs of new housing communities and their infrastructure needs.  A &euro;50 billion investment in housing has the potential to lever many other policy objectives, including reform of the construction sector, climate adaptation, architecture and placemaking, training and skills, infrastructure, transportation and spatial planning.  However, a requirement to obtain a financial return for the State, as required by the LDA, is not compatible with affordability.<\/p><p> What is important is the long-term viability of cities, not the short-term opportunity of sites.  Every euro of value extracted from public lands is not free; it is debt for future households.  Every plot given away is a lost opportunity to provide for permanent affordability.  Every deal that stalls due to unforeseeable market fluctuations is a family without housing.  Ireland has the advantage of having a lot of land in public ownership ,but as the National Economic and Social Council stated, affordability should be an explicit objective.  Supply of housing is not in itself a reliable or sustainable means of making housing affordable.  Ireland must re-engineer affordability into the supply of housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101500002#R00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Orla Hegarty","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571094000,"counter":254,"content":"<p>I thank the joint committee for giving me the opportunity to present to it.  I welcome the idea of managing in a co-ordinated way public land for the benefit of the public.  It is vital to deliver the national planning framework and address some of the housing supply issues.  However, the Bill seems to be premised on supporting the use of public land in conjunction with private actors on a commercial basis for profit.  There is an underlying ethos of marketisation and the privatisation of public assets and using their value as a means for the private sector to deliver public housing and other building and infrastructural projects, as opposed to the public sector delivering them.<\/p><p> As currently formulated, the heads of the Bill are thin on specifics regarding the LDA's role and operation.  It would seem more appropriate to call it the \"Land Development Company\" as opposed to the \"Land Development Agency\".  To my mind, an agency is more of a public actor and facilitator and more about policy formulation, oversight, regulation and so on.  The LDA, however, is very much set around a commercial basis and is effectively being set up as a semi-State company.  The word \"agency\" seems a misnomer.<\/p><p> It is not clear where the liability falls if the LDA's schemes or groups fail.  This matter does not seem to be covered in the heads of the Bill.  If there is a large State investment in projects and those projects fail for whatever reason, I am unclear as to where the liabilities will lie.<\/p><p> It is also not clear how the LDA would work in practice with local authorities and other public landholders or which entity has priority or control of decision making.  If land is held by a local authority, semi-State agency or State agency and the LDA is interested in using it as part of a development, who has power and control and who gets to say that the LDA will use that land or can a public body decide not to co-operate with the LDA?  Since the power relationship is not set out, I am unsure as to how the LDA will perform its work in practice.<\/p><p> Most of my comments concern governance, oversight and open government issues.  For example, there is no detail of how the board of the LDA should be appointed other than it should be appointed by the Minister.  If this is a public agency, then it should be appointed through the State boards process and appointees should have skill sets appropriate to the work of the LDA.  Ideally, there should be representatives from various sectors, including the public sector, industry, civil society and academia.  It should not be loaded with developer interests.<\/p><p> The LDA will be exempt from the Freedom of Information Act.  This seems problematic, given that the LDA will be given up to &euro;1.25 billion.  The public should have the right to know what work has been undertaken, supposedly for their benefit.  The LDA should be available to answer FOI requests, with specific queries that have commercial sensitivity being assessed on a case-by-case basis as to whether information can be made available rather than a blanket exemption.  A large amount of public funding and potentially a large level of public liabilities are involved.<\/p><p> I am not entirely certain who owns the LDA.  For example, will 100% of its shares be held by the Government or will other interests be able to own shares?  Under heads 24 and 25, it is certainly the case that the Government would be able to sell shares.  This raises questions around a public agency that has some level of private ownership, given issues of a conflict of interest with other entities and of providing a private entity with access to public information, which would appear to give the entity a competitive advantage.  Including a provision to privatise a public agency raises issues.  In that context, to what extent would there be public accountability?<\/p><p> Head 36 concerns the review of the LDA's achievements.  It is vague and essentially just states that the Minister will assess progress.  Perhaps it would be more suitable to stipulate that an appropriate set of expectations, targets or benchmarks would be set by the Minister or the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that the performance of the LDA would be assessed against over certain periods.<\/p><p>It is difficult to judge performance or hold a body accountable if there is no sense of what it is seeking to achieve and what satisfactory or successful outcomes would look like. <br\/><br\/>On Head 32, the national public lands register, in my view, given the demand for open government and the Government's commitment to it, the public lands register should be open data and it should be made available through <i>data.gov.ie<\/i>in suitable formats and also as data layers in <i>myplan.ie<\/i>.  This should be written into the heads of the Bill rather than hope it occurs voluntarily.  I do not accept there is commercial sensitivity around identifying the location of public land, which agency owns or its current status.  In my view, this information should already be public knowledge, as it is in other countries.<br\/><br\/>Do we really want to have in place an agency which would be allocated up to &euro;1.25 billion of public money, in which there is no openness and transparency in terms of appointment of the board and the assets it manages, which is exempt from freedom of information and public scrutiny, which can be semi-privatised or fully privatised and which has no defined method of expectations, targets or benchmarks?  In my view, the answer is &quot;No&quot; and I would encourage some review of the governance mechanisms around the new entity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101500002#T00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Rob Kitchin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571094000,"counter":257,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Kitchin for his opening statement and I now invite Dr. Donal McManus to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101500002#V00200","speaker":"1304"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571094000,"counter":258,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for inviting the Irish Council for Social Housing, ICSH, to engage with it today on the significant issue of the delivery of homes across Ireland.  I am accompanied by Ms Karen Murphy, ICSH director of policy.  The focus of our opening statement is the approved housing body, AHB, sector and land supply.<\/p> <p>  The ICSH is the national federation of housing associations with more than 260 AHB member organisations that collectively own and manage over 35,000 homes at affordable rents for families, older people, people with disabilities, homeless and single people.  The AHB sector has had a commitment to developing and managing social housing over the long-term and addressing the changing needs of the population.<\/p> <p>  When the Land Development Agency, LDA, was initially announced it was very much welcomed by the sector and the ICSH.  For some time, the ICSH had advocated that there was an urgent need for the strategic management of State lands with an appropriate tenure mix.  In our view, when it comes to the development of valuable State assets, the public interest is best served by ensuring that a significant proportion of social and affordable housing is built on State lands.  Housing associations need State lands in addition to private lands to deliver social rented homes affordably.  It is a simple equation - the low cost of land should feed into lower costs to deliver social and affordable homes for the taxpayer.<\/p> <p>  We welcome the proactive role being adopted here by the State in the management of land.  In particular, the ability to drive strategic land assembly is a strong power which will be deployed for the public good.  Any interventions which drive down the cost of land for housing are to be welcomed and supported.  In our view, the current 10% social housing mandated on land development agency sites as a minimum is too low and just matches the Part V requirements on private sites.  The LDA is currently active in delivering more than 3,000 homes on State lands.  We would hope that within the 3,000 homes currently being delivered the social element is significantly higher than this and we acknowledge that the LDA stated view is that 10% is a minimum.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the proposed legislation, we would sound a note of caution in regard to the commercial remit of the proposed company.  While there are significant differences between the current proposal and the NAMA legislation, in our view the commercial remit of NAMA meant that the social dividend came at a commercial price.  We would hope that the LDA will enable the provision of social and affordable housing at a lower cost overall to the Exchequer. <\/p> <p>  On Head 8, in regard to the \"objects\", we would like to see the delivery of social housing, affordable rental housing and affordable purchase as part of its remit.  The LDA potentially has a significant role to play in the expansion of a cost rental sector in Ireland and explicit objectives to achieve this should be included.  We welcome the register and would recommend a review of the previous housing land map to ensure all State and semi-State mapped land is up-to-date and accounted for.<\/p> <p>  On Head 9, we would like to see an explicit relationship between the LDA, AHBs and local authorities for the provision of housing and related amenities.<\/p><p>The LDA should have the power to enter into agreements with local authorities and AHBs, which will be regulated by the State under the new Housing (Regulation of Approved Housing Bodies) Bill 2019.  Compulsory purchase order, CPO, powers would also be a necessary addition to their functions.<\/p><p> Regarding the potential management of housing by the LDA, in our view that is not that body's central objective and should be carried out by local authorities and AHBs.  If the LDA becomes a large-scale landlord, it will be distracted from its central functions and objectives.  A question would also arise concerning the LDA then coming under the regulation of the RTB as a rental housing landlord.<\/p><p> The drafting of the legislation should explicitly provide for the use of the Public Appointments Service, PAS, in the recruitment of board members because transparency on governance arrangements is crucial.  In addition, if we look at the nation&rsquo;s changing demographics, we know that a much greater percentage of new housing must come in the form of lifetime adaptable housing.  That will enable a growing number of older households to age in place.  We suggest that, at a policy level, the new LDA should be guided to deliver within its plans a percentage of homes for older people, as well as accessible homes.  That will assist the Government in meeting its housing policy objectives.  The LDA should also have powers to set standards to support and achieve Government objectives in areas such as energy efficiency and zero carbon and lifetime housing, to name just two examples.<\/p><p> To conclude, and linking the future outputs of AHBs to land, last year the sector provided 3,219 social homes.  That was some 38% of the national total social housing output and was the highest ever recorded by this sector.  More than 4,000 households were taken off the social housing waiting list.  As a sector, there are challenges to continued delivery at a high level and the availability of sites which are zoned, serviced and have planning permission will greatly assist the AHB sector in scaling up its future delivery of homes.  I welcome any questions the committee members may have. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101500002#V00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Donal McManus","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571094000,"counter":260,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. McManus.

Turning first to the use of public lands, most of the objectives and functions of the LDA relate to the use of public lands.  One area the committee might consider is the level of long-term control of public lands and the level of ownership that should be kept by the State and local authorities.  I refer to retaining ownership, in some cases, and leasing that land so that control is retained.  The balance of control of lands that should be retained by State is open to debate.<\/p> <p>  The Housing Agency will initially be transferring three sites in Skerries, Balbriggan and Naas to the LDA.  To date, the board of the Housing Agency has applied the principle when transferring lands that such lands have to be used for public or community purposes.  Transfers already undertaken to local authorities or AHBs have been for social and affordable social housing, schools or community use.  The Housing Agency desires that lands in its ownership which are transferred to the LDA would, in the main, remain in public control in the long term.  It is also important that the LDA is given support when lands are transferred to it from Government agencies and organisations.<\/p><p>The first big issue is how should we use public lands, what long-term control should we have in place and what is appropriate.<\/p><p> The second issue is housing supply and affordability.  One of the main objectives is for the LDA to deliver housing on scale to help address the housing crisis, of which a key element is affordability.  We want housing that is affordable to buy or rent in the main in terms of what is being delivered on sites under the control of the LDA.  We need a mixture of tenures and income groups to build good communities.<\/p><p> Semi-public uses would entail social housing use, cost-affordable rental and affordable purchase housing.  There has been much debate about rental versus ownership, but it is a question of getting the balance right.  There is a need for both in our housing system.<\/p><p> The advantages of providing affordable rental housing are that the land is kept in public control and investment can be put in place to fund developments, which ensures certainty of delivery.  Building in scale also helps to reduce market rents.  Home ownership advantages are that it gives people a clear stake and equity in their properties and provides security, particularly compared with the private rental sector.  People will also have a long-term asset as their mortgages are repaid.  It is a question of getting the balance between rental and home ownership right.<\/p><p> The third issue I wish to highlight is climate change.  It is critical that the LDA's developments be sustainable and that climate change be taken into account therein.  None of us appreciates the scale of the climate change problems we are facing.  In that context, the agency needs to consider how its developments will work in ten, 30 or 60 years.  Perhaps the approach should be to ask how a development undertaken today will be perceived in 30 years.  A development should not be considered from today's perspective.<\/p><p> We must ensure that we comply with the national planning framework, particularly as regards compact growth in our towns and cities where the LDA is focused.  We must ensure an adequate density, particularly density of population, to support public transport and public infrastructure and reduce car usage.  It is important that sustainability be a key aspect of the developments undertaken by the LDA.  The agency should be a leader in this regard, particularly compared with the private sector.<\/p><p> These are the three key issues: how to use the public lands and what level of long-term control should we keep; affordability and how to focus on getting housing supply delivered; and how to take the climate change agenda into account in delivery.  We are happy to answer members' questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101500002#W00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. John O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571094000,"counter":267,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Connor for being so considerate of the committee's time.

I am a strong supporter of active land management and would like to see a strong, well-resourced public agency whose function is, in the first instance, to manage public lands strategically.  However, I am in an increasingly uncomfortable dilemma, in that the more I read the heads of the Bill and listen to various views, the more I see that is not what we will get.<\/p><p>All the other stuff in this legislation undermines the part we all would like to see.  I am concerned that the proposed land management functions of the agency will be very weak, particularly with the absence of compulsory purchase order, CPO, powers.  While the Department has indicated that there will be amendments on Committee or Report Stage, it says they will provide for very limited CPOs for small parcels of adjoining land rather than something more significant.<\/p><p> My main concern, and it speaks to some of the comments today, is the commercial residential development element of this proposition.  My question for everybody, and particularly for Mr. O'Connor, is: do we need to combine those two things?  Would it not be better to have an active land management agency whose job is to manage public land strategically and where that land is to be used for certain purposes it would be handed over to, or the agency would engage with, local authorities, approved housing bodies or the IDA to develop it?  The LDA would be about land, not residential development.  It is not an exaggeration to say that if this legislation ends up in the current format, we are potentially facing a National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, mark two.  When I said that in the committee two weeks ago I thought Mr. John Coleman would recoil from it, but he was kind of nodding at that point - one can look at the committee meeting recording to see it - that it is a different vehicle but is heading in that direction.<\/p><p> I do not wish to pick on Mr. O'Connor but the other witnesses have been very clear and I want to hear a little more about the Housing Agency's view.  I know Mr. O'Connor is on the board and that puts him in a difficult position but his job is also to provide advice to the Government on housing policy.  I wish to tease that out.  Other witnesses should feel free to intervene but they answered many of my questions is their opening statements.  First, at a time when we desperately need a large volume of social and affordable housing, and Mr. O'Connor said at the agency's annual conference last year that he did not think the political system fully understood the scale of affordable cost rental we need, is it correct to limit the LDA to a 40% quantum of social and affordable public housing or should it be bigger?  Both the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, and the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, said last week that it should be bigger but I wish to hear the Housing Agency's view on it.<\/p><p> Given that the bulk of the developments will be joint ventures where the LDA, as an independent commercial designated activities company, will be creating special purpose vehicles with other market actors, is that the best way to achieve the affordability that Mr. O'Connor wishes to see?  Looking at the O'Devaney Gardens development, it is clear that the model, whatever one thinks about it in theory, will not deliver affordability.  I am also concerned about, and the ICSH referred to this, the tension that inevitably will emerge between its social objectives, vague as they are in the legislation, and its commercial requirements.  What happens when there are conflicts?  Section 10 of the NAMA legislation said that NAMA not only had to have a commercial return, but the maximum commercial return.  In this case it is different, but I am interested in Mr. O'Connor's view on how we can ensure that the need for social and affordable housing becomes the key driver.  Social and affordable housing is not even referenced in the aims and objectives of the Bill.  Should it be referenced in the aims and objectives?<\/p><p> I seek the views of all the witnesses on CPO powers.  They are not provided for and, clearly, they must be.  What type of CPO powers are needed?<\/p><p> I had not thought previously about the point made by Professor Kitchin.  Where liabilities will fall if a project fails is an important point.  Mr. Coleman was clear when he appeared before the committee that the LDA would be setting up special purpose vehicles.  The possibility of those things ending up badly, for example, in a downturn or a hard Brexit, is not unreasonable.  Do the witnesses have views on that and on how to protect ourselves from it?<\/p><p> To pick up on a point from Professor Kitchin, we asked the Department about the sale of shares.  The officials were clear that shares could only be sold internally within the Government from one Minister to another and two Ministers would have sole ownership.  Regardless of whether that is in the final Bill, Professor Kitchin highlighted the need for us to be careful that the final legislation does not allow the sale of those shares beyond the Government.  That is what the current position is.<\/p><p> Some 60% of this housing is going to be sold at open market price.  We will have the odd Shanganagh and get a little more here and there, but for this entity to remain off-balance sheet, it must be independent of the Government in its governance.<\/p><p>It must be a market operator and the lion's share of what it does must reflect market realities in terms of investment decisions and prices.  The question I am putting to the witnesses is: \"When did it become the responsibility of the State to provide open market priced housing?\"  All of our housing legislation is about meeting social or affordable housing need, yet the policy of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government is actually saying that 60% of these developments should be available for the open market.  How did that change in policy happen because it almost seems to have happened at a quiet policy level in the Department and it is a fundamental shift on which I would like to know the witnesses' views?<\/p><p> I thank the Chair for his indulgence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101500002#X00300","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571094000,"counter":272,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Broin.

Yes, there is an absolute need for active land management.  I think it is important to have the Land Development Agency actually involved in development because many of the sites are very large, so one needs an organisation with the skills to deliver on the development of those large sites.  I think the two roles can be combined.  It is also important for the Land Development Agency to use approved housing bodies and local authorities, where appropriate.  Let me explain what I mean by that.  In some cases it might be best for the Land Development Agency to do the master planning of a site, put in the infrastructure on the site and then parcels of that land may be developed by the Land Development Agency, the local authority, approved housing bodies or others.  The Land Development Agency working with the local authorities would do the master planning, fund infrastructure and ensure the development happens but it also needs to include the involvement of local authorities and approved housing bodies.<\/p> <p>  The view of the Housing Agency on the long-term ownerships of land, and how it has acted, is that it has normally tried to put land into the ownership of the local authority in that the local authority will be there in the long term, whereas the Housing Agency will not.  In some cases the Housing Agency has transferred land to approved housing bodies.  <\/p> <p>  There is a combination in terms of active land management and development.  In terms of the development model, I think much needs to be driven directly by the Land Development Agency in terms of having the developments designed and constructed again in conjunction with the local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies.  Where there is a form of joint venture, I take note of Deputy &Oacute; Broin's point about the need to be careful in how things have worked out in other developments, but we must work out what is required and utilise the skills of the private sector to have the developments constructed and delivered quickly.  The Land Development Agency, should work on its role as a developer.  <\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the provision of social and affordable housing.  Let me clarify the position.  My understanding of the Government's decision was not necessarily related to the Land Development Agency.  It was in respect of the sale of any lands by a State body; the State body must sell the land on the basis that 10% of the land will be used for social housing and 30% for affordable housing as a minimum.  If it was within the control of the Housing Agency, the preference would be to specify much higher levels of social housing and affordable housing provision.<\/p><p>To take the land in Skerries, for example - it is one of the initial sites on which the Land Development Agency is working in consultation with the Housing Agency and Fingal County Council - the desire is for one third of the units to be social housing, one third to be affordable housing to rent and one third to be affordable housing for purchase.  In the case of smaller sites, nearly 100% of the units might be public housing.  It depends on the site involved.  It is up to the Minister and the Oireachtas to decide how to write the affordability and provision of social housing in to the mandate of the Land Development Agency, but they must be written in in order that its obligation to deliver will be clear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101500002#Z00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571094000,"counter":275,"content":"<p>Does Mr. O'Connor mean that they should be written into the legislation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101500002#AA00200","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571094000,"counter":276,"content":"<p>I will leave it up to the Minister and the Oireachtas to decide how best to nail it down.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101500002#AA00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1571094000,"counter":277,"content":"<p>Does Mr. O'Connor believe it would be better to include it in the legislation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101500002#AA00400","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571094000,"counter":278,"content":"<p>It has to be a clear part of the agency's mandate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101500002#AA00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1571094000,"counter":279,"content":"<p>That is fair enough.

The Deputy mentioned the tensions between social objectives and commercial requirements.  I alluded to the broader cost of some of these developments.  Mr. O'Connor has just mentioned the land in Skerries as an example.  Skerries barely meets the requirement that a town have a population of 10,000 people to be eligible.  Building 250 houses will raise the population by nearly 10%.  If one looks at the site purely from a commercial perspective, there is obviously development potential.  However, road and rail infrastructure to Skerries is already at capacity, while drainage and water supply services are under pressure.  It is the antithesis of the national development plan to provide more housing in a commuter town 30 km from Dublin if there is not the capacity on public transport.  If the objective of the LDA is achieving consolidated growth, many of the towns appear to be repeating some of the mistakes of the past.  They are commuter towns, developed at low densities, within reach of Dublin.  There are broader issues in respect of the tensions between policy objectives and the broader costs of extending schools, widening roads and increasing capacity on public transport.  They may not be reflected on the balance sheet of the LDA, but they will be in the costs to other Government agencies.<\/p> <p>  My second point is related to open market rates.  It does not come from the Bill but from other policy statements made in this area.  My reading of the situation is that the figure is 90% for market rate housing, of which 30% will come at a discount on the market rate.  The Planning and Development Act 2000 specifically refers to affordable housing being made available at the cost of providing it.  The situation is the same in respect of Part V social housing.  The redefining is a recent development which comes from the United Kingdom.  Effectively, it is the case that the figure will be 90% for market rate housing, of which 30% of which will come at a discount on the market rate, with the cost, one presumes, being subsidised by the other units in some way.<\/p> <p>  My third point is that this will make everything vulnerable to market pressures.  If 90% of the deal or joint venture is based on the sale price for the 90% of houses that will be sold at market rates, it is vulnerable to a market in which we have no control over the sale prices of houses.  They are subject to many external and internal pressures.  There could be an external economic shock that will knock 10% to 15% off the cost of housing.  This is not within our control, yet a deal will be linked with anticipated market sale prices.  That is where I see a high risk of failure.  Even when deals are made - they are a long way out and will involve a lot of money - if there is a shock to market prices for any reason such as a rise in interest rates or some other factor, these large propositions will be at risk.  It goes back to the question of future liabilities.  There is provision for other financial instruments to allow the LDA to raise finance for these developments and get involved in joint ventures.  People do not realise that, when developing and getting involved in procurement at that level, the site is compromised as soon as the deal is signed.  As we have seen in the case of the national children's hospital and other infrastructural projects, one cannot reverse out of such agreements.<\/p><p>The site is already used, the deal is bought into.  There are potentially very open liabilities here on these sites.  If it is 90% dependent on market rates for housing and the State is getting into very large transactions, it is potentially very risky.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101500002#AA00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Orla Hegarty","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571094000,"counter":282,"content":"<p>I support the idea that the agency should have compulsory purchase powers.  That is very necessary.  For example, one thing that bedevils property development or site assembly and slows it up is one often finds flaws in title.  The title may prohibit a particular form of development that might need to go on the site.  The agency would need power to compulsorily acquire that, otherwise the agency could get into a situation where it was held to ransom.  I very much support it having compulsory purchase powers.<\/p> <p>  The compulsory purchase powers available to the State are very complex.  I imagine the agency would not use them widely.  Many protections are built into the system of compulsory purchase.  I would not be particularly worried about the agency going off and buying stuff, using its powers to buy things that it should not buy.  The agency would need the powers for the specific reason I gave.

Ransom strips are probably the easier side to do as they are small parts of land but beyond that there is also compulsory purchase order, CPO, powers for other public bodies.  I am not clear if the Land Development Agency would be first among equals.  There is a body that is trying to assemble land, that is part of its function.  If other public bodies do not agree to that, is it still possible to use CPO powers?  Whether the land agency is first among equals is really the key issue in the whole Bill.  The onus is on the other public bodies to say why they cannot give land for housing.  It should be on them to do that, otherwise one is doing much chasing around to try to get land.  CPO powers will be key for the small bits of land.  Also, the Land Development Agency should be the leader in negotiations with other public bodies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101500002#BB00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Donal McManus"},{"type":"speech","time":1571094000,"counter":284,"content":"<p>That is a fair point.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101500002#BB00400","speaker":"1304"},{"type":"speech","time":1571094000,"counter":285,"content":"<p>I genuinely appreciate the detailed, thoughtful submissions.  The committee met with the Department for pre-legislative scrutiny, as well as with the Land Development Agency and other stakeholders, at the outset.  This continues.  I would reiterate a point I made to the Department and the Land Development Agency that we are doing this the wrong way around.  The Land Development Agency has been established for more than a year by a ten page statutory instrument which established an agency which received &euro;17.5 million in funding in the budget but it does not have any land and has no legal powers in real terms.  We discussed this with Mr. O'Connor.  I understand that no land can be transferred to the LDA until the legislation is in place and establishes the agency and its powers.  We are doing this the wrong way around because there is an assumption in the Department and by the Minister that this approach will have support.  The more I see it, and the more we delve into the heads of the Bill and the contributions by stakeholders, the more concerns I have with this approach.  I think most of us are agreed, and know I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Broin, that we need a land management agency.  We need a co-ordinating agency that can assist on this.  What I do not want to see is a vehicle that effectively privatises and further outsources the development of State-owned land and abrogates responsibility for the delivery of public social and affordable housing.  I do not mean to feed into any kind of speculation at the moment but we might consider the legislative and electoral cycle.  How can it be that for legislation of this importance we only have heads of Bill?<\/p><p>We have not seen the draft Bill.  I have put the officials on notice that we will not accept significant amendments on Committee or Report Stages as happened with the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 and other recent Bills from the Department.  I cannot see how in the time remaining in this Oireachtas this legislation will pass.  There are too many unanswered questions.<\/p><p> Veering away from the policy areas, which I understand can pose a difficulty for Mr. O'Connor, if we take Ms Hegarty's example in Skerries and Mr. O'Connor's example in Balbriggan, two areas that happen to be in my constituency and that I am familiar with, how much preparation had the LDA and the local authority done on the delivery of those sites?  The LDA told the committee a few weeks ago that little, if any, work had been done in the preparation of the eight or nine sites it had for delivery of social and affordable housing.  That is contrary to the information on the ground, particularly in regard to Castlelands and Skerries.  Is another agency needed or will this complicate the delivery of these lands and further delay the delivery of housing there?  I would like Mr. O'Connor to elaborate on the desire of the Housing Agency that land transferred to the LDA be primarily used for public purposes and long-term control  be retained.  I support that but if the ratio of homes to be delivered on the land is 60:30:10 and, taking Ms Hegarty's point, which I agree with, that the other 30% is at a reduced market rate affordable housing model, it is effectively 90:10.  We would relinquish 90% of the lands that we own under that model.  How does that sit with the Housing Agency's view that Mr. O'Connor has put before the committee? <\/p><p> In respect of the Lobbying Act 2015 and FOI, Professor Kitchin and Ms Hegarty have mentioned concerns about the exemptions from the Freedom of Information Act and the Lobbying Act, which I have also raised at the committee.  Are there reasons the exemptions outlined in the heads of the Bill would apply?  Why would the agency seek a clear exemption from FOI?  Are there, in some instances, genuine commercial reasons for that?  I agree with Professor Kitchin that there is no reason the public register of lands could not be published; perhaps others do not.  There was a type of register on the Department's website where we could see lands that are in ownership. <\/p><p> I agree with the notion of affordable rent for public housing.  Affordable purchase comes under the 2000 Act.  I agree with the witnesses that there cannot just be a discount on market price.  We keep chasing the market price.  Is it their view that one does not have to dispose of the land to deliver affordable purchase as well as cost rental and affordable rent?  Models in other countries deliver a true and equitable stake but it is not necessary to dispose of the land to do so.  Perhaps the witnesses can elaborate on how they see that being done. <\/p><p> I commend the ICSH on its work.  It is in an invidious position making an input to this because we had a long discussion a couple of weeks ago about the on or off-balance sheet issue.  All of us who have spoken publicly on this want the issue addressed and want the AHBs to be off-balance sheet, as in other countries.

The Deputy is correct that Fingal County Council had got that to an advanced stage.  The possibility with the Land Development Agency is with the complete site.  The Balbriggan site is at Castlelands - the Hampton land - which is a large site of 24 ha.  Fingal County Council has been working for many years on a master plan for that site and is still setting out that master plan to get it approved by the members.  The council was at an advanced stage of planning on it.

Fingal County Council was just being careful about how it approached that and about the timing and phasing of the development.  In terms of long-term control of State lands, it is most important that we do not have a situation in ten or 15 years' time whereby the State does not have land.  The Housing Agency lands were effectively funded by the State and our view is that the bulk of the Housing Agency land should be retained in public ownership.  In the transfer of that land and the form in which it is done, control should be kept in place.  In respect of land from other organisations, for example the HSE, it might be a case that they need funding for other purposes in terms of hospitals and so on.  It is a question for the Oireachtas as to the level of State control that should be retained in those sites.  The 10% and 30% are minimum figures.  The view of the Housing Agency is that in both cases, the social and affordable housing on those sites should be provided at cost.  There should not be a land cost in the provision of affordable or social housing on those sites.  The land should be subsumed to start with.  We need to look at how we are controlling State lands and if one looks at other countries, they tend to keep long-term control.  Often it is by way of leasing the land for 100 years or whatever and, depending on the use, whether one has to pay for that or not is dealt with by local authorities or by the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101500002#DD00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John O'Connor"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571094000,"counter":291,"content":"<p>The Deputy mentioned the balance sheet issue.

The issue is finding some way to have a parallel system through leases, community land trusts or something else that creates a secondary market in housing, affordable to people within their own means but not competing directly with the private market.

The Chairman has me worried about naming other examples but a lot of money was lost in the Docklands on certain sites and State agencies were investors in sites when the crash happened.  A lot of money was lost by State agencies.  There are potentially significant liabilities.  In that case, hundreds of millions of euro were lost, which was not an insignificant amount.

The more we go through the Bill, the more holes we find in it and the more questions are raised about it.  How we manage land now and into the future is how we will develop affordability, so we are considering critical legislation.  Something is needed to try to control and manage land but I do not know if this legislation is the vehicle to do that.<\/p> <p>  Over and again I have addressed my concerns on over-marketisation and privatisation, as mentioned by Professor Kitchin.  Ms Hegarty also mentioned commercial viability and profit.  This is referenced throughout the heads of the Bill.  If we keep using that terminology and keep looking for that return, we can never deliver affordability.  This is because we are not just looking at land costs; we are looking at the market value of land costs.  It does not work as a starting point.<\/p> <p>  We all have concerns regarding oversight.  Deputy O'Brien had negotiated a &euro;6 million cap for local authorities to spend, up to stage 4, before they had to go to the Department for approval.  Clearly, the Minister is now saying that this will not happen and that we do not have faith or trust in the way local authorities do their work to give them this sanction, yet, the Government will hand &euro;2.5 billion over to an organisation with what we believe are significant issues in respect of transparency and oversight.<\/p><p>Perhaps we might get the delegates' views on that matter.<\/p><p> Ms Hegarty has mentioned that the policy will change because of the circle of Governments.  We have discussed on a number of occasions whether the legislation should include a minimum number of affordable or social houses that need to be delivered, rather than depending on what Government will be in power tomorrow.  It all comes down to delivery.  <\/p><p> On the issue of land use and how we control same, Ms Hegarty mentioned something that I was following, namely, a State-led process of drawing up master plans for infrastructure.  The other issue is whether infrastructure is more critical than sites.  If all of the land zoned in Ireland was of tomorrow morning to have infrastructure, would it help significantly in delivering affordability?  If so, tools such as site taxes and vacant site levies could be used to trigger it.  Perhaps I am wrong, but Ms Hegarty seemed to suggest the State would draw up master plans for towns with a lot more detail.  Perhaps she might expand on what she said.  We could lay out clearly how every town would be developed, provide the infrastructure and then unbundle it, as Ms Hegarty said, before phasing it and delivering it in sections.  I had not thought of unbundling until Ms Hegarty mentioned it this morning because it is quite apparent that the construction industry is relying on a number of key contractors to deliver.  We have lost the small and medium-sized builders that were able to build schools or 20 houses.  They have been nearly wiped out completely.  That is not good for the market because we are seeing that because of the margins large construction firms are beginning to demand more and more.  This is adding to the challenge in delivering affordability.<\/p><p> We cannot proceed with the Bill.  I cannot see us supporting it under the current policy under which 60% of homes are private, 30% are affordable and 10% are social.  It is not a model I can support in moving forward.  It goes back to whether it should be included in the legislation.  <\/p><p> As I have lost my train of thought, I might come back in later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101500002#FF00800","speaker":"1357","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571094000,"counter":309,"content":"<p>The Deputy has asked more than enough pertinent questions, but he is more than welcome to come back in in a second round of questions.

The legislation is in place.  The local authorities have the power to develop master development plans and local area plans; they just need the resources to do so.  There is a hierarchy of plans from national level to regional level to local level.  The advantage in the local authorities carrying out the function is they have the expertise and the planners.  There is a broader remit.  As they also carry out their local housing strategies, it is a case of having joined-up thinking, rather than duplicating the effort somewhere else, if the resources are provided to enable the local authorities to do this.<\/p> <p>  Unbundling has been done successfully elsewhere in Europe.  In drawing up a local area plan the local authority will know roughly what infrastructure will be provided on every site and what its capacity will be.  That in some way will put a cap on the value of land because it will already be known what will happen.  Providing the infrastructure means that builders can plug in on the edge of a site, be it for street lighting, drainage, water services or whatever else.  It also means the roads will already have been built.  It also means that there will be channels for lots of smaller SME builders to become involved.  One of the issues that is a real barrier to expanding the construction industry and the creation of gainful employment concerns how fractured it is and it has become even more fractured.  There are large entities at the top that might be receiving a lot of public money, as in the example of Carillion, but that money might not be filtering its way down under the terms of the public contract.  Rather, it might be filtering down in private contracts into subcontracts to people who are often working in difficult employment conditions.  They might be unable to take on apprentices or carry out training or they might be waiting for long periods to be paid.  All of this makes employment precarious and it is a barrier to young people becoming involved in construction.  What it all means is that the sector is fragile.<\/p><p>If we want to rebuild, we will need the SME builders and the people who perhaps have a contract for ten council houses, out of which they can buy machinery, take on an apprentice and buy a piece of land for a private development.  That is how we will build capacity in the housing sector and get some competition going.  The other difficulty with bundling these large sites is that there is very little competitive tension if there are few entities which can tender for this work.  If the tendering is for small builders, there will be a lot of competition in the market and people whose standards fall short can be weeded out and the work can be prioritised with those who do a good job.  In bundling into large entities, all the work is subcontracted and it is very hard to track where the poor practices are.  It is also hard to include social and other clauses that could be put into public procurement that would improve some of the other issues in the sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101500002#GG00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Orla Hegarty","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571094000,"counter":312,"content":"<p>We are all agreed that active land management is necessary, is a useful thing for local planning and for large-scale strategic spatial planning and is key to the national planning framework and being able to deliver on that.  The real issue is how it will do this.  We are pretty poor at infrastructure.  We tend to build the housing and then try to do the infrastructure afterwards.  We do not have a strong track record, with a few exceptions such as Adamstown and so on, of thinking about the infrastructure going in before or at the same time as the housing goes in.  There potentially will be a move towards doing that in the Land Development Agency with proper master planning towards co-ordinating and putting in infrastructure at the right points and making sure of that.  It is very evident in places such as the unfinished housing estates where there were houses but no roads, water, sewerage or street lighting because of the point at which they failed.  In other countries it was the other way around.  Photographs on Google Earth in 2009 showed that in the US, there were the roads and infrastructure but the houses were missing because the infrastructure had to go in before everything else so that when people move in they have what is needed.<\/p> <p>  Co-ordination of that would make a lot of sense.  If that does not happen and pressure is put on the transport or health systems, because only the housing estate is dealt with and nothing else around that is co-ordinated, then that becomes a problem.  It needs to move towards larger-scale local development plans where there is joined-up co-ordinated planning around that, as opposed to just developing specific sites.  If we get into the business of creating specific sites, we will create a series of other related issues around schools and health centre capacity, water or sewerage or whatever else.  In other European countries, development companies like the certainty of planning.  Construction companies like knowing what will be developed over the next 30 or 40 years.  They know their phasing, they know there is certainty in the market and that this is almost certainly going to happen.  They like the certainty and profit.  They are often not looking for mad profits but for a good 5% or 6% return.  They are not looking to make a huge buck and get out.  It would be positive if we can move towards that.  Whether our developer or construction industry would like that is a different matter but perhaps we can move the planning mindset onto having much more co-ordinated long-term planning.  The Land Development Agency is a good vehicle to do that and we should be landbanking.  We know the population will go up by 500,000 over the next 20 or 30 years and that we are going to have to build infrastructure and so on and we should be doing it in a co-ordinated way. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101500002#HH00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Rob Kitchin"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571094000,"counter":313,"content":"<p>The question of active land management and the issues around that is one of the great deficiencies of our planning system and needs to be addressed for sure.  I did not see this agency as being a particular way of doing that but thought that it would have a role in it.  The sense I got from the legislation was that it was intended to take lands that are already in the ownership of the State in various forms, which are often just there and are not needed for the purpose for which the entity that holds them is going to make use of in the future, so the question about such lands is what does one do about them.<\/p><p>The option preferred by the local authority, the HSE and other agencies is to flog that land, to put on the marketplace and see what happens.

Active land management and the related issues are a different question.  While I agree with a lot of what has been said about active land management, which is one of the great deficiencies in our system, this is meant as a more specific agency, which I believe the State needs.  The State has a management agency in the Office of Public Works, OPW, which largely looks after the management of properties used by the State.  The Land Development Agency is intended to take the lands that are no longer needed by the State and which must be put to some other use.  With the current crisis in the sector, the most logical thing to do with all that land is to use it for housing, if it can be converted to that purpose.  Some 15 or 20 years down the road we might have a shortage of land for industrial purposes, as we had in the past.  This agency is intended to perform a more specific function.  It should not be opposed because it does not perform a range of other tasks which are definitely needed in our planning system, like active land management.  That is why when I read this Bill I felt the State needed a tool like this agency to perform this specific function.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101500002#HH00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Dunne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571094000,"counter":315,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Dunne.

I would like to return to Mr. O'Connor's point about the Land Development Agency providing master plans and servicing sites.  My question relates to Ms Hegarty's comment.  Local authorities already do that.  We have just agreed a very substantial strategic development zone for Clonburris.  Local authorities have a huge amount of skill and expertise.  Adamstown, also in my constituency, is a good example of that.  The value of those processes is that they have some democratic input and some public consultation and engagement.  Not only did the LDA lack any of these skills when it was set up, thereby being obliged to acquire them, it lacks the statutory requirement to engage with elected representatives or members of the public.  I still do not see what added value the LDA provides that we could not have got from better-resourced local authorities, including master planning and site servicing.<\/p> <p>  Moreover, because we are spending a lot of time talking about residential development and all the associated difficulties, we are not talking about active land management as much as we should.

The first was already mentioned; this agency will take Donnybrook bus garage from the CI&Eacute; or vacant lands in Cork from the HSE and will use them for something better.  However, the Government also talks about other active land management functions.  We are not getting proper sight of that.  If people have models of best practice, perhaps they could share them with the committee. <\/p> <p>  Partly because he sits on the board of the LDA, I am interested in Mr. O'Connor's response to Ms Hegarty's point about affordability being delivered by cost rather than by market discount.  The published figures for O'Devaney Gardens really show the risk of applying the market discount.  We are told that two-bedroom apartments and three-bedroom houses will retail for approximately &euro;310,000.  That is at a discount of 35%.  That means that Bartra Capital has priced those units in at &euro;477,000 before knocking off a discount of 20%.  The State then steps in and cross-subsidises a further discount through its equity share.  While the house will be sold at &euro;310,000, Bartra Capital will be paid &euro;370,000.  If the affordable purchaser ever buys out that equity, he or she will essentially have paid &euro;340,000, &euro;350,000 or &euro;360,000 for the house.<\/p> <p>  That can be compared to the cost model, which I know Mr. O'Connor strongly advocates and which &Oacute; Cualann Cohousing Alliance and others have delivered.  This would deliver exactly the same house or apartment for &euro;250,000.  Given these figures, how can we ensure that the LDA delivers affordable units on the basis of the economic cost of delivery, rather than large companies' inflated market tenders at a discount?  Given the heads of the Bill, I fear the price will be the market value minus the discount, rather than the cost.  This will not merely fail to guarantee affordability; affordability will not be available at all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101500002#JJ00800","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1571094000,"counter":322,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for keeping to his allotted time.

As part of devising local area plans, they do more detailed master planning, although that is not currently the case throughout the country.  It is done to a limited extent but there needs to be more of it.   If the LDA has control of large tracts of State land, it can assist in the master planning.  While it will have to work with the local authority in question, it will have the ability, and potentially the funding, to deliver the infrastructure upfront.<\/p> <p>  On affordability and affordable housing, we often get caught up with the market value and the market rent.  We should approach it with the intention of determining the cost of delivering the housing.  If land has been provided at no cost, we should seek to determine the minimal cost of building a house while ensuring a high quality and that the long-term maintenance costs are low.  We should consider it from a cost base, rather than be sucked into viewing it from the perspective of the market and trying to discount from there.  We should focus on the cost of delivering the housing and on the builder, who wants to be paid a normal return with a modest profit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101500002#KK00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1571094000,"counter":324,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Connor and call Ms Hegarty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101500002#KK00300","speaker":"1304"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571094000,"counter":325,"content":"<p>On the market value versus the cost of production, another current issue is the cost of finance.

It comes from reducing the value of the price of the land when it is bought initially.  The person who pays that is the landowner.  I am not objecting to this as I believe it should be done that way.  Theoretically, land prices should be really low.  They are really just evidence of scarcity.  The way to solve that problem is to manage the process of land administration properly and to have a supply of land on the market regularly that meets the demand.

In the past, there were very good examples of where sites were provided for affordable housing.  The old low-cost sites scheme of local authorities was very much localised.  It was a national scheme but it was rolled out fairly well.  Most of our sector expanded on the basis of the scheme.  A small builders scheme linked into this structure activated the construction market over time.  Confusion arises sometimes when trying to create a structure in addition to supports to deliver land.<\/p> <p>  Maybe the mechanism was initially for larger sites but we see it applying to smaller sites also.  I refer to the ability to impose a CPO on land and to then use a mechanism such as the low-cost sites scheme to deliver housing.  One can link the two together.  It is not an either&ndash;or situation.  Some initiatives worked very well.  The low-cost sites scheme was a real driver of our sectoral expansion, as well as for individual owners wishing to build homes.  Small builders schemes, as mentioned, attached conditions to how land was used and to building standards.  Sometimes people over-complicate things.  What is driving this may be a discussion about the market operator.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin referred to this.  The starting point is probably the market operation and how this could be passed by EUROSTAT and not be on the balance sheet, as with Irish Water.

We are joined by witnesses from Mental Health Reform, the Clanwilliam Institute, the HSE, and Dr. Brian Keogh from Trinity College Dublin.<\/p> <p>  We welcome everybody here this morning.  It is the third meeting of the committee, each of which have focused on mental health.  Following the meeting on 24 September, last week we heard powerful and stark testimony from Martin Reilly.  He gave a harrowing, first-hand account of suicide and its impact in his life and on his family.  Mr. Bernard Joyce of the Irish Traveller Movement reminded us of the statistics and the rates of suicide among Travellers from the well-respected and authoritative 2010 all-Ireland Traveller health study.  Suicide among Traveller men occurs at a rate seven times as high as among the general population and the rate among Traveller women is six times as high.  The Irish Traveller Movement estimated 30 deaths by suicide to the end of August.  That estimate was not made lightly.<\/p><p>Dr. Brigid Quilligan of Kerry Traveller Health Community Development Project spoke of the hurt and causes of Traveller mental ill health, enduring long-standing racism, hate speech, prejudice and discrimination towards her community.  Ms Minnie Connors from Wexford also shared her personal experiences of everyday racism, hate speech, prejudice and discrimination in her life, and its effect on the mental health of her family and friends.<br\/><br\/>Mr. Patrick Reilly of Pavee Point, who is present in the Gallery, spoke of the everydayness of suicide in his community and brought attention to the State's response and cuts that still have not been reversed.<br\/><br\/>Last week we heard from Thomas McCann of the Traveller Counselling Service, echoing and amplifying testimonies from the 25 September hearing.  He also referenced the 2010 all-Ireland traveller health study, the shocking findings of which have been ignored.  He spoke of indifference and inaction by the State in the face of the facts.  He spoke of the limitations of goodwill and the need for real political will and leadership.  He called for three specific actions, namely, the establishment of a national Traveller mental health steering group; the development of a national Traveller mental health strategy; and allocation of necessary resources to ensure its implementation.<br\/><br\/>Ms Sandra McDonagh from the Offaly Traveller Movement gave a stark account of mental health among Travellers in that county and the devastating effect on her community.  She spoke of a colleague who had lost eight first cousins to suicide.  She echoed Thomas McCann's observation of indifference and asked the Government how it can watch her people suffer and die, and do nothing about it.  She outlined an approach in Offaly, entitled &quot;Travelling to Well-being&quot;, which is showing positive results and should be supported or replicated.<br\/><br\/>Ms Bridget Kelly from the Galway Traveller Movement said that addressing the mental health needs of her community should be a priority.  She drew committee members' attention to &quot;just therapy&quot; an approach developed in New Zealand.<br\/><br\/>Ms Niamh Keating spoke of how mental health issues were affecting Travellers in west Limerick.  She referenced a recently completed baseline study among Travellers in Clare.  Findings include 94% of people surveyed saying they had experienced discrimination and 87% saying they worry about discrimination some or most of the time.  That anxiety can be the context for mental ill health.  She also brought the members' attention to a peer-to-peer youth mental health strategy having a positive impact.  However, like all such initiatives, it needs to be put on a firm funding footing and adequately resourced to do its job.<br\/><br\/>Ms Maria Carnicer from Exchange House Ireland talked about the social determinants of good mental health, including access to safe living conditions, adequate housing, educational opportunities and meaningful engagement in work and society.  She said that 90% of the people seeking support from Exchange House Ireland had experienced trauma.  She spoke of the need for culturally competent front-line mental health services.  She referenced the approaches of eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing, EMDR, and contextual-conceptual therapy, CCT, which notes that feeling suicidal is not a mental illness, but an attempt to create a life without intense emotional pain.  I thought that was a very interesting observation and worth noting.<br\/><br\/>Given the prevalence of suicide among Travellers, we may be able to reflect that the Traveller community is experiencing that intensity of emotional pain individually and collectively.  That is why we are here today.<br\/><br\/>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, and officials from the Department of Health.  We are also joined by Senator Joan Freeman, Ms Kate Mitchell from Mental Health Reform, Dr. Brian Keogh from Trinity College Dublin, Dr. Aileen Tierney from the Clanwilliam Institute, Mr. John Meehan and Dr. Siobh&aacute;n N&iacute; Bhriain.<br\/><br\/>In accordance with procedures, I am required to draw attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.

From these meetings with Traveller community organisations and representatives advocating on their behalf, it has become increasingly clear that suicide and mental health are issues of growing concern within the Traveller community.  I noted with sadness the recent contribution from Bernard Joyce of the Irish Traveller Movement to the committee.<\/p><p>It is accepted that suicide rates are higher among the Traveller community when compared with those in the general population.  To try to address this, the Traveller community was included as one of 23 priority groups at risk of increased risk of suicide under Connecting for Life, Ireland's national strategy to reduce suicide.  Connecting for Life is a national and local strategy, with 17 local plans launched throughout the country.  Progress under the national strategy is overseen by an implementation and steering group comprising cross-departmental and agency representatives.  Each local plan involves local teams, including a resource officer for suicide prevention, local HSE staff, members of the Garda, county and city councillors, local community groups and others as relevant.  Furthermore, A Vision for Change, Ireland's overarching mental health policy document acknowledges the importance of specific service developments for vulnerable groups, including the Traveller community.<\/p><p>The 2010 all-Ireland Traveller health study commissioned by the Department of Health continues to provide the benchmark for measuring progress on Traveller health.  It found that approximately 60% of Traveller men and women said their mental health was not good enough for one or more days out of the past 30 compared to approximately 20% in the general population.  The health inequalities experienced by the Traveller community are rooted in the social determinants of health that encompass accommodation, education and employment.<\/p><p>Despite the reported higher levels of ill mental health, take up of mental health support services in the Traveller community remains lower than the general population.  The fundamental challenge of members of the community dying younger, having more illnesses and being at greater risk of substance misuse and mental health issues remains.  Addressing this challenge is a priority for the Government.<\/p><p>The national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy was launched in 2017 and contains 34 actions assigned directly to the HSE or the Department of Health.  The strategy contains a set of specific actions aimed at improving the lives of the Traveller and Roma communities in Ireland.  A key action of the strategy is to develop and implement a detailed action plan to address the health needs of the Traveller community.  The lead role in developing this action plan rests with the HSE.  A draft plan has been circulated and work is ongoing to finalise the plan.  Responsibility for this action plan lies with the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne.  The Minister of State and the Department are fully committed to ensuring the implementation of the plan.<\/p><p>More generally, since 2012 the budget allocation for HSE mental health services has increased from &euro;711 million to almost &euro;1 billion, which is an increase of approximately 27%.  The Department of Health and the HSE have been developing several e-mental health initiatives targeted at increasing access to services for difficult-to-reach groups, including the Traveller community.  These initiatives include telepsychiatry and telecounselling pilots, a new accessible website, <i>yourmentalhealth.ie<\/i>, the development of a crisis text line and a mental health signposting service in the national ambulance service.<\/p><p>The Department of Health, through the HSE, provides funding in the region of &euro;10 million a year for programmes specifically targeted at improving health outcomes for the Traveller community, including primary healthcare projects, counselling, dedicated public health nurses, mental health promotion and culturally sensitive suicide prevention services.  A further &euro;500,000 is provided through the Dormant Accounts Fund for initiatives aimed at improving Traveller mental health, such as providing mental health community development workers and mental health advocacy workers for Traveller organisations.<\/p><p>The HSE National Office for Suicide Prevention funds Exchange House Ireland to address the mental health promotion and suicide prevention needs of the Traveller community in a culturally sensitive manner.<\/p><p> The Government recognises the need for a sustained effort in addressing mental health inequalities between the Traveller community and the general population.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019101500002#D00200","speaker":"1261","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571094000,"counter":360,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State and call on Senator Freeman to make her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019101500002#E00200","speaker":"1430"},{"type":"speech","time":1571094000,"counter":361,"content":"<p>I welcome the formation of the committee and the focus it will put on mental health in the Traveller community.  As most of what is in my submission repeats what has been said, I will edit it as a I move along to focus on what I want to speak about.<\/p> <p>  I will jump straight into it with the crisis within general mental health services and the unacceptable inadequacies and underfunding in many key areas.  Whatever I say, it is not directed under any circumstance at the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly.  We have had serious problems in mental health services for decades, whereas the man has only been in position for two years and is trying his best.  Everything I say is directed at the Department of Health because no one is listening in it.<\/p> <p>  I was Chairman of the Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care which laid out in its final report in 2018 that there was much about which to be concerned in the availability and implementation of mental health services.  This does not just relate to Travellers but to all of Ireland.  That warning was also articulated in the Mental Health Commission's 2017 annual report.  Such a note of alarm from the State's statutory body for the quality assessment of mental health services should be a sobering check for all legislators about the reality of service provision.<\/p> <p>  As a vulnerable group in society, a lack of adequate service provision is particularly detrimental for the Traveller community.  As we have all highlighted, members of the Traveller community are less likely than average to reach out for help with their mental health.  Forgive me for ad libbing, but I heard a suggestion last week of integrating services for the Traveller and settled communities.  That will not work.  We need to train people in the Traveller community in how to prevent suicide, offer therapy and look after their own.  We have gained a reputation for being inaccessible, not compassionate; therefore, this is the only way we can start taking that small first step.<\/p> <p>  The committee will rightly be concerned with addressing the stigma and other barriers that create this disconnect, but all efforts will be for nothing if the services are not available when someone looks for them.  There was the \"Let Someone Know\" advert, but once we let someone know, what then?  There are no services to follow up.  Let us consider, for example, the lack of consultant child psychiatrists in child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, in Wexford in the past year.  A lady is present who has spoken about losing eight people in her family to suicide.  People have been urged to reach out and look for help, but they have not been rewarded by the provision of support or even access to the inadequately staffed support services.  This apathy is not just for the Traveller community.  It is for all children.<\/p> <p>  The Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care devised good solutions and suggestions on how to help the Traveller community.  We acknowledged that there was a crisis in the Traveller community and knew the statistics, but let me be brutal.  I am afraid that the report of the Joint Committee on Key Issues affecting the Traveller Community will be added to the 12,000 other reports that are gathering dust in this organisation.  Someone needs to do something different.  We will have a new Government in a few months' time.  We do not know who the Taoiseach will be, but I appeal to that person to nominate someone from the Traveller community to the Seanad in order that we can have someone on the inside who will devote his or her term to tackling the problems of the Traveller community.<\/p> <p>  I am sorry for always being so cynical.<\/p><p>This committee may end up like the Joint Committee on Future of Mental Health Care in terms of the promise that it would be allowed to continue its work and it not having done diddly squat for a year now.  The Taoiseach promised that he would allow that committee to continue.  Where is it at?  We have to stop kicking the can down the road because every time we kick it an inch someone else has died.  I call on the Government to not only prioritise implementation of some of the suggestions that we have made over the years in respect of the Traveller community but to make mental health a priority.  If we do not have our mental health, we have nothing.  <\/p><p> I apologise for going off script, but I am pretty passionate about this issue.  I am concerned that the eyes of Government glaze when it comes to mental health, children and the Traveller community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019101500002#E00300","speaker":"1428","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571094000,"counter":363,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Freeman for her contribution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019101500002#F00200","speaker":"1430"},{"type":"speech","time":1571094000,"counter":364,"content":"<p>I apologise but I have to leave at this point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019101500002#F00300","speaker":"1428"},{"type":"speech","time":1571094000,"counter":365,"content":"<p>I note the Senator's passion.

The purpose of this committee is to examine Traveller community life and, in particular, mental health within that community.  In this regard, we are asking the Traveller community to come forward and tell us their experiences and, thus, this committee is taking on the responsibility for the future mental health of the Traveller Community.  I hope it will not meet the same end as the Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care, which, as mentioned by Senator Freeman, has not met for the last year.<\/p> <p>  Last year, &euro;55 million was allocated to the mental health sector.  A number of the mental health organisations have made the point that &euro;25 million of that allocation has not yet been spent.  Is this correct?  The Minister of State might respond \"yes\" or \"no\".  If so, why has it not been spent?  A number of the Traveller groups contacted members of the committee and asked us to specifically raise the following questions with the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly.  Will the Department of Health commit to supporting the implementation of the national Traveller health action plan, including ring-fenced funding and the establishment of an institutional mechanism with the HSE and the Department of Health to drive its delivery and implementation?  Why has Traveller health not received any development funding since 2008, as opposed to once-off funding, given health inequalities and the findings of the all-Ireland Traveller study in 2010?  Why has the Department of Health not provided targeted resources to address the Traveller mental health crisis given disproportionate levels of suicide and poor mental health?  Will the Department of Health commit to providing resources to Traveller mental health from the additional &euro;39 million allocated in budget 2020?  Why has the Department of Health not implemented the recommendations of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Future of Mental Health Care?<\/p> <p>  As discussed over the course of our meetings to date, the Traveller community feels that across the board in all Departments Travellers are not regarded in any way; they are treated as second and third class citizens.  The view was expressed that future reforms across Departments should be proofed from the point of view of the Traveller community.  It is important Traveller community issues are put on the agenda such that they are not left behind, as they feel they have been up to now.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019101500002#F00500","speaker":"1306"},{"type":"speech","time":1571094000,"counter":367,"content":"<p>Deputy Joan Collins has raised some very specific questions to which I now invite the Minister of State to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019101500002#F00600","speaker":"1430"},{"type":"speech","time":1571094000,"counter":368,"content":"<p>Many questions were raised.  Deputy Collins might remind me if I miss any one of them.  The Deputy asked for a \"yes\" or \"no\" response on whether &euro;25 million of the &euro;55 million allocation for last year has not been spent.  The answer is \"no\".  There is &euro;12 million yet to be spent and there is two plus months of this year remaining to spend it.<\/p><p>I am meeting representatives from the Department and the HSE tomorrow, as I do every couple of months, to review our spending targets and commitments on that front.  Another question concerned new development money for Traveller mental health initiatives.  I will ask the representatives from the HSE to address that more specifically, but I will state that new development funding is intended to roll out new models of care into communities.  Examples would include eating disorders and any model of care for mental health and intellectual disability, MHID.  We also have many different programmes for adults and children in communities, and Travellers can access these services and specialist teams.  <\/p><p> We view Traveller mental health as something that requires a whole-of-government response.  Mental health is a symptom and it has an impact on Travellers and the entirety of the Government has to take responsibility.  We could just narrow this issue down, look at it through the prism of mental health and, if it were decided, set up dedicated specialist teams for Travellers' mental health.  There are, however, many other minority groups and we cannot establish dedicated teams for each of those.  We prefer to see groups established in the community and issues with access being addressed in that way.  Those services must be culturally sensitive and there must be culturally-appropriate communications in order that people know how to reach out to and access those services.  We prefer that model as opposed to establishing specific services.  <\/p><p> Specialist programmes have been set up to address Traveller health.  Exchange House Ireland receives about &euro;1 million each year.  I understand that programme has helped about 8,000 Travellers.  There is also a &euro;10 million programme for promoting Traveller mental health and wellness, in addition to the &euro;500,000 I mentioned already from the Dormant Accounts Fund.  Overall, the budget for mental health is more than &euro;1 billion.  Some 1,027 different services are available in communities.  When I came into this job, I asked how many such services were available and nobody had the answer.  I also asked how people knew about the services that existed.  That is why the phone line now established in the national ambulance service went live last week.  More than 1,000 services in the community are now available and accessible through that one phone number and I want to create awareness of that initiative.  <\/p><p> This discussion has to be helpful and focused on improving access to the services available, as opposed to creating individualised services for minority groups.  The most important thing is to ensure people can access those services and we must support them in doing so.  I already outlined the targeted resources for Travellers.  Turning to new development funding for Travellers from 2020, again we are open to suggestions.  No one in this room has a monopoly on the wisdom regarding the right thing to do.  I certainly do not, so I am very happy to hear any suggestions from this committee on ideas for new developments to support Traveller mental health specifically.  I state that because it is a crisis.  There is no doubt about that at all and we want to support and assist in addressing this issue in every way possible.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019101500002#F00700","speaker":"1261","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571094000,"counter":370,"content":"<p>Is Deputy Joan Collins happy that her questions have been answered?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019101500002#G00200","speaker":"1430"},{"type":"speech","time":1571094000,"counter":371,"content":"<p>The Minister of State referred to &euro;12 million outstanding or having to be spent in the coming two months.

It is not for me to cast my eye over the history of the State's treatment of people.  As I have acknowledged, this is a crisis.

The State has responded to suicide overall with the establishment of the National Office of Suicide Prevention and Mr. John Meehan, head of the office, will talk in more detail about the issues.

That is the reason it has been tasked for a whole-of-Government report led by the Department of Justice and Equality, which is the lead agent in driving issues affecting Travellers.  Mental health is more of a symptom of the malaise of the treatment of Travellers than itself being an issue.  There are developments all of the time.  For example, the online space and crisis text line is being developed as we speak and we hope it will be available in a number of weeks.  Crisis Text Line has had phenomenal success throughout the world, giving people access to support and help at a time of dire need and preventing suicide.

We welcome its establishment and the attention it is giving to the important issue of mental health in the Traveller community.  Mental Health Reform is the leading national coalition on mental health, with over 75 member organisations, including groups such as the Traveller Counselling Service, Exchange House and Pavee Point.  We work together to drive progressive reform of mental health services and supports.  In its manifesto, published in 2012, Guiding A Vision for Change, Mental Health Reform identified that community mental health services had a duty to meet the mental health needs of all members of the community, including those in the Traveller community.  Mental Health Reform also highlighted that the particular challenges of some minority and marginalised groups such as members of the Traveller community led to social exclusion and increased mental health difficulties.  Mental Health Reform has since published a position paper on ethnic minorities and mental health which documents the challenges such individuals, including from the Traveller community, experience in accessing appropriate mental health services and supports.  Such challenges include reports of lack of quality in care, communication barriers, over-reliance on medication, negative experiences with staff, the cost of accessing supports and experiences of inequality and discrimination.  Perhaps most important of all is the reported lack of understanding among professionals of individuals' social and cultural context and a sense that the mental health system has been designed to reflect the majority culture.  Such a lack of understanding and appreciation of Traveller culture makes it impossible to provide mental healthcare in a way that respects that culture and fulfils Travellers' human rights to culturally sensitive care.  To clarify, when we speak about cultural competence, we are referring to the attitudes, behaviours, knowledge and skills mental health services and staff need to have in order to deliver culturally responsive mental health services, while recognising that such competencies must incorporate the addressing of power imbalances and institutional discrimination.<\/p> <p>  In 2016 Mental Health Reform published, in partnership with the Mental Health Commission, guidelines for mental health services and staff on working with people from ethnic minority communities and delivering culturally sensitive care.  The key recommendations outlined in the report include that staff and services respect the diverse beliefs and values of the people using the services; the provision of communication and language supports; the facilitation of family and advocate involvement in providing support and training for mental health staff, to include reflection on inherent cultural biases and the evaluation and review of the delivery of culturally sensitive services.  It should include the establishment of an ethnic identifier to collect data for service utilisation, equity of access and quality of service for persons from ethnic minority groups.<\/p> <p>  I would like to highlight two key points in my opening statement, the first of which is that the experiences of social exclusion and discrimination felt by the Traveller community increase the risk of mental health difficulties.  These issues must be addressed effectively if we are to improve the mental health outcomes of this community.  The second point is that the lack of culturally sensitive mental health services results in the particular mental health needs of members of the Traveller community not being met.  This must be addressed as a matter of priority.  <\/p> <p>  With regard to social exclusion and discrimination, the all-Ireland Traveller health study, published in 2010, identified discrimination as being a major problem for all Travellers.  There were significant numbers of accounts of it directly influencing mental health, leading to feelings of depression and anxiety and suicide.  A report published in 2017 by the Community Foundation for Ireland identified that 77% of Travellers had experienced discrimination in the previous year.  Some 43% indicated that they had encountered discrimination while accessing employment.  High rates of unemployment and poverty, over-representation in prisons and experiences of unsuitable accommodation among members of the Traveller community continue to be reported.  There can be no doubt but that they are compounded by cuts to Traveller services in recent years.<\/p><p>As outlined in Travelling with Austerity, significant cuts to Traveller infrastructure were highlighted, including cuts of more than 80% to Traveller education and Traveller accommodation and more than 70% of cuts to equality programmes.  The community and voluntary services that provide essential mental health supports to Travellers at local and national levels must be acknowledged.  These services, however, are often under-resourced and operate on insecure funding streams and budgets.  Under human rights law, the Government is obliged to &ldquo;ensure that health services are culturally appropriate and that health care staff are trained to recognise and respond to the specific needs of vulnerable or marginalised groups&rdquo;.  At national level, the Government&rsquo;s current mental health policy, A Vision for Change, recognises that mental health services should be inclusive of all people in Irish society and should be delivered in a culturally appropriate way.  This sentiment is reflected in Mental Health Commission&rsquo;s quality framework.  The requirement to meet the particular needs of the Traveller community has also been committed to in Connecting for Life, the national intercultural health strategy, and more recently the national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy.  While these commitments are welcome, to date there has been a severe lack of implementation and policy is far removed from what is happening in practice.<\/p><p> It is anticipated that the revised mental health policy, due to be published later this year, will have a greater focus on developing mental health services for particular groups of people, including those from the Traveller community.  Mental Health Reform continues to hear reports that the Traveller community feel their mental health needs are being ignored, notwithstanding serious concerns about high rates of suicide and mental health difficulties within the community.  Many Travellers feel there is a lack of engagement with the Traveller community and where their concerns are voiced they often fall on deaf ears.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Future of Mental Health Care acknowledged that clearly there is a mental health crisis in the Traveller community, and that mental health services are failing Traveller people the most.  In its October 2018 final report the committee recommended \"that the Department of Health carry out a study to identify the causative factors [of mental health difficulties] to include a priority focus on the Traveller Community, and how they can be addressed\", and that \"more resources and funding should be targeted at the areas of highest need with particular attention to the Traveller Community and towards addressing suicide.\"  There is no doubt of the need to implement in full the recommendations of the Oireachtas committee, including those pertaining to the Traveller community.  There is a fundamental need to adequately address the mental health needs of the Traveller community through national policy with the voice of Travellers at the heart of the process, and to effectively resource and implement such a policy.  Traveller-specific infrastructure, including local community groups and primary healthcare projects, must receive adequate investment through sustainable funding.  Mental health services and supports must be developed to deliver culturally sensitive services and to ensure equity of access and quality of care among the Traveller community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019101500002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Kate Mitchell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571094000,"counter":406,"content":"<p>I remind Ms Mitchell of her time.

I am an assistant professor in mental health nursing at the school of nursing and midwifery in Trinity College Dublin.  In my statement I will draw from work that was completed in Carlow and Kilkenny during 2018 when we evaluated the role of the mental health liaison nurse, a post introduced to support Travellers who were experiencing mental health difficulties.<\/p> <p>  Travellers are not a homogenous group and care must be taken not to apply stereotypes and make assumptions about their needs or abilities.  An individualised approach is required and approaches that are sensitive, non-judgmental, unrushed and respectful will assist towards meaningful engagement.  The importance of relationships, the development of trust, privacy and confidentiality should not be understated.  Recovery-orientated approaches should underpin all services and interactions with Travellers.  Meaningful involvement of Travellers in the design and delivery of services is essential.<\/p> <p>  Cultural competence training should be mandatory for mental health service providers who are in close contact with Travellers on a regular basis.<\/p><p>Any strategy to support the mental health of Travellers needs to consider the social determinants of health and how they can impact negatively on the mental health of Travellers.  For those who are vulnerable to developing mental health difficulties, strategies need to assist Travellers to recognise mental distress and develop self-help strategies, including help seeking strategies, to manage their distress and prevent it from worsening.  For those in receipt of treatment from mental health services, strategies to assist Travellers to remain in contact with the services and adhere to treatment plans, where appropriate, need to be developed.  Traveller health projects already in existence are in a prime position to promote positive mental health, but they need to be supported to do so.  For Travellers who are in receipt of care from mental health services, service providers need to understand why Travellers might be vulnerable to disengaging from the services.  Traditional ways of informing people about appointments or medications, etc. may not be useful for Travellers for a variety of reasons.  Interventions need to be tailored to meet individual needs and take into consideration issues such as literacy levels and others that might impact on their engagement with services.  There are also opportunities for mental health services to work closely with Traveller health projects in engaging with the Traveller community and addressing some of the barriers between Travellers and mental health services such as stigma.<\/p><p> In 2018 my colleagues and I evaluated the role of a Traveller mental health liaison nurse in Carlow and Kilkenny.  The liaison nurse works within the primary care system and supports Traveller community health projects in a number of ways such as by educating Travellers, liaising with other professionals and community organisations and facilitating access to primary care services, or re-engagement with mental health services, when necessary.  She also provides a follow-up and reminder service.  This model of mental health service provision supports existing services, including the traditional mental health services, and was evaluated positively by key stakeholders, including Travellers.  Some of this success can be attributed to the relationship the liaison nurse has built up with the Traveller community and her use of wellness and recovery oriented strategies to support individual Travellers who are experiencing distress.  In addition, her comprehensive knowledge of community resources is instrumental in helping Travellers to access the assistance they require.  Furthermore, she has forged relationships and worked closely with other agencies such as social workers and substance misuse services in facilitating access and helping professionals to understand the specific needs of Travellers.<\/p><p> Stigma and social exclusion are major problems for members of the Traveller community.  In addition, mental health difficulties are stigmatised, leading to a lack of openness about mental distress and a reluctance to engage with the services, where necessary.  Educational supports and good relationships with healthcare providers will go some way towards breaking down some of the barriers, while Traveller community health projects are in a good position to do this in partnership with mainstream organisations.  <\/p><p> Suicide is a significant issue among members of the Traveller community.  Travellers have been identified as a priority group within the national suicide prevention strategy.  The introduction of the liaison nurse in Carlow and Kilkenny and the Traveller community health projects respond to some of the strategic goals of the national suicide prevention strategy such as supporting the community's capacity to prevent and respond to suicidal behaviour.  A gendered response is necessary in the Traveller community.  Traveller men are particularly hard to access and reluctant to engage with mental health services.  Possibly the most effective strategy to reduce the incidence of suicide is tackling social exclusion, in particular, unemployment and the lack of a meaningful occupation that Traveller men often experience.<\/p><p> LGBTQ+ Travellers face the potential for discrimination within their community which tends to have strong conservative and religious values.  There are many resources for LGBTQ+ people throughout the country and raising awareness of these supports as an avenue for open and confidential discussions about sexuality may encourage access to them byTravellers, especially young people.  Traveller health projects may facilitate a sharing of information on the services and supports available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019101500002#M00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Brian Keogh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571094000,"counter":411,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Keogh for his strong endorsement of Traveller health projects and the role of the liaison nurse.

I welcome its establishment at what is a time of crisis for Travellers.<\/p><p>I come from the Clanwilliam Institute, which is a registered charity founded in 1982.  We provide systemic family therapy services and train mental health professionals.  Clanwilliam has been involved for 31 years in that provision.  Our approach to therapy is embedded in reflexive practice, which creates problem-solving competencies for clients and fits with a community-centred approach, to build resilience.  We provide a counselling service that is responsive and tailored to each client group&rsquo;s specific needs.  A significant part of our education and training is about taking into account the lived experience of our clients and the impact of their culture and how they perceive their world and their place in it.  All our therapists are trained in cultural competency.  <\/p><p> We are in partnership with the Traveller Counselling Service, which was launched in 2008 and has developed into a community-based counselling service led by Thomas McCann.  This service works from a culturally inclusive framework.  Clanwilliam and the Traveller Counselling Project have been in partnership in the provision of services to children and families and this collaboration is underpinned by the mutual shared interest of both our agencies in the provision of family therapy to marginalised groups and in particular to members of the Traveller community. <\/p><p> We need to begin to consider the position that any organisation such as Clanwilliam can hold in supporting positive mental health for Travellers.  The voices of Travellers must be included in the planning and delivery of all mental health services.  Drawing on the disability slogan, \"nothing about us without us\", Travellers must be included at every level of service delivery. <\/p><p> The Clanwilliam Institute's role is as an ally and a partner in consultation with the Traveller-led counselling service.  If people do not see that people of their race, ethnicity, culture, class, sexual orientation and ability are widely represented in newspapers, on television or in all the structures in society, it is very difficult for them to hold a positive view of their own position as fully accepted members of society.  As I began to meet the children, families and women from the Traveller community, I thought of myself as a culturally sensitive therapist.  I somehow believed I had some knowledge of marginalisation and discrimination and its impact on people's lives.  Having frequently experienced marginalisation as the parent of someone who lives with a disability label, I thought I might understand them a little.  I falsely assumed, however, that I knew something about the possible experiences of others or, if I did not know, that I would be curious and sensitive enough to inquire about what I needed to understand of cultural beliefs and practices that might affect therapy conversations.  Culture, however, does not reveal itself, it cannot be inquired about and it is not available to questioning.  It is embedded in ways that are subtle and sometimes hidden.  At times power occludes the possibility of our seeing our own capacity to oppress, not power as an expert stance or any therapeutic arrogance, but the power by virtue of being.  The internalised history of being silent often meant that my clients from the Traveller community were not even able to let me know the times when I was misguided in my conversations.  I had to rely on a heightened sensitivity to voice tone, posture and demeanour, always conscious that people who have experienced marginalisation can internalise expectations of what it means to be from that community, that is, an expectation not to be listened to or to pass expertise to members of the dominant community. <\/p><p> The most interesting feature of my responses was that I could easily oscillate between shame, sadness, outrage and a feeling of hopelessness and powerlessness in my work with the Traveller community.  I felt shame at being settled and what my people and I do and have done to others and for not really understanding the lived experiences of others.  A deep sense of sadness often pervaded my reflections on working with Traveller populations, which was related to the complexity of the difficulties at every level, from access to housing, health services, education to being a witness to the repetitive cycles of exclusion and the challenges in the next generation.  There was sadness at the displacement of young men struggling to find their identity and the high suicide rates and I felt rage at discrimination.  My sense of powerlessness came from my incapacity to support change, including the attitudinal change of other professionals in making judgments that did not always take culture into account.  Sometimes I felt my own voice when working with Travellers was silenced within my profession.  At times it seemed the issues were too complex to create sustainable change and the desire to be political as a therapist, to impact societal and structural changes and to begin to advocate at a political level, became more imperative. <\/p><p> Among the themes that emerged from my therapeutic work and that seem significant in forming any recommendations I might make was the idea that Travellers are often caught between two worlds, settled and Traveller, when trying to navigate systems and legislation that had not been set up with cultural sensitivity.<\/p><p>Childcare systems are often not created with cultural sensitivity.  For example, there is a lack of relative foster care placements for Traveller children in our care systems.  I refer also to addiction and a lack of services that are culturally inclusive, as well as GPs prescribing and over-medicating the Traveller population, particularly Traveller women.  The risk of suicide is higher in marginalised populations and particularly among young men.  We have been noticing Traveller mothers preparing their children to manage discrimination and note the need for the State to police the role of social workers and psychologists to receive and undertake cultural sensitivity training.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019101500002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Aileen Tierney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571094000,"counter":415,"content":"<p>As Dr. Tierney is at six minutes, can she come to her recommendations?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019101500002#P00200","speaker":"1430"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571094000,"counter":416,"content":"<p>I will move to some of the recommendations.  We recommend a focus on young men in particular, who often feel displaced, are early school leavers and cannot access employment and education; a focus on supporting young women in families who are often isolated rearing children; and a focus on building trust.  Members of the Travelling community have often experienced discrimination, racism and marginalisation and trust is really essential in service delivery.  It requires respectful communication, valuing views and opinions, and honest transparent information-sharing to create dialogue and collaboration between settled communities and Traveller groups.  We recommend respecting the history of oppression and healing that history; developing the ability to consider Traveller representation in all levels of society, school boards, health services, Government committees and political representations; and providing services that are informed by values of anti-racism, ethics and inclusion with mandatory training in cultural competency for all mental health professionals.  We recommend providing a continuum of mental health services, from local Traveller-led peer support groups and information services to Traveller-led counselling services to partnerships with specialist services such as ourselves, to deliver culturally sensitive mental health services.  We recommend devising a national Travellers' mental health strategy that is Traveller led; and resources and a personal commitment of Government representatives to address the history of exclusion, marginalisation and oppression of Travellers.

On behalf of the HSE mental health services, I welcome the establishment of this committee and its focus on mental health within the Traveller community.  In the context of our own health services, mental health describes a spectrum that extends from positive mental health through to severe and disabling mental illness.  A strategic goal for mental health services is to promote the mental health of our entire population in collaboration with other services and agencies, including reducing loss of life by suicide.  This requires a whole-population approach to mental health promotion.  Over 90% of mental health needs can be successfully treated within a primary care setting with a need for less than 10% to be referred to specialist community-based mental health services.  Of this number, approximately 1% are offered inpatient care and nine out of every ten of these admissions are voluntary.  I offer a reminder today that our mental health services, whether provided by community-based mental health teams or within acute inpatient services, day hospitals, outpatient clinics or forensic services, are for our entire population and that includes the Traveller community.<\/p> <p>  On suicide and mental health among Travellers, it is widely accepted that there are many factors that can impact on the mental health of the Traveller community including, but not limited to, perceived stigma associated with being a Traveller and discrimination against Travellers among the general population; lower educational levels; socioeconomic conditions; inadequate accommodation; addiction; domestic violence; and inclusivity among the Traveller community as regards LGBTI+ and gender equality.  Nevertheless, it remains difficult to ascertain the levels of suicide among the Traveller community.  Unfortunately, the data provided by the Central Statistics Office do not capture a wide range of information, including ethnicities.  This gap is just one of the barriers to improving real-time visibility of suicide incidence among many different cohorts in society.  However, we can still look to qualitative studies.<\/p><p>The 2010 all-Ireland Traveller health study, although somewhat dated, concluded that the rate of suicide among male Travellers was 6.6 times higher than the general population.  The female suicide rate was less pronounced.<\/p><p> In a strategic context, I would like to highlight four key drivers that inform and assist us in the HSE in improving the mental health of, and reducing suicide among, the Traveller community.  First, members of the Traveller community are considered as a priority group in Connecting for Life, and feature across many objectives and actions in the strategy.  They are strongly represented in 17 localised versions of Connecting for Life that are now in place across the country, many of which involve local Traveller groups and representatives on their implementation or oversight groups.<\/p><p> A Vision for Change reminds us that mental health services should be inclusive of all the people in Irish society and should be delivered in a culturally appropriate way.  A refresh of A Vision for Change is due to be completed later this year and will propose an expansion of existing recommendations, as well as seeking to develop a framework for the implementation of cultural, diversity and gender competency that is required to respond to the needs of these particular groups.  The national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy also details HSE-specific actions which inform this work.  Of particular note is the commitment to develop a national Traveller health action plan.  In answer to Senator Warfield's question about the action plan, a senior manager in the HSE has been allocated to work with Travellers to complete it and it will be done by quarter 1 of 2020.<\/p><p>  The consultation process to inform the development of the plan, led by the HSE national social inclusion office, commenced in 2018.  Along with the HSE community strategy in planning mental health, the office has proposed an integrated approach to deliver key mental health and social inclusion actions under the national intercultural health strategy, which includes Connecting for Life, A Vision for Change and Healthy Ireland, alongside wider Government initiatives.  The second National Intercultural Health Strategy 2018-2023 provides a comprehensive and integrated approach to addressing the many unique health and support needs experienced by the increasing numbers of HSE service users from diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds who live in Ireland.<\/p><p> There have been key initiatives and developments across the HSE, nationally and locally.  In 2017, the HSE committed to the recruitment of nine mental health co-ordinators for Travellers, eight of whom are currently in post.  The focus of these roles is to work within the CHOs to support improved access, consistency and integration of mental health services to meet the mental health needs of Travellers.  The HSE NOSP provides suicide prevention-specific funding to Exchange House, from which the committee heard last week and whose service has now established working groups in Dublin, Limerick, Sligo, Meath, Waterford, Kildare and the midlands.  The NOSP has also funded the Offaly Traveller Movement and the local community healthcare organisation, CHO, to provide the local Travelling to Wellbeing mental health service.  This has resulted in the production of a guide to  developing a local co-ordinated multi-agency crisis response plan for the Traveller community to ensure more support for individuals and families when suicide incidences or crisis situations occur.  The HSE national social inclusion office funds a wide range of Traveller mental health initiatives that are focused on both improving the mental health and reducing death by suicide of Travellers through training and education programmes but also through providing a community development approach to service access and delivery.  Many of these initiatives are based in CHOs and a number are funded directly through dormant accounts.<\/p><p> Last week, the committee also heard from Ms Niamh Keating, from the West Limerick Primary Health Care Project for Travellers.  Primary health care for Travellers projects, PHCTPs, establish local models for how Travellers could take part in developing health services.  Travellers work as community health workers and this will allow primary health care to be developed based on the Traveller community&rsquo;s own values and perceptions.  This helps to achieve positive outcomes with long-term effects.  It is just one example from an array of initiatives under way within Traveller health units across each CHO area in the HSE.  These units provide support to a range of primary care projects and other initiatives for Travellers.<\/p><p>The Traveller health units, as discussed previously, work to enhance Traveller health status, improve the capacity of mainstream health services to respond to Traveller needs, and to respond to the social determinants that impact Traveller health.  The latter issue has been mentioned by many of my colleagues.<br\/><br\/>There remain challenges across our health system in accessing Traveller populations, and in responding to their specific needs, but the HSE believes that targeted, evidenced local initiatives can make a difference.  For example, projects to introduce regional Traveller mental health liaison nurses, mental health promotion programmes, Traveller cultural awareness training and programmes such as Healthy Minds, which was discussed in Cork and Kerry previously, all have promising outcomes.  A wide range of local Traveller projects or action groups have nurtured constructive relationships and partnerships with HSE community health organisations in this regard.<br\/><br\/>I assure the committee and representatives here today that there remains a very firm commitment, at national and local levels, to improve the health service experiences and reduce mental health inequalities experienced by the Traveller community in Ireland.  We hear, and share, the concerns about mental health and levels suicide among the community, and remain determined to work collaboratively with all<i><\/i>partners and stakeholders, to achieve better outcomes together and to reduce suicide and self-harm among the Traveller community and the general population.  That concludes my statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019101500002#P00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Meehan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571094000,"counter":421,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Meehan for his presentation.

It seems to be a very good model whereby people are trained to develop specific expertise in helping people within the Traveller community who are having difficulties.  Could Dr. Keogh outline a little more about the way the nurse works in Carlow because it would be well worth doing it, if that is something that could be replicated across the country?<\/p> <p>  The HSE statement referred to the fact that there is a gap in the CSO's data in terms of information gathering.  Has the CSO been approached in order to address that and, if so, what is the progress in that regard?  That would be something important for us to identify in making our report.

Young men I have met in the Traveller community often marry younger and want to move into employment earlier.  The kinds of training programmes she is talking about that would be of particular interest to young men would have to have a remuneration component.  The programmes would have to help them to move away from potential addiction trajectories, lack of employment or further discrimination, which impact on their self-esteem and their views of themselves.<\/p> <p>  I am sure it is possible to develop some schemes.  Last week I heard someone speak about the law on horse ownership.  If the legislation was more culturally sensitive some of the young men might be interested.  In terms of specific projects, it might be useful to hear from young men on what they think might be helpful to them.  I see them as a group that has great difficulty in accessing mental health services.<\/p><p>From the settled population 20 or 30 years ago, we saw that women access services first.

She had spent considerable time building up relationships with the community and the health and social care agencies in Carlow and Kilkenny.  She worked with individuals, groups and the health and social care agencies.  When she met people individually, she engaged in listening, support, reassurance, education and advice, and then pointed them in the right direction.  She had a great knowledge of the services available in both of the counties.  She was able to put people in touch with the relevant organisations and advocate for them in some cases.  She could contact the Housing Agency or social work services on a Traveller's behalf to discuss the matter in question.  She was also involved in crisis intervention.  When Travellers were in crisis, she was able to speak to them and work out a plan to address certain issues.  Much of her work was on signposting, to either community organisations or non-governmental organisations, or to primary care services through general practitioner services.  For example, she might have told a Traveller that he or she needed to make an appointment with a general practitioner but an issue might have arisen in that he or she might not have been registered with a general practitioner.  Part of her job in that case was to make sure that the individual could be registered.  The approach was individualised, depending on the case.  The nurse knew all the agencies and was able to support families.  Where parents said their children were misusing substances, she was able to provide some sort of support and recommend services.  She recommended such services to the family members in addition to the Traveller who came for the help in the first place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019101500002#S00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Brian Keogh"},{"type":"speech","time":1571094000,"counter":426,"content":"<p>It struck me on listening to the response that it would be great if Travellers who wish to become nurses themselves could have such a role.

It cannot be determined by anybody else, such as a doctor in the HSE.  Internationally there is a challenge related to identifying specific groups and cohorts of those who have died by suicide, particularly in Ireland considering we have a small community and sensitivities about identification and the associated stigma.  This has, however, been addressed internationally with coroners to seek solutions.  One cannot identify anybody's sexuality, for example.  Connecting for Life has a focus on priority groups.  It is very difficult to identify priority groups because the coroner will not determine these.  This involves a big conversation that cannot be had in isolation.  Internationally, there is a movement, in which Ireland is involved, to open up this discussion with the coroners to determine how we can target specific data in coroners' reports.  Currently, the National Office for Suicide Prevention is working with coroners on reviewing previous cases to determine whether they could be learned from.  Currently there is no plan to provide the identity.

The funding for the National Office for Suicide Prevention has increased from &euro;7 million in 2012 to &euro;12 million.
