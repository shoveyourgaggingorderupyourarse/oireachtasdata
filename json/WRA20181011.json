This is a key Government Brexit response for which I had provided &euro;25 million in funding in 2018.<\/p>  <p>  The Food Wise 2025 strategy outlines the agri-food sector&rsquo;s unique and special position within the Irish economy and its potential for future growth. Brexit is obviously a significant challenge given our unique exposure to the UK market. Farmers, the seafood sector and food businesses will need to focus on competitiveness and innovation in order to continue the growth in Irish agri-food exports, which reached a record &euro;13.6 billion in 2017. The Scheme forms an important part the Government&rsquo;s Brexit response alongside the &ldquo;Brexit Loan Scheme&rdquo;, the provision of additional resources to the agri-food and enterprise State Agencies and an intensification of Minister-led trade missions to access and develop new markets.<\/p>  <p>  The Scheme, which will be administered by the SBCI and backed by a European Investment Fund counter-guarantee, will bring previously unavailable 8 to 10 year unsecured investment finance to the Irish market at competitive interest rates. I am working with colleagues the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Heather Humphreys TD, and Minister Donohoe, to bring up to &euro;300 million of loans to the market.<\/p>  <p>  This is a long-awaited source of finance for young and new entrant farmers, especially the cohort who do not have high levels of security.

The measures adopted will be informed by stakeholder consultation on the needs of the sector to develop in an economically and environmentally sustainable way, as well as the relevant research and the available budget and structure of the new CAP when it is finalised. <\/p>  <p>  I was pleased to secure in the Budget this week an allocation of &euro;20 million in 2019 for a new pilot scheme for suckler farmers, specifically aimed at further improving the carbon efficiency of beef production. The Beef Environmental Efficiency Pilot (BEEP) will target the weaning efficiency of suckler cows and calves - measuring the liveweight of the calf at weaning as a percentage of the cow's liveweight. This data will be used to target improvements on a herd basis by giving the farmer detailed feedback on the performance of individual animals. The data collected will also be a valuable addition to Ireland's already impressive database on cattle genomics. Details of the scheme will be announced in due course.<\/p>  <p>  The Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP) is currently the main support specifically targeted for the suckler sector, which provides Irish beef farmers with some &euro;300 million in funding over the current Rural Development Programme (RDP) period. This scheme is an agri-environmental measure to improve the environmental sustainability of the national suckler herd by increasing genetic merit within the herd.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has rolled out a range of schemes as part of the &euro;4 billion Rural Development Programme (RDP), 2014 - 2020. In addition to the BDGP, other supports which are available for suckler and sheep farmers under Pillar II of the CAP include GLAS, ANCs and Knowledge Transfer Groups. Suckler farmers also benefit from the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) and Greening payments under CAP Pillar I.  <\/p>  <p>  I am conscious that this has been a difficult year for the sector in terms of weather and the range of challenges associated with it. At the recent meeting of the Beef Roundtable on 3 October, I highlighted the need for stakeholders to recognise their inter-dependency. I urged processors to engage positively with their farmer suppliers to build the sustainability of the sector as a whole and to ensure a reasonable return for the farmers upon whom the sector relies for its development.  It is essential that the position of the primary producer in the supply chain be secured if we are to build a sector for the future.<\/p>  <p>  The Beef Roundtable also included discussions on the potential for producer organisations and the development of new technologies as ways of adding value along the whole supply chain, all tools to build resilience in the sector. Producer Organisations would allow farmers to engage collectively with processors, with the aim of strengthening farmers' bargaining power. Additionally, I have asked Bord Bia to conduct a detailed examination of market dynamics, with the cooperation of the industry, taking into account sales of particular cuts into particular segments of the market in order to improve price transparency.<\/p>  <p>  One of the unique strengths the agri-food sector has is our shared vision for the sustainable development of the sector in Food Wise 2025.  I hope that this positive engagement will continue.<\/p>  <p>  I am strongly of the view that this new provision announced in this week's Budget and the existing range of supports available to suckler farmers, together with ensuring access to as many markets as possible, both for live animals and beef exports, are appropriate supports for the continued development of the sector. According to National Farm Survey already suckler farmers receive support equivalent to approximately &euro;500 per suckler cow on average.  <\/p>  <p>  I will continue to argue for as strong a CAP budget as possible, post-2020.  In particular, I am committed to ensuring that suckler farmers continue to receive strong support in the next CAP.  My view is that such payments should support and encourage suckler farmers to make the best decisions possible to improve the profitability, and the economic and environmental efficiency, of their farming system.  The Beef Environmental Efficiency Pilot is a positive step in that direction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101100050#WRA00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":13,"content":"<p>Question No. 14 answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Harness Racing Industry","counter":14,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101100050#WRA00950"},{"type":"question","counter":15,"qnumday":15,"qnumall":"[41469\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101100050#WRA01000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the way in which he plans to support the harness racing sector in the future.","asker":"1345","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":16,"content":"<p>My Department funded the Indecon Review of the Irish Harness Racing Sector, which was published on 1st November 2017.

This figure represents a substantial reduction of over 145,000 tonnes in the quantity of SMP in public intervention stocks across the EU over the course of this year.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the sale of intervention stocks, the Commission has agreed to accept bids as part of recent tender processes, for approximately 43,000 tonnes of  SMP at a price of &euro;123\/100kg since August.<\/p>  <p>  An additional recent development in terms of the strategy adopted for reducing the overhang of SMP stocks in public intervention has been to amend Implementing Regulation 2016\/2080 &ldquo;as regards the periods for the submission tenders&rdquo;, which will result in approximately doubled frequency of tenders for sale of product in intervention which provides for &ldquo;two partial invitations to tender per month&rdquo;.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the Commission&rsquo;s general approach, my Department and I engaged at Council of Ministers meetings and directly with the Commission on recent measures to prevent further stockpiling of skimmed milk powder into 2019 without due justification, including the Commission's proposal to reduce the fixed-price ceiling to zero which it had previously introduced for 2018.<\/p>  <p>  This proposal is for 2019 only and it is essential that this should not mark a fundamental or permanent change in the mechanism for intervention for dairy products agreed by Member States in the Council Regulation in 2013.

With this in mind, I have ensured that my Department has put in place a range of supports for the sheep sector in recent years across a number of schemes.  <\/p>  <p>  In relation to Pillar 1 supports under the Common Agricultural Policy, sheep farmers continue to benefit from the direct income support available under the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS).  In addition, Ireland&rsquo;s Rural Development Programme (RDP), 2014-2020, also contains a number of support schemes which offer direct financial benefit to Irish sheep farmers.  Sheep farmers continue to benefit from the Areas of Natural Constraint (ANC) Scheme and from GLAS in large numbers, as well as from capital investment support under TAMS.  In Tuesday's Budget I announced an additional &euro;23m for the ANC scheme, bringing the total to &euro;250m in 2019. I expect sheep farmers to be significant beneficiaries of that measure. The RDP also includes specific provision for sheep farmers within the Knowledge Transfer Programme, which has helped to build on the existing knowledge base and skills set in the sector in a way which will help to ensure continued sustainable development in the sector. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to these measures, in December 2016 I announced the new Sheep Welfare Scheme as an amendment to the RDP.  Under this scheme, farmers are required to choose from a menu of actions which aim to improve the overall welfare of their flock. These actions must be completed over a 12 month period, and in return the farmer receives a payment of &euro;10 per breeding ewe.  <\/p>  <p>  This important support was introduced for a period of four scheme years, and I am glad to say that over &euro;18.4m has issued on time to sheep farmers in respect of Year 1 of the Scheme.  85% advance payments under year 2 of the scheme are due to commence  in November of this year.<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased to note the strong export performance of the sector last year, which was reflected in the Central Statistics Office (CSO) 2017 trade and livestock statistics.

A key component of the Origin Green assessment is the independent farm audit where the farmer receives a feedback report on his or her farm&rsquo;s performance. This allows them to make informed decisions on improving the sustainability of their farms while also improving their efficiency and farm viability.  The knowledge transfer schemes, funded under the Rural Development Programme, are essential in facilitating the transfer of information from research and advisory services to farmer discussion group networks and cover a range of topics related to sustainability and climate mitigation.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department is supporting a number of other schemes and measures under the Rural Development Programme to help farmers improve their farm&rsquo;s environmental performance.  Measures such as the Agri-Environment scheme, GLAS, includes specific measures to support climate change objectives whilst our Organic farming scheme supports organic farming as an alternative farming system contributing to improving soil quality and mitigation and adaptation to climate change. <\/p>  <p>  Improving breeding and maintaining the health of livestock is also very important to achieving efficiency and managing emissions.  This is actively supported through our Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP). This Programme ranks the efficiency of beef breeding animals on a star based system, with 5-star being the most efficient.  Building on the success of this Programme I have just announced a new pilot scheme - The Beef Environmental Efficiency Pilot &ndash; which will be targeted at suckler farmers and specifically aimed at further improving the carbon efficiency of beef production by measuring the weaning efficiency of suckler cows.  Farmers will get detailed feedback on the performance of individual animals allowing them to identify the most productive cows in their herd.  On the Dairy side, the &lsquo;Economic Breeding Index&rsquo; is identifying the most efficient animals for grass based production system.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of sequestration, or the capturing of carbon, our most significant intervention is the national afforestation programme.  Afforestation and forests also play a key role in replacing energy intensive materials and providing sustainable renewable biomass to the energy sector. We are therefore, investing heavily in the Afforestation Scheme to encourage landowners to establish forests on their land. The Government has recently approved significant improvements in grant and premium rates under the agroforestry and forestry for fibre options.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department is also investing heavily in research and I have recently announced an additional &euro;5.4 million in research grant awards.

Similar to the work already undertaken in relation to the central case scenario, my Department will be working closely with other Departments in progressing these arrangements over the coming period.  <\/p>  <p>  I wish to assure the Deputy that the Government remains very focused on supporting the agri-food industry through the challenges ahead. The Government will be firm in arguing that any agreement reached between the EU and the UK must take account of the very serious challenges presented by Brexit for the sector, particularly given the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland and the importance of our economic relationship with the UK. <\/p>  <p>  And, of course, ultimately Ireland's objective in the negotiations is to have a trading relationship with the entire UK which is as close as possible to the current arrangement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101100051#WRB02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Plant Protection Products","counter":93,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101100051#WRB02350"},{"type":"question","counter":94,"qnumday":41,"qnumall":"[41449\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101100051#WRB02400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if the use of glyphosate will be reconsidered in view of the findings of the DeWayne Johnson court case in California; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1355","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":95,"content":"<p>Regarding the use of plant protection products containing glyphosate in Ireland, I continue to be guided by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), who have both concluded, on the basis of extensive reviews involving public consultation, that glyphosate can be used safely without putting consumers or users at risk.

","asker":"1322","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":98,"content":"<p>The pursuit and development of new markets for Irish agri-food exports is of course an ongoing and central component of the strategic development of the agri-food sector, as evidenced by its placement right at the centre of Food Wise 2025, the industry&rsquo;s strategy for development over the coming decade. Food Wise 2025 outlines the huge potential for growth in agri-food exports to new and emerging markets, particularly in Asia, Africa, the Americas and the Gulf region. This is where our efforts will be focused for the foreseeable future, particularly given the need to diversify our markets and to reduce our reliance on traditional destinations such as the UK.<\/p>  <p>  Trade missions, of course, play a crucial role in market development, not just in terms of the valuable opportunity that they provide for businesses to make contacts and develop relationships, but also in terms of their usefulness in developing political and official contacts, which are often just as important in facilitating business development and resolving market access issues. For this reason they are an essential component of the suite of measures that I and my Department deploy in our efforts to develop more opportunities for Irish agri-food exporters.<\/p>  <p>  In the last two years I have led a series of very successful trade missions. In 2017, destinations included the Gulf States, the US, Mexico, Japan and South Korea. In the case of the latter two, this was an ideal opportunity to exploit the benefits to be derived from the EU's recent trade and economic partnership agreements with South Korea and Japan. <\/p>  <p>  This work has continued in 2018. I have already led trade missions to the US, Canada and China, and my Department is currently making the final arrangements for a further trade mission to Indonesia and Malaysia at the end of October. Again this will include participants from across the agri-food sector and will feature extensive trade contacts as well as high-level political discussions.  Both of these markets had been identified by my Department as offering huge potential to the Irish agri-food sector.<\/p>  <p>  These and the other missions that my Department are planning for the first half of 2019 will serve to enhance and improve our existing levels of market access in these destinations.  It will also promote Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a producer of high quality, safe and sustainably produced meat and dairy products. The destinations are also in keeping with the recent market prioritisation exercise that was completed by Bord Bia at my request. This exercise identified opportunities in new and more mature markets, and will provide valuable market intelligence both for industry operators and policy makers.<\/p>  <p>  It is also no coincidence that the destinations that have we recently visited and plan to visit are now some of the countries showing the greatest increase in growth, with the value of exports to Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Central\/South America standing at almost &euro;2.8 billion in 2017. The value of trade to these markets increased by 159% since 2009.  These markets now account for over 20% of total agri-food exports.<\/p>  <p>  Growth to emerging markets has been led by Asia, with exports of &euro;1.6 billion in 2017, of which around &euro;1 billion went to China. Exports to other Asian markets grew by 85% since 2012 to &euro;659 million in 2017. Trade to Africa has also grown to &euro;606 million, while exports to the Middle East have also grown significantly, to reach &euro;370 million. <\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to seek out and identify new markets, and I am ready to respond as appropriate to other opportunities that may arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101100051#WRB02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","counter":100,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101100051#WRB02800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"International Election Monitoring","counter":99,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101100051#WRB02750"},{"type":"question","counter":100,"qnumday":43,"qnumall":"[41580\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101100051#WRB02800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his plans to introduce an aptitude test as part of the selection process for election observers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":101,"content":"<p>I refer the Deputy to the response to a previous parliamentary question on this matter, Question 36 of 9 October 2018, as well as to responses to the following related parliamentary questions: Question No. 45 of 20 September 2018, Questions Nos. 69 and 70 of 7 September 2018, Questions Nos. 103 and 104 of 24 July 2018, Questions Nos. 57 and 58 of 3 July 2018, Question No. 60 of 21 June 2018, Question No. 107 of 24 April 2018, Question No. 98 of 28 March 2018, Question No. 16 of 25 January 2018, Questions Nos. 428 and 396 of 26 July 2017 and Question No. 651 of 2 May 2017.

This is a key Government Brexit response for which I had provided &euro;25 million in funding in 2018.<\/p>  <p>  The Food Wise 2025 strategy outlines the agri-food sector&rsquo;s unique and special position within the Irish economy and its potential for future growth. Brexit is obviously a significant challenge given our unique exposure to the UK market. Farmers, the seafood sector and food businesses will need to focus on competitiveness and innovation in order to continue the growth in Irish agri-food exports, which reached a record &euro;13.6 billion in 2017. The Scheme forms an important part the Government&rsquo;s Brexit response alongside the &ldquo;Brexit Loan Scheme&rdquo;, the provision of additional resources to the agri-food and enterprise State Agencies and an intensification of Minister-led trade missions to access and develop new markets.<\/p>  <p>  The Scheme, which will be administered by the SBCI and backed by a European Investment Fund counter-guarantee, will bring previously unavailable 8 to 10 year unsecured investment finance to the Irish market at competitive interest rates. I am working with colleagues the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Heather Humphreys TD, and Minister Donohoe, to bring up to &euro;300 million of loans to the market.<\/p>  <p>  This is a long-awaited source of finance for young and new entrant farmers, especially the cohort who do not have high levels of security. It will also serve smaller-scale farmers, who often do not have the leverage to negotiate for more favourable terms with their banking institution. Along with the likes of Milk Flex, this Scheme will form part of a comprehensive investment package for farmers.

This\u00a0equates to a cut of around 5% compared to the current provision.\u00a0 It is\u00a0hoped that the next MFF will be finalised before the European elections in May 2019.<\/p>  <p>  The MFF proposal published by the European Commission is an initial position. The final outcome will be determined by negotiations at EU level. \u00a0Achieving Ireland&rsquo;s priorities in these negotiations will be a key issue for the Government. Ireland has stated clearly that it is\u00a0important that policies with demonstrable added value continue to be properly supported. The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) remains a priority for Ireland.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  As I have already mentioned, the shape of any new Multi Annual Financial Framework is ultimately a matter for Heads of State and Government.\u00a0 The agreement of the\u00a0European Parliament will also be required. Member States have differing expenditure priorities and the loss of UK\u00a0budgetary contributions will make these negotiations particularly challenging.\u00a0 Agreement on the budget requires unanimity among Member States. <\/p>  <p>  I have been working closely with my\u00a0European colleagues to build a consensus to reverse the cut to the\u00a0CAP budget and to maintain support to CAP at the current EU 27 level.\u00a0 In May this year, I, along with my EU Ministerial colleagues from France, Spain, Portugal, Greece and Finland signed a joint Memorandum seeking the retention of the CAP budget at current levels.\u00a0 The Memorandum was presented at the Agri-Fish Council in Luxembourg on 18 June, and up to 20 other EU Ministers have signalled their support to this proposal now.\u00a0 At the Agrifish Council on 16 July 2018 France and Germany presented a joint declaration on the CAP proposals including a joint rejection of the cuts proposed. This paper was supported by other Member states including Croatia, Romania, Spain, Portugal, Slovenia, Belgium and Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  Over the coming months detailed negotiations will continue at all levels across the EU as we work together to shape the final outcome. At the centre of all our considerations will be the need to ensure that CAP Post 2020,\u00a0properly funded,\u00a0will continue to support\u00a0farm families\u00a0and the rural economy. <\/p>  <p>  I can assure the deputy that I will continue to work to develop a broad consensus on the value of a strong, fit for purpose agriculture sector,\u00a0and work to reverse the cuts proposed in the draft MFF.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101100055#WRF04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":397,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101100055#WRF04650"},{"type":"question","counter":398,"qnumday":144,"qnumall":"[41658\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101100055#WRF04700","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the amount granted to animal welfare charities in each year since the enactment of the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 in tabular form; and the charities in receipt of such funding on an annual basis.","asker":"1244","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":399,"content":"<p>The information requested is available on my Department's website at: .<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101100055#WRF04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Animal Identification Schemes","counter":400,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101100055#WRF04850"},{"type":"question","counter":401,"qnumday":145,"qnumall":"[41660\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101100055#WRF04900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the reason a recent letter from his Department to sheep farmers stated that EID is compulsory for farmers and optional for factories; and if his attention has been drawn to the views expressed by an organisation in an article (details supplied).","asker":"1244","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":402,"content":"<p>The letter referred to by the Deputy recently issued to all registered sheep keepers, informing them of the new rules in relation to the identification and movement of sheep\u00a0that I announced in May 2018, and on which I provided additional detail in August. <\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0changes to the National Sheep Identification System (NSIS)\u00a0address\u00a0inadequacies in the current system, which is widely acknowledged to be very complicated and overly-dependent on the manual transcription of the individual identification number of each sheep moved, through all stages of production. The new system will significantly reduce the record-keeping requirements of keepers and will result in a simpler, more effective and robust sheep traceability system.<\/p>  <p>  Under the new rules,\u00a0with effect from 1 June 2019, all sheep\u00a0moving from a holding must be\u00a0 identified electronically. Generally, all sheep must be identified with a full EID\u00a0set of tags comprising of one electronic tag in the animal's right\u00a0ear and a corresponding conventional tag, bearing the same unique animal identification number, in the left ear. Identification with an electronic bolus set\u00a0will also be permitted.\u00a0An exception is made for\u00a0lambs moving\u00a0directly to slaughter from the holding of\u00a0birth while aged under 12 months\u00a0of age. Such lambs must be identified with a minimum of one electronic tag in the right ear although identification with a full set of EID tags\/ an electronic bolus set is also permitted.<\/p>  <p>  The electronic identification of all sheep provides for the establishment of Central Points of recording (CPRs), approved by my Department,\u00a0to record the individual identification number of each sheep moved to such a destination. <\/p>  <p>  The approval of CPRs is provided for at Paragraph C2 of the Annex to Council\u00a0Regulation 21\/2004\u00a0by way of a derogation from the requirement for a keeper of the holding of departure to record the individual numbers of all sheep moved.\u00a0The Regulation provides that Member States may authorise the recording of the individual tag numbers of sheep moved within the State at the point of destination, on behalf of the presenting keeper, by holdings approved by the competent authority for this purpose.<\/p>  <p>  With effect from 1 June 2019, approved CPRs\u00a0will be required to\u00a0scan the electronic tags of all sheep presented at that location and provide the presenting keeper with a printed list of all sheep presented. This will significantly reduce the administrative burden currently placed on farmers who are required now to\u00a0manually list these numbers on the dispatch documents accompanying sheep on movement. Under the new system, farmers will simply be required to record the total number of sheep moved to an approved\u00a0CPR. <\/p>  <p>  The CPR will provide a printed list of presented tag numbers (LPT) to the keeper within a maximum of 48 hours (but often on the same day). Having checked it for accuracy, the keeper\u00a0will then associate the LPT with the relevant dispatch document and retain both documents together\u00a0to complete his\/her record keeping requirements.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I am acutely aware that the enhancement of the sheep traceability system through the extension of electronic identification to all sheep represents an additional tagging cost to\u00a0keepers.  <\/p>  <p>  In this regard, I have introduced a once-off\u00a0 EID tag subsidy scheme,\u00a0providing keepers with a\u00a0once-off payment of\u00a0up to a maximum of &euro;100\u00a0based on the number of electronic tags purchased in their first completed order for electronic tags between 1 October 2018 and 30 September 2019.<\/p>  <p>  I am similarly aware that the\u00a0\u00a0operation of marts and slaughter plants as CPRs is\u00a0key to\u00a0the reduction in the current administrative burden placed on farmers. On\u00a0that basis, there has been consultation with both marts and slaughter plants on enabling\u00a0them to become CPRs.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I have also\u00a0announced a subvention to marts of 40% of the verified development cost (subject to a maximum of &euro;10,000) of the infrastructure necessary to enable them generate the printout of tag numbers for farmers in respect of sheep supplied. <\/p>  <p>  I will be closely\u00a0monitoring\u00a0progress in the application and approval processes for marts and slaughter plants to operate as CPRs\u00a0in the coming months, in order\u00a0to maximise the benefits for the farming community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101100055#WRF05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Capital Expenditure Programme","counter":403,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101100055#WRF05050"},{"type":"question","counter":404,"qnumday":146,"qnumall":"[41661\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101100055#WRF05100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the capital spend to date in 2018 including the capital carry-over from 2017 by subhead; the provision under each subhead including the capital carry-over from 2017 provided for in the Revised Estimates Volume for 2018; the details of overspends or underspends under each subhead; the action to be taken to deal with them; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1244","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":405,"content":"<p>The following table shows the allocations for each capital sub-head for 2018 and expenditure to end September 2018:<table><tr><th>Subhead <\/th><th>Expenditure Capital<\/th><th>2018 Allocation REV&euro;000<\/th><th>Spend to end Sept 2018&euro;000<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>A.2<\/td><td>Administrative capital (Share   attributed to Programme A)<\/td><td>3,590<\/td><td>1439<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>A.3<\/td><td>Food Safety, Animal   Health Programme<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>B.2<\/td><td>Administrative capital (Share   attributed to Programme B)<\/td><td>1,269<\/td><td>330<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>B.3<\/td><td>Agri-Environmental   Schemes<\/td><td>1,000<\/td><td>148<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>B.5<\/td><td>Development of   Agriculture &amp;amp; Food ( Farm).<\/td><td>76,200<\/td><td>47614<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>B.10<\/td><td>Forestry ( includes &euro;23.8m carry &ndash;over from 2017)<\/td><td>103,356<\/td><td>84275<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>C.2<\/td><td>Administrative capital   - (Share attributed to Programme C)<\/td><td>247<\/td><td>64<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>C.4<\/td><td>Development of Ag &amp;amp;   Food (Non-farm).<\/td><td>12,100<\/td><td>4861<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>C.5<\/td><td>Teagasc <\/td><td>5,150<\/td><td>3300<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>C.7<\/td><td>Horse and Greyhound   Racing Fund<\/td><td>11,544<\/td><td>11544<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>C.10<\/td><td>Other Services (   Johnstown Castle Restoration)<\/td><td>1,000<\/td><td>1000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>D.2<\/td><td>Administrative capital   - (Share attributed to Programme D)<\/td><td>294<\/td><td>76<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>D.3<\/td><td>Fisheries<\/td><td>22,362<\/td><td>8635<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>D.4<\/td><td>Marine Institute <\/td><td>10,000<\/td><td>7870<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>D.5<\/td><td>Bord Iascaigh Mhara <\/td><td>13,100<\/td><td>3755<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>D.6<\/td><td>Sea Fisheries   Protection Authority<\/td><td>750<\/td><td>55<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>D.7<\/td><td>Haulbowline Island   Remediation<\/td><td>10,000<\/td><td>4823<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Total Budget: Total<\/td><td>271,962<\/td><td>179790<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>It is not possible to be certain about expenditure for year end.

As such, SACs and SPAs are a key component in the protection of rare and endangered habitats and species, both in Ireland and at a European and international level.<\/p><p>One of the key protective measures under this European legislation is the requirement under Article 6(3) and 6(4) of the Habitats Directive to apply an appropriate assessment procedure, to consider any possible impact on the conservation objectives of a Natura site that might arise from a plan or project, before a decision is taken whether or not to allow that plan or project to proceed.

The long-term policy vision for the agriculture and land use sector as a whole is &lsquo;an approach to carbon neutrality which does not compromise the capacity for sustainable food production&rsquo;. The extent to which the sector can respond positively to climate change requirements is, however, qualified by the need to ensure that our capacity for sustainable food production is maintained.<\/p><p>The farming sector is actively engaging in a number of measures and actions focused on the environment and climate, which support the continued transition towards carbon neutrality.\u00a0 Some examples include the<b><\/b>Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP), which is aimed at lowering the intensity of GHG emissions by improving the quality and efficiency of the national beef herd, the Green Low Carbon Agri-Environment Scheme, which offers opportunities to support emission reductions and carbon sequestration through various environmental priority actions such as hedgerow\/tree planting and\u00a0minimum tillage, and the Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Schemes (TAMS). This last scheme supports capital investment to promote sustainability such as low emissions slurry spreading equipment and energy efficiency support measures.<\/p><p>I have also just announced a new pilot scheme called - The Beef Environmental Efficiency Pilot, which builds on the success of the BDGP.\u00a0 This new pilot scheme will be targeted at suckler farmers and specifically aimed at further improving the carbon efficiency of beef production by measuring the weaning efficiency of suckler cows. \u00a0<\/p><p>Afforestation also has an important role to play. It is the main cost effective land based mitigation tool available to us. The role afforestation and forests play with respect to climate mitigation is threefold: the direct sequestration of carbon in the forest and resulting wood products, replacing energy intensive materials and providing sustainable renewable biomass to the energy sector. Since 1990 almost 312,000 hectares have been afforested primarily by farmers with supports from my Department, which represents a 40% increase in forest cover. It is intended to expand our overall forest estate from 11% to 18% by 2050. <\/p><p>My Department is deeply involved both at national and international level on issues related to agriculture and climate.\u00a0 We are engaging with organisations such as\u00a0the Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO), the UNFCCC Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the EU Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use group. <\/p><p>On the home front we are engaged with colleagues across government in the National Mitigation planning process and adaptation planning. <\/p><p>Looking to the future, the recently published Teagasc report &ldquo;An Analysis of Abatement Potential of Greenhouse Gas Emissions in Irish Agriculture 2021-2030&rdquo; highlights the potential for GHG abatement to limit the emissions from the sector over the period 2021 to 2030 based on current scientific knowledge against the likely level of future GHG emissions if no action is taken to address the emissions. It is an important piece of research that will inform developments in relation to future policy development. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101100056#WRG03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Food Promotion","counter":444,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101100056#WRG04000"},{"type":"question","counter":445,"qnumday":160,"qnumall":"[41717\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101100056#WRG04100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the extent to which he has engaged in overseas visits to promote food exports at various locations globally; the result of such promotions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":446,"content":"<p>The pursuit and development of new markets for Irish agri-food exports is of course an ongoing and central component of the strategic development of the agri-food sector, as evidenced by its placement right at the centre of Food Wise 2025, the industry&rsquo;s strategy for development over the coming decade. Indeed, this is all the more relevant after the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU, which presents significant new challenges for the agri-food sector in particular.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Food Wise 2025 outlines the huge potential for growth in agri-food exports to new and emerging markets, particularly in Asia, Africa, the Americas\u00a0and the Gulf region. This is where our efforts will be focused for the foreseeable future, particularly given the need to diversify our markets and to reduce our reliance on traditional destinations such as the UK. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In keeping with the priorities outlined in Food Wise 2025, there has been an increasing focus in recent years on the use of Trade Missions to create and develop export opportunities for the Irish agri-food sector. Taking the last two years by way of example,\u00a0I first of all led a very successful Trade Mission in February 2017 to the Gulf Region. This covered the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.\u00a0This was followed by an extensive Trade Mission to the US and Mexico in June. Both markets offer many aspects that are very attractive to Irish exporters.\u00a0The US is the largest food and beverage market in the world and has a population of 324 million people. Around 35 million Americans also claim Irish ancestry.\u00a0Mexico has a population of 127 million, making it the eleventh-largest country in the world in population terms and the fifteenth-largest economy in the world,\u00a0with projections that it will move into the top five by 2050.<\/p>  <p>  During a trade mission to Japan and South Korea in November 2017 I was accompanied by 40 representatives of the Irish food sector, as well as by experts from my Department, the CEO of Bord Bia and senior representatives from Enterprise Ireland and Teagasc. <\/p>  <p>  This was a very\u00a0opportune time to bring a delegation of Ireland&rsquo;s food leaders to this part of the world, given that the EU has concluded a Free Trade Agreement with\u00a0South Korea as well as agreeing\u00a0an Economic Partnership Agreement with Japan.\u00a0Japan and South Korea\u00a0are markets of high potential\u00a0for beef, pigmeat and sheepmeat exports, and so it is important that\u00a0we raise the profile of\u00a0Irish agri-food enterprises\u00a0that already have access to these markets, and make progress in negotiating access for others. <\/p>  <p>  This work has continued in 2018. I have already led\u00a0trade missions to the US, Canada and China, and\u00a0my Department is currently making the final arrangements for\u00a0a further\u00a0trade mission to Indonesia and Malaysia at the end of October. Again this will include participants from across the agri-food sector and will feature extensive trade contacts as well as high-level political discussions. \u00a0Both of these markets have been identified by my Department as offering huge potential to the Irish agri-food sector.<\/p>  <p>  These and the other missions that my Department are planning for the first half of 2019 will serve to enhance and improve our existing levels of market access\u00a0in these destinations. \u00a0It will also promote Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a producer of high quality, safe and sustainably produced meat and dairy products. The destinations are also in keeping with the recent market prioritisation\u00a0exercise that was completed by Bord Bia at my request. This exercise identified opportunities in new and more mature markets, and will provide valuable market intelligence both for industry operators and policy makers.<\/p>  <p>  It is also no coincidence that the destinations that we have recently visited and plan to visit are now some of the countries showing the greatest increase in growth, with the value of exports to Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Central\/South America standing at almost &euro;2.8 billion in 2017. The value of trade to these markets increased by 159% since 2009.\u00a0 These markets now account for over 20% of total agri-food exports.<\/p>  <p>  Growth to emerging markets has been led by Asia, with exports of &euro;1.6 billion in 2017, of which around &euro;1 billion went to China.\u00a0Exports to other Asian markets grew by 85% since 2012 to &euro;659 million in 2017. Trade to Africa has also grown to &euro;606 million, while exports to the Middle East have also grown significantly, to reach\u00a0&euro;370 million. <\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to seek out and identify new markets, and I am ready to respond as appropriate to other opportunities that may arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101100056#WRG04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fishing Industry Data","counter":447,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101100056#WRG04300"},{"type":"question","counter":448,"qnumday":161,"qnumall":"[41718\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101100056#WRG04400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the number of persons involved in the fishing industry, including processing; the extent to which these numbers will be retained in the future notwithstanding Brexit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":449,"content":"<p>BIM advise that in 2017 there are 14,638 people employed around our coast \u00a0through direct and indirect employment in the Irish seafood industry.\u00a0 The key priorities for Ireland and the EU27 in the context of fisheries and Brexit will be\u00a0the maintenance of current access to fishing grounds in the UK zone in the Irish Sea, Celtic Sea and north of Donegal and the protection of Ireland&rsquo;s existing quota shares which will in turn protect those involved in the industry.\u00a0 My continued objective is\u00a0to ensure that the implications for fisheries are fully taken account of throughout the negotiations for a future EU-UK relationship.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In recent months, I have continued to have positive, regular meetings with my European colleagues, especially those from the group of 8 Member States whose fisheries are most impacted by the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU.\u00a0 I am also working closely with key stakeholders in the Irish fishing industry and am pleased at the level of unity on these key issues.\u00a0\u00a0The results of my engagement with the Barnier Task Force, in close collaboration with the T&aacute;naiste are evident in the agreed EU position on fisheries.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  \u00a0In the context of the economic relationship, the European Council confirmed its readiness to start work towards a balanced, ambitious and wide-ranging free trade agreement (FTA).

Beef exports to China have now commenced.  My Department has also recently agreed Veterinary Health Certificates for the export of beef, sheepmeat and poultry to both Kuwait and Qatar. These certificates apply for meat and meat products and are a result of a joined-up effort between my Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, in  particular the Embassy in the United Arab Emirates, also accredited to Kuwait and Qatar. <\/p><p>I hope that these new markets will positively contribute towards another successful year for the Irish beef  &amp;amp; sheepmeat industry and our exports. However, the role of the Department is to open up new markets and increase opportunities, while taking advantage of these new markets and availing of these new opportunities is a matter for the industry themselves.  <\/p><p>I recently launched an online international market access information portal which provides information across some of the major agri-food export sectors of dairy, meat, seafood and live animals.  The information provided includes certification arrangements, exporter terms and conditions, individual country trading statistics and the typical products exported to individual markets.

Crop production as a whole including Horticulture, contributes in the region of &euro;700 million annually to agricultural output at farm gate prices.<\/p>  <p>  In particular, the cereals sector is a major contributor to livestock production providing high quality grain to the animal feeding industry. The cereal sector is also a key source of seed production as well grain for the milling and malting industry and\u00a0is therefore\u00a0a significant stakeholder in our agri-food industry from a supply\/food safety and sustainability viewpoint. I am most conscious that the maintenance of an efficient and viable tillage sector in Ireland is of the utmost importance as it reduces our dependence on imported cereals. <\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge that cereal production has experienced difficult challenges in recent times in terms of weather conditions throughout the spring and summer of this year. In relation to cereal markets, Ireland only accounts for approximately 1% of EU production. Grain prices here are very much affected by European and world market price shifts linked to supply\/demand issues and tend to experience volatility. The current situation for the cereal sector is that it has experienced, as a result of the drought in Europe, a spike in prices and a drop in the harvest forecast for the 28 Member States including\u00a0Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  I would like to add that my Department has provided\u00a0and continues to provide, a range of supports to assist this vital sector. In 2017, I introduced the &euro;150m Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme and extended it through provision of national exchequer\u00a0funding to cover the tillage and horticulture sectors. As a further support to tillage farmers the Tillage Capital Investment Scheme under TAMS II covers specific areas of investment with\u00a0over &euro;3.9 million paid out to tillage farmers to date. My Department announced earlier this year the extension of the\u00a0Protein Aid Scheme with the same level of funding as 2017.\u00a0Furthermore in August this year I announced a &euro;2.75 million fodder production incentive measure for tillage farmers to encourage tillage growers to actively engage in the fodder market and there has been very positive engagement. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  My Department additionally provides a high quality official crop seed certification scheme to the industry, in\u00a0addition to an extensive national crop variety evaluation programme. <\/p>  <p>  The agri-food sector is exploring the development of niche and specialist markets for cereal products which have the potential to improve competitiveness and sustainability. The demand for Irish malting barley is growing in line with the sustained growth in demand for Irish whiskey. The opportunity offered by maximizing the amount of Irish grain must be developed to the benefit of all involved. <\/p>  <p>  In conclusion I would also encourage tillage growers to fully implement the advice and research provided by Teagasc in relation to efficient and sustainable production of crops. I am committed to this important sector which plays a key role in the development of the wider agri-food industry. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101100057#WRH00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Dairy Sector","counter":467,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101100057#WRH00500"},{"type":"question","counter":468,"qnumday":168,"qnumall":"[41725\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101100057#WRH00600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the value of dairy exports over the past three years to various export markets; the extent to which he expects this to continue notwithstanding external issues; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":469,"content":"<p>In 2017, Ireland\u00a0exported dairy\u00a0products to 147 countries totalling over &euro;4.6 billion worth of produce. <\/p><p>Irish\u00a0dairy\u00a0products have a highly rated and hard earned reputation in terms of quality, safety and sustainability, and this gives them a competitive edge in markets over the world.

Earlier this year, my colleague Minister Ring and I launched  the &lsquo;LEADER Food Initiative&rsquo;  for the artisan\/small food and beverage businesses, which provides for funding of &euro;15 million up to 2020. <\/p>  <p>  The Initiative  provides financial supports, including for the renovation and extension of production facilities and the purchasing of processing equipment, as well as supporting participants in the artisan food and beverage sector in areas such as market development, competitiveness, and innovation.The maximum amount of funding available is &euro;200,000 per project and funding will be provided for both capital investment and softer supports related to analysis and development or training. This includes support for collaborative proposals where food businesses jointly address common processing and marketing challenges.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101100057#WRH02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Alternative Farm Enterprises","counter":485,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101100057#WRH02300"},{"type":"question","counter":486,"qnumday":174,"qnumall":"[41731\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101100057#WRH02400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the extent to which deer farming continues with consequent supply to the home market and-or exports; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":487,"content":"<p>Deer farming in\u00a0Ireland\u00a0is an alternative enterprise which is dependent on the dynamics of supply and demand\u00a0which affect all agricultural production systems.

I am not therefore in a position to provide detailed progress updates on its work. <\/p>  <p>  The Commission has prepared three Interim Reports to date, in July 2016, September 2016 and September 2017. I have published all three reports and the Commission is continuing with its work under the leadership of Judge Yvonne Murphy, Dr William Duncan and Professor Mary Daly. The Commission is due to submit its final reports in February next year. <\/p>  <p>  It is not possible for a Government to consider a response to an independent statutory investigation, including any question of financial compensation, prior to the Commission submitting its final reports. To date the Commission has made no findings about abuse or neglect in any of the institutions within its terms of reference. <\/p>  <p>  The Commission must be given the opportunity to conclude its investigation and to establish the facts of what happened in and around these institutions. I know that many former residents are eagerly awaiting the completion of this work. As I have indicated previously, when the final reports of the Commission are available the Government will be in a position to comprehensively respond to the full account of the Commission&rsquo;s conclusions on all matters regarding the experiences of former residents. <\/p>  <p>  In the interim, I have initiated a number of processes to complement the Commission's work.
