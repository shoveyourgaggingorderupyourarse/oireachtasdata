While there has been a reduction in mainstream class size in recent years, there has not been a corresponding reduction for those Urban Band 1 DEIS schools who are already allocated a preferential staffing schedule of 20:1 for schools catering for junior classes only and 24:1 for schools catering for senior classes only.

The updated guidance has now been published. <\/p>  <p>  In terms of good ventilation practices in schools it is important, particularly as we get further into winter that we achieve an appropriate balance between good ventilation and comfort.<\/p>  <p>  The overall approach for schools should be to have windows open as fully as possible when classrooms are not in use (for example during break-times, lunch-times and at the end of each school day) and partially open when classrooms are in use to achieve appropriate air flow.<\/p>  <p>  It is worth noting that windows do not need to be open as wide in windy\/colder weather in order to achieve the same level of airflow into the classroom.<\/p>  <p>  As part of managing comfort levels in classrooms, schools should check that their heating systems are set at the recommended manufacturer&rsquo;s guidance levels to maximise the available heat to the school.

This has been agreed with the partners in education. While this matter (and supporting data) will be kept under review, my Department does not consider it necessary for schools to install such monitors in classrooms, where the practical steps outlined in the update guidance are applied.

That schools have remained open throughout level 5 restrictions has been very encouraging.<\/p>  <p>  On 21 August, I announced a series of changes that would be made to assessment arrangements for both Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate examinations for 2021. This announcement was accompanied by a published document detailing these changes, Assessment Arrangements for Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate Examinations 2021, and forms part of the Roadmap for the Full Return to School.<\/p>  <p>  These arrangements are designed to take account of the disrupted learning experienced by students during the 2019\/20 school year and to factor in for some further possible loss of learning time in the 2020\/21 school year as a contingency measure. As the loss of learning through school closures will have affected students&rsquo; engagement with their course of study in different ways, the adjustments put in place will play to students&rsquo; strengths by leaving intact the familiar overall structure of the examinations, while incorporating additional choice. The adjustments were arrived at through discussions between my Department, the State Examinations Commission (SEC), the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) and key stakeholders.  <\/p>  <p>  As schools have significant autonomy in determining how to sequence and pace learning for students in their schools, no centrally prescribed adjustment of the curriculum and courses of study would have been effective for students taking the certificate examinations in 2021. Consequently, the most appropriate way to reflect and take account of the challenges for students that have occurred in 2019\/20 and may occur in 2020\/21 was to incorporate adjustments to the certificate examinations in 2021.<\/p>  <p>  These changes to the national assessment arrangements were made with due regard for the principles of equity, fairness and integrity, as these principles apply to assessment and examinations and refer to student to-student, subject-to-subject, and year-to-year comparisons over time. The changes provide reassurance to students, their parents\/guardians, teachers and schools.<\/p>  <p>  Further clarification on the assessment arrangements for 2021 for certain subjects will issue shortly. <\/p>  <p>  It is my firm intention to operate the conventional 2021 state examinations, with appropriate contingency built in, in line with prevailing public health advice. This is shared by the SEC, which has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations<\/p>  <p>  The SEC has valuable learning from the experience of running the 2020 November examinations, notwithstanding that the numbers taking these examinations is significantly lower than the number due to sit examinations in 2021.  The measures relating to COVID-19 that have been put in place for the November examinations will be considered as part of the planning for examinations in 2021.   <\/p>  <p>  The SEC has commenced its contingency planning for the 2021 examinations, recognising that a flexible and agile approach is necessary in light of the continuing fast-moving environment linked to COVID-19.  It is not intended that there would be any change to the length of the written examinations. Project briefs for relevant subjects have issued earlier than usual and practical coursework will be submitted two weeks earlier than normal as a contingency measure. Teachers are being encouraged to plan and undertake these projects as early as possible in the programme of study.  These changes to the Leaving Certificate assessment arrangements for 2021 are deigned to provide reassurance to students, their parents\/guardians, teachers and schools.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, an advisory group of key stakeholders, which advised on altered arrangements for the 2020 state examinations, was reconvened on 25 November in an online meeting to perform a similar role in respect of the 2021 examinations. The advisory group includes representatives of students, parents, teachers, school leadership and management bodies, the SEC, the NCCA and the Department, including the National Educational Psychological Service. Representatives from the Higher Education Authority and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science are also represented on the advisory group to ensure liaison with the third level sector.<\/p>  <p>  Other documents published by my Department to support the return to school include Guidance for Practical Subjects in Post-Primary Schools and Centres for Education and Returning to school: Guidance on learning and school programmes for post primary school leaders and teachers.

The curriculum at both Primary and Post-Primary aims to foster inclusivity and to promote equality and diversity.  <\/p><p>The Primary Curriculum acknowledges the importance of a balanced and informed awareness of the diversity of peoples and environments in the world. Such an awareness helps children to understand the world and contributes to their personal and social development as citizens of a global community. The curriculum promotes tolerance and respect for diversity in both the school and the community.  The Social Personal and Health Education Curriculum (SPHE) supports students&rsquo; learning in the areas of inclusion, diversity and counter racism. The SPHE content is complemented by the work carried out in social, environmental and scientific education (SESE) at primary level. SESE enables the child to live as an informed and caring member of local and wider communities.<\/p><p>Under the Framework for Junior Cycle, there are twenty four statements of learning which should inform the programme designed by all schools.  One of these statements is: (The student) appreciates and respects how diverse values, beliefs and traditions have contributed to the communities and culture in which she\/he lives.  The Junior Cycle short course in CSPE focuses on supporting students in becoming active citizens through their learning in three strands: Rights and Responsibilities, Global Citizenship, and Exploring Democracy. <\/p><p>As a result of the learning outcomes approach, teachers can facilitate discussion around diversity, prejudice, discrimination and racism, as well as the many other topical issues which might arise during the course of a class. For example, in Learning Outcome 1.2 (Junior Cycle History) students are asked to consider contentious or controversial issues in history from more than one perspective and discuss the historical roots of a contentious or controversial issue or theme in the contemporary world.  For example, there are opportunities to explore aspects of history such as the impact of colonisation, the civil rights movements in the 1960s and a number of learning outcomes relate to the history of Europe and the wider world.  <\/p><p>The two Classroom-Based Assessments (CBAs) in the Junior Cycle specification allow students to explore topics that are interesting and relevant to their own lives. In <i>A Life in Time<\/i>, students choose a person from the past and explore why that person is historically significant. There are often opportunities for these projects to be exhibited or shared with classmates or with the school, so that there is greater awareness and understanding of the issues discussed. <\/p><p>In terms of textbooks used within a classroom setting, my Department has no role in promoting any particular text or resource used in the delivery of the curriculum, apart from a list of prescribed texts for Junior and Senior Cycle. A diverse range of authors, including poets and playwrights, is included in the prescribed lists of texts and schools have the autonomy to choose any text from these lists, in order to best serve the needs of their learners.<\/p><p>The Leaving Certificate History curriculum offers students the opportunity to study aspects of the history of colonialism in the unit: <i>European retreat from empire and the aftermath, 1945-1990<\/i>. This topic explores themes such as the impact of western colonialism in Africa, tensions between indigenous people and colonisers, as well as issues of prejudice, racism and the consequences of colonialism. Another topic in the curriculum called <i>The United States and the world, 1945-1989<\/i>facilitates students to examine the experience of African Americans and people of colour throughout this period in American history.  <\/p><p>As part of my Department&rsquo;s ongoing curricular reform, consideration of issues in relation to inclusivity\/diversity etc. will be included as part of the ongoing reviews in relation to the Primary curriculum and Senior Cycle at Post-Primary. <\/p><p>The Junior Cycle for Teachers (JCT) History team are planning a number of continuous professional development (CPD) opportunities for teachers in the school year 2020-21, to support them in teaching topics that include race\/overcoming diversity. Work is underway to develop webinars and podcasts that support teachers in exploring diverse human histories with students and to develop resources on controversial issues such as racism and privilege in History.<\/p><p>My Department will continue to address the areas of anti-racism, identity-based bullying and cultural awareness through a suite of supports including the recently revised Stay Safe Programme and the provision of continuing professional development to teachers at Primary and Post-Primary level and in initial teacher education. It will ensure that such programmes enable teachers to deal with teaching and learning needs of all students from all cultural backgrounds and provide support for pedagogical practices that promote inclusion.<\/p><p>In specific relation to Traveller history, in 2019 the NCCA undertook an audit on the place of Traveller history and culture in the curriculum from Early Years to Senior Cycle in order to identify current opportunities for children and young people to encounter and learn about aspects of Traveller culture and history. Following the findings of the audit, the NCCA commenced the work of identifying good practice and where supports and initiatives can be enhanced with the appointment of a full-time NCCA Education Officer in September, 2020.

Any proposal to close a school must involve consultation with all of the relevant stakeholders, parents, teachers, students and local communities and follow decisions taken at local level. <\/p>  <p>  Budget 2020 provided for improved teacher staffing levels for small schools. This measure saw a more favourable pupil teacher ratio in small schools from September 2020.  This improved schedule will apply in two, three and four teacher schools and ensure one less pupil is required to retain\/recruit a teacher. This builds on measures in previous budgets which has seen improvements in the appointment and retention thresholds for the 2nd, 3rd and 4th classroom teacher and more favourable enrolment thresholds for one teacher schools situated 8km or more from the nearest school of the same type of patronage and\/or language of instruction.<\/p>  <p>  Small schools have also benefitted from the 1 point improvement to the primary staffing schedule for all schools implemented in 2016 and again in 2018.

In the meantime, Special Educational Needs Organisers are available to support both families and schools who need help or advice. <\/p><p>My Department will continue to support the NCSE and schools through the provision of the necessary funding and capital investment to ensure all children are successful in accessing an education and I want to reassure you that the delivery of the necessary additional provision is being progressed as an absolute priority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100062#WRF02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":233,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100062#WRF02900"},{"type":"question","counter":234,"qnumday":108,"qnumall":"[40019\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100062#WRF03000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if she will consider closing schools early for the Christmas period in view of Covid-19-related concerns; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1486","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":235,"content":"<p>The scheduling of the school holiday periods during the academic years is agreed between the managerial authorities of schools, the teacher unions and my Department for the purposes of standardising breaks at Christmas, Easter and mid-term.

The Government was concerned that the financial impact of significant redundancy claims at this time would have a serious impact on the potential for businesses, and the economy as a whole, to recover which in turn could result in significant insolvency and bankruptcy situations, with further permanent job losses.<\/p>  <p>  The suspension of these redundancy provisions has been extended to 31st March 2021. This was a difficult decision for the Government to make and I know it will be disappointing for those employees who are experiencing uncertainty and who were hoping to claim redundancy from their employers before the end of the year.

In recognition of the need to make this Scheme as widely available as possible an open-call for new on-lenders has been completed and proposals are being reviewed by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland in respect of potential new lenders.  I therefore expect to confirm a number of new lenders will be joining the Scheme in the coming weeks which will increase access to the Scheme and make a wider range of products available to businesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100063#WRG02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Losses","counter":267,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100063#WRG02300"},{"type":"question","counter":268,"qnumday":119,"qnumall":"[40509\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100063#WRG02400","dept":"Department of Trade, Enterprise and Employment","minister":"Minister for Trade, Enterprise and Employment","question":"the number of redundancies registered in each month between October 2019 and October 2020, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1560","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":269,"content":"<p>Section 12 of the Protection of Employment Act 1977 provides that\u00a0employers proposing a collective redundancy must notify the Minister\u00a0of the proposed collective redundancy.\u00a0 The Department\u00a0monitors that the legislative\u00a0requirements for consultation and notification of potential redundancies\u00a0to the Minister are complied with. <\/p><p>Information on collective redundancy notifications does not reflect the total number of actual redundancies that take place across the workforce.\u00a0 Collective redundancies arise where, during any period of 30 consecutive days, the employees being made redundant are:<\/p><p>- 5 employees where 21-49\u00a0 are employed,<\/p><p>- 10 employees where 50-99\u00a0 are employed, <\/p><p>- 10% of the employees where 100-299 are employed, <\/p><p>- 30 employees where 300 or more are employed.<\/p><p>Other redundancies outside of these parameters are not required to be notified to the Minister.

The reduced trade barriers, tariff elimination, simplified customs procedures and more compatible technical requirements all make it easier and cheaper for Irish companies of all sizes to export to Canada and vice versa.  <\/p>  <p>  CETA covers virtually every aspect of economic activity and will provide new market opportunities in many sectors for Irish firms.  In addition to savings on duty costs, Irish firms should also benefit from the recognition of product standards and certification, thus saving on &lsquo;double testing&rsquo; on both sides of the Atlantic.  Increased trade facilitation will reduce processing times at the border and make the movement of goods cheaper, faster, more predictable and efficient.  Irish companies will also be able to bid for Canadian public procurement contracts, as limitations to these end under CETA.  Furthermore, almost half of the benefits anticipated from CETA are expected in the services sector, including financial software, telecoms, digital media, content and gaming, education and e-learning, agritech\/engineering, life sciences and digital health as well as consumer retail.  <\/p>  <p>  On agriculture, Ireland secured strong protections for our beef industry through restricted quotas for Canadian beef entering the EU, while CETA also provides significant opportunities for the Irish dairy industry.  <\/p>  <p>  For SMEs, the benefits and opportunities to business in the agreement are especially valuable given that trade barriers tend to disproportionately burden smaller firms, which have fewer resources to overcome them than larger firms.<\/p>  <p>  For the consumer, CETA has the potential to lower prices and give consumers a wider choice of products and services.  At the same time, imports from Canada will still have to satisfy all EU product rules including social and environmental standards.<\/p>  <p>  Bilaterally, business links between Ireland and Canada are deep and extensive.  Outside of Europe, the US and China, Canada is our largest indigenous export market.  More than 400 Enterprise Ireland clients are doing business in the Canadian market with over 6,000 people in Canada employed by Enterprise Ireland clients.  When we compare the last full year of bilateral trade with Canada prior to the provisional application of CETA (2016), against the most recent full year of provisional application (2019), Irish exports of Goods and Services to Canada have grown by approximately 35%.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, Ireland, like many EU Member States, was awaiting the opinion of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) in a case concerning the compatibility of CETA with EU law prior to considering the commencement of our ratification process.  Therefore, CETA could only be provisionally applied by the EU and Canada since September 2017 and only insofar as the trade elements were concerned where the EU Commission has competence under the EU Treaties.  The Opinion of the CJEU in this case issued on 30th April 2019 finding that there were no issues regarding the compatibility of the Agreement with EU law and that no changes to the text of CETA were required.  On foot of this decision of the court, Government has now agreed to the moving of a Motion in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann seeking the House's approval for Ireland to formally ratify CETA.  The D&aacute;il Business Committee will arrange the timing for the taking of the Motion in due course and I look forward to securing the approval of the House for ratification in the near future.  Ireland will then be able to notify the EU Council Secretariat of the completion of our ratification procedures as some 14 other Member States have so far done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100063#WRG04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Creation","counter":294,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100063#WRG05000"},{"type":"question","counter":295,"qnumday":128,"qnumall":"[39730\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100063#WRG05100","dept":"Department of Trade, Enterprise and Employment","minister":"Minister for Trade, Enterprise and Employment","question":"if he will provide a full sectoral breakdown of new jobs announcements supported by Enterprise Ireland in 2020; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1473","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":296,"content":"<p>Investment to support a significant number of jobs was approved by Enterprise Ireland in 2020 across a range of sectors and the full amount of jobs created in Enterprise Ireland supported companies in 2020 will be included in the agency's Annual Business Review, which will be published in 2021.<\/p><p>The list below refers solely to job announcements by Enterprise Ireland supported client companies and this information is listed on the Enterprise Ireland website.

This includes, among other things, diversifying and growing the financial services products it provides for individuals and SMEs to include loans, credit cards and more foreign exchange products, local banking in association with the major banks and a full range of State Savings products. Two new dedicated sub-brands, An Post Money and a new business-to-business brand, An Post Commerce, were launched. Investment by An Post of &euro;50 million in the network is designed to encourage communities to use the enhanced services in their local post office.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the community banking model a project team comprising officials from the Department of Rural and Community Development and the Department of Finance was established to progress that particular commitment. The final report was published by the respective Ministers on 4 July 2018. The report indicated that the Department of Finance would continue to engage in dialogue with Irish Rural Link and other stakeholders and that it would commission an independent external evaluation of the possibility or otherwise for promotion of the local public banking concept in Ireland. That further report was published by the Department of Finance in December 2019 and concluded that there is no business case for the State to establish a public banking system in Ireland, supporting the outcome of the July 2018 report.<\/p>  <p>  The importance of the post office network has been clearly demonstrated throughout the pandemic where we have seen a range of initiatives through our post offices which have helped support local communities, the elderly and vulnerable. <\/p>  <p>  The serious decline in the volume of mail and the impact of Covid on footfall through post offices, has had a severe impact on the postal network and I am aware of the concerns of the Irish Postmasters Union. I am also aware of the findings of the most recent Grant Thornton Report commissioned by the IPU, which are being considered by the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications. <\/p>  <p>  While it is long-standing Government policy that postal services will not be directly subsidised by the Government, we remain fully committed to a sustainable post office network as a key component of the economic and social infrastructure in both rural and urban areas. <\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government recognises that a modernised post office network will provide a better range of financial services and e-commerce services for citizens and enterprise, as part of our commitment to a sustainable nationwide post office network. <\/p>  <p>  Government believes An Post has untapped potential to do more and make a further significant contribution across many areas of public, business and community life in Ireland. With an evolving mandate An Post can emerge as a central hub for a wide variety of valuable community focused services. We will work closely with An Post to see if there is scope to channel additional services through the network. All options will be considered fully and efforts will be redoubled to give effect to our commitment to ensuring a sustainable and viable post office network. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100064#WRH02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Broadband Plan","counter":350,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100064#WRH02800"},{"type":"question","counter":351,"qnumday":147,"qnumall":"[39686\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100064#WRH02900","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the scheduled and planned enabling of broadband exchanges in County Clare under the national broadband plan; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1518","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":352,"content":"<p>The National Broadband Plan (NBP) State led Intervention will be delivered by National Broadband Ireland (NBI) under a contract signed last November to roll out a high speed and future proofed broadband network within the Intervention Area which covers 1.1 million people living and working in the over 544,000 premises, including almost 100,000 businesses and farms along with 695 schools.<\/p><p>In County Clare, there are 69,225 premises of which 22,592 (33%) are within the intervention area for the National Broadband Plan. The deployment plan forecasts premises passed in all counties within the first 2 years and over 90% of premises in the State having access to high speed broadband within the next four years. <\/p><p>I am advised by NBI that, as of 23 November 2020, over 136,000 premises across all counties have been surveyed which is ahead of the full year survey target of 120,000 that had been projected by the company. Surveys have been completed in County Clare in the areas of Cratloe, Ballycannan, Ballyglas and Cloghrea and NBI indicative dates for fibre connections for premises in these areas, which are close to the border of Limerick, is mid 2021. Further surveys have recently commenced in the areas of Kilkishen, but deployment information is not yet available from NBI for this location.<\/p><p>Surveying is the first step towards delivering the new fibre network and involves physically walking the routes and documenting images, notes and measurements of the poles, cables and underground ducts in each area. This informs design solutions for provision of the fibre network to each and every premises in the surveyed area and leads to detailed designs. The detailed designs are then used to initiate the &lsquo;make ready&rsquo; project with Open eir for the area, where Open eir ensure any poles and ducts being reused are fit for purpose and the make ready of other required infrastructure. This step also informs decisions on equipment ordering. <\/p><p>Survey data is also needed to initiate pre-works which pave the way for the deploying of fibre. Pre-works involve construction of new duct routes, erection of poles, building chambers, and tree trimming. On completion of these pre-works, the main construction works can commence. This involves deploying fibre overhead on poles and in underground ducts, splicing of fibre, and unblocking of ducts. Once the main construction works are completed and the appropriate level of testing has been undertaken, the fibre network can be commissioned and end users can order their connection.<\/p><p>Further details are available on specific areas in Clare through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website .  Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises when works are due to commence. I am aware that concerns have been raised regarding the level of information available on the deployment of the NBI network and I am advised that NBI is working to provide more detail on its website in this regard, with a rolling update on network build plans.<\/p><p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 20 November, 149 publicly accessible BCP sites have been installed by NBI, with 59 already connected to high speed broadband service. The remaining locations will be connected through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development in the coming months. In Clare, Cree Community Centre, Loop Head Lighthouse and Michael Cusack Visitor Centre BCPs have been connected. A further BCP at Loughraney has had infrastructure installed by NBI and will be connected in the coming weeks. <\/p><p>Some 52 schools throughout Ireland have now had infrastructure installed by NBI, with 23 schools already connected to high speed broadband. In Clare, a number of schools including Shragh, Ennistymon and Stonehall National Schools are now connected as part of this initiative.

Since 2010, the award of Public Service Obligation (PSO) funding falls under the independent statutory remit of the NTA.

Clearly, the Covid-19 health emergency has had a profound impact on the public transport sector through the fall in passenger numbers and associated drop in fare revenues. Therefore, several Government decisions have been taken to mitigate the negative financial impact of Covid on the public transport system, including: <\/p><p>-  initially, to substantially increase the 2020 overall budget for the existing PSO system, and in the recent Budget, to continue with an increased overall allocation for 2021;<\/p><p>-  to introduce new temporary financial support for non-PSO licensed services provided by commercial bus operators; and<\/p><p>-  enhancements to certain PSO bus services - which include some provided by Dublin Bus - that were announced under the Stimulus package, and which will become fully operational in 2021.<\/p><p>In relation to capital investment, next year the NTA will be purchasing a significant number of double-deck hybrid buses for use in the Dublin region.

Works on those roads are funded from local authorities' own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.<\/p>  <p>  Before the post-2008 financial crisis, local authorities could apply on a regular basis for Specific and Strategic Improvement Grants to improve regional and local roads. However, the extent of the cutbacks in grant funding during the crisis meant these grant schemes had to be curtailed after 2013 because expenditure on maintenance and renewal was falling well short of what was required to adequately maintain the regional and local road network. <\/p>  <p>  Project Ireland 2040 does provide for the gradual build up in funding for the road network but it will take some time yet to reach the level required for the adequate maintenance and renewal of the network. For this reason there is limited scope at present for funding projects under the Specific or Strategic Grant Programmes.  <\/p>  <p>  Any projects proposed by local authorities for consideration under the Specific or Strategic Grant Programmes are assessed by the Department on a case-by-case basis.  All projects put forward by local authorities for consideration must comply with the requirements of the Public Spending Code and the Department's Capital Appraisal Framework (CAF). Given the limited funding available for regional and local road improvement works it is important for local authorities to prioritise projects within their overall area of responsibility with these requirements in mind.<\/p>  <p>  As regards the bridges and causeways in the south Connemara area, a  number of options have been proposed by Galway County Council such as traffic management with the provision of traffic lights to control the traffic in one direction at a time along the causeways, remedial works to the causeway parapets and facades and the incorporation of the aforementioned traffic management and full widening of the causeways to facilitate two way traffic and remedial work to the causeway facades. <\/p>  <p>  In order to consider and approve a project or projects to replace one or more of the causeways and bridges consideration would at least have to be given to the total cost of the scheme and the necessary planning requirements. The likely cost of replacing the causeways would mean that a detailed economic appraisal would need to be carried out. This would involve carrying out a full business case for the scheme including a detailed financial appraisal of the capital costs, the operating and maintenance costs and the source of funding. An appraisal of the options under numerous criteria such as economy, safety, environment, accessibility and social inclusion and integration also forms part of the business case. Further to this a full Cost Benefit Analysis of the preferred option would also have to be carried out and this along with the business case would be subject to review by the Economic Evaluation Unit within the Department.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the business case, planning permission would need to be sought by the local authority. As the causeways are located in a Special Area of Conservation then a screening process in order to determine whether or not the proposed scheme is likely to have significant effects on the environment and as such require an Environmental Impact Assessment and an Environmental Impact Assessment Report to be carried out. In addition, an Appropriate Assessment screening process would also need to be carried out in order to determine whether the proposed works could have significant effects on the Special Area of Conservation in view of the sites&rsquo; conservation objectives and as such require a Natura Impact Statement. Subject to screening determining that significant effects on the environment and\/or significant effects on the Special Area of Conservation could occur then the Environmental Impact Assessment and the Appropriate Assessment processes would involve submission to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for planning consent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100065#WRJ05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Tests","counter":446,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100065#WRJ05400"},{"type":"question","counter":447,"qnumday":179,"qnumall":"[39913\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100065#WRJ05500","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the estimated daily volume of demand for airport testing in Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports during December 2020; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1507","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":448,"content":"<p>The Plan for Living with Covid-19 and the Government decision of 20 October both affirm that any testing model implemented for international travel should not impinge on HSE testing capacity.

To fulfil this requirement, every road transport undertaking in Ireland (or in any other EU Member State) must have a nominated Transport Manager to effectively and continuously manage its transport activities. The Transport Manager must hold a Certificate of Professional Competence (CPC), in either Road Haulage or Road Passenger Transport depending on the nature of the operator's business. This certificate must be issued by an EU Member State and is ordinarily obtained by passing a written examination. <\/p>  <p>  As highlighted by the European Commission in 2018, and more recently in July of this year, after the end of the Brexit transition period on 31 December, Transport Manager CPCs issued by an authority of the United Kingdom or a body authorised by the United Kingdom will no longer be valid in the EU.  <\/p>  <p>  As part of the Government's Brexit preparations, my Department carried out a review and identified approximately 200 individuals with a UK-issued Transport Manager CPC who are currently nominated as Transport Manager for Irish road transport operators. The Department recently wrote to these Transport Managers and the relevant operators to ensure that they are aware of the position as outlined by the European Commission.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department has liaised with the European Commission on this matter and has recently obtained clarification that corresponding Irish Transport Management CPCs may be issued to those UK-qualified individuals working for Irish operators and resident in Ireland, before the end of the Brexit transition period.  This means that these Transport Managers will not now be required to undertake an Irish examination in order to continue to work as Transport Manager for an Irish or other EU operator. <\/p>  <p>  In view of this clarification, my Department has established arrangements with the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport (CILT) for the application process to obtain a corresponding Irish Transport Management CPC.  CILT is the body that issues Transport Management CPCs in Ireland on behalf of the Department. A further communication has now issued to affected Transport Managers to inform them of this recent update and to outline what needs to be done in order to obtain an Irish Transport Manager CPC.  <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that applications must be submitted to CILT by 31 December 2020, as after that date it will not be possible to obtain an Irish Transport Management CPC on the basis of holding the UK equivalent certificate. No fee will apply in this case for obtaining an Irish Transport Management CPC. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100066#WRK01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Driver Licences","counter":484,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100066#WRK01850"},{"type":"question","counter":485,"qnumday":191,"qnumall":"[40359\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100066#WRK01875","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"when a driver licence will issue to a person (details supplied) requiring evidence of a valid driver licence for car insurance purposes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1462","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":486,"content":"<p>My Department does not have access to individual driving licence applications.

In those meetings I stressed the importance of the Advisory Committee and the important role it plays, particularly in this critical time. I have also consulted the NTA and asked them to work with driver representatives and consider the best approach to filling these vacancies to ensure that the Advisory Committee features strong and effective representation for taxi drivers, limousine chauffeurs, and hackney drivers. This includes consideration of how best to ensure appropriate urban and rural driver representation. I look forward to finalising the approach to filling these vacancies on foot of the outcome of this work.<\/p><p>I attach here a table outlining the current membership of the Committee: <table>    <tr>       <th>Name<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Mr. Cornelius O'Donohoe, chairperson<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Ms. Ann Campbell<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Ms. Joan Carthy<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Mr. James Cawley<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Mr. Noel Ebbs<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Mr. Kevin Finn<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Mr. Peter Fleming<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Mr. Alan Fox<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Ms. Mary Henchy<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Mr. John Murphy<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Superintendent Thomas Murphy<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Mr. James O'Brien<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Mr. Al Ryan<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100066#WRK03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Haulage Industry","counter":507,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100066#WRK03800"},{"type":"question","counter":508,"qnumday":200,"qnumall":"[40449\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100066#WRK03900","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"his views on a matter (details supplied) regarding a UK haulage licence; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1487","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":509,"content":"<p>The question appears to relate to a Transport Manager Certificate of Professional Competence, which is a qualification as opposed to a licence.<\/p>  <p>  EU legislation sets out a number of requirements to be satisfied in order to hold a road transport operator licence, one of which is professional competence. To fulfil this requirement, every road transport undertaking in Ireland (or in any other EU Member State) must have a nominated Transport Manager who resides in the EU to effectively and continuously manage its transport activities. The Transport Manager must hold a Certificate of Professional Competence (CPC), in either Road Haulage or Road Passenger Transport depending on the nature of the operator's business. This certificate must be issued by an EU Member State and is ordinarily obtained by passing a written examination. <\/p>  <p>  As highlighted by the European Commission in 2018, and more recently in July of this year, after the end of the Brexit transition period on 31 December, Transport Manager CPCs issued by an authority of the United Kingdom or a body authorised by the United Kingdom will no longer be valid in the EU. <\/p>  <p>  As part of the Government's Brexit preparations, my Department carried out a review and identified approximately 200 individuals with a UK-issued Transport Manager CPC who are currently nominated as Transport Manager for Irish road transport operators. The Department recently wrote to these Transport Managers and the relevant operators to ensure that they are aware of the position as outlined by the European Commission.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department has liaised with the European Commission on this matter and has received clarification that a corresponding Irish Transport Management CPC may be issued to those UK-qualified individuals working for Irish operators, before the end of the Brexit transition period. This means that these Transport Managers will not now be required to undertake an Irish examination in order to continue to work as Transport Manager for an Irish or other EU operator. <\/p>  <p>  In view of this clarification, my Department has established arrangements with the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport (CILT) for the application process to obtain a corresponding Irish Transport Management CPC.  CILT is the body that issues Transport Management CPCs in Ireland on behalf of the Department of Transport. A further communication has now issued to affected Transport Managers to outline what needs to be done in order to obtain an Irish Transport Manager CPC.  <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that applications must be submitted to CILT by 31 December 2020, as after that date it will not be possible to obtain an Irish Transport Management CPC on the basis of holding the UK equivalent certificate. The Department has emphasised this to affected Transport Managers and has urged them to contact CILT as soon as possible.  <\/p>  <p>  No fee will apply in this case for obtaining an Irish Transport Management CPC. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100066#WRK04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Finance","counter":511,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100066#WRK04200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ireland Strategic Investment Fund","counter":510,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100066#WRK04100"},{"type":"question","counter":511,"qnumday":201,"qnumall":"[39557\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100066#WRK04200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the list of projects funded by the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund and a company (details supplied);

The examination of accounts and tax returns submitted by taxpayers is a matter for Revenue and, in monitoring tax compliance, Revenue can scrutinise returns received to ensure they comply with legislative provisions.<\/p>  <p>  While I cannot comment on a specific taxpayer, I can give the following overview of Section 110 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 as it relates to the securitisation of mortgages.<\/p>  <p>  Securitisation allows banks to raise capital and to share risk and, by providing a repackaging and resale market for corporate debt, it lowers the cost of debt financing.  It is accepted that having the option for more diversified sources of financing is good for investment and business.  It is also important for financial stability in the economy, as the ability to securitise loan books plays an important role in allowing banks to meet their capital requirement obligations and to continue lending to businesses and individuals.   <\/p>  <p>  The importance of securitisation has been recognised by the European Commission through their work on Capital Markets Union, one of the aims of which is to seek to build a sustainable securitisation regime across the European Union.<\/p>  <p>  Section 110 sets out a regime for the taxation of special purpose companies.  The tax provisions are intended to create a tax neutral regime for bona-fide securitisation and structured finance purposes.  The section 110 regime enables noteholders to invest through one structured vehicle without giving rise to an additional layer of tax as compared to a direct investment in the underlying assets.  As such, having regard only to the taxation of the company, and not also to the taxation of its noteholders, gives only a partial picture.<\/p>  <p>  The regime is subject to a number of anti-avoidance provisions designed to ensure that a deduction \/ no inclusion outcome does not arise. For example, Finance Act 2011 restricted the ability of a section 110 company to take a tax deduction for interest payments to connected persons in respect of the &ldquo;profit participating note&rdquo; (PPN).  In general terms, this means that a section 110 company cannot take a tax deduction for interest paid to a connected party unless that connected party is taxable on the interest.  More recently, in Finance Act 2019, I brought forward amendments to strengthen this anti-avoidance rule to ensure that it is effective and operates as intended. The focus of the 2019 amendment was to ensure that the anti-avoidance rules apply to all connected parties.<\/p>  <p>  Concerns with regard to investments in financial assets backed by Irish property, such as mortgage loans, were addressed in Finance Act 2016.  The changes restricted the ability of a section 110 company to claim a deduction for profit-participating interest to any noteholder (be it a connected party or third party) unless it is liable to tax on receipt in an EU Member State.  An exception is allowed for bona-fide securitisations carried out in line with the Capital Requirement Regulation of 2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms (CRR). However, I would note that these Finance Act 2016 restrictions are layered on top of the Finance Act 2011 provisions.  This means in that, even in the case of a CRR securitisation, a deduction is not available on PPN interest paid to a connected party unless it is subject to tax on receipt.<\/p>  <p>  Finance Act 2019 also introduced anti-hybrid rules which apply to all corporate taxpayers in Ireland with effect from 1 January 2020.  While the anti-hybrid rules introduced a general rule to prevent deduction \/ no inclusion mismatch outcomes arising due to hybridity, they also include more stringent rules to deal with those mismatch outcomes which arise in relation to hybrid financial instruments.  The anti-hybrid rules require that a deduction is denied in situations where such a mismatch outcome would otherwise arise.  These anti-hybrid rules apply to section 110 companies in addition to the specific anti-avoidance rules contained within section 110.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that there are competing concerns in this area &ndash; on the one hand, ongoing concerns regarding loan-book sales and appropriate levels of taxation, and on the other hand a recognition that bona-fide securitisation is an essential support to both consumer lending and bank capital requirements.  My officials, together with officials in Revenue, therefore continue to monitor the sector on an ongoing basis, with a view to taking action should it be deemed necessary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100066#WRK07700","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Value Added Tax","counter":548,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100067#WRL00200"},{"type":"question","counter":549,"qnumday":212,"qnumall":"[39806\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100067#WRL00300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if beauty salons are covered by the recent reduction in the VAT rate; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1481","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":550,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, the VAT rate applied to Tourism and Hospitality related goods and services has been temporarily reduced from 13.5% to 9%, from 1 November 2020 to 31 December 2021, in recognition of the unprecedented challenges facing the sector.

While hairdressing services will apply the 9% rate from 1 November, services consisting of the care of the human body, including beauticians, are subject to the 13.5% rate.<\/p>  <p>  This arises from the fact that many of goods and services to which Ireland applies a reduced rate of VAT, including services related to care of the human body, have their basis under an EU derogation that provides that as Ireland applied a reduced rate to these items on 1 January 1991, we are entitled to continue applying that reduced rate to those items.

The scheme was introduced as an emergency measure to provide financial support to businesses that were severely economically impacted by the pandemic and enabled employees whose employers could no longer afford to pay wages receive subsidy payments. The scheme was not intended as a support to employers in respect of employees who provide domestic duties within a private household nor was it ever implied that it applied to them. <\/p>  <p>  The provision of domestic duties by an employee within a private household, where the employer is the owner or occupier is not a business activity. A relevant business in the context of the TWSS generally includes manufacturing, buying, selling or supplying goods or services with a view to making a profit, none of which can be associated with employing staff who carry out domestic duties. It is also not possible for such employers to meet the minimum 25% business turnover decline eligibility test as there is no turnover associated with engaging an employee to carry out domestic duties.<\/p>  <p>  The TWSS operated on a self-assessment basis with the onus on applicants to satisfy themselves that they fully met the eligibility criteria for the scheme and to self-declare to Revenue that they correctly qualified. To assist employers in determining their eligibility, Revenue published very extensive guidance, which clearly set out the qualifying conditions, including the requirement that a minimum 25% decline in business turnover had occurred due to COVID-19 related restrictions. <\/p>  <p>  Revenue consistently referenced the minimum 25% business turnover decline eligibility requirement throughout the intensive media briefings, press releases and political responses that were provided during the period of operation of the TWSS. Revenue also clearly confirmed that, in line with all other self-assessment regimes, it would engage with TWSS claimants to ensure they properly qualified for the subsidy and that payments were passed on to eligible employees. This was a very important action to undertake given the level of public funds invested in the TWSS.<\/p>  <p>  As part of this compliance checking process, Revenue contacted all employers (approx. 66,500) that availed of the TWSS, including the person in question, to ensure they were correctly eligible for the scheme. As part of the compliance check, employers were asked to confirm that they had suffered the minimum 25% decline in business turnover, and to provide payslip evidence that the funds were correctly passed on to their relevant employees. Where ineligible employers incorrectly claimed and received TWSS payments, they were requested to repay the amounts received.<\/p>  <p>  Revenue wrote to the person in question in early November 2020 requesting repayment of the TWSS amounts incorrectly claimed by them. Revenue also confirmed to the person that they were ineligible for the scheme as they did not meet the qualifying criteria in their capacity as an employer of a domestic employee. Revenue had previously set out the qualifying criteria for the scheme in correspondence with the person in March 2020, which clearly stated the requirement for a decline of at least 25% in business turnover. The person subsequently self-declared to Revenue on 26 March 2020 that they met the eligibility criteria, including in respect of the required minimum 25% decline in business turnover, and on that basis was provided with access to the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  There is now a requirement on the person to repay the amounts that were incorrectly claimed, and it is important that they engage with Revenue as quickly as possible to agree a repayment arrangement. Non engagement on the matter by the person may result in Revenue raising assessments and taking action to secure the repayment in question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100067#WRL00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":555,"content":"<p>Question No. 216 answered with Question No. 202.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Sector","counter":556,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100067#WRL01100"},{"type":"question","counter":557,"qnumday":217,"qnumall":"[39857\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100067#WRL01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will review correspondence (details supplied); his views on the campaign to retain rural services; if his Department has engaged with the bank on the issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1557","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":558,"content":"<p>As I outlined to the Deputy on the 3<sup>rd<\/sup>November, I am aware of the 'Save our Ulster Bank' campaign and I share the concerns outlined in the correspondence.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, I met with representatives of Ulster Bank on the 21 of October.

This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive) which expressly prohibits Member States from doing so.  Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies as to how they price their policies or what terms and conditions they apply in those policies. <\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, I note the situation as outlined, as it appears to relate to the forbearance measures that a number of Insurance Ireland members agreed to earlier this year.  To be of assistance to the Deputy, my officials contacted Insurance Ireland, in relation to the issue.  It advised that this particular set of circumstances is not one that it has previously encountered. In addition, Insurance Ireland would like to assist the policyholder to resolve this situation, and suggested that the individual impacted should contact it&rsquo;s Insurance Information Service, with a view to achieving a speedy and satisfactory outcome.  This service can be accessed at: feedback@insuranceireland.eu. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will know, I strongly believe that the insurance sector must play an important role in assisting their customers during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, and this is also recognised in the Programme for Government.

While I am satisfied that it appears that the issue as outlined may be an isolated incident, it is an issue that my officials will monitor in case this is part of a wider industry practice.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I would note that generally if a consumer has a service complaint regarding their insurance provider, it is advisable that they make a complaint to the firm's internal complaint resolution process.  The Consumer Protection Code requires that if after 40 days the complaint has not been resolved to the customer&rsquo;s satisfaction, the regulated entity must inform the consumer that they may refer their complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO).  The FSPO is a statutory official who acts as an independent arbiter of disputes which consumers may have with their insurance company or other financial service provider.

The actions that have been taken to mitigate these risks allowed scope for the Government to introduce a range of emergency support and stimulus measures in response to COVID-19. These include the creation and funding of the Rainy Day Fund, prioritising the reduction of debt and continuing to broaden the tax base. <\/p>  <p>  A number of measures have been taken in this regard in recent years and include the introduction of the Universal Social Charge, annual domicile levy, and the Sugar Sweetened Drinks Tax. Non-indexation of tax thresholds, bands and credits can also operate to broaden the tax base. I have also taken steps to broaden and enhance the stability of our corporation tax base, including through the introduction of the 80 per cent cap on capital allowances for intangible assets in Budget 2018 and the introduction of a broader Exit Tax regime in Budget 2019.<\/p>  <p>  The introduction of the Local Property Tax (LPT) in 2013 broadened the tax base to include residential properties and the tax is providing a stable funding base for local government.  I propose to advance legislative proposals early in 2021 to implement the 2020 Programme for Government commitments and secure the future of the LPT.  <\/p>  <p>  More recently changes to the VAT rate and carbon tax changes were introduced. The Programme for Government also recognises that we need to remain cognisant of avoiding the mistakes of the past and being overly reliant on a narrow set of taxes. The carbon tax is set to increase throughout the lifetime of this government with an annual increase of &euro;7.50 per annum to 2029 and &euro;6.50 in 2030. To the extent that taxation measures are required to close the deficit in the medium term, the Programme for Government notes that we will focus any tax measures on behaviour with negative externalities such as carbon tax, sugar tax and plastics.

The National Debt is managed by the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA). The NTMA&rsquo;s Annual Report &amp;amp; Accounts 2019 (available at ) provides further details of the breakdown of the National Debt on pages 83-104. <\/p><p>National Debt at end-2019 was circa &euro;188 billion, however, the most comprehensive measure of public debt is General Government Debt (GGD) as it also includes Local Government, extra-budgetary funds, non-commercial state bodies etc. GGD is a measure of the total gross debt liabilities of the consolidated General Government Sector and is compiled based on the European System of Accounts (ESA10) methodology and is used for comparative purposes across the European Union.  <\/p><p>GGD at end-2019 was just over &euro;204 billion. Reflecting the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy and public finances, end-2020 GGD was forecast &ndash; in the recent <i>Budget 2021<\/i>&ndash; at just under &euro;219 billion. <\/p><p>National Debt Service (NDS) differs from General Government (GG) interest for a number of reasons. NDS reflects the net interest, fees and operating expenses, on the National Debt prepared on a cash basis. Whereas the GG interest is prepared on an ESA10 accruals basis and represents the projected interest cost of the wider GG measure of debt. The GG interest measure includes consolidation adjustments in respect of interest paid between bodies inside the GG sector and excludes fees and operating expenses which are captured elsewhere in the GG accounts. <\/p><p>NDS in 2019 was &euro;5.2 billion whereas GG interest was &euro;4.5 billion. For 2020, NDS was projected, at the time of Budget 2021, at &euro;4.7 billion while GG interest was forecast at &euro;3.9 billion. Therefore, despite the increase in debt, the interest bill continues to decline. This reflects the favourable funding and interest rate environment, which is underpinned by large-scale ECB monetary policy support, including its asset purchase programmes. <\/p><p>While GGD is expected to increase further next year, the pace of public debt accumulation will need to be slowed once the most acute phase of the pandemic has passed. This will be done by returning the public finances to a balanced position. In this context, the Government will set out &ndash; in the spring &ndash; a medium-term trajectory showing how the deficit will be eliminated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100067#WRL04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Value Added Tax","counter":590,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100067#WRL04600"},{"type":"question","counter":591,"qnumday":229,"qnumall":"[40198\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100067#WRL04700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the cost to the Exchequer of the VAT exemption on white and cylindrical candles per annum.","asker":"1504","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":592,"content":"<p>Candles that are white (including off-white and cream) and cylindrical are zero rated for VAT purposes.

I outlined that I expected that staff, customers and other stakeholders would be informed promptly about any decisions being made.<\/p>  <p>  News of the review is, of course, unsettling for all stakeholders, especially the staff and customers. I outlined that I expect Ulster Bank to keep all its stakeholders, especially its staff and customers, fully informed about any developments in the review and engage with them in relation to any proposals or decisions that result from the review promptly. <\/p>  <p>  I also emphasised the importance of Ulster Bank to the Irish financial services market, to the wider economy and to the communities it serves.<\/p>  <p>  Ulster Bank confirmed that the strategic review is ongoing and that no decision has yet been taken. Ulster Bank also confirmed that there is no set timetable for this review and that it is fully aware of the strategically important role that Ulster Bank plays in the provision of financial services to the Irish market.<\/p>  <p>  The continued presence of a viable and active Ulster Bank in the Irish market would be the most welcome outcome. Ulster Bank is a significant employer with 2800 employees and has 88 branches across the country. Ulster Bank is also important in terms of providing competition in the Irish retail banking market. <\/p>  <p>  In the absence of direct knowledge about NatWest&rsquo;s strategic review of Ulster Bank&rsquo;s operations, I cannot and will not comment or speculate on possible outcomes as there is no basis for such speculation, which would be open to misinterpretation.<\/p>  <p>  While I will have further engagement with the bank as the review process continues, I would like to emphasise that I have no role in the review or any commercial decisions arising from it. My officials will continue to monitor developments.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to competition in the Irish banking sector, as the Deputy may be aware, the Department of Finance published a paper in 2019 by Indecon Consulting on an Evaluation of the Concept of Community Banking in Ireland. This was a follow on to a previous paper on Local Public Banking published by the Department of Finance in 2018. The Indecon report concluded that there is no business case for the State to establish a public banking system in Ireland, supporting the outcome of the previous report on Local Public Banking.  While Indecon&rsquo;s report concluded there are some areas of market failure, it noted that there is extensive provision of and access to banking services through some 1,900 bank branches, credit union offices and An Post branches, as well as a wide range of Exchequer funded existing supports. <\/p>  <p>  Credit unions are increasing the offering of financial products for their members. The Credit Union Act, 1997 (the 1997 Act) and the Credit Union Act 1997 (Regulatory Requirements) Regulations 2016   set out the services that credit unions may provide to their members. These include loans and savings under the 1997 Act and a further suite of services under the 2016 Regulations such as third party payments; ATM services; bureau de change and certain insurance services on an agency basis. I understand that a number of credit unions provide some of the services provided for under the 2016 Regulations. Where a credit union wishes to provide other services to its members, an application may be made to the Central Bank for approval to provide such services in accordance with the provisions set out in sections 48-51 of the 1997 Act.<\/p>  <p>  One such additional service includes the Member Personal Current Account Service (MPCAS). In 2016, the Central Bank defined and described a suite of additional services known as MPCAS, under which approved credit unions may offer personal current accounts with debit cards, overdrafts and a wide range of payment services within an appropriate risk framework. To date, 54 credit unions have been approved to provide MPCAS.<\/p>  <p>  An Post offers financial services including a payment account, personal loans, credit cards, a range of insurances, money transmission and foreign exchange services. An Post offers counter services for a number of retail banks, allowing customers to lodge and withdraw cash at An Post branches. There is there is a significant network of post offices in areas where there is no bank branch within five kilometres. <\/p>  <p>  I would welcome the introduction of new lenders to the Irish market. It is, therefore, a welcome development that a new residential mortgage lender has recently entered the market and it will be of benefit to new mortgage borrowers and also to borrowers who may wish to consider switching to a new lender.  With regard to the mortgage market, though the general level of lending interest rates in Ireland are higher than is the case in many other European countries, it should also be noted that recent trends indicate that rates have been falling. For example, interest rates on new fixed rate mortgages (excluding renegotiations) have fallen from 4.11% in December 2014 to 2.64% in September of this year. <\/p>  <p>  Interest rate pricing in the mortgage market, and generally, is affected by a wide range of factors including product features, e.g. cash back, the operational costs of the lender, capital requirements, credit risk, the level of non-performing loans (NPLs) and competition.  As a result of the previous crash, credit risk levels are still elevated in Ireland as is the level of historical NPLS and these feed into higher capital requirements for Irish banks versus the requirements elsewhere in Europe.  A reduction in the level of competition in any market may affect interest rate pricing but any estimation of this, particularly in isolation, would be speculation. Furthermore, as noted above, interest rates in the Irish mortgage market have declined over the last 6 years despite lower levels of competition compared to other jurisdictions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100067#WRL05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Data","counter":601,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100067#WRL05900"},{"type":"question","counter":602,"qnumday":234,"qnumall":"[40259\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100067#WRL06000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the research his Department is undertaking on the level of sales of property by receivers that are the subject of impaired loans; the analysis that is being carried out by his Department on whether receivers are fulfilling their duties to borrowers in terms of achieving the best price for their properties; and if the research and analysis will be made available.","asker":"1504","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":603,"content":"<p>Receivership is one of the remedies available to creditors in the case of a default on a credit contract.

However, the Central Bank has informed me that credit unions have experienced savings inflows over recent years, which have outpaced loan demand from their members. The savings which a credit union does not lend to its members must be invested while ensuring that such  investments do not result in undue risk. At the same time, due to low\/negative investment returns, reflective of the current low interest rate environment, credit unions may decide to limit the amount of savings to be invested. <\/p>  <p>  Accordingly, individual credit unions may take business decisions to limit the amount of savings they accept from their members. Such limits are separate from the savings limit set out in Central Bank Regulations.<\/p>  <p>  The Credit Union Act 1997 (Regulatory Requirements) Regulations 2016 (the 2016 Regulations) set an individual savings limit of &euro;100,000 that applies on a per member basis. Individual credit unions could apply to the Central Bank to retain individual members&rsquo; savings in excess of &euro;100,000, which were held at commencement of the 2016 Regulations. In addition, on an ongoing basis, credit unions with total assets in excess of &euro;100 million can apply to the Central Bank for approval to increase individual member savings in excess of &euro;100,000.

The Government&rsquo;s strategy, in line with the public health advice, is disease suppression. COVID-19 spreads when individuals and groups come into close contact with one another, enabling the virus to move from one person to another. The risk of infection spread is greater in certain environments than others e.g. uncontrolled environments, crowded and noisy places, indoor environments, and poorly ventilated spaces.<\/p><p>Given the current epidemiological situation, it has been necessary to put in place very significant restrictions to arrest the current trajectory of the disease and break transmission chains. This means asking people to stay at home and eliminating as much activity and contacts as is possible to ensure that opportunities for the virus to transmit are minimised, while allowing essential activities to continue. Unfortunately, this means minimising discretionary activities including sports such as basketball. <\/p><p>In Levels, 3, 4 and 5 of the Government's Resilience and Recovery Plan, sporting competitions and events - indoors or outdoors - are not permitted except for defined exempted athletes and teams, as set out in the public health regulations. Individual training indoors is permitted in Level 3 and Level 4, however indoor exercise and dance classes are not. <\/p><p>I recognise that there is great disappointment among those who wish to engage in sport. There has been, and will continue to be, a regular, ongoing engagement with the sports sector, including with the National Governing Body for basketball. In addition to direct engagement with Sport Ireland, the statutory agency for the development of sport in Ireland, sporting organisations have also contributed to regular meetings of the Sports Monitoring Group, which is chaired at Ministerial level. Moreover, the Expert Group on Return to Sport, which is chaired by my Department, has reviewed and provided, via Sport Ireland, feedback to the National Governing Body for basketball on its return to sport protocols.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100068#WRM02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1471"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":632,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100068#WRM02300"},{"type":"question","counter":633,"qnumday":244,"qnumall":"[39927\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100068#WRM02400","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the reason the circus sector has been excluded from the Covid restrictions support scheme despite the statement she made that the sector may qualify for same (details supplied); the grant scheme for which the circus sector is eligible; if none, if a financial support package will be put in place for the sector; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1504","askee":"1471"},{"type":"question","counter":634,"qnumday":252,"qnumall":"[39811\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100068#WRM02500","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the actions being taken to save the Irish circus industry during Covid-19; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1481","askee":"1471"},{"type":"question","counter":635,"qnumday":254,"qnumall":"[39921\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100068#WRM02600","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the reason she has stated that the circus sector may qualify for the Covid restrictions support scheme when the eligibility criteria for the scheme expressly exclude the circus sector; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1504","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":636,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 244, 252 and 254 together.<\/p><p>Primary support for the arts in Ireland is delivered by the Arts Council.

The <i>Framework for Restrictive Measures <\/i>is a risk management strategy designed to allow individuals, families, businesses and services to better understand, anticipate and prepare for the measures Government might introduce in response to COVID-19.  Each level of the framework contains a &ldquo;basket&rdquo; of measures which are intended, collectively, to contribute to lowering risk of transmission in alignment with the risk level at that time.  The set of measures, individually, do not comprise a list of activities or places which are equally safe.  Instead, they are &ldquo;baskets&rdquo; of measures which are informed by public health understanding of the disease and recognise that we can and must prioritise some activities over others.<\/p><p>The priority in level 3 is to keep health services, schools and early learning and childcare services open and minimise disruption in the work force.  In order to keep people safe the public are asked to reduce the number of people they meet to a minimum and stay in their own county, until 18 December. Furthermore people are asked to work from home unless absolutely necessary to attend in person.<\/p><p>Many of the sectors under the aegis of my Department involve audiences and people congregating.  This is the very thing the Government is trying to minimise, we need to reduce the number of people congregating across a range of settings in order to reduce the spread of the virus.  Unfortunately, this means that certain elements of the various sectors remain closed.  <\/p><p>I fully recognise the importance of the Christmas season from social and community perspective, as well as from an economic perspective. In that context, Government has decided to make certain exemptions to help people celebrate this important time at the end of an extremely challenging year.  In the context of the Deputy&rsquo;s Question, the guidance specifies that no exercise or dance classes are allowed at Levels 3, 4 or 5.  This precludes any exercise class, including gymnastics classes, and any type of dance class &ndash; traditional, step, jazz, or ballet.  While classes are not allowed, individual training and one-to-one instruction can take place. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100068#WRM03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1471"},{"type":"question","counter":648,"qnumday":248,"qnumall":"[40288\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100068#WRM03900","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"her views on a matter regarding the case of a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":649,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, from today (Tuesday 1 December), all counties have been placed on level 3 of the Government&rsquo;s <i>Resilience and Recovery 2020 &ndash; 2021: Plan for Living with COVID-19.<\/i><\/p><p>From Friday 4 December, restaurants and pubs operating as restaurants (serving a substantial meal) can open for indoor dining with additional restrictions.

The funding will be allocated in the form of a grant scheme, open to the 69 licensed establishments in Ireland. This is aimed primarily at preventing an animal  welfare crisis as a result of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.

As well as having responsibility for licensing, inspection and regulation of zoos, my Department is responsible for ensuring compliance with welfare standards in accordance with the Irish Standards of Modern Zoo Practice, which set out best practice and strict standards for animal well-being.

To do so could potentially have an adverse impact on the many long-established tourism accommodation properties upon which the tourism industry in these areas relies. The broader regulation of tourism activity, including the possible development of a new regulatory or licensing\/registration system for commercial platforms and short-term letting agents, was recommended in the final Working Group report on the regulation of short-term letting.

However, as some elements of potential regulation of the short-term letting market fall outside the remit of my Department, I have written to my colleague the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media on this matter and look forward to engaging with my cabinet colleagues on how best this issue can be tackled jointly and more comprehensively. <\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government also commits the Government to the progression of State-backed affordable housing, including the development of a Cost Rental model. Cost Rental is housing where the rents cover only the costs of delivering, managing, and maintaining the homes. It represents a new form of rental tenure for Ireland and is particularly relevant in densely populated urban centres where rental affordability pressures are acute and where State resources can have the biggest impact in assisting people who are paying highest rents. Cost Rental projects led by Approved Housing Bodies and Local Authorities are currently under development in Dublin, while the Land Development Agency will be involved in the delivery of Cost Rental homes on its initial portfolio of urban sites across the country. However, I accept that this measure may not be immediately relevant in smaller rural towns. Accordingly the Government is exploring other possible options that might be pursued in these areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100070#WRO01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Urban Renewal Schemes","counter":766,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100070#WRO01900"},{"type":"question","counter":767,"qnumday":293,"qnumall":"[39826\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100070#WRO02000","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the regeneration plan, Project Carlow 2040: A Vision for Regeneration, launched recently by Carlow County Council and the local enterprise office and supported by local business groups in Carlow town; and if he will engage with and agree to meet local Deputies and business representatives remotely to discuss this vision for the town centre.

This coincided with the preparation of the National Planning Framework (NPF), which was finalised and published in early 2018.  Work undertaken for the NPF to project estimates of future population growth in the years ahead to 2040, is based on the 2016 Census, as the most up to date available CSO data.<\/p><p>The demographic and econometric modelling of 2016 Census data, which comprises the evidence base underpinning the NPF, includes the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) research study, titled &lsquo;Prospects for Irish Regions and Counties: Scenarios and Implications', which is available on the ESRI's website at the following link: <\/p><p>The National Planning Framework (NPF) was adopted by Government in February 2018.  This was reiterated by Government in May 2018 and a &lsquo;Roadmap&rsquo; document was drafted, setting out target population growth for each County to 2026 and 2031.  This was issued to Regional and Local Authorities in July 2018.<\/p><p>The Regional Spatial and Economic Strategy (RSES) for the Eastern and Midland Regional Assembly (EMRA) area, which includes County Meath, was subsequently adopted by the EMRA in June 2019 and includes the NPF targets.  The Meath County Plan the first statutory development plan review to be brought to the draft stage of the plan review process following the adoption of the RSES for the Eastern and Midland Regional Assembly (EMRA).  <\/p><p>The National planning strategy outlined in the NPF seeks to facilitate regional development, led by the growth of Ireland&rsquo;s five cities and five identified regional and cross-border drivers.  It aims to ensure that a greater proportion of housing demand arising in Ireland&rsquo;s cities and towns, can be accommodated within and close to the cities and towns and thereby avoid sprawl into surrounding counties and the long-distance commuting that this gives rise to.<\/p><p>While the NPF strategy is to break the &lsquo;business as usual&rsquo; pattern of development, it also recognises that this change will not automatically be achieved from the outset and allows for transition over time.  While seeking to discourage rapid unplanned growth and sprawl, the NPF strategy supports continued population and housing growth in County Meath, projecting an additional 26,000 persons in the ten years from 2016 to 2026, while also allowing for an additional &lsquo;headroom&rsquo; figure of 6,500 persons over this period.  This means that the Meath County Development Plan to 2026, must plan for a further 32,500 people in the County by 2026, than were there in 2016. <\/p><p>It remains a matter for the forthcoming Meath County development plan to determine how this level of growth should be provided for and distributed throughout the County, including over the period of the next County Development Plan.  This is the exercise that is currently underway and requires prioritisation, whereby the new population planned for is targeted towards zoned land that is serviced and locations where infrastructure and facilities have been or can be provided.  <\/p><p>The NPF is explicit that rather than focus on seeking additional housing development in locations that have been subject to rapid development and require infrastructure and services to further &lsquo;catch up&rsquo;, some locations should include planning for a greater focus on deficits, such as targeting greater employment and the needs of existing communities, as well as housing.<\/p><p>The NPF, has a long term overarching strategic framework, which will continue to be informed by the latest evidence based data and statistics.

The #EndSARS protests in Nigeria, which took place in a number of cities including Abuja and Lagos, were in reaction to allegations of excessive use of force and other abuses committed by a unit of the Nigerian police, the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) police unit.  While the protests were largely peaceful, there were credible allegations of the use of excessive force against protesters.  <\/p>  <p>  Of particular concern were reports that armed personnel in military-style attire fired live rounds towards a group of protesters in the Lekki area of Lagos on 20 October, causing numerous casualties. The Nigerian army has denied using live ammunition against civilians. An investigation of these events is currently ongoing in Nigeria. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland, together with the European Union, believes that it is essential that these allegations are thoroughly investigated and that those responsible are held to account.  This echoes the calls by UN Secretary General and the African Union for a speedy investigation and for an end to reported police brutality and abuses.<\/p>  <p>  Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari announced on 12 October that the SARS police unit would be disbanded, which had been one of the main requests made by protesters. In an address to the nation on 22 October, President Buhari set out a number of steps his Government intends to take, including: the establishment of State Judicial Panels of inquiry; the establishment of human rights complaint mechanisms; and the establishment of a fund for the compensation of victims. Work has begun on these potentially significant measures, which have helped calm the situation. <\/p>  <p>  The Nigerian National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has formed an Independent Investigative Panel to investigate allegations of abuse against the now-disbanded SARS police unit. Work by the Panel, which includes civil society and youth representatives, is currently ongoing. <\/p>  <p>  The concrete efforts of the Nigerian Government in addressing the demands of the #EndSARS movement were most recently acknowledged in the joint statement EU-Nigeria Ministerial Dialogue that was held on 18 November. In this Dialogue, the importance of respect for human rights, including the right to peaceful demonstration, was reiterated at the highest levels.<\/p>  <p>  The Embassy of Ireland in Abuja continues to actively monitor developments on the ground and, working closely with our EU partners, to engage with the Nigerian authorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100071#WRP01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1573"},{"type":"question","counter":835,"qnumday":318,"qnumall":"[39784\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100071#WRP01500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if action has been taken regarding the arrest of a person (details supplied) in Egypt as part of a crackdown on human rights; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1473","askee":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":836,"qnumday":319,"qnumall":"[39785\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100071#WRP01600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the interactions he has had with the Irish Embassy in Egypt regarding the arrest of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1473","askee":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":837,"qnumday":329,"qnumall":"[40324\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100071#WRP01700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the representations he has made to the Egyptian authorities and-or his European counterparts on the arrest and arbitrary detention of persons (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1577","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":838,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 318, 319 and 329 together.<\/p><p>I am aware of the specific cases to which the Deputies refer.

These Directives will continue to be applied, and will be updated as necessary, in Northern Ireland after the transition period. In August, the UK Government published an explainer document which outlined its commitment &ldquo;to ensuring that, if the EU decides to amend or replace the substantive rights in those directives to improve the minimum levels of protection available, the corresponding substantive rights protections in Northern Ireland will also develop to take account of this&rdquo;. <\/p>  <p>  The Protocol will apply at the end of the transition period, regardless of the outcome of negotiations between the EU and the UK on a future relationship. What is required under the Protocol is already agreed.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is aware that the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, as well as a number of civil society organisations, have expressed significant concerns in relation to the Internal Market Bill and the risk that it will undermine the Good Friday Agreement commitment to ensure incorporation of the ECHR, and risk diminishing the commitment to ensure there is no diminution of rights, safeguards or equality of opportunity as the UK leaves the EU.<\/p>  <p>  The Government takes these concerns very seriously and they underline why it is so important that the Protocol, which was designed to protect the Good Friday Agreement and the gains of the peace process, be fully implemented. The Government has been consistently clear that full, effective and timely implementation of the Protocol is of vital importance.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has participated in all meetings to date of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Withdrawal Agreement and the Specialised Committee on the Implementation of the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland. In those meetings, as well as in a number of bilateral engagements with the UK at political level, Ireland has emphasised the importance of the effective implementation of all aspects of the Protocol. We have also underlined to the British Government our grave concerns on the provisions of the Internal Market Bill, including at the very highest political level. Together with our EU partners, we will continue to monitor and engage on developments on this issue very closely.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100071#WRP04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":862,"content":"<p>Question No. 329 answered with Question No. 318.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"United Nations","counter":863,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100071#WRP04600"},{"type":"question","counter":864,"qnumday":330,"qnumall":"[40378\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100071#WRP04700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the steps that will be taken to ensure that the EU develops a legal analysis of the UN treaty and acquires a negotiation mandate given that the EU attended the sixth annual session to negotiate a UN treaty to regulate transnational corporations and other business enterprises without a negotiation mandate; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1625","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":865,"content":"<p>As I have previously stated, Ireland supports a constructive and engaged approach by the European Union in regard to the proposed legally binding instrument that it being developed by the open-ended Intergovernmental Working Group (OEIGWG) on Transnational Corporations and other business enterprises with respect to human rights. <\/p>  <p>  The sixth session of the open-ended Intergovernmental Working Group on Transnational Corporations and other business enterprises took place from 26 to 30 October last.

The EPF is seen as a global instrument and will, in particular, expand the geographical scope of the African Peace Facility.   The EU believe that the EPF will improve its ability to prevent and swiftly respond to crises and conflicts, primarily but not exclusively in areas that display the most urgent and critical security threats for the EU. <\/p>  <p>  While discussions are on-going at EU level to finalise the provisions of the mechanism, it is expected that this mechanism will be operational in 2021.  Member States contributions to the EPF will be based on a gross national income (GNI) distribution key.  Ireland's GNI distribution key is expected to increase in 2021 to reflect the impact of Brexit. The allocation of the &euro;5.7billion for the period 2021 to 2027 across assistance measures (under what was the African Peace Facility) and Athena and across each of the seven years of the MFF has not yet been agreed by Member States. <\/p>  <p>  The Department of Defence has responsibility for the Athena Mechanism.  Under the proposed EPF, funding for Athena will remain in a separate pillar within the framework of the EPF and will be expanded to account for the additional costs associated with EU overseas deployments.  While projected out-turn for Ireland's contribution to Athena in 2020 is approximately &euro;1.7m, the indicative figures provided in respect of Year 1 of the EPF indicate expenditure in this area for Ireland in the region of &euro;2.2m for 2021.  <\/p>  <p>  In terms of military CSDP missions and deployment of members of the military forces of member states, the only change proposed within the EPF is that more of the costs would be commonly funded.  At the moment most of the costs associated with, for example, an EU military Training Mission or the deployment of EU Battlegroups, lie with the member states which send personnel, but in future there will be more costs (eg transport costs) eligible for refund from the Facility. While there is preliminary agreement on the type of costs to be covered in common, the actual amount will depend on the circumstances- the type, number and location of military CSDP missions, including future missions which may be agreed only by unanimity over the coming seven years and take into account lessons learned from ongoing missions and operations. <\/p>  <p>  Discussions continue in Brussels on the measure and the exact provisions and there are on-going discussions here between the Departments of Defence, Foreign Affairs, Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100072#WRQ06700","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Permanent Structured Co-operation","counter":951,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100072#WRQ06800"},{"type":"question","counter":952,"qnumday":361,"qnumall":"[40401\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100072#WRQ06900","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"if he will report on the permanent structured co-operation, PESCO, projects in which Ireland has observer status; his plans to participate in further PESCO projects; the criteria that will be used; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1547","askee":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":953,"qnumday":366,"qnumall":"[40406\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100072#WRQ07000","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"if Ireland will be submitting permanent structured co-operation, PESCO, project proposals with an operational focus in order to facilitate joint deployment in the field; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1547","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":954,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 361 and 366 together.<\/p>  <p>  Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) is a process under which groups of Member States can come together to develop capabilities in support of Common CSDP Operations.

Taking stock of a rapidly deteriorating security envi\u00adronment for Europe, the strategy broadened the EU&rsquo;s level of ambition beyond crisis management and capacity building to include issues such as hybrid threats, cybersecurity, border management and other challenges that sit along the internal-external secu\u00adrity nexus. <\/p>  <p>  The establishment of PESCO represented a further development in EU Cooperation in support of international peace and security under Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP).  Ireland has participated in PESCO since it was established.  As part of our participation in PESCO, Ireland has committed to regularly increase our defence budgets in real terms. It should be noted that regularly does not mean annually but rather over the medium term. Ireland&rsquo;s defence expenditure increased in real terms in both 2019 and 2020 and with the announced increase of over &euro;32m in the defence allocation for Budget 2021, Ireland&rsquo;s defence expenditure will continue to increase in real terms.  The Council Decision under which PESCO is established provides that the commitment cannot be inconsistent with or affect national sovereignty or the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain Member States and must be consistent with the applicable constitutional provisions of the member State.  <\/p>  <p>  Joining PESCO does not of itself involve any direct additional cost to the Exchequer.  However, additional costs may arise in respect of participation in specific PESCO projects similar to the case where the Defence Forces participate in European Defence Agency Project, the costs of which are met from the Defence Vote. Ireland is currently a participant in one PESCO project and holds observer status on a further nine. To date the only costs that have been incurred through PESCO relate only to costs associated with attendance by military Subject Matter Experts at PESCO project planning meetings.  <\/p>  <p>  The project which Ireland is a participant in, is still developing, and the budgets and timeline for participant's involvement has yet to be fully determined. This may change as the project progresses and capabilities are developed and acquired through the PESCO framework. However, it is expected that sharing the costs of capability development across a number of Member States should prove cost neutral in terms of overall projected defence expenditure.<\/p>  <p>  The recently completed PESCO Strategic Review which brings to a close the first initial phase of PESCO does not establish any new commitments or modify the existing PESCO commitments for the period 2021 - 2025.

The staffing schedule operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally, irrespective of location. For the current school year, it operates on a general average of 26 pupils to every 1 teacher (26:1) which is historically the lowest ever allocation ratio at primary level.  In DEIS schools, the staffing schedule operates at a more preferential allocation ratio.<\/p>  <p>  The staffing process includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit a staffing appeal to the Primary Staffing Appeals Board under certain criteria as outlined in the staffing circular 18\/2020. <\/p>  <p>  This year the Department and the Primary Appeals Board are very cognisant of the impact of COVID-19 on schools and in that context has looked carefully at all decisions on the allocation of teaching posts where schools have reduced enrolments to ensure that all decisions are reasonable and all schools are treated fairly.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to appeals dealt with by the Primary Appeals Board, 195 appeals were submitted by schools.  These included schools that were due to lose a post and schools that sought to gain an additional teaching post based on projected enrolments.  14% of these schools were unsuccessful in their appeal with the main reason being instances where schools had forecasted a larger intake of pupils than materialised and in some cases the overall number of pupils returned on 30th September was lower than last&rsquo;s years enrolment and did not warrant an additional teacher based on current staffing schedules.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100074#WRS01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"DEIS Scheme","counter":1036,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100074#WRS01300"},{"type":"question","counter":1037,"qnumday":392,"qnumall":"[39775\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100074#WRS01400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the way in which the &euro;5 million investment for DEIS schools as announced in budget 2021 will be allocated; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1521","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1038,"content":"<p>I am pleased to advise the Deputy that under Budget 2021 I have announced a general reduction in the mainstream staffing schedule to 25:1.

The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period. This arbitration agreement covered the period up to 31 December 2019 and has been fully implemented. <\/p>  <p>  The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a secretary or caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019 been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay. <\/p>  <p>  F&oacute;rsa trade union has tabled a follow-on claim from the 2015 agreement.

A stable, secure learning environment is an essential requirement to achieve this goal.  A core value of the curriculum, across all levels of schooling in Ireland, is inclusivity and diversity. The curriculum at primary and post-primary is for all learners, from all backgrounds &ndash; regardless of gender, socio-economic background, race or creed. It aims to foster inclusivity where equality and diversity are promoted.  <\/p><p>At primary level, Social, personal and health education (SPHE) provides particular opportunities to foster the personal development, health and well-being of the individual child, to help him\/her to create and maintain supportive relationships and become an active and responsible citizen in society. As children progress through an SPHE programme, they will encounter a wide range of issues. These will include substance misuse, relationships, sexuality, child abuse prevention, prejudice and discrimination. The SPHE curriculum is structured in such a way that these issues are not explored in isolation; rather the emphasis is on building a foundation of skills, values, attitudes and understanding relevant to all these issues, with specific information provided where necessary. SPHE contributes to the development of personal attributes and skills, such as learning how to manage feelings, how to resolve conflicts and how to cope with new and demanding situations.<\/p><p>SPHE provides opportunities for children to learn about, and actively participate in, the various communities to which they belong and to develop a sense of a shared commitment. Diversity and difference characterise the society in which children live. A respect for and an appreciation of human and cultural diversity can and should be promoted at every level of the primary school. Through SPHE children can become aware of some of the prejudices and attitudes that fail to respect the dignity of others. <\/p><p>At post-primary level, the Framework for Junior Cycle (2015) emphasises the importance of valuing, acknowledging and affirming all the students&rsquo; learning opportunities and experiences during the three years of junior cycle. It also envisages that parents\/guardians and students will get a broader picture of students&rsquo; learning.<\/p><p>At the heart of junior cycle reform lies the need to build on our understanding of education, to provide students with quality learning opportunities that strike a balance between learning knowledge and developing a wide range of skills and thinking abilities. <\/p><p>Students will have opportunities and be encouraged to use and develop skills such as applying their learning in a number of different contexts; engaging in research, investigation and experimentation; and making decisions, implementing ideas and taking action.<\/p><p>SPHE at Junior Cycle provides a unique opportunity where students can develop the skills and competences to learn about themselves, to care for themselves and others and to make informed decisions about their overall health and wellbeing. <\/p><p>SPHE also provides the context within which students can learn about the important moral, physical, social and emotional issues around relationships, sex and sexuality including where to get reliable information from trusted sources.<\/p><p>In December 2019, a review of Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) provision in Irish schools carried out by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) which specifically looked into, among other areas, healthy, positive, sexual expressions and relationships, contraception and LGBTQ+ matters. As a result of this review, the NCCA are currently developing interim guidance for SPHE and RSE to provide guidance on how the current curriculum can be provided in a more holistic way. Work on updating or developing new specifications for SPHE\/RSE will commence in the NCCA in 2021, beginning with a focus on Junior Cycle.<\/p><p>The NCCA will examine opportunities for SPHE\/RSE within the new Junior Cycle Wellbeing area of learning. Wellbeing provides learning opportunities to enhance the physical, mental, emotional and social wellbeing and resilience of students, and to enable students to build life-skills and to develop a strong sense of connectedness to the school and to their community. <\/p><p>With regard to ensuring a safe environment for all learners, the National Anti-Bullying Procedures for schools were published in September 2013 and are available on the Department&rsquo;s website at <\/p><p>These procedures are designed to give direction and guidance to school authorities and school personnel in preventing and tackling school-based bullying behaviour amongst their pupils.  The procedures require that the prevention of bullying must be an integral part of a school&rsquo;s anti-bullying policy. The procedures include specific requirements in relation to the use of prevention and education strategies and the consistent investigation, follow up and recording of bullying behaviour.  The strategies that schools implement must be documented in the anti-bullying policy and must explicitly deal with the issue of identity-based bullying.  Schools&rsquo; actions to create a positive school culture and to prevent and tackle bullying are included in the whole school evaluation process carried out by the Department&rsquo;s Inspectorate.<\/p><p>Schools are required to publish their anti-bullying policy on the school's website and to provide it to the parents association and to undertake an annual review of the school's anti-bullying policy and its implementation. Confirmation that the annual review has been completed must be provided to the parents association and published on the school website.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100076#WRU02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs","counter":1201,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100076#WRU03000"},{"type":"question","counter":1202,"qnumday":450,"qnumall":"[40471\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100076#WRU03100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the extent to which she continues to make provision of sufficient places for children with autism throughout mainstream education at both primary and secondary level; the extent to which the needs of students are being met to the fullest extent possible in line with projections; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1203,"content":"<p>It is my belief that children with special educational needs should receive their education in placements which are appropriate to their needs alongside their peers wherever possible unless such an approach would be inconsistent with the best interests of the individual child or other children in the school. <\/p><p>This approach is consistent with the provisions of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act 2004.  <\/p><p>My Department's policy is therefore to provide for the inclusive education of children with special educational needs, including autism, in mainstream schools. The majority of children with special needs attend mainstream education with additional supports.  <\/p><p>This policy is supported by significant investment by Government, &euro;2bn or 20% of the total education spend.  This funds the provision of additional teachers, special needs assistants and other supports required to enable children with special needs to access education. <\/p><p>Only where it has been assessed that the child is unable to be supported in mainstream education, are special class placements or special school placements recommended and provided for.<\/p><p>It is therefore not the case that special educational placements are required to support all children with special educational needs, nor is it intended that this should be the case. <\/p><p>As the first-ever Minister with responsibility for special education, I am however determined that specialist educational placements are available to meet the needs of children with special educational needs where required.  <\/p><p>We are fortunate in Ireland that most schools accept their responsibility in this regard and are very willing to enrol children with special educational needs and open special classes to meet the needs of their community.  <\/p><p>Good planning is essential to ensuring that specialist placements are available when and where they are required.<\/p><p>The National Council for Special Education has a statutory function to plan and coordinate specialist provision throughout the country.  My Department works closely with the Council in supporting the establishment of the necessary provision.  <\/p><p>Demand is forecast based on engagement with families, schools, HSE teams, NEPS and other relevant stakeholders. <\/p><p>There are now 1,836 special classes in place, compared to 548 in 2011.  Of these 1,567 are Autism classes. Provision in special schools has increased from 6,848 placements in 2011 to approx. 7,872 this year. <\/p><p>And while the significant growth in special class and school provision is a strong indicator the current approach is effective, there are challenges in some parts of the country where increases in population and other issues have led to reports of a shortage of specialist school places. <\/p><p>Recently, protocols and procedures have been developed between my Department and the NCSE that provide for a more joined up approach to planning at both national and local level.  The NCSE is developing a five year forecasting tool which incorporates population demographics and forecasts of need which will inform future planning for special class accommodation in major projects and new school builds.<\/p><p>Through better planning at both national and local level, it is my objective that specialist education places should come on stream to meet emerging demand on a timely basis. However, the active collaboration of school communities is essential in this regard.<\/p><p>NCSE has also been asked to provide policy advice on the future of special schools and classes and the advice is expected before the year end.  The evidence based advice will take account of local and international perspectives including the views of stakeholders. <\/p><p>In the meantime, my Department will continue to provide for a continuum of provision, which includes special class and special school places for children who have been assessed as needing such placements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100076#WRU03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs Staff","counter":1204,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100076#WRU03300"},{"type":"question","counter":1205,"qnumday":451,"qnumall":"[40472\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100076#WRU03400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the extent to which the special needs teacher requirement continues to be met nationally and, in particular, in north County Kildare; if sufficient provision continues to be made in line with requirements and requests from the various primary and second level schools; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1206,"content":"<p>Very significant levels of financial provision are made to ensure that all children with special educational needs can be provided with an education appropriate to their needs. <\/p><p>Next year my Department will spend approximately &euro;2 Billion, or almost 20% of its total budget, on making additional provision for children with special educational needs.<\/p><p>This represents an increase of over 50% in total expenditure since 2011, at which point &euro;1.247 Billion per annum was provided. <\/p><p>This additional investment has provided for an increase of 39% in the number of special education teachers allocated to schools, from 9,740 in 2011, to over 13,550 at present.  <\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that a new model for allocating special education teachers to mainstream schools was introduced from September 2017.

Consequently, there are over 1.4 million applications to be examined to determine if arrears are due. To date, over 13 million individual payments have issued over a 36 week period. <\/p>  <p>  Arrears in respect of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment will arise under two broad headings. Firstly, there may have been an initial time lag in the commencement of payments. During the month of March, the Department of Social Protection received and processed jobseeker claims equivalent in number to a three year claim-load. Almost 59,000 people were paid in the first week of the scheme, increasing to 283,000 people in the following week and over 507,000 people in the third week of the scheme. The focus was on putting claims into payment as quickly as possible was and it was not possible to generate arrears payments at the time.  Secondly, arrears may also arise in respect of individual weeks where claims could not be processed due to incomplete applications or data mismatches. <\/p>  <p>  The Department is keenly aware that many people are due some arrears and that every case will be different. In order to address an issue of this scale, the Department has developed an automated process, which examines each case and looks at their overall entitlement to payment and matches this against their payment history. The work involved is complex as the Pandemic Unemployment Payment system itself evolved from a manual applications system to one where applications were submitted online and paid over two different payment platforms (one from March to July and the second from July to date). Final testing and implementation of the automated process is currently underway.  It is intended that payments in respect of identified cases will issue on 1 December. <\/p>  <p>  The tax treatment of any arrears of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment  is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.<\/p>  <p>  I hope that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100077#WRV03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":1263,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100077#WRV03200"},{"type":"question","counter":1264,"qnumday":473,"qnumall":"[39688\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100077#WRV03300","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the reason persons over 66 years of age are not considered for the Covid-19 crisis payment; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1511","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1265,"content":"<p>The Pandemic Unemployment Payment is a statutory support payable to people between the ages of 18 and 66 which is consistent with other social protection schemes payable to people of working age who have lost their employment. <\/p><p>People aged 66 years and over are provided for through the contributory State pension or the non-contributory State means tested pension.<\/p><p>A person aged over 66 who is in employment may retain their State pension and employment income. <\/p><p>If a person does not have the required number of contributions to receive the maximum rate of State pension contributory they may qualify for an increased rate of State non-contributory pension, depending on their circumstances.

As part of these consultations, potential changes to the eligibility criteria were discussed and a number of viable changes were implemented thereafter. <\/p>  <p>  A number of new conditions were introduced to the CE scheme in July 2017 in order to further support progression to employment, broaden CE access to a wider range of people and to standardise the conditions relating to the length of time a CE participant can remain on a CE scheme.  <\/p>  <p>  The general qualifying age for CE for those on the Live Register was reduced from 25 to 21 years.  <\/p>  <p>  It was also made easier for former CE participants, who had exhausted their CE entitlement, to re-qualify for CE as participation prior to the year 2007 was to be disregarded.

This is because many employers operate a \"last in-first out\" protocol when reducing their labour force and also because young people tend to work in occupations and sectors, such as retail and hospitality, that are most immediately affected by economic downturns.  As research published recently by my Department shows, the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic has been no different.<\/p>  <p>  Youth unemployment stood at just over 10% in Q1 2020 based on the Labour Force Survey data, with approximately 20,000 persons aged under 25 on the Live Register.  By Q3 2020 these figures had increased to 20% and 25,000 respectively.<\/p>  <p>  By end October, if PUP recipients are included in the figures, over 45% of young people in the labour force were unemployed.  However, it is important to note that the Government extended access to PUP to students who worked part-time.  As a consequence one in four of those in receipt of PUP, and under 25, have self-certified as students.  Using internationally recognised standards set by the International Labour Organisation, these students would not normally be considered, or counted, as unemployed.<\/p>  <p>  While young people are disproportionately affected we also know from past recessions that youth unemployment levels typically fall quite quickly once economic activity resumes.  <\/p>  <p>  The evidence also shows, however, that some young people will remain disconnected from employment and that those who cannot re-find their footing tend to suffer permanent scarring effects with unemployment and social isolation becoming entrenched. <\/p>  <p>  That is why it is critically important that we act quickly and decisively to engage with young people who do not return to either employment or education, to create opportunities and options for them, to promote these options and to work with them to help them take up these options.  As part of this approach it is also critically important to work with employers to encourage them to make opportunities available to young people who might not have the social and family networks that can sometimes be necessary to take that first step into employment. <\/p>  <p>  That is why my Department, and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, are developing a range of support measures to assist persons, including young persons, on their journey to work.  Measures announced under the July Jobs Stimulus to combat unemployment and youth unemployment, include:<\/p>  <p>  - Expanding the capacity of Intreo Centres to provide enhanced employment services and supports with the assignment of 100 Job Coaches.<\/p>  <p>  - Expanding the benefit of the JobsPlus recruitment subsidy to employers who  hire young people from the Live Register. <\/p>  <p>  - Providing 35,000 new places in further and higher education courses.<\/p>  <p>  - Providing incentives to employers to take on more apprentices, with the provision of a grant of &euro;3,000 to employers for each new apprentice recruited.<\/p>  <p>  - Facilitating access to the Back to Education Allowance and Back to Work Enterprise Allowance to those displaced by the pandemic by waiving the usual qualifying period.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is also developing a new work experience placement programme for those out of work for at least six months to encourage employers to provide jobseekers with the necessary workplace skills to compete in the labour market  - to help break the vicious circle of 'no job without experience, no experience without a job'.  I expect to launch the Programme in early 2021, subject to public health restrictions.<\/p>  <p>  In developing these programmes and services the Department is working closely with, and being advised by, the Labour Market Advisory Council which is composed of leading market experts, representatives of industry and workers and representatives of unemployed people.

Only one allowance is paid per household.<\/p><p>In Budget 2021, I announced an increase of &euro;3.50 in the weekly rate of Fuel Allowance payable with effect from 4 January 2021.  This increase takes account of the increase in carbon tax on solid fuels from May 2021 and allows recipients to benefit from the increased payment rate over this winter period. <\/p><p>Current figures indicate that approximately 369,000 households are in receipt of Fuel Allowance.  Those who qualified for Fuel Allowance last year automatically receive the payment this year, provided they continue to fulfil the eligibility conditions, and do not need to re-apply.  <\/p><p>Due to the administration of Fuel Allowance payments across different IT platforms, accurate numbers of claims received and disallowed are not readily available.  However, approximate numbers of claims awarded and disallowed for the last eight years and to date in 2020 are provided in the table below.<\/p><p><b>YearAwardedDisallowed<\/b><\/p><p><b>2020 (to date)  <\/b>28,64619,761<\/p><p><b>2019<\/b>31,90121,639<\/p><p><b>2018<\/b>  32,39921,727<\/p><p><b>2017<\/b>59,88021,100<\/p><p><b>2016<\/b>26,50418,021<\/p><p><b>2015<\/b>  27,64318,110<\/p><p><b>2014<\/b>28,42215,064<\/p><p><b>2013<\/b>  28,30216,864<\/p><p><b>2012<\/b>  21,35913,976<\/p><p>Eligibility for fuel allowance is assessed based on a means test, a household composition test and only one allowance payable per household.

Information appearing in media over recent days is speculative and not accurate.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of preparations to support former residents, my Department has a dedicated telephone information line available for any person seeking further information in relation to these issues. Relevant contact details are available on my Department's website.

Additional resources were made available to the Health Service Executive in 2020 to put in place dedicated and enhanced counselling and patient advocacy services for former residents of these institutions. My officials have liaised with the Department of Health and the National Counselling Service to ensure that available capacity is primed to respond to the anticipated increased demand for its services which may arise on publication of the report.

Tackling this issue is good for equality and it also makes good business sense, as firms that can report a low or non-existent gender pay gap will have an advantage in recruiting future employees. Initiatives to address the gender pay gap can also be expected to have a positive impact on disparities in income for women across and after their working lives.<\/p>  <p>  The aim of the Gender Pay Gap Bill is to provide transparency on the gender pay gap and incentivise employers to take measures to address the issue insofar as they can. The Bill was published on 8 April 2019 and completed D&aacute;il Committee Stage in June 2019. It has since then been reintroduced by the Government, and Report Stage is currently awaited.

The Act distinguishes between the entitlement to citizenship by birth and descent and to the acquisition of citizenship through the naturalisation process. <\/p><p>Following a referendum of the Irish people, the 27th amendment to the Constitution changed the situation in relation to entitlement to Irish Citizenship. As a result, Section 6 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 was amended by the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 2004. <\/p><p>The changes came into effect on 1 January 2005. As of that date, a person born in the island of Ireland is not entitled to be an Irish citizen, unless that person's parents have been legally resident in the island of Ireland for a total of three years during the four years preceding that person's birth. The parent of a child who meets these requirements can apply directly to the Department of Foreign Affairs for an Irish passport and therefore does not require a naturalisation certificate. <\/p><p>It is open to the parent, guardian or person who is in loco parentis to the child to lodge an application for naturalisation on behalf of the child if and when the conditions for naturalisation are satisfied, including a requirement to have a total of 5 years residence in the State. This ensures that there is a pathway to obtaining Irish citizenship through the naturalisation process for those children. <\/p><p>No applications for citizenship were granted to children born in the State during the period 2000 to 2010 because prior to 2005, a child born in the State had an automatic entitlement to Irish citizenship and thereafter they must have 5 years residence before making an application.<\/p><p>Table 1 below sets out the certificates granted since 2010 to minors born in the State who did not at birth have an entitlement to Irish citizenship.<\/p><p>Table 1 <table>    <tr>       <th><\/th>       <th>2012<\/th>       <th>2013<\/th>       <th>2014<\/th>       <th>2015<\/th>       <th>2016<\/th>       <th>2017<\/th>       <th>2018<\/th>       <th>2019<\/th>       <th>2020 (to date)<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Minor born in State post 1 Jan 2005<\/td>       <td>331<\/td>       <td>485<\/td>       <td>191<\/td>       <td>72<\/td>       <td>102<\/td>       <td>53<\/td>       <td>76<\/td>       <td>42<\/td>       <td>4<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>Some or all of the conditions for naturalisation may be waived where the applicant is a naturalised Irish citizen acting on behalf of their minor child.

In turn, this provides for timely reunification with immediate family members to support those granted international protection to begin their new lives here in Ireland.<\/p><p>The family reunification provisions under the 2015 Act apply equally to beneficiaries of both types of international protection: refugee status and subsidiary protection status and there are no economic conditions imposed on sponsors.  The application must be made within 12 months of being granted international protection. <\/p><p>Under Section 56 of the 2015 Act, the following family members are eligible for family reunification:<\/p><p>Spouse - the marriage must have subsisted on the date the application for international protection in the State was lodged;<\/p><p>Civil Partner- the civil partnership must have subsisted on the date the application for international protection in the State was lodged;<\/p><p>Parent(s) and their children (under 18 and unmarried) if the sponsor was under 18 andunmarried on the date the application for family reunification in the State was lodged; and<\/p><p>A child of the sponsor, who is under the age of 18 and unmarried when the sponsor made an application for family reunification in the State. <\/p><p>Where an application for Family Reunification is granted, family members will be given permission to enter and\/or reside in the State for not less than one year, provided the sponsor's permission is in force and the sponsor is entitled to remain in the State.<\/p><p>It also remains open to me to exercise my discretion under the Non-EEA Policy Document on Family Reunification to waive the economic conditions for sponsors applying for extended family members. My Department will continue to examine such applications on humanitarian grounds on a case-by case basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100082#WRAA06300","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Crime Data","counter":1650,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100082#WRAA06400"},{"type":"question","counter":1651,"qnumday":609,"qnumall":"[40316\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100082#WRAA06500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of convictions that took place in 2019 to date in 2020, under section 80(1) of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1469","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":1652,"content":"<p>As the Deputy may be aware, under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998, management of the courts is the responsibility of the Courts Service, which is independent in exercising its functions, and this includes information relating to convictions. <\/p><p>I have had enquiries made of the Courts Service and they have provided the information requested on convictions in the table below. <\/p><p>It should be noted that this information provided has been drawn from instances where prosecutors used offence codes.

Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of face coverings by persons in various community settings has been recommended by an increasing number of countries. In Ireland, cloth face coverings are currently mandatory on public transport and in a range of indoor settings, including shops and other retail outlets. Additionally, cloth face coverings are recommended in situations where physical distancing may not be possible. In both the primary and post-primary setting, it is a requirement that staff wear a face covering when a physical distance of 2 m from other staff or students cannot be maintained. Children in the post-primary setting should also wear a face covering when a physical distance of 2 m from other staff or students cannot be maintained.

The second phase will focus on the execution of the programme once vaccine is available &ndash; encouraging the public to get the vaccine, informing  them about who will administer it and where, and providing information on the progress of the programme on an ongoing basis. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100085#WRDD00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Staff","counter":1821,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100085#WRDD01000"},{"type":"question","counter":1822,"qnumday":666,"qnumall":"[39767\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100085#WRDD01100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on a matter (details supplied) in relation to the appointment of a rheumatologist at University Hospital Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1823,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100085#WRDD01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Respite Care Services","counter":1824,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100085#WRDD01300"},{"type":"question","counter":1825,"qnumday":667,"qnumall":"[39769\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100085#WRDD01400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the progress of the development of respite care facilities (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1516","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1826,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose, and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.<\/p>  <p>  As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100085#WRDD01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1484"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HSE Staff","counter":1827,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100085#WRDD01600"},{"type":"question","counter":1828,"qnumday":668,"qnumall":"[39786\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100085#WRDD01700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if a matter raised in correspondence by a person (details supplied) in relation to staff pay from the HSE for a practice will be examined and expedited.","asker":"1581","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1829,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100085#WRDD01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1830,"content":"<p>Question No. 669 answered with Question No. 632.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Public Health Emergency Team","counter":1831,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100085#WRDD02000"},{"type":"question","counter":1832,"qnumday":670,"qnumall":"[39800\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100085#WRDD02100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason the expert advisory group to NPHET was dissolved following its last meeting on 2 September 2020; the rationale for this decision; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1478","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1833,"content":"<p>This decision was taken in the context of a review carried out by the NPHET, in which a number of Subgroups, having met their Terms of Reference, were stood down with their work subsequently realigned into the appropriate policy and operational functions of the Department of Health or other relevant organisations, or bodies.

The 2019 Survey found that 5% of the population use e&ndash;cigarettes and a further 12% reported having tried them at some point. It also found that 38% of those who made an attempt to quit smoking reported using e-cigarettes during the attempt. The Survey does not examine standards in vaping products.<\/p>  <p>  Electronic cigarettes are currently regulated in Ireland by the European Union (Manufacture, Presentation and Sale of Tobacco and Related Products) Regulations 2016. These Regulations transposed the EU Tobacco Products Directive (Directive 2014\/40\/EU).<\/p>  <p>  The Regulations introduced minimum standards for the safety and quality of all e-cigarettes and refill containers including limiting the capacity of e-cigarette tanks, limiting the volume of nicotine-containing e-liquid allowed in one refill container and restricting the nicotine strength of e-liquids.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Regulations require nicotine-containing products and their packaging to be child-resistant and tamper proof, prohibit certain ingredients including colourings, caffeine and taurine, and provide for mandatory labelling requirements including health warnings. The manufacturers of electronic cigarettes must also notify the HSE and provide details on all ingredients contained in e-cigarettes and e-liquids before they can be sold in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The most recent data on the usage of electronic cigarettes among young people is from the European Schools Project on Alcohol and other Drugs 2019 report. Almost 2,000 Irish students aged 15 and 16 years completed the survey in 2019 and it found that 39% of students reported having ever used an e-cigarette with 16% of these reporting using one in the last 30 days.<\/p>  <p>  In October 2020 the Health Research Board published the findings of three evidence reviews on electronic cigarettes that were conducted at the request of the Minister for Health. The main findings of the reviews are as follows:<\/p>  <p>  - Electronic cigarettes are not harmless to users, but there is evidence that they are less harmful than tobacco cigarettes.<\/p>  <p>  - Electronic cigarettes appear to be as effective as nicotine replacement therapies for assisting smoking cessation for an observed period of up to 6 months. Further study is required to determine their effectiveness over a longer period.<\/p>  <p>  - There appears to be an association between the use of electronic cigarettes and subsequent smoking among adolescents.<\/p>  <p>  The General Scheme of the Public Health (Tobacco and Nicotine Inhaling Products) Bill was approved by Government in October 2019. Along with important tobacco control provisions the Bill will further regulate the sale of electronic cigarettes by prohibiting their sale to, or by, persons under the age of 18 and by introducing a mandatory licence for the retail sale of e-cigarettes. The General Scheme of the Bill has been submitted to the Office of Parliamentary Counsel for drafting and has also been referred to the Oireachtas Committee on Health for Pre-Legislative Scrutiny.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100085#WRDD06000","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1871,"content":"<p>Question No. 683 answered with Question No. 658.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vaccination Programme","counter":1872,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100085#WRDD06300"},{"type":"question","counter":1873,"qnumday":684,"qnumall":"[39861\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100085#WRDD06400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the counties that have the greatest shortage of access to the flu vaccine; the way in which he will ensure that all vulnerable persons receive their vaccinations before the end of 2020; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1547","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1874,"content":"<p>This season, 1.95 million doses of influenza vaccine have been purchased, which is double the amount administered last season.

A number of initial priority areas for action were determined by the Taskforce in 2020, with the issue of endometriosis recognised and included as part of a priority workstream on improving gynaecological health for women and girls.

A programme of actions under these proposals is currently being finalised.

The HSE&rsquo;s National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme has advised that the best way to help the majority of patients with endometriosis is to improve access to gynaecology services.  As such, the Programme has developed a plan to increase capacity and reduce waiting times for women awaiting general gynaecology, which includes patients with endometriosis. The plan aims to re-orient general gynaecology services to an ambulatory, or see and treat, model, rather than the traditional outpatient referral model.  An ambulatory care model is a more efficient and effective use of resources.  It is also better for the patient as it reduces the requirement for multiple outpatient appointments. The roll out of Phase One of the new Model of Care commenced this year, with the first three clinics to be established under the governance of the Rotunda Hospital, Cork University Maternity Hospital, and University Hospital Galway, with a more limited clinic in Waterford. Additional clinics will be developed in 2021, with investment provided through Budget 2021, and subject to funding availability, it is envisaged that further clinics will be rolled out in the coming years. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100085#WRDD07200","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nursing Staff","counter":1883,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100086#WREE00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1884,"qnumday":688,"qnumall":"[39876\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100086#WREE00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the consideration he has given to concerns raised by nursing and midwifery third level students in relation to lack of pay; the steps his Department plans to take to address the concerns urgently; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1567","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1885,"content":"<p>I recognise the importance of student nurses and midwives completing their essential clinical placements in a safe environment and also recognise the potential hardship that might arise for students on placement due to COVID 19 such as, maintaining part time employment, increased travel and additional accommodation costs.  <\/p><p>Student nurses and midwives are not paid for clinical placements in years 1-3 and year 4 from the period of September to December of their studies and this supernumerary status is critical for learning in complex environments.

Visiting guidance was considered in the context of the wider COVID-19 situation, as we exit level 5 restrictions today. <\/p>  <p>  It is also important to be cognisant of the wider epidemiological situation and the risks associated with same. On the 19th November, the European Centre for Disease Control published its latest risk assessment with regard to long-term care facilities. It highlights that the probability of COVID-19 introduction into a long-term care facility depends on the level of COVID-19 circulation in the community, with a higher risk associated with higher incidence rates in the community. <\/p>  <p>  This highlights the importance of suppressing the level of the virus in the community as one of the primary measures for protecting nursing homes. As citizens, we all have a responsibility in this regard and our actions across all of society can directly impact the outcomes for nursing home residents.<\/p>  <p>  I encourage all nursing homes to remain familiar with the latest public health advice and support, and to make every effort to continue to facilitate visitors in line with public health advice and to communicate with family and friends on an ongoing basis in order to support positive mental health and wellbeing.  I have communicated with the sector outlining the need for them to be flexible, innovative and to facilitate to the greatest extent possible alternative arrangements such as window visiting, in line with public health advice. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100086#WREE00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":1889,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100086#WREE00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1890,"qnumday":690,"qnumall":"[39885\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100086#WREE00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on a matter regarding the case of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1891,"content":"<p>Given the role of the HSE&rsquo;s National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme in the dissemination of pregnancy related clinical guidelines, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100086#WREE01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Dental Services ","counter":1892,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100086#WREE01100"},{"type":"question","counter":1893,"qnumday":691,"qnumall":"[39890\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100086#WREE01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a vacant position for a dentist for the school dentistry service based in Tuam, County Galway, will be filled; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1482","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1894,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100086#WREE01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"General Practitioner Services","counter":1895,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100086#WREE01400"},{"type":"question","counter":1896,"qnumday":692,"qnumall":"[39891\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100086#WREE01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the assistance and advice he can provide on a matter (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1897,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100086#WREE01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":1898,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100086#WREE01700"},{"type":"question","counter":1899,"qnumday":693,"qnumall":"[39897\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100086#WREE01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on the waiting time of nine months for a person (details supplied) to be seen at the breast clinic in University Hospital Limerick, having originally been advised that it would be a six-week wait period; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1509","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1900,"content":"<p>The HSE's National Cancer Control Programme (NCCP) have advised that an appointment has been scheduled for the patient to whom you refer for Tuesday 2nd December at 9.00am.

() <\/p><p>This publication is based on deaths registered with the General Registrar&rsquo;s Office (GRO) and notified to the CSO for the period of January to October 2020.<\/p><p>The findings of the CSO publication reported that there were 1,462 Covid-19 related deaths in the period January &ndash; October 2020 registered with the General Registrar's Office and subsequently notified to the CSO. <\/p><p>As of the 1<sup>st<\/sup>of November, the Department of Health had been notified of 1,915 Covid-19 related deaths. This is 453 higher than reported by the CSO for deaths registered by the end of October. <\/p><p>These deaths have been reported to the Department of Health by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC). Under Infectious Diseases (Amendment) Regulations 2020, all medical practitioners are required to notify the Medical Officer of Health (MOH)\/Director of Public Health (DPH) of certain diseases including Covid-19. <\/p><p>There are several reasons for the difference in these figures:<\/p><p>a. The CSO note that the data in their publication is based on deaths that occurred between 1 Jan 2020 and end October 2020, and that have been registered with the General Registrar's Office and subsequently notified to the Central Statistics Office (CSO). They also note that these figures are provisional.<\/p><p>b. Due to the legal requirement for registration of deaths being within 3 months in Ireland, it can be assumed that deaths for the months August-October registered with the GRO and subsequently notified to the CSO are incomplete.<\/p><p>c. Outside of these months, there are a significant proportion of deaths that are registered after 3 months.  The most common reason for a late registration of a death is that a case is referred to the Coroner for further investigation.<\/p><p>d. All unnatural deaths (deaths from accidents, suicides, poisonings etc.) must be referred to the Coroner&rsquo;s Office for further investigation and these deaths tend to be registered late as a consequence.  In addition, all deaths that occur in nursing homes and all COVID-19 deaths must also be reported to the Coroner. The number of late registered deaths is increasing over recent years and the CSO publishes these late registered deaths as an appendix to the annual report.  <\/p><p>e. The classification process for deaths related to COVID-19 differs between the HPSC and the CSO. Further detail is provided below on the process. <\/p><p><b>Further information:<\/b><\/p><p><b>Classification and publication of deaths by the HPSC:<\/b><\/p><p>A death reported by the by the Health Protection Surveillance (HPSC) as due to COVID-19 is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically compatible illness, in a possible, probable or confirmed COVID-19 case as per the case definition for COVID-19, available on the HPSC website www.hpsc.ie, unless there is a clear alternative cause of death that cannot be related to COVID-19 disease (e.g. trauma). There should be no period of complete recovery from COVID-19 between illness and death. A death due to COVID-19 may not be attributed to another disease (e.g. cancer) and should be counted independently of pre-existing conditions that are suspected of triggering a severe course of COVID-19.<\/p><p><b>HPSC Procedure for recording and checking COVID-19 deaths <\/b><\/p><p>All medical practitioners and coroners have been advised to report all deaths in confirmed, probable and possible COVID-19 cases, in any healthcare setting, to their local Department of Public Health and these are notified to the HPSC. <\/p><p>The case definitions for confirmed, probable and possible COVID-19 are available on the HPSC website. The outcome for cases that have already been notified is then updated to &lsquo;died&rsquo; on HPSC&rsquo;s Computerised Infectious Disease Reporting System (CIDR) and cases newly identified on death are notified. <\/p><p>The following deaths should be notified as COVID-19 deaths:<\/p><p>- Deaths in confirmed COVID-19 case: A death in a person with laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 infection, irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms (including post mortem). <\/p><p>- Deaths in probable COVID-19 case: A death in a person with probable COVID-19 as per the COVID-19 case definition for surveillance purposes <\/p><p>- Deaths in possible\/suspect COVID-19 case: All deaths in patients suspected of having COVID-19 i.e. patients with symptoms clinically compatible with COVID-19 illness. These suspect cases may or may not have been laboratory tested for COVID-19 prior to death. These possible COVID-19 deaths include patients with pending COVID-19 laboratory results.  This includes all unexplained deaths\/sudden deaths  in residential facilities  with a confirmed\/suspected COVID-19 cluster\/outbreak of illness unless the there is a clear alternative cause of death that cannot be related to COVID disease (e.g. trauma)<\/p><p>- Coroner&rsquo;s reports of deaths: All COVID-19 deaths reported as such from Coroners should be notified as COVID-19 deaths. The case classification should be assigned as per the COVID-19 case definition.<\/p><p>The HPSC also receives a daily list of deaths from all causes which were registered in Ireland in the previous day from the General Register Office (GRO). All registered deaths with COVID-19 reported in any of the four cause of death fields are reported as COVID-19 deaths. The causes of death on the GRO file are checked for &lsquo;COVID-19&rsquo; and cross-checked against the details for the cases of COVID-19 notified to HPSC. <\/p><p>Deaths in patients with COVID-19 due to causes such as accidents, trauma or other causes that could not be related to COVID-19 are recorded as not due to COVID-19. Deaths in COVID-19 cases occurring more than 30 days after the COVID-19 diagnosis are flagged and checked to ascertain if the death should be reported as due to COVID-19 or not due to COVID-19. If there is a period of complete recovery between the COVID-19 related illness and death, the deaths are recorded as not due to COVID-19.<\/p><p><b>HPSC publications on COVID-19 related deaths<\/b><\/p><p>Publication of COVID-19 Related deaths by the HPSC are made on a daily basis on the HPSC website, based on the data held in CIDR at that time. CIDR is a live dataset and data is subject to revision when new information is received.<\/p><p><b>Classification of COVID-19 related deaths by the CSO:<\/b><\/p><p>The CSO classify the information received from the General register Office on the Death Certificate to assign an Underlying Cause of Death (UCOD).  This is a complex process as coding rules that are adopted by the World Health Organisation (WHO) are applied to ensure parity between jurisdictions. <\/p><p><b>CSO Procedure for recording and checking COVID-19 deaths<\/b><\/p><p>It is a legal requirement that every death that takes place in the State must be recorded and registered and these records are then held in the General Register Office (GRO).  A death within the State can be registered with any Registrar, regardless of where it occurs. Deaths must be registered as soon as possible after the death and no later than three months from the date of death.<\/p><p>Following a death, a registered medical practitioner who attended the deceased will complete and sign Part 1 of a Death Notification Form (DNF), and this will include information on the cause of death.<\/p><p>This form is then given to the spouse\/partner or another relative of the deceased who are then the qualified informant for the death. If the deceased has no spouse\/partner or other relative, then the form will be provided to another qualified informant.<\/p><p>The qualified informant must then complete Part 2 of this DNF with additional details regarding the deceased person. Once completed, this DNF must then be given to a Registrar (within, as per the above, a maximum of three months) and the qualified informant then signs the register in the presence of the Registrar. You do not need to be the next-of-kin to undertake this requirement.<\/p><p>The Cause of Death is completed by the medical practitioner who attended the deceased and has the following information:<\/p><p>Part 1(a): Disease or condition directly leading to death, (this does not mean the mode of dying e.g. heart failure etc., it means the disease that caused death) due to (or as consequence of)<\/p><p>Part 1(b): Antecedent Causes (morbid conditions, if any, giving rise to the above cause stating the underlying condition last) due to (or as consequence of)<\/p><p>Part 1(c): Further Antecedent Causes<\/p><p>Part 2: Other Significant Conditions (contributing to the death but not related to the disease or condition causing it)<\/p><p>Any death that occurs in the State must be registered in the State, e.g. a death of a US resident holidaying in Ireland must be registered here.  An Irish national that dies abroad is not registered in the State.<\/p><p>The registration of a death may be delayed where the death has been referred to a Coroner for investigation or inquiry.  In such cases, the Coroner may issue a temporary certification to allow the death to be registered pending final determination of any investigation or inquiry.<\/p><p>CSO Mortality Coders in the Vital Statistics unit use specialised software (IRIS) and defined coding rules on the specified causes of death to assign an appropriate underlying cause of death. The hierarchy in which the causes are written on the death certificate impacts on the assignment of the UCOD. According to the WHO international guidelines, persons with COVID-19 may die due to other conditions such as myocardial infarction.<\/p><p><b>CSO publications on COVID-19 related deaths;<\/b><\/p><p>The &lsquo;Frontier Series&rsquo; that this data was published under is a new development from the CSO.

In September 2010, the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of secondary school.<\/p>  <p>  The NIAC recommended that the HPV vaccine should also be given to boys. On foot of the NIAC&rsquo;s recommendation, my Department asked the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a health technology assessment (HTA) to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of extending the current immunisation programme to include boys in the first year of secondary school.<\/p>  <p>  The HIQA completed the HTA in December 2018, recommending that the HPV immunisation programme be extended to include boys. A policy decision was made to extend the HPV immunisation programme to include boys, starting in September 2019, with the introduction of a 9-valent HPV vaccine. <\/p>  <p>  However, the HIQA report published in December 2018 did not recommend an HPV catch-up programme for older boys for the following reasons:<\/p>  <p>  - vaccinating boys in the first year of secondary school provides the best possible protection against HPV infection;<\/p>  <p>  - boys are already benefitting from the indirect herd protection provided by the girls' HPV vaccination programme which started in 2010.<\/p>  <p>  The ages at which vaccines are recommended in the immunisation schedule are chosen by the NIAC in order to give each child the best possible protection against vaccine preventable diseases. As the HPV vaccine is preventative it is intended to be administered, if possible, before a person becomes sexually active, that is, before a person is first exposed to HPV infection. <\/p>  <p>  Therefore, the gender-neutral HPV vaccination programme targets all girls and boys in first year of secondary school to provide maximum coverage. All vaccines administered through the School Immunisation Programme are provided free of charge. <\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to be guided by NIAC's recommendations on any emerging evidence on this issue in the future.<\/p>  <p>  Anyone not in 1st year of secondary school or age equivalent in special schools or home schooled during the 2020\/2021 school year who wishes to get the HPV vaccine, must go to their GP or sexual health clinic and pay privately for the vaccine and its administration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100087#WRFF06000","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cross-Border Health Initiatives","counter":2012,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100087#WRFF06100"},{"type":"question","counter":2013,"qnumday":736,"qnumall":"[40223\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100087#WRFF06200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the arrangements that have been made to ensure a seamless transition for those patients from the State availing of the health treatments under the cross-border directive in Northern Ireland from 1 January 2021; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1461","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2014,"content":"<p>Both the Irish and British Governments are committed to maintaining, in so far as possible, the current healthcare arrangements under the Common Travel Area (CTA).

It aims to allow society and businesses to be able to operate as normally as possible, while continuing to suppress the virus. The Plan is framed to account for periods during which there is a low incidence of the disease, with isolated clusters and low community transmission, through to situations where there is a high or rapidly increasing incidence, widespread community transmission and the pandemic is escalating rapidly in Ireland and globally. It recognises the need for society and business to be allowed to continue as normally as possible and is designed so that either national or county level restrictions can be applied. Each level outlines what is permitted for social or family gatherings, work and public transport, bars, hotels and restaurants, exercise activities and religious services. <\/p><p>As I am sure the Deputy can appreciate, COVID-19 spreads when individuals and groups come into close contact with one another, enabling the virus to move from one person to another. COVID-19 is infectious in a person with no symptoms, or for the period of time before they develop symptoms. For this reason, we are all asked to be extra careful when socialising and working with others. For now, we must act like we have the virus to protect those around us from infection.<\/p><p>The number of people allowed to gather in different scenarios in the Government Framework are based on a review of international practice and the judgment of public health experts.

These various limits in the Levels are all designed to reduce the number of households mixing with each other and cut down the virus&rsquo;s chances of spreading into more homes.<\/p><p>The Deputies should note that the numbers should not be considered a target - they are the maximum recommended number. It&rsquo;s always safer to meet less people, less often, for less time.

It was not possible to address this concern by extending the statute of limitations retrospectively; as advised by the Attorney General however, I have received Cabinet approval to develop a proposal to address any such claims, should they arise. I have written to the Group informing them of the government's commitment and that I am willing to discuss this with them.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of how the Tribunal will deal with the issue of recurrence, this issue has been examined in great detail by the government and the previous government and I have engaged in extensive consideration on this most sensitive issue. The Tribunal will make awards relating to recurrence in the same way as the High Court. That is, an additional amount can be made as part of the Tribunal settlement, to factor in a future chance of recurrence.  An advantage of the Tribunal over the courts is that, if a claimant does not wish to accept the amount awarded by the Tribunal, they can appeal to the High Court, an extra step that would not be available if the claimant had gone directly to the High Court. However, just like the Court system, a claimant cannot return with a second claim in respect of the same event years later.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the CervicalCheck Tribunal remains the most appropriate venue for CervicalCheck claims.

For this year, CSO figures show that nearly &euro;52 million worth of Irish beef has been exported to China. <\/p>  <p>  However, Irish beef shipments to China are suspended at present because of the confirmation of an isolated case of Atypical BSE in the national herd in May. Atypical BSE is believed to occur spontaneously in all cattle populations at a very low rate and has only been identified in older cattle. The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) does not consider the incidence of Atypical BSE in determining a country&rsquo;s BSE risk status. <\/p>  <p>  Hence, the discovery of this case has no implications for Ireland&rsquo;s 'controlled risk' status. This classification recognises that Ireland&rsquo;s BSE controls are effective and that, under OIE rules, Irish beef can be safely traded internationally. Ireland's strong reputation for food safety and our excellent animal health status underpinned the export of Irish beef to some 70 international markets last year, and continues to provide the necessary quality assurance for consumers worldwide.<\/p>  <p>  Under the terms of the bilateral protocol governing the export of beef to China, Ireland suspended beef shipments in late May, when the Atypical BSE case was confirmed, pending the outcome of deliberations by  the Chinese authorities. <\/p>  <p>  In early June, my Department provided a comprehensive epidemiological report for consideration by the Chinese authorities, demonstrating that there were no food safety or control systems implications arising from this isolated case.  <\/p>  <p>  Since then, my Department, in coordination with the Embassy of Ireland in Beijing, has engaged frequently with the relevant Chinese Ministry to try to resolve the issue.  I also raised the matter with China&rsquo;s Ambassador to Ireland when Minister of State Martin Heydon and I met him in September.   <\/p>  <p>  Recently, in response to a request from the Chinese authorities, my Department submitted a detailed update on our official BSE controls. I understand that this information is currently being assessed by the Chinese authorities. <\/p>  <p>  Ultimately, it must be recognised that the decision to resume trade remains a matter for the Chinese authorities.  However, given the growing importance of the market for Irish beef, I will continue to respectfully press the case for a resumption of the beef trade whenever there is appropriate opportunity to do so. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100089#WRHH07000","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Food Exports","counter":2163,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100089#WRHH07100"},{"type":"question","counter":2164,"qnumday":789,"qnumall":"[39713\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100089#WRHH07200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the status of the diversification of food exports taken in view of Brexit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1473","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":2165,"content":"<p>Developing increased third country market access and furthering trade opportunities abroad are both integral parts of my Department&rsquo;s response to the challenges posed by Brexit.   <\/p>  <p>  These goals are aligned with the strategic market development theme of Food Wise 2025, which outlines the significant potential for growth of our agri-food exports to new and existing markets, particularly in Asia, Africa, the Americas and the Gulf region.   <\/p>  <p>  Ireland's food and drink exports have greatly increased in recent years, with a greater proportion going to non-EU markets.

The centre will allow greyhounds to be socialised and for interested parties to consider the fostering or adoption of a greyhound in such a setting.<\/p><p>- The implementation of an extensive rehoming programme with over 1,300 greyhounds rehomed in 2020 to date with assistance from the Irish Retired Greyhound Trust, an entity established by RC&Eacute;. <\/p><p>- The introduction of a financial incentive for all domestic rehomings to encourage further rehoming in Ireland.<\/p><p>- The implementation of a Foster-to-Adopt Scheme.<\/p><p>- The operation of an Injuries at Track Financial Support Scheme whereby funding is available to address injuries sustained to racing greyhounds to ensure that they can be retired from greyhound racing.<\/p><p>- The establishing of a confidential phone line\/email through which any welfare issues can be reported on a 24\/7 basis. All reports are fully investigated by RC&Eacute; welfare staff.<\/p><p>- The full utilisation of the Exclusion Order process whereby a party can be excluded from being on a greyhound racing track.<\/p><p>- The updating of the Code of Practice for the Care and Welfare of the Greyhound which has been the subject of a public consultation process.  The Code is provided for under Section 6 of the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011.<\/p><p>- The continuing of an intense testing regime both at race events and through out of competition testing.  The urine sampling regime has been expanded in 2020 to also cover on a periodic basis blood sampling.  Work is also underway in terms of the necessary protocols to implement further enhancements of the testing regime through hair sampling.<\/p><p>- RC&Eacute; implemented a Covid-19 Care Payment Scheme during the period of suspension of racing activity from March to June 2020.  Some &euro;998,000 was paid under the scheme to ensure that the welfare needs of the racing greyhound were met during a period when racing activity was suspended<\/p><p>The introduction of a traceability system is viewed as essential as an integrity measure to provide for traceability in relation to key life events for the racing greyhound.

It is open to individual farmers to decide what enterprise they undertake and to what scale it should be undertaken, according to their  land type and with due consideration to the market terms for their products.  <\/p>  <p>  As only basic malt is produced in Ireland, drinks requiring specialised malts are often either reliant on imported malt or the export of Irish grain for processing and the re-importation for use in the drinks industry.   <\/p>  <p>  Independent reports estimate that 93% of all barley used in brewing and distilling is native barley, and that the balance is sourced mainly from the UK, with some imports also from the EU. No genetically modified barley exists in the UK or the European Union.<\/p>  <p>  My Department will this year fund a Teagasc facility which will allow for testing raw materials for malting and the production of small batches of specialised malts for the craft beer sector or for test batches for distilling companies.  The equipment will also provide a facility for brewing and distilling companies to try new varieties\/crops at a small commercial scale or to produce different styles of malt for different beers or spirits at a craft scale. It is expected that this facility will assist in identifying how home grown grain can be used to meet the requirements of the drinks industry. <\/p>  <p>  The technical files for each of the Geographical Indication (GI) for Irish Spirit Drinks (Irish Whiskey\/Uisce Beatha Eireannach\/Irish Whisky, Irish Cream and Irish Poteen\/Irish Poit&iacute;n) were confirmed by the European Commission in March 2019 as meeting the required conditions laid down in relevant EU Regulation. <\/p>  <p>  Whilst the Irish Whiskey Technical file contains specifics relating to the types and combinations of grains to be used for the creation of mashes for the production of each of the varieties of Irish Whiskey, it does not specify any requirements regarding the sourcing of the raw materials including grains utilised in the production of Irish Whiskey. <\/p>  <p>  Restricting the sourcing of inputs such as cereals\/grains in the production of Spirit Drinks cannot conflict with the EU Treaty rules on the freedom of movement of goods. However, notwithstanding the absence of such a requirement in the specification, the malting sector has undoubtedly delivered an added value outlet for Irish barley growers in recent years with the brewing and distilling sectors utilising approximately 250,000 tonnes of Irish barley annually of which 90,000 tonnes were purchased for the Irish whiskey industry. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100090#WRJJ04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Contracts","counter":2217,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100090#WRJJ05100"},{"type":"question","counter":2218,"qnumday":808,"qnumall":"[40204\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120100090#WRJJ05200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will provide a schedule of all consultancy firms, accountancy firms, legal firms, project management firms and IT firms his Department has engaged to carry out work its behalf in 2018, 2019 and to date in 2020; if he will summarise the work they were engaged to do and the full costs of the engagements; if disputes over costs ensued; if they were resolved with or without sanctions and or financial penalties and or withholding of funds; and if contracts are subject to legal challenge or mediation.","asker":"1489","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":2219,"content":"<p>Due to the volume of the information requested by the Deputy, it was not possible to provide a comprehensive response in the required timeframe.
