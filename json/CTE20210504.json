Biodiversity quality is either being maintained and enhanced, or biodiversity is suffering loss.  The only effective way to measure success or failure of biodiversity policy is against this trend.  Biodiversity is measured by how well ecosystems function and how efficiently they deliver the ecosystem services that we all benefit from, such as pollination, nutrient cycling, soil fertility, water purification, etc.  Measurement of ecosystem services is complex but generally the number and diversity of species in an area is a relatively good measure of environmental and ecosystem health.<\/p> <p>  Our understanding of biodiversity and biodiversity loss in this country is still quite poor.<\/p><p>Although there are well known losses of iconic species such as corncrake, Atlantic salmon and European eel, the bulk of biological diversity and ecosystem services are provided by lesser-known taxonomic groups about which we know very little.  For example, just under 32,000 different species have been documented for Ireland yet we estimate there are another 8,000 or so yet to be described.<\/p><p> The majority of our biodiversity and the functions it provides are delivered by smaller creatures - the invertebrates, lichens, algae and fungi which account for 86% of all species in Ireland.  Other than the Irish butterfly monitoring scheme which shows a 1.3% decline in butterfly populations since 2008 and the all-Ireland bumblebee monitoring scheme which shows a 4.8% decline each year in bumblebee populations since 2012, we know very little about how these less conspicuous elements of biodiversity and biodiversity function are performing.  This is an impediment to the prioritisation, implementation, tracking and reviewing of the effectiveness of biodiversity policy in Ireland.<\/p><p> We know quite a bit about the other more easily recognisable species.  Red lists are an internationally recognised method of doing conservation assessments of the risk of species going extinct.  It compares the known distribution of species from two different time periods.  Red lists have been completed for 12 broad taxonomic groups and have found that on average about 20%, or one in five, of all species assessed in Ireland are threatened with extinction.  For bees and fish the figure is an alarming 30% of the species.<\/p><p> Birds are assessed separately through the birds of conservation concern process, the results of which we only published recently.  It found that 63% of regularly occurring bird species in Ireland are of conservation concern, with the number of highest conservation concern increasing by 46% since 2013.  The species of most concern include the species with which we are familiar, such as corncrake, curlew, lapwing and barn owl, and now includes widespread species like meadow pipit, snipe and kestrel.<\/p><p> From the monitoring schemes that are in place, we know that Ireland is not immune from the well-documented global biodiversity crisis.  Biodiversity loss is happening right here in Ireland, too, and is happening right now.  For clarity, whereas a small number of species are increasing in abundance and some new species are arriving to Ireland, the overall trend is towards increasing biodiversity loss and associated reduction in the quality of ecosystem services.  This is occurring countrywide.<\/p><p> There is one other big caveat to the state of knowledge on biodiversity in Ireland that must be acknowledged.  There are no long-term monitoring schemes that extend back more than about 20 years, so none of the big declines in biodiversity loss that Ireland experience during the 1970s and 1980s has been captured.  Government policy must avoid the pitfall of falling into the shifting baseline syndrome.<\/p><p> Finally, there must be a twin-track approach to addressing biodiversity loss.  We need to make space for biodiversity in all parts of the countryside.  I am not separating farm land from other aspects.  We must make sure that the approach is countrywide.  Everyone taking voluntary actions, big and small, for biodiversity can have a huge, positive cumulative impact.  This is likely to create favourable conditions to tackle the declines of the common and widespread species.  However, against that, if we want to tackle decline in species that require more specialised conditions, it will require a much vigorous and strategic approach as it is likely to require landscape-scale or catchment-scale interventions.  I must note that this has already begun for species such as freshwater pearl mussel, hen harrier and curlew, but it has to be cranked up a lot and a great deal more needs to be done.  We must become much more ambitious in our objectives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021050400002#A00900","nonspeaker":"Dr. Liam Lysaght","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620082800,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Lysaght for his statement.

Biodiversity, which is the variety of life, is fundamental to humanity.  Without a variety of different creatures in soils, hedgerows, woodlands, bogs and heaths, we would not be able to produce the food, timber and other raw materials that we produce.  Without a variety of different creatures and habitats in the landscape, we would not have protection against natural hazards, such as sea-surges, floods and droughts.  Without a rich and diverse landscape, our culture and recreational opportunities would be diminished.  With the loss of that biodiversity, I cannot over-state the problems that will face human societies.<\/p> <p>  Currently, the Covid-19 pandemic has been caused by a disease that spread from other animals to humans.  Our destruction of biodiversity, deforestation and simplification of habitat, as well as the trade and handling of animals by people, has brought humans and wild animals into closer contact, facilitating this disease transfer.  In fact, 75% of all new diseases in humans in the past ten years have come from animals, and more will come in the future.<\/p> <p>  However, with restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems, solutions to global challenges are all around us.  In terms of climate change, biodiversity is key to both mitigation and adaptation strategies.  First, in respect of climate change mitigation, slowing climate change, biodiversity can help slow carbon release.  In Ireland, we hold a trump card - healthy peatlands are fantastic carbon sinks.  Peatlands cover only around 3% of the earth's land surface, but store about double the amount of carbon in all forests which cover ten times that area.  Peatlands retain carbon and prevent it from being lost to the atmosphere, as well as acting like giant sponges, holding rainwater and releasing it slowly, preventing flooding.  They also provide habitats for plants and animals, like birds, that need these wild open spaces.  In respect of climate change adaptation, urban trees and other green spaces can help towns and cities cope with higher summer temperatures, cooling them down; coastal wetlands can protect against storm surges; wooded floodlands and peatlands attenuate flood water; and patches of scrub hold soil together and prevent erosion and soil loss.<\/p> <p>  By restoring biodiversity and healthy ecosystems, nature can provide solutions to the climate crisis.  We need diversity.  Diversity in ecosystems gives them resilience.  If there are more species, then an ecosystem is more adaptable in the face of change and can bounce back from severe events more effectively.  Studies have shown that with more species in grasslands, they are more resistant to a broad range of climate events, including wet or dry, moderate or extreme and brief or prolonged events.  Diversity is going to be very important in adapting to a climate-changed future, for example, in our agricultural systems.<\/p> <p>  However, we do need to restore ecosystems back to health and ensure that biodiversity is there.  Most of our ecosystems are not in good health.  Peatlands have been converted to grassland, planted with forestry and harvested for fuel, and most of them are emitting carbon rather than storing it.  Intensive agriculture and chemical inputs from farmland are polluting soils and waterways.  Well-intentioned, but wrongly sited, installations to address greenhouse gas emissions can cause instability to entire habitats.<\/p> <p>  Restoration of biodiversity is urgent, but there has never been a better time.  It is the UN decade on ecosystem restoration, we will have legally binding targets as part of the EU biodiversity strategy to 2030 and the public has got back in touch with nature during lockdown.  This is good, because to restore ecosystems back to health, we need action.  We actively have to work with nature to restore biodiversity and create these nature-based solutions.  We have to work with local communities and empower them to restore their own patches.  We need to ditch the perverse policies and make people proud of being stewards of nature.  Let us not penalise farmers for having uncultivatable land and pay them for actions that have no positive effect.  We must work with them and pay them to restore biodiversity on all parts of their farms.  We must look to the success of initiatives like the all-Ireland pollinator plan, which has brought together local communities, local authorities, schools and businesses.  Working together for pollinators has brought additional benefits for other wildlife.  It has got commercial companies investing in nature and has brought people together with a common purpose.<\/p> <p>  We have immediate access to nature-based solutions.  The restoration of biodiversity and healthy ecosystems is a solution to the climate crisis, and fundamental to all of our well-being.  Nature is not a luxury; it is a necessity.  Investing in nature now will not just affect the next five to ten years, but the next 100 to 200 years.  It does not cost the earth, but it gives us and the earth a chance. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021050400002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Jane Stout"},{"type":"speech","time":1620082800,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank the professor for her statement.

It is nearly two years since the D&aacute;il declared a climate and biodiversity emergency and my message to the committee today is that the collapse of our biodiversity is real, that it is happening and that it matters.  While many of us looked on in horror at the destruction of the Amazon rainforest in 2019, we can sometimes forget that Ireland is perhaps the most deforested country in the world.  Having once been 80% deciduous oak woodland, our native forests have been reduced to sorry fragments that extend to no more than 2% of our land area.  What was not forest was wetlands and bogs but these too have been remorselessly exploited so that today fewer than 1% of the midlands' bogs are still growing while across the uplands and the west of Ireland, fewer than one third of these peatlands remain what is termed \"suitable for conservation\".  Even these areas have been largely denuded of their wildlife due to fires and overgrazing.<\/p> <p>  Our farmland has been utterly transformed in recent decades such that most fields are practically devoid of life while even the ancient system of hedgerows is vanishing due to neglect and outright destruction.  Last month, BirdWatch Ireland and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds in Northern Ireland reported that an incredible two thirds of all our bird species are heading toward extinction.  This is a frightening figure.  Our waterways are mostly polluted by farm run-off and under-treated human sewage.  In fact, we continue to pour completely untreated sewage into our surroundings from 35 towns and villages in Ireland.  At sea, Ireland has a lamentable reputation for overfishing marine life while we continue to lose biodiversity in the mere 2% of our seas that currently fall within protected areas.  It is a dire state of affairs when the majority of the fishing boats around Ireland scarcely even catch fish any more and must make do with crabs and lobsters due to the collapse of the ocean ecosystem.  Healthy ecosystems are not just nice to have, they are central to the production of food, the availability of clean water, the stability of our climate as well as our mental and physical health.  Healthy, functioning ecosystems are essential to our very survival yet we have destroyed them.  We should be doing better.<\/p> <p>  Successive Governments have signed up to a raft of legislation to protect biodiversity and water quality yet a recent report from the National Biodiversity Forum lambasted the State as \"The biggest transgressor of environmental law\".  As legislators, member play a key role in addressing this crisis.  The good news is that the solutions are to hand, namely, farming in a way that is close to nature, ending overfishing and creating well-protected marine protected areas, investing in wastewater infrastructure, reintroducing species we have driven to extinction and rewilding our rivers and uplands so forests and peatlands are restored.  We must remove perverse subsidies which promote the destruction of nature and reform laws that are no longer fit for addressing the challenges we face.  For instance, the Arterial Drainage Act 1945, which results in so much damage to our river systems, must be looked at.  We need a new biodiversity Act that will put our biodiversity action plan on a legal footing.  Nature restoration is climate action.  Healthy bogs, farmland and oceans all store and sequester carbon.  It is also people action as it creates employment, diversifies economic opportunity strengthening communities and reducing inequalities.<\/p> <p>  The challenge before us is daunting.  Quite frankly, our children face a frightening future.  As legislators right now, members are making key decisions that will shape that future.  I urge them to act with the level of urgency this crisis requires.  We have no excuses.  I firmly believe restoring nature to our island could be the most wonderful project for bringing our communities together.  We are, after all, a part of nature but the time for action is now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021050400002#C00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. P&aacute;draic Fogarty"},{"type":"speech","time":1620082800,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Fogarty.

For some reason, I thought we had five minutes.  I will get straight into the questions as opposed to making the big, broad statement I had intended.  I will just say that I am delighted we are having this session specifically focused on biodiversity.  This session needed to happen, regardless of which committee dealt with it, because of the dire state of biodiversity right across the world but specifically here in Europe.  I am delighted, therefore, that we are having this session and thank the speakers for coming before us.  Maybe there will be a second round where I can comment further on the state of biodiversity in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  I want to bring things back to where we are at the moment.  We were putting together our climate action plan during the summer.  Much of what we were hoping to focus on in these sessions, besides learning about biodiversity and the mainly negative impact we are having on it, was how, in our climate action plan we can both address and improve biodiversity but also link that into our goal of reducing emissions by 51% by 2030, or the overall goal of being carbon-neutral by 2050.  To that end, I might direct this question to Dr. Stout.  Where rewilding projects are concerned, are there any international examples we can look to, be they in Europe or the UK, where rewilding has successfully happened and what form it has taken?  She mentioned, for example, how peatland restoration can increase carbon capture but I have also read papers about salt marshes and wetlands.  Dr. Stout mentioned how they will protect against coastal surges.  However, I have read papers which state that, per hectare, there is 40% more carbon captured in wetlands and salt marshes than there is in the same area of Amazon rainforest, for example.  Are there examples like that we can look to so when we are putting together our climate action plan they can be included?  Thus, they would not just be increasing biodiversity and having lavish ecosystems but also helping to capture carbon.  She also mentioned farmers being penalised for having habitat on their farms.  Does she have any faith in the upcoming Farm to Fork strategy and the intention, by the beginning of 2023, to have a proper, funded agri-environment scheme that no longer penalises farmers for having habitats on their land but incentivises them to have it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021050400002#C00300","speaker":"1545"},{"type":"speech","time":1620082800,"counter":20,"content":"<p>That is two and a half minutes.

In terms of improving biodiversity and carbon capture, the point I make is that there must be a diversity of habitats.  We cannot think about just restoring peatlands, establishing woodlands or protecting wetlands - it is all of those different habitat systems which must be restored, both for biodiversity and carbon benefits.  It is something I can look into and come back to the Deputy on.<\/p> <p>  On the Farm to Fork strategy and the 2023 results-based agri-environment schemes, I would like to have faith in them.

It has been sent from one Department to another and has come under the remit of various Ministers.  It has therefore been subject to the varying levels of interest of those Ministers.  A review of the NPWS is under way at the moment.  It should be made an independent agency so that it can build itself up again, communicate the science, tell Departments what needs to be done in Government plans and programmes and perform an educational function, all in the knowledge that its structure is not going to be shifted, moved or undermined after the next election cycle.

This is something we are developing through the Natural Capital Ireland forum.  This allows all of the biodiversity and ecosystem functions and the benefits derived from those ecosystems to be identified and recognised.  That includes biodiversity itself as a benefit but also the co-benefits with regard to production, the provision of food and water, and the regulation of climate, pollination and pest control.  These benefits accrue to society and to landowners.  This system of accounting for biodiversity is already established and can be used to look for those trade-offs.  Through the system, you can look at the knock-on impacts of changing the management of a particular area on these regulating services, including the regulation of climate, on the production of food and on biodiversity itself.  There is a system.  It is the UN system for environmental economic accounting and ecosystem accounting.

This restoration may relate to peatland restoration, protecting the ocean, regenerating farm soils or native forests.  Where the trade-offs come in most starkly is in the area of renewable energy.  We have seen a number of examples in Ireland, even in recent times, of renewable energy infrastructure - wind farms - having been put in the wrong place.  This has resulted in, for example, the devastation of peatland habitats in Donegal.  We are, unfortunately, now looking at something similar coming down the line.  Renewable energy projects are going to be sited in marine environments without marine protected areas having been identified.  The co-benefits are very real and very substantial but these projects do require careful planning.

I would like to see the Joint Committee on Agriculture and the Marine having an interest in this area also as it is of great importance.<\/p> <p>  On the climate perspective, our witnesses mentioned the co-benefits of investing in biodiversity.  I wonder also about the impacts of climate change on biodiversity.  Usually we look at it the other way around where we say that if we invest in a different type of land-use in respect of biodiversity that will have an impact on climate.  I would like to hear our witnesses views on the impact of climate on biodiversity.<\/p> <p>  One of the things that has been quite stressful for farmers is the idea that we have the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill 2021 going through the D&aacute;il and Seanad which would see reductions of 51% in emissions by 2030 and being climate neutral by 2050.  If other sectors play their part and do more, then there would not be as much pressure on agriculture.  It is important to say that there is still that pressure there and that investing in biodiversity can be the thing that very much eases the pressure on farmers.  Can our witnesses speak a little bit more about the effects of agriculture, particularly on soil health, which has an impact on biodiversity?<\/p> <p>  Finally, on local action on biodiversity, Dr. Lysaght spoke about voluntary actions and systemic support.  One of the things I see is a lack of support within councils for biodiversity.

I will deal with two of those questions that I may be able to answer.  One is to do with the climate impacts on diversity.  Climate change is very much pulling the rug from under ecosystems.  We already have all of these pressures from habitat loss to over-exploitation, invasive species and pollution.  We then have climate on top of that.  We do not know the effect that will have on our peatlands.  We know that prolonged droughts can turn peatlands from carbon sinks to carbon emitters.  Perhaps this is most significantly felt in the ocean, where climate change is acidifying, warming and contributing to the pollution of it where it is running out of oxygen.  These are very significant challenges for ecosystems in respect of climate change.<\/p> <p>  On farming and soil, the biodiversity of our soil is something that is widely unrecognised and under-studied.  We do not know a great deal about it.  We know that worms, for instance, are essential to the health of soil in the recycling of nutrients.  A study from England in recent years showed that nearly half of the fields in England did not even have worms, or had very few of them.  This aspect of soil is very much under-studied.  Our view of fertility on farm soils has heretofore focused on the chemistry of the soil and not on its biology.  There are farmers in Ireland who are practising what is called regenerative farming, which is about bringing the life back to the soil and enhancing the natural fertility of it.  That is producing enormous benefits for farmers as well as drawing carbon out of the air and storing it in the soil.  There are many co-benefits to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021050400002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. P&aacute;draic Fogarty"},{"type":"speech","time":1620082800,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I call Dr. Lysaght.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021050400002#E00500","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620082800,"counter":37,"content":"<p>I thank Senator O&rsquo;Reilly.

I see this as being one of the potentially major win-win situations, if we can change the narrative a little bit around biodiversity and farming.  Sadly, nature conservation policy in Ireland since the 1990s has been predicated in a negative way in terms of restrictions and regulations.  There are opportunities to communicate better at the landscape level and to look at those aspects of farming which may be described as low hanging fruit.  In some of the areas where one has very wet grasslands, for example, great efforts have been made to keep those in a more improved condition through the use of perennial ryegrass.  Great efforts, resources and inputs have been invested into farming marginal agricultural landscapes.  If we could even start by trying to retain these, cut back on productivity and inputs at this level, that is an area in which we could have a quick win that could help to integrate the biodiversity benefits without impacting too much on farm productivity and it could also help in respect of greenhouse gas emissions.  If we could change the narrative, there are big wins to be gained around the farming and biodiversity side.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021050400002#E00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Liam Lysaght"},{"type":"speech","time":1620082800,"counter":38,"content":"<p>Can I have a response on the biodiversity officers suggestion, perhaps from Professor Stout?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021050400002#E00700","speaker":"1693"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620082800,"counter":39,"content":"<p>I agree with the Senator.

On protected areas, since nature conservation was invented - more or less - in the 1970s, nature reserves and protected areas have been one of the principal tools used.  They identify important areas and basically put a ring around them.  Unfortunately, that has not worked in Ireland.  There are some success stories but the model we have used to identify protected areas and manage them simply has not produced results.  In some instances biodiversity is worse inside the reserves than outside them.  At the moment about 13% of the land area in Ireland and a little over 2% of the sea is designated.  The European Union wants to designate 30% of land and sea by the end of this decade.  There is a huge challenge ahead and we are not even getting what we had already committed to right.  We have to recognise the mistakes that have been made around nature conservation up to now.  Ireland in particular should sign up to protecting 30% of our land by 2030 and strictly protecting 10% of it, which is another goal, but we have to do it differently.  We have to use public land to achieve many of these aims.  We have to incentivise local communities to create their own nature reserves.  We have to recognise that a lot of farmers feel dispossessed by the current system and we have to try to rebuild trust with those farming communities.

Of course there have to be strong regulations enforcing them and the appropriate assessments and environmental impact statements, EISs, are necessary but they set the tone and they take the involvement of local people away from conservation.  Professor Stout mentioned the all-Ireland pollinator plan, which has been transformative in how this has been approached.  It presented evidence-based solutions that we know are important and we know work.

The witnesses have all been very active in this area so I thank them and acknowledge that.<\/p> <p>  My first question is primarily for Dr. Lysaght.  He spoke about the red lists of species that are at risk of extinction.  Yet when a species is identified and included on a red list, we do not seem to have any emergency measures that are set in train to actually address that crisis for that particular species, which I find very concerning.  I am doing some work on the basking shark at the moment and that is not even protected under Irish legislation, even though it is an endangered species.  What should happen when a species is included on these red lists?  What actions should the State take to make sure there is a concerted emergency effort to deal with that crisis?<\/p> <p>  My next question is for Professor Stout and Mr. Fogarty and relates to peatlands.  We have identified nature-based and climate benefits to restoring our peatlands and there is some work happening in the midlands in that regard.  It was interesting to see reports over the weekend that a species of bird could be about to breed on these sites for the first time in 300 years.  That is exciting because it shows what can potentially be achieved in these areas if we put some work into them and just give them the space to return to their natural state.  Would now be a good time to look at creating a national park in that area, with the appropriate model?  Mr. Fogarty said the model we use has not produced biodiversity benefits but that is because biodiversity has not been specified as the ultimate objective.  Is there potential for a national park in the midlands with biodiversity at its heart, and is now a good time to start that off?  When it comes to the damage and impact we can have on biodiversity, a lot of the time when a species or habitat is destroyed or so negatively impacted that its biodiversity potential is ruined, we have this mindset that it has happened and there is nothing we can do, or that it is unfortunate it has happened but we have to move on.  Should we be looking at something along the lines of an ecocide law that would hold Governments to account?  For many years we have had targets and legislation that we have failed to meet and our biodiversity is in a worse state now than it ever has been.<\/p><p>While we need the incentives and the carrot approach, do we need major legislative oversight as well?

I thank Deputy Whitmore for those questions.  On the national parks, the idea of a national park for the Shannon region has been around for some time.  It was proposed for the cut-away bogs.  The problem with national parks, however, as I am sure the Deputy is aware, is that we do not have national parks' legislation.  Apart from being an internationally recognised label, there is little substance behind it.  We saw how a fire devastated Killarney National Park last week a.  Fires regularly devastate the Wicklow Mountains National Park.  People think that the idea behind national parks is to prioritise nature and conservation, but that is not what we see on the ground.  A national park is a good tool for engaging local people, if the structures are right.  Really, however, it is not a great way of restoring biodiversity.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the ecocide law, this is an interesting development.  Several countries are now giving legal rights to nature.  Rivers, for instance, may have the same power of prosecution as corporations in a court of law.  The idea of ecocide is overdue, although I think much of the damage has already been done.  Nevertheless, it would set down a marker that these crimes are simply unacceptable.  In Ireland, I would particularly love to see an amendment to our Constitution to recognise the right of nature to exist and also the right we have as people to a healthy natural environment.

I have three questions, and the first is for Dr. Lysaght and it relates to the National Biodiversity Data Centre.  Deputy Christopher O'Sullivan asked about the resources and Dr. Lysaght said it is important that the centre is properly resourced.  I would like to tease out that point in the context of the legislative footing the centre is on, and whether it should be a fully functioning centre as opposed to a service level agreement.  I raise this issue as well out of respect for the vital work being done by the National Biodiversity Data Centre and in the context of maintaining the existing expertise by moving from short-term contracts to a situation of having multi-annual funding to enable the centre to know where it is going and be properly resourced in future.<\/p> <p>  Turning to Mr. Fogarty to tease out the question of the Arterial Drainage Act 1945, we know that nature-based solutions are very effective at addressing climate change, but particularly flooding.  I mean that type of flooding referred to more as \"nuisance floods\", namely, the smaller events rather than the bigger ones.  I ask Mr. Fogarty to expand on why he thinks the Arterial Drainage Act 1945 needs reform.  I refer to aspects such as the Act hampering us in using nature-based solutions in addressing flooding, as well the impact on biodiversity.  <\/p> <p>  My final question arises from the horrific fire in Killarney National Park.  Mr. Fogarty remarked that the canopy of the old native woodlands, which are not only important as carbon sinks but also for biodiversity, seemed to offer some sort of protection.  What needs to happen in the national parks, especially regarding invasive weeds, such as rhododendron?  Funding was announced to address that aspect.  Is there going to be a science-based approach to rhododendron clearance that will enable us to protect those native woodlands and help them regenerate?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021050400002#G01100","speaker":"1635"},{"type":"speech","time":1620082800,"counter":66,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Boylan.

The Arterial Drainage Act 1945 was put in place in order to reclaim farmland from river floodplains and that function of the Act has not changed since.  Some 11,500 km of rivers are routinely altered and have their trees and vegetation removed, regardless of whether there is any need for that.  This is an enormous undertaking by the Office of Public Works, OPW, at huge public expense for no good reason any more, other than to maintain that farmland.  This activity is exacerbating flooding problems downstream in towns and villages and impeding the ability of the landscape to adapt to extreme weather events.  That is one of the main problems with the Arterial Drainage Act 1945.<\/p> <p>  The other problem, as the Senator pointed out, is that the Act does not recognise the importance of nature-based solutions to flooding.  Much of what we have done to the land in the past 50 years has served to exacerbate flooding.  I refer to compacting soils, draining land and bogs and making sure that water travels as fast as possible from any given location.  That contributes to flooding throughout entire catchment areas.  The corollary of that, of course, is that blocking drains and re-establishing native woodlands and regenerative farming systems would increase the ability of the land to absorb water and take the peaks and troughs out of flooding.  That aspect is also not recognised in the Arterial Drainage Act 1945.  Those are the two main issues I see in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Turning to Killarney National Park, it was devastating to see the damage done.  Fires occur in the park nearly every year, but this was a particularly large one.  Hundreds of fires occur all over our country during the bird nesting season and that results in enormous damage.  As the Senator pointed out, however, the footage from Killarney National Park showed that where we have our native woodland intact, it is not flammable.  It did not burn, so this is telling us that the land wants to be a native woodland and we must restore our native woodlands across our hillsides.  That is possible, but it will require a lot of work.  We have rhododendrons, as the Senator mentioned, and we also have a possible overpopulation of deer that may prevent the regeneration of the oak woodlands.<\/p><p>These are certainly things we can do if we have the right vision in place and the right incentives for landowners.  Recreating beautiful oak forests could be an amazing national project.  Indeed, it could be an all-island project that we could all get behind.  It would be an amazing legacy to leave for the next generation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021050400002#G01500","nonspeaker":"Mr. P&aacute;draic Fogarty","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620082800,"counter":71,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Fogarty.

We need to pay attention to the latest science and research that is showing what not to do.  Coming back to the issue of rhododendron and Killarney national park, Ireland is not a place where wildfires are natural.  We do not have fire-adapted ecosystems but rhododendron survives fire.  We need an approach that tackles the rhododendron problem, allows the native woodlands to regenerate and could also protect against fire in the future.

I thank our guests.  I wish to refine one or two points.  Professor Stout is absolutely right regarding the way in which some of the schemes have penalised farmers for keeping land that was ultimately a benefit to the environment, biodiversity and nature generally.  If a farmer allows certain scrubland to remain in that state, the land is not considered to be arable and, therefore, unfortunately falls outside the schemes.  I and many of my Oireachtas colleagues spend time arguing with Departments and trying to ensure that farmers get their payment.  Sadly, the rules and conditions have been so rigidly applied or were so rigidly designed in the first instance that it is about productivity.  If there is anything to be learned from this discussion, it is that it should be clearly recognisable that farmers are providing a benefit by leaving lands to be less arable and more in concert with nature.  At this stage, many of them do not even want to be paid for it; they just want to avoid being penalised for what they are doing.  I would argue, as would other members, I am sure, that far from seeing a cut in their payment for doing what is right by nature, they should be receiving a top-up for it.  That is something on which the committee can work with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in terms of the design of schemes.<\/p> <p>  I ask Dr. Lysaght or Mr. Fogarty to comment more broadly on what happened in Killarney national park.  It is a huge wake-up call for all present and maybe for society generally.  People who previously did not talk about biodiversity or its loss have seen vast swathes of nature being destroyed in one fell swoop and they are discussing it.  Can the witnesses give some indication of the scale of the loss, based on what they know to date of what has happened, and its negative impact on the environment?  Perhaps we can build on what happened there by trying to convince people who say they are not climate change deniers but have been rather silent on this particular situation in the past couple of weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021050400002#H00500","speaker":"1655"},{"type":"speech","time":1620082800,"counter":75,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.

It is a fantastic asset and on one level the local community and tourism is dependent on it, but the resources and proper effective management that the area deserves have not been put into the woodlands.  A kind of dual approach has been taken to it.  We like to have the picture postcard scene with the associated tourism benefits, but the harsh reality is that we actually have to invest it in as an asset and it needs to be managed properly.

In the ten or more years I have been working in this area, we have been dealing with these fires every year.  There is also the issue of erosion caused by too many farm animals being on the hills.  There are conifer plantations that were planted in the 1950s and 1960s and are still there.  Basically, from a policy point of view, the uplands have been completely abandoned.<\/p> <p>  From an ecological point of view, these ecosystems are in collapse.  Many of the birds that lived on and were synonymous with the uplands are literally hanging on by their toenails, if they still exist.  Some bird species are literally down to one or two populations whereas 30 or 40 years ago they were everywhere.  The uplands as a whole have been ignored and neglected.  The flip side is that although we should value the uplands for their heritage and nature, they are also of benefit in terms of carbon storage and much of our water comes from them, so they do all these things for us.  However, as Dr. Lysaght said, they have not been invested in but, rather, pretty much ignored.  I firmly believe the opportunity is still there but we need a radical rethink about what we want from these landscapes.

Dr. Lysaght said that we have to be much more ambitious around planting and rewilding and so forth.

I am thinking about expensive vegan handbags.  We think they are good but they actually take decades to break down.<\/p><p> Mr. Fogarty's presentation really illustrates a watershed.  We need a national campaign on this matter.  I have a question for him regarding something which goes to the heart of the issue of how we have been, and are, living.  It relates to the difference between the individualism of the past and present and the community-based way we in which will need to live in the future.  Big finance and big business have turned us into loyal customers and consumers as opposed to citizens.  To tackle this issue, we will need a shift.  Citizenship is critical in addressing climate emissions and the biodiversity issue.  I am interested in Mr. Fogarty's views as to how that might be done.

She raised the issue of holistic thinking.  One of the big problems we face at the moment is that Government policy in one area is directly at odds with laws and biodiversity policies in other areas.  For instance, there is currently a draft of an agrifood strategy that will be in place until 2030.  This foresees more growth, more productivity and getting more out of the land when we know that nature is already suffering as a result of our current levels of productivity.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned communities.  I get emails and phone calls from people around the country nearly every day.  I frequently get calls from people who are next to tears because their local beauty spot or nature area is being destroyed or is under threat from some quarter or other.

There is a great example in Abbeyleix in County Laois where a local community has basically taken over the conservation of the local bog.  In contrast with many of our bogs, since this community went in, the bog has been growing.  It is now healthier than it was 20 years ago.  The group is removing invasive species.  There is an enormous sense of ownership of that project among the local community.  We know we can do this - the template is there - but we need to get Government on side.

We have not seen much follow through on that in terms of identifying what are the actual sources of pollution within any given catchment, at any one time.<\/p> <p>  On a biodiversity Act, I would love to see an equivalent to the climate Act that we are about to see this year.  We have produced biodiversity action plans since the Rio Earth Summit nearly 30 years ago.  We are about to head into our fourth biodiversity action plan and action plans numbers 1, 2 and 3 never really got off the ground so we must look at how we can do things differently.  I think that a biodiversity Act would bring up to date an awful lot of our national wildlife legislation, which is showing its age, as well as bring together the European obligations that we have made, and creating lines of responsibility.  At the moment, we do not seem to have anybody in particular responsible for implementing the measures that we see in the biodiversity action plan.  As I have stated, an awful lot of the time headline Government policy, whether it is on food, in particular, oceans and farmland, are completely at odds with the targets in the biodiversity plan so putting it on a legal footing would be a very significant development. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021050400002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. P&aacute;draic Fogarty"},{"type":"speech","time":1620082800,"counter":98,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  A lot of what I was going to raise has been raised.  It is interesting to hear the level of agreement on the analysis, the diagnosis, and the range of perverse incentives and contradictions within schemes.  I share the opinion of many of the contributors.  In my experience of communities, and working with communities, they are far ahead of the Government and certainly policy when it comes to these issues.  If anything, local government and policy can be an impediment to what communities want to deliver and achieve in terms of the type of environment they want to live in whether that is urban or rural.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Lysaght, in his opening statement, commented on roadside policy.

The roads network in Ireland is enormous.  In particular, the motorway network has huge margins that have the potential to be good for biodiversity.  Already, through the all-Ireland pollinator plan, there are guidelines for transport corridors in terms of how to manage them more effectively and some local authorities are doing really good work in this regard.  Again, it would be a case of high-level commitment by Transport Infrastructure Ireland and the local authorities to strategically consider the network and say these are aspects, features and elements that are good for biodiversity, and to manage those positively.  Although there are issues, particularly for the smaller roads network where hedgerows must be cut for road safety, there are other areas that would be beneficial for biodiversity.  It is really about getting high level buy-in from these organisations to do this work.  The tools are there and it is just a matter of commitment.<\/p> <p>  On the final point, we obviously have two Ministers who are responsible for heritage and biodiversity.  Within the public sector what is missing is a figurehead behind whom we could all rally.  As I have mentioned before, he or she could be an ambassador maybe from biodiversity whose job would be to raise the profile, identify what is possible and link together the different policies to make sure that they are compatible, and consistent, with one another.

The last year, with people being confined to their local areas and appreciating nature more, has shown that there is enthusiasm for doing positive things for nature.  My experience on the all-Ireland pollinator plan has been that people are keen but that we need to keep the messaging positive.  As we mentioned earlier, there has been a lot of negative messaging around nature and seeing nature as an impediment.  We need to think about nature as a solution, consider the win-win benefits, change the narrative and work together.  There is huge opportunity for lots of groups, individuals, organisations, businesses and the Government to work together towards a common goal, which is something that can be very positive.<\/p> <p>  Finally, in terms of mobilising goodwill, we need to provide tools and guidelines based in science and evidence for what people can actually do to help.  Having something like the Citizens' Assembly can raise an awful lot of ideas and generate a lot of inspiration.

The Deputy asked how can we maximise citizen engagement.  One really glaring thing that we could do is recognise that the State is the biggest landowner in the country.<\/p><p>Between them, Coillte and Bord na M&oacute;na could own over 10% of the country.  There is a lot of land out there that really needs to be rewilded and given over for nature for very practical carbon and biodiversity benefits.  Communities should be allowed to basically become custodians of these areas, which they know better than anybody.  They can come up with management plans and do the monitoring, and the State can facilitate that.  That can also work in marine protected areas.<\/p><p> Another area in which work is already up and running relates to biodiversity action plans.  Many local authorities have biodiversity plans.  However, we have seen that these plans are frequently not funded or particularly prioritised within the wider work of the local council, so many of the actions do not get very far.  People are willing to engage and know what needs to be done.  If dedicated funding streams for biodiversity action plans were to be created, much more than what we have at the moment, local authorities would spend that money wisely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021050400002#K00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. P&aacute;draic Fogarty","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620082800,"counter":103,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Fogarty.  We have about 20 minutes left.  Before we go into a second round, I will ask some questions.<\/p> <p>  Most of the witnesses alluded to the challenge in agriculture.  It has been said that it is perhaps the biggest challenge to biodiversity on land that we have at the moment.  Deputy O'Sullivan and Senator Dooley mentioned that many farmers want to be custodians and guardians of the land and want to do things differently.  In that respect, can the witnesses recommend concrete measures that could be applied to the agriculture sector and would improve land biodiversity?<\/p> <p>  The programme for Government includes a commitment to establish a citizens' assembly on biodiversity and its terms of reference should be ready by the end of the year.  Do the witnesses have suggestions for what should be included in those terms of reference?  <\/p> <p>  Dr. Lysaght mentioned that a biodiversity champion is needed in the public sector.  I do not know who that might be but I have an idea, partly because as a committee, we have struggled a little with our own remit.  Biodiversity falls partly within our remit, which also includes climate action, but it is also an area that fall between many stools.  It struck me that perhaps we should have a joint Oireachtas committee on biodiversity, while also acknowledging that we do not necessarily want biodiversity to be siloed.  Obviously, it has to be interwoven with the work of all committees.  I would be interested in hearing the thoughts of the witnesses on that point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021050400002#L00200","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620082800,"counter":104,"content":"<p>The Chairman mentioned the challenges in agriculture.  How it is done is a different question, but what needs to be done is that each farmer should identify what resources or aspects of his or her farm and farming practice are beneficial to biodiversity.  Many farmers do not have the training on biodiversity to be able to do that.  As an absolute minimum, we should look at current resources and what good practices are taking place, and ensure we retain them.  They should not get worse.  That should be an absolute requirement.<\/p> <p>  We must look at what policies and incentives can be put in place to achieve that and make it happen.  A good case in point, to which I keep coming back, and one that is symptomatic of how poorly we manage our biodiversity is hedgerows across the countryside.  They are often managed as poorly as they can be in respect of biodiversity.  They are the types of things in respect of which, if we just eased back with a small bit of management and did something more sympathetic, the benefits would be enormous.  It is soul-destroying that we cannot even achieve that.  The same applies for roadside hedges.<\/p> <p>  When talking about the champion for biodiversity within the public sector, it is important to state that climate action is going to benefit biodiversity.  There is no doubt about that.  However, if we do not take action specifically for biodivesity, all the climate action in the world may not actually benefit biodiversity.  It is quite a nuanced issue.  The reason I am talking about a champion for biodiversity within the public sector is that it is cross-sectorial.  All sectors and aspects of society have to at least do a small bit to help benefit biodiversity.  It is a cross-cutting initiative.  We need someone at a high level to try to bring it up the political ladder and play an overarching co-ordination role.  That is perhaps what is missing.  This committee could be extended or there could be a committee on biodiversity.  Many of the discussions we had today have shown that there are plenty of solutions to this.  We know what the solutions are; the issue is how we achieve them and make them happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021050400002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Liam Lysaght"},{"type":"speech","time":1620082800,"counter":105,"content":"<p>Does Mr. Fogarty or Professor Stout want to comment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021050400002#L00400","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620082800,"counter":106,"content":"<p>Ladies first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021050400002#L00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. P&aacute;draic Fogarty"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620082800,"counter":107,"content":"<p>I agree with Dr. Lysaght on farmland challenges.

We only have one planet, one island and one ocean.  Nature is collapsing.  We have to let go of growth and decide that, for the benefit of everybody, we can get back within the limits of nature.  The footprint of farming and fishing needs to be reduced.  We should not be trying to farm and fish absolutely everywhere.  There are areas that are good for farming and fishing and others that are simply not good for them.

When I say \"we\" I mean us as humans.  It is clearly largely due to human activity and we have to acknowledge, accept and address that.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Lysaght mentioned that 20% of all Irish species are threatened with extinction and 63% of bird species are a conservation concern.  These are species we are all familiar with.  We all know the kestrel that hovers over the roadsides hunting.  To think that will be a thing of the past is frightening.  Another great example of a bird species is the puffin.  We use it on our postcards and literature and it is an iconic bird that breeds off the coast of Ireland.  To think that is something that would be consigned to history is scary.<\/p> <p>  That is the reality and we needed to hear that bleak truth but there are positives to be taken from today's meeting.  It is incredible that we have a like-minded committee, whose members all seem to be singing from the same hymn sheet and who want to take action and do something.  That is positive.  The other positive that has already been touched on is that because of lockdown and the pandemic people have been getting in touch with nature.  That has led to the outrage we saw over the wildfires in Killarney and the persecution of birds of prey.  That public outrage is something we were not seeing before and we are seeing now.  That is evidence to me that change is happening.  There is the odd positive in the area of climate change if we look at it.  We have had more regular occurrences of humpback whales off the Irish coast.  There is no doubt about that.  Only five years ago, the Irish Whale and Dolphin Group, IWDG, catalogue was at 33 animals and that is well over 100 now so that is something we could look at.  Little egrets have colonised large parts of Ireland since the 1970s.  There is something to grasp onto there.<\/p> <p>  I want to ask Professor Stout about the ecosystems, biodiversity and the potential socioeconomic benefits.

Apologies have been received from Senator Flynn.  I remind members to please ensure that their mobile phones are switched off for the duration of the meeting because they interfere with the broadcasting equipment even when in silent mode.  I remind those who are located outside the precincts of Leinster House that they will not be marked as in attendance.  The minutes of the meeting of 27 April 2021 have been circulated to all members.  Are they agreed to?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  On behalf of the committee, I welcome Dr. Colman Noctor, board member of Mental Health Ireland, Ms Mary Briody, psychotherapist, and Dr. Claire Hayes, consultant clinical psychologist, Ms Stella O'Malley, psychotherapist, and Dr. Niall Muldoon, the Ombudsman for Children.  The witnesses are here to brief the committee on school bullying and the impact on mental health.  This is a special day for the committee as we commence our examination of a topic that can have a detrimental effect for many years on the lives of many people.  The committee began looking at the issue in November last, when representatives of the National Anti-Bullying Research and Resource Centre at Dublin City University, DCU, came before the committee on the first UN Day against Violence and Bullying at School including Cyberbullying.  The meeting had a great impact on committee members and they agreed the issue warranted further consideration.<\/p> <p>  The format of the meeting is as follows.  I will invite Dr. Noctor, Ms Briody, Dr. Hayes, Ms O'Malley and Dr. Muldoon, respectively, to make individual opening statements.  The statements will be followed by questions from members of the committee, each of whom will have a six-minute slot to include the witnesses' responses.  I will interrupt either the witness or the member after six minutes has passed.<\/p> <p>  Before we begin, I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses of the Oireachtas or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  As the witnesses are giving evidence remotely from a place outside the parliamentary precincts, and as such may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings that a witness physically present does, they have been advised that they may think it appropriate to take legal advice on the matter.  They are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of a person or entity.  If, therefore, their statements are potentially defamatory to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed by me to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.<\/p> <p>  I invite Dr. Noctor to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021050400002#A00200","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620082800,"counter":132,"content":"<p>It is a pleasure to be here.  I am appearing as a board member of Mental Health Ireland and a child psychotherapist.  I also work as an assistant professor at University College Dublin, UCD.<\/p> <p>  In my clinical experience, approximately 80% of the children who have attended my service have had a significant experience of what they describe as bullying.  This appears to be a considerable contributor to many of their mental health difficulties.  I work predominantly with girls who have eating disorders.  Self-worth, self-belief and self-value are cornerstones of our mental well-being.  Bullying is one of the leading causes of these qualities being eroded in children and is, therefore, a significant contributor to the mental health problems of children.<\/p> <p>  There are some important distinctions to be made in regard to bullying.  Some children describe as bullying what can more accurately be described as robust banter.  I fear that if we dilute the term too much, it will lose its significance, and language is an important player in the management of this dynamic.  The key differentiation is intent.  Childhood is a mixed bag of interactions of personality.  Robust children, who may be the youngest of four and are used to enjoying the rough and tumble of physical and robust verbal engagement in the world, will share a space with more reserved, sheltered children who have no desire for such antics and may be hyper-sensitive to these events.  As a result, it comes down to the spirit of the engagement and the levels of knowledge and intent of which all the parties are aware.<\/p> <p>  Childhood, by its nature, involves negotiating the social landscape and, therefore, mistakes and social errors or misjudgments will occur.  For example, a child may be unaware of how his or her behaviour is impacting on someone else and has to be given an opportunity to adjust that behaviour.  If, however, this feedback is given and the child knowingly persists with the hurtful behaviour, and continues to harass, torment, persecute or exclude another child, that cannot be tolerated.<\/p> <p>  It is my opinion that the most important element in predicting the management and behaviour of bullying is culture.  A culture can hide harm in plain sight and the cultures of schools, sports organisations and clubs are strongly influential on the behaviour of their attendees.  We need to invest in meaningfully respectful cultures, and a poster at the entrance of a school is not sufficient.  In the bullying triad, there are the bully, the bullied and the bystander, and we underestimate the influence of the bystander.  To cultivate culture, we must work to convert the majority.  Contrary to popular belief, I am not sure the answer lies in making meek children robust or teaching children to hit back or answer back.  Instead, it is about selling a culture of values and respect and stamping out a culture of avoidance, dismissal or tolerance.<\/p> <p>  The stories that have the greatest impact are those that go on for years.  It is not unusual for me to hear a story of a child whose parents reported bullying incidents when a child was in senior infants and the response was that the class was spoken to as a group but nothing changed and that the child in question was then continually persecuted for the remaining six years, which can often have a devastating effect on their social and emotional development.  Bullying has many forms and guises, some more identifiable than others.  The overt name-calling and physical hostilities are easier to name and manage but the greatest challenge is exclusion.  With greater opportunity for exclusion and exclusiveness in the contemporary world, through social media and so on, this is a considerable challenge.<\/p><p> The response to this is very complex.  How do we instruct children to include or play with other children?  How do we avoid micromanaging childhood relationships?  This detrimental dynamic is a huge part of the bullying problem.  My clinical caseload shows that children are far more affected by exclusion than physical bullying.  Perhaps a move towards meaningful value systems is required.  Although we have lots of focus on inclusion and embracing of diversity, little has been done to stem this tide of exclusion and isolation.  For me, this is what we need to address.<\/p><p> In the meantime, there must be supports for children who are experiencing bullying and exclusion.  The inclusion of therapeutically informed school staff would be a good way to start.  In my view, having the right culture is the greatest ally.  The culture should involve a value system that reflects the seriousness of the issue.  A culture will only work if it is developed by the students from the inside out as opposed to the outside in.  Parents must be included and must, from the off, buy into the culture of management of bullying and exclusion.  Attending school, a sporting activity or a club free from the fear of persecution, hostility or exclusion should not be seen as a luxury.  It is a basic human right that we need to take seriously.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021050400002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Colman Noctor","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620082800,"counter":134,"content":"<p>Thank you, Dr. Noctor.

Young people who have experienced bullying are more likely to develop an anxiety disorder or suffer from depression.  Those who both bully and are bullied suffer the most serious effects.  They are at greater risk for mental and behavioural problems than those who are victims or bullies alone.  Rates of depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation and behaviours are greatest in this group.<\/p> <p>  Bystanders fall into one of two groups, namely, those who act to stop bullying and those who do not.  Members of the latter group may be afraid of retaliation and experience upset because they wanted to intervene but did not.  They may experience increased anxiety and depression that can affect academic performance and increase their use of substances like alcohol, drugs and tobacco.  However, bystanders who act to stop bullying have beneficial outcomes, including increased self-esteem.<\/p> <p>  There is no direct correlation between bullying and suicide, which is not usually due to a single source of trauma, but bullying can contribute to the intense feelings of helplessness and hopelessness involved in suicidal behaviours.  Victims or perpetrators who experience continued, frequent bullying are at greater risk for suicidal behaviour.  The types of bullying experienced in a school setting are verbal, social, physical and cyber.  The more we learn about mental health, the more we recognise how to address mental health issues.  Studies of adults presenting with mental health issues have shown that bullying can lead to depression and anxiety in young people who are bullied, which can continue into adulthood.  Those who bully others are likely to engage in violent, unsafe and risky behaviour in adulthood.  Even those who simply observe bullying taking place are more likely to have mental health issues such as anxiety or depression.  A recent European study looked at adults who had been bullied, adults who had bullied other children and a control group of adults who had never been involved in bullying.  In the control group, 12% had needed treatment for some mental disorder, compared with 20% of bullies, 23% of those who had been bullied, and 31% of those who had been on both the receiving end and the giving end of bullying.<\/p> <p>  What can we do to address these issues?  The fundamental need of any student is to belong - to a family, a classroom, a school, a community and a country.  Outside of family life, the relationship with peers and the relationship with teachers have the greatest influence on young people's development in all aspects of themselves, including physically, socially, sexually, behaviourally, creatively, intellectually, emotionally and spiritually.  In terms of the well-being of students, and their adult roles in the future, the psychological safety afforded them by their parents and teachers will allow them to express all aspects of themselves safely.  If our schools can create a culture of psychological safety for staff and students, then we can eradicate bullying.<\/p> <p>  This will involve seeing discipline as a vehicle to transport change.  Discipline is about creating psychological safety for the student who has experienced bullying.  The focus, first, is on the person who has experienced bullying and, second, on the student who has perpetrated the bullying.  Discipline means that people experience psychological safety when encountering violations because of the creation of a response whereby the teacher, supported by school policy, models and teaches taking action for self rather than against the student who created the undisciplined behaviour.  Taking action for oneself is a mature response to bullying.  We need to realise that all behaviour makes sense.  We need to educate young people to get underneath the stand of their behaviour, whether it be aggressive, dominant or passive.  This requires a whole-school approach.  If a young person becomes conscious of what his or her behaviour is about and what function it has, he or she can learn, in safety, to let go of that behaviour.<\/p> <p>  The sad reality is that a young person's diary knows more about him or her being bullied than do the adults taking care of that young person.  The responsibility lies with parents and educators to recognise, monitor, challenge, confront and maturely resolve bullying and passivity.  Professionals such as relationship and parent mentors can offer such support to parents and the school community to effect change.  I have been privileged to journey with many families and schools in helping them to see a young person and not just his or her behaviour.  If I confuse the individual with the behaviour, then no change arises.

My work focuses on parenting and family dynamics and working with teenagers.  Much of my counselling and writing focuses on mental health.  My books include <i>Cotton Wool Kids<\/i>in 2015, <i>Bully-Proof Kids<\/i>in 2017 and, my latest book, <i>Fragile<\/i>, published in 2019.<br\/><br\/>I work in private practice in the midlands.  Of the three second level schools in the area, one of them appears to handle bullying very effectively, another does reasonably well and the third encounters bullying on an almost continuous basis.  This is remarkable as the children are mostly from similar backgrounds.  The difference is that the problem school minimises the bullying incidents, while the other two schools are willing, to a greater or lesser extent, to address the problem and take steps to deal with it.  It is notable that schools that are more competitive and more focused on their student's education results than their emotional well-being tend to minimise bullying.  Anti-bullying programmes show varying degrees of success and are insufficient to change a culture of bullying within a school.<br\/><br\/>The research on bullying provides the resolution to this complex and chronic problem.  It is estimated that approximately 75% to 90% of children do not bully, which means that 10% to 15% of them are bullying.  The problem is that the children who do not bully are prepared to act as upstanders only some 20% of the time.  Dan Olweus, a Swedish expert on bullying, coined the phrase, &quot;If it's mean, intervene.&quot;  If we can convince children to intervene and become upstanders when they see bullying, we can immediately reduce its frequency, intensity and impact.  The role of adults in this context is to encourage the bystanders to act as upstanders and, perhaps more idealistically, to nurture potential bullies to be fair leaders.<br\/><br\/>Bystanders are the people who see everything but do nothing.  Thousands of children today are bystanders to cruel bullying.  They let the bullying happen in real life or online.  The bystanders are the silent majority but they hold the majority of the power.  It is estimated that bystanders are present in 90% of cases of bullying and could stop the bullying, online or in real life, within ten seconds if they chose to intervene.  If we can create an environment where being a bystander means one is complicit in the drama, then we will eliminate the safe position of the bystander.  Challenging bystanders to become upstanders will change the culture of bullying, whereby it is perceived as an inevitable happening, to one where it is instead perceived as a preventable problem.<br\/><br\/>It is helpful for schools to view bullying as an opportunity to teach children how to behave in a more socialised manner.  Children are not yet fully socialised and their brains are not yet fully formed.  This brings to the mind the words of Robert Ardrey: &quot;But we were born of risen apes, not fallen angels...&quot;  Children may gravitate towards the pack instinct more quickly than adults do.  It is our job, as concerned adults, to educate children such that bullying becomes less acceptable within the school culture.  Bullying can be significantly reduced.  However, to date, not enough people are educated about how to do this.<br\/><br\/>I thank the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021050400002#B00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Stella O'Malley"},{"type":"speech","time":1620082800,"counter":142,"content":"<p>Thank you, Ms O'Malley.

We know that school bullying can have a detrimental impact on mental health.  I have had the privilege of working with clients ranging in age from five to 88 who have shared their stories of bullying.  Some of them were victims of bullying, some were deeply ashamed of how they turned to bullying as a way of not being bullied while others were distressed by how they let others down by not recognising that they were being bullied at a time when it might have made a difference.  Anti-bullying measures are essential.  However, it is my view that it is likely that bullying will always be an aspect of life.  My submission invites the committee to focus on how we can help people of all ages develop coping strategies, and build resilience, based on the key principles of cognitive behavioural therapy, CBT, so that treating themselves, and others, with respect and understanding becomes a more desirable option than bullying.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021050400002#C00100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Claire Hayes"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620082800,"counter":144,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for the invitation and remind the committee that I made a formal submission on this topic in February this year, to which I refer members<br\/><br\/>By way of background, it may be of interest to the committee to know that since 2018 the Office of the Ombudsman for Children has received more than 400 complaints about bullying in schools, both at primary and post-primary level.  These comprise 10% of all complaints that we have received in that time.  In the context of our broad remit and the endless variety of complaints that we receive, that is quite significant.<br\/><br\/>The extent to which schools can be a site of bullying and the important role that schools can play, and must be supported to play, in combating bullying involving children are important considerations for today's meeting.  This issue has received considerable attention from the UN Special Representative of the Secretary General on Violence Against Children, and contributed to the establishment in 2020 of the International Day against Violence and Bullying at School Including Cyberbullying, which the Chairman mentioned earlier.  It is notable that the list of issues prior to reporting that the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, published in November 2020 in respect of Ireland,  includes a request for information about measures being taken to tackle bullying with particular reference to cyberbullying and bullying in schools.  Based on the complaints that we have received, some of the important issues to highlight are as follows: there is psychological and physical bullying between young people with a noted increase in instances, in complaints we have received, of serious bullying resulting in physical and-or sexual assault; there are challenges for schools in dealing with the more serious instances of bullying as many schools feel ill-equipped to do so; and there is a failure by some schools to report child protection and welfare issues arising from bullying instances to Tusla.  In light of that, I believe that prevention and early intervention would be greatly aided by training, resourcing and support measures that can strengthen the capacity of education professionals working with children and young people in schools.  It would also be helpful to co-ordinate and mainstream prevention and early intervention measures across the formal education system.<br\/><br\/>Back in 2016, our office, as part of its report to the UN committee on the rights of the child, encouraged the State to build on the monitoring framework contained in the Department of Education's document, entitled the Anti-Bullying Procedures for Primary and Post-Primary Schools, by examining schools' annual reviews of their implementation of the procedures.  We hoped that the Department would go further than just checking if there was a policy in place and would start to collate specific information, and data, from around the country to determine the issues and solutions that occurred in schools.  This is still not happening, unfortunately.  In light of a number of consultations that we have had with children, over the past couple of years, who say that within their schools they have experienced issues such as racism, homophobia and negative commentary about their mental health, we believe that this data collection is long overdue.  A review of the Department's anti-bullying procedures is also long overdue, which date from 2013, to take account of issues such as those that we have mentioned and cyberbullying.  We ask for that because it may be time to start differentiating what constitutes bullying so that more refined solutions can be generated across the education system.<br\/><br\/>Before concluding, I want to speak about the mental health aspect and reiterate my call to have an independent therapist or counsellor available to every primary school in the country.  This is not a unique concept.  It has been shown internationally to offer enormous advantages to schools and their communities by affording children the opportunity to normalise speaking to someone about their emotions or if they are feeling down.  I believe that it would complement the well-being policy and framework for practice currently employed across the education system.  It would also afford additional comfort to teachers who know they have somewhere to send their pupils who may be impacted by bullying, bereavement, separation, divorce, addiction issues or domestic violence.  Having an easily accessible therapeutic service would aid the whole school community to know that they are doing their best for every child.  With regard to post-primary schools, I urge that all career guidance counsellors are formally trained to provide therapy for emotional issues as well as careers.<br\/><br\/>I must mention the Youth Mental Health Pathfinder Project.  The project was designed to take a whole-of-government approach to tackling mental health issues for young people.  It was backed by the Departments of Education, Health and Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth<b>.  <\/b>The project has not progressed, which is an issue that I have raised many times over the past five years.  The implementation of Pathfinder would, undoubtedly, have a positive impact on tackling bullying in schools and dealing with other mental health issues that affect young people.<br\/><br\/>Finally, I am part of the Wellbeing for Teachers and Learners Group that seeks to embed a culture of well-being across the whole school community.  The group has members from the Irish Primary Principals Network, the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals, the Teaching Council, and the National Parents Council Primary.  We believe that we need to engage the whole school community, comprising parents, teachers, staff and children, to help reduce or prevent mental health issues within education.  That must include supporting our teachers and other school staff to be emotionally aware and present for each other as well as students.  If school staff are not safe and secure in their well-being, then children will be impacted.

Parents play a huge role in this.  As well as advocating for the child who is undergoing the bullying, they need to agitate until that is resolved as opposed to letting it go.  The establishment of a culture where bullying is not tolerated has to involve parents because if one has a child who gets in trouble for mistreating or excluding another child, there is an emphasis that parents will dismiss that as unimportant or will not follow through.  The number of children who experience bullying suggests there are many more children who bully than we know about or come in contact with.  It would be good if parents agreed to buy in in the first year of primary school and the first year of secondary school, for example.  I mean that if bullying occurs that the parent of the child who is the perpetrator and the parent of the child who is the victim will take an active role in following through on that.  If teachers get involved, there is a \"not my Johnny\" approach and when that happens, it is incredibly difficult to have a consistent approach across the board.

In September at the beginning of the school year, schools need to send a letter to all the parents stating that there will be bullying, and that it is very important that the parents acknowledge that their child might be a bully and that is okay.  There is a kind of vilification of bullying and parents are so frightened that their child might be bullied that they completely deny it.  The schools need to say, \"We're socialising our children.  One day they will grow up.  In the meantime, they might behave very badly and that's okay because we'll help them to become better people.\"  It is a process and we need honesty and moral courage in this process.<\/p> <p>  As Dr. Noctor said, the way to do that is to get buy-in at the beginning.  More people need to sign up to the bullying policies and they need to be more prominent than they are.  Rather than being in the background somewhere on a website, there needs to be a conscious decision that we are going to create a culture of not only upstanding but an acknowledgement that bullying will take place and we will hopefully respond sufficiently.  Often the important point about the bullying programmes is their execution.  It is not good enough just to write a bullying programme; it needs much more depth than that.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021050400002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Stella O'Malley"},{"type":"speech","time":1620082800,"counter":151,"content":"<p>My final question is for Dr. Hayes.  One factor that can have an impact on the mental health of children is that they may feel excluded.  Of course, they can be excluded without bullying necessarily being perpetrated by another child; they might just not be invited over to the house of a friend who is having a party.  What can we do to try to allow children to recognise that they have a role to play in terms of trying to ensure there is greater inclusion among people?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021050400002#D00400","speaker":"1553"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620082800,"counter":152,"content":"<p>That is a great question.  The Deputy is absolutely right.  It highlights that at times it is not the bullying itself; it is the perception.  Some children might be excluded because they are not liked or because it is an afterthought.  If they or their parents are looking at life through the bullying lens, then much of the behaviour can be seen as them being bullied.  It is important to look at that and help children stand back a little bit from it and take responsibility for it themselves, but also to be able to acknowledge how they are feeling about it.  They feel hurt and upset because they think they are being bullied or they think that they are being deliberately excluded, but they have choices over how they respond to that.  Throughout life, as adults, we have experiences where we might perceive we are excluded, either deliberately or unintentionally, and we learn how to respond to that.  It is important that children of all ages start taking responsibility for the choices they have in responding to either deliberate bullying or behaviour that they perceive to be bullying.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021050400002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Claire Hayes"},{"type":"speech","time":1620082800,"counter":153,"content":"<p>I am present here in Leinster House.<\/p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for the presentations, which were very impressive.  The previous session we had on this topic was powerful and quite emotive.  One of the things that struck me was the fact that bullying has always existed and always has been very traumatic.  Sometimes it can be minimised but for families and children who are at its centre, it can make their lives hell on earth when it is severe.  Where previously children might have got respite at home, the way that social media can be used and manipulated to facilitate or increase bullying means that there is very little respite even at home, even in the child's own bedroom.<\/p> <p>  My first question is for Dr. Muldoon.  Is he satisfied with how the online safety Bill is being progressed?  I know some people are suggesting it should be delayed.  Does he believe this needs to be legislated for and enforced urgently?  Does the Bill have an important role to play?  I believe it does in respect of material posted without consent and harmful material.  Obviously, it is not the full solution or the only solution, but I believe it has a role to play.  <\/p> <p>  Ms O'Malley identified a very interesting point about the different nature of the approach taken in schools that typically might be more competitive in terms of their results.  Is there any variation in how schools might have implemented policies related to relationships and sexuality education, RSE, and social, personal and health education, SPHE, on religious and sexual issues?<\/p> <p>  As has been discussed recently, I am somewhat concerned that in instances where a child might feel othered in a school, they do not feel themselves properly represented in educational programmes there because of the way they have been prescribed by the school.  Is there merit in tackling that issue and ensuring uniformity in how those issues are discussed?  <\/p> <p>  My final question is for Dr. Noctor.  Dr. Muldoon made a few points about access to therapists.  That is also a key point in respect of guidance counsellors.  Does Dr. Noctor agree with that point?  Does the HSE need to provide more support in respect of body-image issues?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021050400002#D00600","speaker":"1460"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620082800,"counter":154,"content":"<p>The Deputy referred to the online media Bill.  From our point of view, of course, it will have a role and will be very important legislation to look at the edges of criminality around this area.  When talking about school bullying and starting from a young age, the answer lies in the culture of the schools.  That is really where we need to make a significant difference.<\/p> <p>  I urge members of the committee, as legislators, to consider the Education (Student and Parent Charter) Bill, which was set up to be an opportunity for schools, students and their families to engage in the processes and cultures they want in their schools.  It proposes the automatic generation of a charter, which is reviewed on a yearly basis, and which allows for that informal engagement with families and children when there is an issue and sets up that respect element.  That is the way to generate the culture consistently throughout the country.  That will be the key to it as far as I am concerned.<\/p> <p>  Certainly, the online media Bill will highlight many of the areas.  I mentioned earlier that the bullying procedures date back to 2013 and are probably out of date in some areas.  Certain issues were not happening as much back then.

That is a sad reflection but something I have noticed.<\/p> <p>  In addition, certain schools minimise bullying and almost act as if it is not happening.  I have noticed that the more effective schools I work with are all over the bully when it happens.  They provide extra support for the bully and put a serious plan in place acknowledging that they have gone askew and they need to be helped.  At the same time in a more subtle way they provide support for the target of the bullying and bring in the vast majority of the students in the class who have nothing to do with it but are complicit because they are nodding along.  That is to do with the culture.  The school needs to acknowledge that it is taking place, rather than being distracted by sports or educational achievement.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021050400002#D00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Stella O'Malley"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620082800,"counter":156,"content":"<p>I will answer the question on the therapeutic involvement.  The landscape for teachers to negotiate is considerably more complex than it was previously.  The Deputy asked Dr. Muldoon about the online safety issue.  The online world has much more impact on this than we imagine.  It is the narrative around what friendship means and how disposable people are.  It has a subtle influence on the stuff that is happening, rather than something that is very clear.  Returning to the point made by Deputy O'Callaghan, if there is no rule, there needs to be a value system highlighting inclusion, diversity and being upstanding.  As Ms O'Malley said, everybody needs to buy into that.  If the value system is about academic or sports achievement, bullying probably lies far down in the hierarchy.<\/p><p>We need to understand that it is much more complex.<\/p><p> On the involvement of expertise, we have subcontracted many issues to teachers, such as sex education, therapy and so on.  Teachers are correctly saying they are not therapists and they do not know how to manage this.  It is a litigious, contentious environment when a child is accused of bullying.  The teacher has to decide whom to tell and wonder whether the parents' solicitor will come down on him or her.  There are many aspects to think about.  The expertise in the room, whether therapeutic or supportive of the school, is essential.  I fully concur with Dr. Muldoon's point.

It is great to see Dr. Noctor and Dr. Hayes, both clinical psychologists, as well as Ms O'Malley, Ms Briody and the Ombudsman for Children, Dr. Muldoon.  When we held a meeting on this subject on 5 November, it was the UN Day against Violence and Bullying at School including Cyberbullying.  We heard from the National Anti-Bullying Research and Resource Centre at Dublin City University, DCU, on all the systems and programmes it was examining.  It highlighted the FUSE programme in particular.  Our guests might comment on how that should be rolled out.  It was intended to train teachers but, as far as I am aware, it has been in place only since September of last year.<\/p> <p>  As Dr. Noctor stated, a high level of mental impacts result from bullying and 80% of the children who have presented to him have experienced bullying.  Dr. Briody stated that there are significant impacts for perpetrators as well as for victims.  It was surprising to me that bullying impacts on everybody, from the perpetrators to the victims and bystanders as well.  It is important for bystanders to step up and have a say in preventing this type of behaviour.<\/p> <p>  I liked Dr. Noctor's point that it is important that being safe from bullying is treated as a basic human right and we need to take seriously that we should be able to attend a school or club free from any sort of hostility or exclusion.  I feel strongly about the measures that were mentioned regarding training therapists, guidance counsellors and staff to be emotionally aware.  It is about a positive school environment.  We need to have anti-bullying policies and it should not just be a box-ticking exercise.<\/p> <p>  On the school environment and training for staff and students, I am curious about mediation training.  Does Dr. Noctor have an opinion on the FUSE programme being rolled out by DCU?

Nevertheless, we can overburden schools by asking them to get into mediation and so on.  If we are going to have accountability, resources have to be in place that will support the school to do it.  It is a two-pronged approached.  While we can inform teachers on how to better manage the issue, there has to be somebody to whom they can hand it over.  Teachers are educators primarily and there are experts in this field, many of whom are attending this meeting, who would be able to help with that.

I am happy for any of them to take the questions.  My first point concerns the general issue of bullying in society, which children are aware of.  I suspect that bullying is very different now from how it was 20 or 30 years ago because, from my observations, it has become mainstream and features in media, game shows, reality TV shows and politics as well.  I sometimes think we have to bully-proof our political campaigning because children see what is happening in wider society and impersonate what they see on screen and what is deemed to be acceptable.<\/p> <p>  Furthermore, bullying nowadays does not just happen in school.  It can follow people home because as long as they have a smartphone and other people have access to the phone number, they can be bullied at all hours of the day and night.  There was a time when people could escape from it, at least until Monday, when they went home to the bosom of their family.  Now it can happen all weekend long, through the night and the early hours of the morning.  Schools will say they have an anti-bullying policy, but at what point does the school's responsibility finish?  Obviously, bullying occurs not just within the student body; it can happen within the staff body as well, and children see this and are aware of it.  Perhaps Dr. Muldoon or another of our guests will comment on that dynamic of not being able to escape bullying and of the wider societal responsibilities that politics or the media has.<\/p> <p>  My third question relates to the understanding of bullying.  In my experience, parents will sometimes suggest that their child is being bullied because of a once-off incident.  Much time can then be spent on trying to explain to the parent the nature of bullying, which is not a once-off incident.  Bullying is the persistent intimidation or reduction of one person by another over a prolonged period.  The very definition of bullying can sometimes be misunderstood, and it is difficult to tackle something such as bullying if there is such a misunderstanding of its nature.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021050400002#E00700","speaker":"1551"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620082800,"counter":164,"content":"<p>I agree completely in regard to the culture in adult society and the fact that the way in which we are showing the way forward is not the way we want it to be.  There have been a number of high-profile cases of adults being bullied through the media.<\/p><p>We can think of people such as Caroline Flack.  There are situations in which children are very much aware of influencers and the way they can lead to high-profile dangerous situations.  We need to take hold of that.<\/p><p> The Deputy is correct in that politics is one of the most dangerous situations because there is an automatic assumption that we are allowed to give out about politics and politicians on a personal basis.  We need to change that culture as well.  We are not leading from the front well as adults with the way society has developed.<\/p><p> I will bring it down to the school situation.  We need to start looking at understanding what bullying is taking place throughout the country.  It is a matter of gathering data.  If we have 4,000 schools and the Department is only asking how many schools have policies in place, then it is only a box-ticking exercise.  Within those schools we need to know how many times there has been a bullying complaint, what the school has done with it, what the issues were and how they were dealt with.  Only then can we really start to understand where the issues are coming from.  We have had consultations with children where they have highlighted racism as an issue as well as other issues.  We need to drill down and know about all of this.  That creates a culture of understanding.  As Ms O'Malley said, it is about dealing with it on an ongoing basis.  This takes into account the issue raised about one-off bullying.  Families and children will understand that there is more to it than that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021050400002#E00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Muldoon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620082800,"counter":166,"content":"<p>Dr. Noctor indicated a wish to comment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021050400002#F00200","speaker":"1551"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620082800,"counter":167,"content":"<p>The issue of jurisdiction is interesting because the school facilitates the introduction but the control the school has over 24 hours is challenging.

Perhaps transition year could run delete days with the first year and second year students.  There are solutions whereby older school children could teach younger school children good online tech behaviour.  Children have not really learned how to behave themselves online and they need to be taught.  They are young and we need to give them space.

I would also like to bring attention to the fact that this starts at a young age.  I wish to go back to what Dr. Noctor said with regard to one-off bullying.  There is a big solution to this if we have better communication between parents and the schools.  Parents need to see it as okay to talk to the school principal.  The school principal has to hear what the parents are saying and agree to keep an eye on the situation and agree that the school policy will take note of all of that.<\/p> <p>  I would start at junior infants.  How do we educate junior infants, senior infants and younger children?  There is a great role here for play psychotherapy.  Play is a great method to communicate with the younger cohort.  I believe it would make a great difference at primary school level in a fun but effective way to get the message across around bullying.  That could then be followed into secondary school with the presence of really good psychotherapy measures or counselling.  It is not fair to ask teachers to take on more than they are already doing.  We need specialised people in place.  One of the major things I hear from secondary school students is that they often do not trust going out to counselling in school settings because they are afraid people will see them or get to know why they are going out.  That all has to be looked at.

Building trust between the whole school community is important in terms of what we are talking about.  Schools cannot say it is up to parents and parents cannot say it is up to teachers.  Children have to accept that it is not okay for them to say they were afraid to tell.  It is really up to everyone involved to try to tackle bullying.  The idea and concept of having an independent therapist and counsellor available to every school is really important and should be done.<\/p> <p>  Ms Briody talked about a recent European study.

What works is bringing it all together.  I was thinking about professionals who could actually bring it together.  I am thinking about play psychotherapists at primary level and psychotherapists or counsellors at secondary level.  I am thinking about how we bring the whole idea together around the parents.  What I have in mind is relationship mentoring and parent mentoring in particular.  In this scenario we have people who will not judge parents but work with them and help them to understand and make sense of the behaviour of their children.  When it is brought to the door of parents that their children are actually bullying they feel judged or can feel shame.  When all these big emotions get involved it is difficult for it to be worked out.  We need to get underneath and understand what the bullying behaviour is about, whether in respect of the dominant person who is bullying or the more passive person.

On that note, can Dr. Noctor make any suggestions on how we can empower the bystander and make it safe for him or her to stand up and intervene?  Ultimately, that would be helpful to both the victim of bullying and the perpetrator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021050400002#F01200","speaker":"1689","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620082800,"counter":178,"content":"<p>If this has an easy solution, we would have found it by now.  When we should have started doing this is approximately six years ago is probably the answer.  The issue of the bystander is about value systems.  We need to focus less on rules and more on values in schools.  The parents have an important role in this.  Bullying is not an issue that only affects disadvantage; it happens in all social spheres.  Even with the parents who are dismissive of their child's role as perpetrator, it is often not due to a lack of education, awareness or shame.  It could be just dismissive of a sense of accountability and responsibility to try to do something about it.  The value system has to spread across the parents.  I believe they are crucial.  We all might agree with the bystander role but, as a parent, would I encourage my eight-year-old to get involved in a row between two others?  I am not entirely sure I would do that to the degree that I would like to think I would, if that makes sense.<\/p> <p>  Some of the anti-bullying information comes through a website or is circulated as a big glossy document.  It is something that is developed by a board of management or some entity outside.  It must be developed from the inside out.  The only bullying policies I have ever seen as effective have been developed by students, so get them involved and ask them what they would do.  One school, whose name I cannot recall, had an intimidation squad.  It comprised three children.  If a child was getting grief, he or she would go to them.  They were fifth and sixth years who would listen to the student and talk him or her through it.  That is students finding their own solutions as opposed to having a formalised channel.  It is parent buy-in, school buy-in and cultural buy-in.  The bystander issue is not easy.  It is a hard thing to ask people to do.  The playground politic is very difficult: \"Do I become a target as soon as I raise my head in this and will the bully turn on me?\".  It has to be a collective effort.  To be a single upstander in a group of bystanders is challenging.  We must be able to support children meaningfully to do that.  As to how one does it, I do not have the answer.  However, just because one does not have the answer does not mean we should not ask the right questions or rummage around to find it, if that makes sense.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021050400002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Colman Noctor"},{"type":"speech","time":1620082800,"counter":179,"content":"<p>Absolutely, I agree in that regard.

A couple of things struck me.  Sometimes when we discuss bullying we are talking about it after the horse has bolted.  Could I hear the witnesses' thoughts on being more creative about the value system mentioned by Dr. Noctor and empathy education?  Some other countries are considering implementing education that does not involve having everyone of the same age in the same space at the same time.  That creates a type of competitiveness that can drive this because everybody is at probably the same level of maturity trying to deal with something.  There are a couple of adults there who they probably do not react to in the same way as they would to a slightly older child.  Is there something we can do in our schools?  I come from a non-traditional background in terms of home schooling, but it is worth looking at the school system and considering if we took down all the walls from it and decided not to try to bolt on something about bullying but to look at it from a different perspective.  What are the witnesses' perspectives on that?  What we can do at the start rather than afterwards?<\/p> <p>  The numbers in home education have also increased.  Based on my experience in the past, half of those who dropped out of school wanted to do so but the other half were those who had extreme bullying and traumatic experiences.  That is the half we can deal with.  We have seen that increase and now there is an opportunity to see how the school system can be better placed to support children who want to stay there.<\/p> <p>  Those are a couple of points on which I wish to hear the witnesses' thoughts.  The point about a democratic approach to dealing with bullying mentioned by Dr. Noctor is very interesting, as well as how to empower students in a way whereby they do not feel overwhelmed by the responsibility of having to deal with something.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of cyberbullying, all of us, as adults, have probably witnessed it as bystanders and not known how to deal with it.  An education for our children will probably make us healthier and stronger adults as well when we come out of that school system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021050400002#G00700","speaker":"1693"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620082800,"counter":184,"content":"<p>What we are doing does not work so we require anything that is creative and offers us a possible solution, be it something innovative involving a mentorship system of the older child.<\/p> <p>  It is interesting that the Senator mentioned home schooling.

When we get to the cyber topic there must a buy-in from them as well.  This is a platform of introduction which they need to supervise.  I work with young people in groups all the time, and I have worked in inpatient units.  The more one listens, the less they shout.  It is about involvement, buy-in and getting them to organically create the bystander upstanding policy from inside out, rather than trying to impose it from outside in.  From the point of view of the first years coming into the school and the parents, every pupil is sat down and told this is the policy and the pupil signs up to it, so when something comes up one can say that the pupil committed to this approach and to this ethos of exploration, openness and whatever it might be.  Again, it has some teeth, as opposed to being a glossy laminated sheet on the wall of little value, if that makes sense.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021050400002#G00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Colman Noctor"},{"type":"speech","time":1620082800,"counter":185,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Noctor.

It was, as Dr. Noctor said, that they all bought into being active rather than just paying lip service to something.  The school found that very effective.  It would roll it out again for the second years, so they got two years of it, and then introduced it to the first years.  In this school before lockdown we were up as far as transition year.

Bullying is a behaviour and any person can experience or exhibit it.  To label someone as a bully can be detrimental.  To effect change, we need to go back to basics, question our language as adults and work with the whole of society, including the teacher training colleges and the National Parents Council.  Just as we put our seat belts on when we get into a car and do not throw plastic bags around, what I am referring to is a basic cultural shift.

I acknowledge that, unfortunately, bullying is not the preserve of our school system.  It is rife across all of society, including politics, as Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in noted.  I welcome Dr. Muldoon's comments in response to that point.  I concur with him.<\/p> <p>  I was taken by the remarks of Dr. Noctor when he stated that a poster at the door was not good enough.  I agree with him.  He mentioned the notion of a value system, which was an interesting way of phrasing it, from the point of view of getting to the bottom of this issue and coming up with ideas.  As he rightly stated, we do not have all the answers, but asking the right questions is probably a good place to start.<\/p> <p>  I would welcome responses from our guests to any of my comments.  In the context of trying to change the culture, I suspect that bullying has been around since time immemorial.  That said, it is possible for us to consider primary schools in particular as the place to start that cultural shift early and create a value system.  In line with what other committee members have said about policy formulation, is it good enough that we are allowing schools to create policies themselves and then merely checking to ensure they have policies rather than what is in them?  Are there international examples of best practice in the centralisation of such policy formulation or, rather, in setting out that a policy's base should have X, Y and Z and that schools can add to it if they want?  That may be a better way of dealing with this matter, particularly if there are schools experiencing issues.<\/p> <p>  I was taken by Dr. Muldoon's comment that the Ombudsman for Children's office had received 400 complaints.  I must assume that those are serious complaints rather than relatively minor ones if parents went all the way to the Ombudsman for Children over bullying incidents.  As part of this and future hearings, perhaps that issue should be examined more broadly.  There is much for us as committee members to learn from Dr. Muldoon's statement.<\/p> <p>  I appreciate that many members have already asked questions and had them answered.  The availability of therapeutic services and counsellors to school groups or communities is paramount, as may be the upskilling of teachers or guidance counsellors in order to identify and assist children in dealing with this problem within schools.  The issue goes beyond school environments, of course.  It goes to sporting clubs and other organisations that work with children.  The State being able to provide aid for identifying bullying within a group, be it in a classroom, on a football team or wherever, and assisting and intervening is of paramount importance.  How to encourage intervention among pupils is worthy of consideration in terms of empowerment for children.  Speaking as the former Chairman of the old Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs, empowering children is not just about giving them an opportunity to speak on something.  It is also about giving them an opportunity to tell us what they want.  The examples that were cited were excellent and eye-opening.<\/p> <p>  If anyone among our guests wishes to respond to my points, I would be delighted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021050400002#H00300","speaker":"1562"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620082800,"counter":191,"content":"<p>The Deputy referred to the 400 complaints.  As he rightly alluded, we are the last port of call.  Before coming to us with a complaint, a person has already gone through the teacher, the principal and the board of management.  People take their complaints seriously if they are coming to us.  Obviously, not all of the 400 complaints are of the same level of seriousness, but we are finding more complicated and difficult issues arising under the title of \"bullying\".  We need to examine them from a systemic point of view, including the Department of Education's responses as well as the supports it gives schools.  As we discussed the previous time I was before the committee, there is a sense of the Department being hands off and that the response should be from the individual school.  That makes achieving consistency, including in communication styles, across the 4,000 schools difficult.  When does a school engage with child protection services or the Garda when the bullying becomes more serious and complicated?  That last point concerns me.  We are hearing about incidents that might have been called \"touching\" years ago but are now known to be sexual assaults.  We are recognising different issues and naming them appropriately, but they can be hidden under the term \"bullying\".  People have got away with things because of that.  We need to start considering this in the longer term.  We had not examined our figures before this committee meeting was arranged.  What we found was surprising, so we were delighted to do that.

Much has been said at this stage.  In 2012, I was involved in developing a whole-community and whole-school approach to bullying with the Trinity anti-bullying centre, with Stephen Minton and Leanne Bart.  It was part of a community development project that obviously involved the whole community.  I cannot see any other way that we can tackle bullying meaningfully except through a whole-community approach.  Within that, there was the Garda, the GAA, the soccer clubs, clinicians, teachers, students and everybody else involved in the approach.  It worked and it is one of the evidence-based models that was produced.<\/p> <p>  Now we have a huge amount of information internationally and nationally.  We have the evidence-based models.  It is time to look at how we bring all this forward.  I commend the schools which implement good anti-bullying policies.  There are good practices out there and I know of them even in my own area.  We need to encourage the schools which are not participating.  I was always concerned when teachers said bullying did not happen in their schools.  Straight away, that should alert us.  I would not send my child to a school where the board of management or the teachers said bullying did not happen there.  We know that where there are human beings, there is the potential to be bullied and for bullying behaviour.  It is about how we deal with it.  We have models of good practice there to deal with it.<\/p> <p>  We have not spoken about the whole cost of bullying.  We are being foolish in terms of not investing in the way that we need to tackle school bullying in a meaningful way.  Have we estimated how much it has cost us?  In Australia, it is estimated to cost &euro;2.3 billion.  From an economic and social point of view, it makes sense for us to get a grip of this.  That is why I am glad the committee is putting aside some sessions to deal with this.<\/p> <p>  When 400 cases arrive on Dr. Muldoon's desk, after all these years, we have to ask why.  We must assume there is a gravity to those cases and that all other procedures have been gone through in trying to deal with them.  That is a failure of the system.  That is 400 failures about which we know.  We also know that the majority of children suffer in silence and damage is being done.  What measurements are in place to see if the anti-bullying procedures divvied out to schools are actually working?  I hate to use the word \"sanctions\".  However, what sanctions are in place if an anti-bullying policy is not implemented in a school?  I use the word \"sanctions\" in the wider sense of the word.  What extra resources have been specifically ring-fenced to deal with bullying in schools over the past ten years?<\/p> <p>  In part of the project we did, Drumcondra accepted and approved the teacher training that had to be done.  Is there a recognised training programme for teachers that is sufficient to meet their needs in order for them to be able to tackle bullying in the way they need to?  I like the idea of having a counsellor in place for national schools, both in terms of supporting teachers as well as children.  It is also good in terms of the wider acceptance of seeking help when one needs it.  That would have many broader benefits, above and beyond helping the children that would need to see the counsellor.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021050400002#J00200","speaker":"1501"},{"type":"speech","time":1620082800,"counter":199,"content":"<p>The Deputy has nearly taken up her six minutes with questions.

There is something to be said about the notion that we are less likely to stand up if there is a crowd but, like anything, that can be changed.<\/p> <p>  On parents, my experience is that they do their best 99.9% of the time with the resources and information they have.  It is important to support parents to know what is and is not appropriate.  While parents may not have their children eating sweets at 1 a.m. in their bedroom, they may be less aware of what is going on with technology.  It is a huge thing that has taken hold in our society and it can be extremely detrimental.  However, it is out there and children have phones.  It is about teaching them and teaching parents to teach them to use them responsibly.  It is about supporting parents.  It it is not about whipping or blaming.  It is about understanding.  If we come back to what bullying is, it is bullying behaviour treating other people with disrespect.  People might do that from a sense of fear from themselves.  From my experience of parents who shine the bullying lens on other children or other parents, often it is because of their own experience.  They are determined their children will not experience the lives and the difficulties they had.

Asking someone to be resilient in the face of bullying, when any of us who have been at school know how extraordinarily poisonous and insidious it is, is too much.

I am late on in the debate so a lot of the ground has been covered already.  I draw attention to what Ms O'Malley said about compassion.  That is central to all of this.  Dr. Hayes referred to labelling.  We have to at all times be conscious of our language.  When we talk about this, we should talk about bullying behaviour.  We should talk about the behaviour rather than the child.<\/p> <p>  In a lot of this, self-esteem is the silver bullet.  I knew very few children in my teaching life who had good self-esteem and engaged in bullying behaviour.  We have to look at causes and at mitigating the effects of bullying.  When we talk about culture, upstanders and bystanders, we are talking about mitigating the effects of bullying.  If we are going to the root cause, we should be looking at the child who engages in bullying behaviour.  <\/p> <p>  I am struck by Dr. Noctor's phrase in his opening that culture is the greatest ally.  It made me think of the famous Peter Drucker quote that culture eats strategy for breakfast.  As Dr. Noctor stated, one can have all the signs in the world on the school gate but if the culture is not right in the school, strategy counts for nothing.<\/p> <p>  I draw attention to the atomisation in schools, particularly primary schools.  The child's reality is set within the four walls of the primary school class.  It is difficult to share culture even between classrooms and between teachers.  In Dr. Muldoon's opening piece, he talked about information-sharing between schools and I do not think that happens enough.  We certainly do not have a formalised enough process to allow that to happen whereby we could share the experience of what went well and what went less well.  I think of Ms O'Malley's example of the three schools that are geographically close but that have such different school cultures.  How do we share that experience?  How does one school learn from another how to culture-set in the right way?<\/p> <p>  My question is directed to Dr. Muldoon because three minutes was very short for his opening statement.  He mentioned two things in particular.  The first was the Department's anti-bullying procedures which date from 2013 and which he believes should be updated.  I agree with him.  Second, the Youth Mental Health Pathfinder Project commenced five years ago but has not been implemented.  I want to give him the opportunity to expand on those a little bit and tell us how important they are for the work of this committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021050400002#K00600","speaker":"1617"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620082800,"counter":215,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  The anti-bullying procedures came into place and they were the first ones ever in place for the Department of Education.  Coincidentally, our office carried out a big consultation with children just prior to that.  We chatted to over 300 children on what they thought about bullying and what they wanted.  They were always clear that they wanted the relationship between the bully and the victim to be worked on.  They did not call it restorative justice but that is the concept the children had, as well as and compassion for the other person, because they know they have to meet that child in the street again and unless the child is fixed and worked on, there is no point doing it.  A lot of that stuff fed into the policy procedures the Department made up.  It is past time to revisit it.  There are many things changing in our lives.  Smart technology alone has changed everything completely and schools and the way they educate has changed.  That is hugely important.<\/p> <p>  The vast information mine and the data that is out there from every school around bullying could be phenomenally useful for us as we look for evidence-based progress.  There are fabulous schools out there doing a brilliant job on bullying, changing the culture, increasing self-esteem and encouraging diversity.  Encouraging diversity and children's rights in a school eliminates many opportunities and reasons for bullying.  We could gain a lot of information from individual schools.  <\/p> <p>  On the Youth Mental Health Pathfinder Project, it essentially means officers from the Departments of Education, Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and Health would work in the same office to streamline the process of sending a child for mental health support.  If a teacher says he or she needs a child to be referred, it goes through the GP, the teacher is kept in the loop and the education system pays for some degree of mental health support.  That reduces the input from the Department of Health.  All of those things become streamlined and much easier.  It has been budgeted for four or five years in a row but has never happened because they cannot determine who will take the final budget Vote and which Department has the final responsibility.  That is a cop-out that is causing a lot of harm and hurt for our children.<\/p><p>If the three Departments are going to work together there needs to be a joint budget and some way to streamline the process.

We have all sat on boards of management and played a role on that side of things in terms of education.<\/p> <p>  I might know the answer to my question, but I will ask it anyway.  How effective are the anti-bullying procedures or arrangements currently in place in schools?  <\/p> <p>  My second question follows on from that.  I think I know the answer having listened to the earlier responses.  Has a database been compiled on the number of bullying incidents or allegations of bullying in various education settings over the years ?  Are there data on whether the allegations were successfully resolved or remain unresolved or outstanding or how have they been dealt with?<\/p> <p>  I ask this because in Northern Ireland a new anti-bullying law will be introduced in September whereby schools will account for those types of incidents and the motivation behind them.  It would be interesting if we had a similar arrangement here or if it was something we could introduce.<\/p> <p>  My next question concerns bullying in schools.  Many instances of bullying might happen off campus or outside a school setting.  That created difficulties for principals and boards of management in the past because they would have said it was somebody else's issue.  All of these bullying incidents inevitably find their way into school settings one way or another, through modern technology, people being friendly with other groups and so on.  What is the experience of the witnesses in how boards of management deal with bullying that is happening off campus?  Could they play a greater role in dealing with those types of issues?<\/p> <p>  I refer to data on the number of potential suicides caused by bullying in our schools.

From my point of view, the clear indication that there has not been data collection is that the UN committee, as of November 2020, has asked for the State to give it disaggregated data on the cases of bullying and harassment in schools and, in a wider sense, the evidence and disaggregated data relating to child victims of violence, sexual exploitation and bullying in general outside of the school setting.  We are trying to get that data.  The UN is not happy with the type of data that have been gathered so far.<\/p> <p>  As regards the database on the number of instances of bullying, some of the other witnesses may be able to address that point.  The Deputy is correct that off-site bullying is an issue.  Ten years ago, before I worked in the Ombudsman for Children's Office, I worked as a psychologist.  I remember many principals said there was a separation and they could not deal with such bullying.  I must acknowledge that most principals are now willing to take that on board because it is part of what children experience.  It is part of their lifestyle and it happens all the time.  The best place to deal with that is within a school setting. <\/p> <p>  There is a system in place that tends to look for accountability as opposed to moving towards the personal and compassionate and asking why something is happening and how it can be prevented.  Again, we need to keep pushing for a culture change that allows for the sharing of diversity and the promotion of respect for the self and each other.  That would carry through regardless of whether the setting is online, offline, inside or outside of school, in sports clubs or any other setting.  <\/p> <p>  Deputy Conway-Walsh referred to the whole-of-community effect, which will be crucial so that everybody has the same set of values and culture.

I often hear comments to the effect that something was dealt with in senior infants, but it was never resolved.  We can lean on those examples.  I would like to see more outcome-focused results about how something was resolved rather than whether it was addressed.  There is a question of whether something is a tick-box exercise.<\/p> <p>  People ask me all the time whether a school is good or bad.  There could be a wonderful school with a third year group that is particularly toxic.  That involves cultures within cultures.  How do we address that?

In the context of the rough and tumble of family life or whatever, parents might be a little wary or shy of contacting the school about their son or daughter being bullied.

The issue is that as well as being very positive, the culture of a school can also hide harm in plain sight.  Ms O'Malley pointed out that issues relating to gender, sexuality and sexual assault are accepted as subjects for locker room talk or as the way things are.  There is often much more emphasis in schools on academics than there is on students' well-being.  We have to address the bad cultures before we start encouraging the good ones.  First, we must identify where the culture is not good enough.  There may be a culture of dismissal, avoidance and brushing things under the carpet when a bullying issue arises because it might affect the reputation of the school or whatever it might be.<\/p> <p>  We talk about parents being the solution and not always the problem.  It is often the passive parent, not the argumentative parent, whose child is disenfranchised in the ways we have been discussing.  The parent may not feel able to go to the school.  Parents might say they have brought an issue up twice, for instance, and nothing happened.  The parent who has a path worn to the school principal's office is actively trying to manage something.  It is when the parent has never approached the school, or perhaps did so once through a telephone call, that there is nobody advocating for the child.  We should encourage parents to not let these matters go.  Just because one has tried and it has not worked does not mean one should not keep trying.  As I said in my opening statement, these issues have to reach a resolution.  It is not good enough just to say that one tried but it is still happening.  It is not about having a zero-tolerance culture but, rather, a culture that has a value system whereby bullying and mistreatment are not accepted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021050400002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Colman Noctor"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620082800,"counter":230,"content":"<p>I agree with what Dr. Noctor said.  When it comes to the culture around bullying, it starts with the school.  We have not spoken yet about situations where there is a culture of bullying behaviour within staffrooms.  My background is in primary school teaching and I know, as many members will know, that such a culture can, unfortunately, be part of schools.  That is an important point when looking at changing cultures.  In a school I worked in at one time as a student, there was a notice saying that no parents were permitted beyond that point.  Fortunately, that was a long time ago.  It is about making schools a place where respect is a core value and where respect is lived, not just through having anti-bullying policies but in the way teachers are treated by the principal and how parents are treated by the principal and board of management.  It is a whole culture shift.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of CBT, like Dr. Muldoon and, I assume, the other guests, I submitted a detailed document to the committee.  I did not have time in the three minutes allocated for my opening statement to draw more on that issue.  CBT involves looking at and responding to our feelings, thoughts, beliefs and actions.  Parents may feel disenfranchised and may believe they will not be listened to.

That changes the way children see each other, especially if it is started early, and it takes away a lot of the sting that often creates the othering of certain individuals.  It is about promoting respect and rights.  Children's rights are one of the issues on which we intend to focus.  In Wales, children's rights have been put into the education curriculum.  It is a way of acknowledging that everybody has a right to be respected and everybody is equal.  That should be taught in schools.<\/p> <p>  On the role of parents in changing the culture of a school, I agree with Dr. Noctor that parents are often not able to push forward.  That is why we should legislate for a student-parent charter, which will, in effect, enable a coming together of the whole school community to agree what the plan is for a school and what its culture should be.  That will allow the children in junior infants as well as the children in sixth class to say, for example, that they want more gardening, mechanics or music, and parents can have an input into that as well.  This changes the focuses so that it is not always about wanting everybody to get As across the board.  It allows the whole school community to integrate and it generates a statutory obligation to produce an annual report on whether those targets were reached.  It becomes a whole-community engagement and that is when the culture starts to change.  Bullying and how it is dealt with could be one of the topics included in the charter, as agreed by the whole school community.  It would be a hugely important step forward if we can get that across the line legislatively.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021050400002#M00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Muldoon"},{"type":"speech","time":1620082800,"counter":232,"content":"<p>Does Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh want to come back in?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021050400002#M00500","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speech","time":1620082800,"counter":233,"content":"<p>I am being a bit cheeky.

I look forward to us meeting in person in a room in the not-too-distance future so we can have a more detailed interaction on some of these issues.  Given the large number of items discussed at the Foreign Affairs Council since we last met in October, and at the Security Council since January, I will only address selected issues in my opening remarks but, of course, I will be happy to answer any questions you have.<\/p> <p>  We had a busy first four months on the UN Security Council since joining in January.  From rapidly evolving crises in Myanmar and Ethiopia to the challenging situations in Syria, Yemen, Libya and the Middle East peace process, we have been actively engaged bringing our views and perspectives, and seeking to make a difference.  The same goes for thematic issues such as climate and security, women, peace and security, and hunger and conflict, all of which Ireland is centrally involved in.  That is what we are elected to do, of course.<\/p> <p>  As part of our work as Council co-penholder on the humanitarian situation in Syria, I visited Turkey in January.  I saw first-hand the vital role which the UN authorised cross-border humanitarian assistance operation plays in meeting the needs of Syrians, particularly in the province of Idlib.  I also discussed wider regional issues with the Turkish Foreign Minister.  We have a significant task ahead of us, as in Ireland, in the next few months as we prepare for the renewal of the mandate for that border-crossing operation.<\/p><p> Some 2.7 million vulnerable Syrians in the Idlib area are reliant, almost solely, on the humanitarian aid that comes through what is called the Bab al-Hawa crossing from Turkey into Syria.  It is the only international crossing into Syria left open at the moment.  This matter is a top priority for me and my Department.  Put simply, if we cannot keep that crossing open, millions of people, most of them children, will be deeply impacted on a humanitarian level.  They will not be able to get consistent and structured aid, predominantly through UN aid agencies which will not be able to continue should that mandate not be maintained.  If committee members have questions on this matter, I will happily talk to them about why it is difficult to keep that crossing open.<\/p><p> In the context of our role as UN Security Council facilitator on the Iran nuclear agreement, last month I visited Iran to discuss the joint comprehensive plan of action, JCPOA, with President Hassan Rouhani and Minister of Foreign Affairs Mohammad Javad Zarif.  I encouraged Mr. Zarif to come to the table with the JCPOA participants and start serious discussions on how to get the agreement back on track, including a suggestion that he consider proximity talks.  Three weeks after my visit, Iran accepted an invitation, I am glad to say, from the EU for proximity talks in Vienna.  There is some way to go but I am encouraged by the progress to date.  I have also been clear, however, that Iran's recent proliferation activities are deeply concerning.  I have called on Iran to comply with its obligations under the JCPOA.<\/p><p> The Middle East peace process continues to be a priority for Ireland.  We have been actively engaged at both the Foreign Affairs Council, FAC, and the UN Security Council.  At the quarterly open debate on the Middle East peace process, MEPP, at the UN Security Council in January, I underlined my clear view that a two-state solution is the only basis for a just and lasting peace.  In April, Ireland delivered a statement on the MEPP on behalf of five current and recent EU members on the UN Security Council.  We encouraged the completion of free, fair and inclusive elections across the occupied Palestinian territory, including east Jerusalem, and called on Israel to facilitate elections and international monitoring.  I am very disappointed by the decision taken on 29 April to postpone the elections.  I encourage the Palestinian National Authority to set a new date immediately and I urge Israel to co-operate in facilitating voting, including in east Jerusalem.  In fact, I spoke last Thursday to the Palestinian Foreign Affairs Minister, Riyad al-Maliki, which, unfortunately, was the day before this decision was made.<\/p><p> Since I last met with the committee, the process to end the brutal civil war in Libya has moved remarkably quickly.  I welcome the adoption in April of the UN Security Council resolution supporting a new Libyan ceasefire monitoring mechanism.  The EU has effectively used the tool of sanctions to support this progress.  We have rewarded constructive engagement by easing sanctions.  We have expedited sanctions against those who defied the UN arms embargo and are accused of mass killings.  The EU's Operation Irini continues to play an important role in upholding the UN arms embargo and, as the committee knows, three Defence Forces personnel are based in the operation's headquarters.  The members of this committee share a sense of pride in our Defence Forces and their unbroken record of contribution to UN peacekeeping.  We are using the day-to-day experiences of our Defence Forces personnel to seek to improve peacekeeping mandates as they come forward for renewal at the UN Security Council.<\/p><p> As regards Africa and Asia, Ireland has strong ties in Africa and we have been working closely with our African partners on the UN Security Council.  Since we last met, conflict has broken out in the Tigray region of Ethiopia.  More than five months on, the humanitarian situation there remains dire.  There are credible and harrowing reports of widespread sexual violence against women and girls.  Such violence is effectively being used as a tool of war.  These atrocities must end and the perpetrators must be held to account.  Ireland has been to the fore in efforts to address the situation in both the Foreign Affairs Council and the UN Security Council.  In April we led the negotiation of the UN Security Council press statement, which was its first statement on the crisis.  We will continue to use our Security Council membership to highlight the need to protect civilians and ensure unfettered humanitarian access into the Tigray region.<\/p><p>We are also using our influence to try to make sure Eritrean troops leave that region.  They should not be there.<\/p><p> The instigation of a military coup in Myanmar, invoking serious violence and ongoing repression, is another major development of concern since our last meeting.  This crisis has been discussed at the Foreign Affairs Council, FAC, on three occasions.  EU sanctions have been adopted against individuals and economic entities, and I welcome that the UN Security Council has maintained a united stance, although many would like us to go further.<\/p><p> On human rights and sanctions, promoting human rights is a priority for Ireland in terms of our UN Security Council term and ongoing contribution to EU policy formation at the FAC.  In December, the FAC established the EU global human rights sanction regime .  This regime seeks to target serious human rights violations and abuses wherever they may occur.  To date, we have agreed to impose sanctions on 15 individuals and entities from six countries.<\/p><p> Sanctions have been just one element of the EU response to a series of recent destabilising developments in its eastern and southern neighbourhoods.  The EU's relationship with Russia has been discussed on multiple occasions in recent months at the FAC.  We have seen little indication of a willingness on the part of Russia to improve relations with the EU, unfortunately.  Our extensive FAC discussion in February focused on the High Representative's visit to Moscow, and we imposed sanctions on those responsible for the persecution of Alexei Navalny.<\/p><p> We have agreed that progress in addressing the situation in Ukraine remains a key condition for any substantial change in EU-Russia relations.  The FAC met with the Ukrainian foreign minister in April and I underlined our full support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.<\/p><p> The FAC considered EU-Turkey relations in March.  During this discussion and during my visit to Turkey, I made clear that Ireland is in favour of developing a more stable EU-Turkey relationship and that this is dependent on Turkish behaviour.  Turkey has taken a number of steps which run counter to its obligations, including withdrawal from the Istanbul Convention.  For real progress to occur, Turkey will need to begin to address its human rights situation for real.<\/p><p> Since I last met with this committee, President Joe Biden has been inaugurated.  The US elections and transatlantic relations have been discussed at the FAC four times since we met and we held a videoconference meeting with Secretary of State Blinken.  The EU is committed to strengthening the relationship, working together on foreign policy priorities, strengthening multilateralism and, of course, tackling climate change.<\/p><p> I thank the committee members for their continued engagement on a broad range of foreign policy issues.  I will conclude by saying that Ireland will hold the presidency of the Security Council in September.  This will be an important opportunity to highlight particular issues and themes, in keeping with the priorities for our term.  Of course, planning is well under way for that.  I look forward to the members' comments and questions and, as I said at the start, I particularly look forward to being able to meet in person and perhaps more regularly than we have been able to over recent months, for obvious reasons.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021050400002#A00700","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620082800,"counter":258,"content":"<p>Our meeting must conclude in advance of the 11.30 a.m. Cabinet meeting, so I will go straight into the questions and answers session.

I wish to raise the issue of Syrian detainees.  The committee met Ms Ghufran Khoulani last Thursday.  She told a very harrowing personal story of her three brothers who were detained, tortured and ultimately murdered in Syria.  It is believed that tens of thousands of Syrians remain detained and their fate is unknown.  This committee undertook to bring the matter to the Minister's attention as a high priority and to investigate the possibility of raising it as at the UN Security Council.  <\/p><p> I thank the Minister for his update on Tigray and commend him, his Department and the staff in New York on the recent resolution passed by the UN Security Council, which is very significant.  It is a credit to this country that we have raised the ongoing issue of Tigray at Security Council level and got that resolution passed.  We have had a very special relationship with Ethiopia down through the decades and perhaps have more influence than most with the Ethiopian Government so it is laudable that we have taken that issue to the highest stage.  Could the Minister comment on what he thinks the next steps will be with regard to that situation?  <\/p><p> My colleague, Deputy Costello, submitted a question to the Minister, which the Minister acknowledged, on Western Sahara and ongoing human rights abuses as identified by Amnesty International and others.

There are a lot of areas on which we could and should touch so I will try to be brief because I want to cover a number of areas.  In his opening statement, the Minister referred to promoting human rights and how human rights are a priority for us.  In November 2020, the European Council adopted the EU's action plan on human rights and democracy.  It says that when there are human rights violations and abuses worldwide, we will take action regardless of where they are.  Has the Minister read the Human Rights Watch report on Palestine that was published last week because it makes for damning reading?  It finds that Israel has committed the crimes against humanity of apartheid and persecution as defined under the 1973 International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid and the 1998 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.  I seek the Minister's comments on that report.  Another independent human rights organisation has stated that Israeli authorities have demolished 58 Palestinian structures and have approved plans for the construction of nearly 5,000 settler units in occupied East Jerusalem since the beginning of the year.  A number of human rights organisations are speaking about the actions of Israel on the ground in Palestine.  We also know that even overnight, Israeli forces raided the homes of Palestinians in Sheikh Jarrah in East Jerusalem, used tear gas and arrested many young people.  These families are being forced out of their homes on Thursday to make way for Jewish settlers to take over.<\/p><p>A significant number of human rights abuses have taken place, which, in my view, amount to ethnic cleansing.  Yet the Government's response seems to reward Israel and we see that by the opening of IDA offices in Israel.  As opposed to taking definitive action against Israel, we seem to be rewarding it.  There seems to be a level of double standards.  Does the Minister view that as ethnic cleansing?  Will he comment on the gross human rights abuses that are happening on the ground?  Ireland will take over the presidency of the Security Council in September.  Will we use the opportunity of our presidency to invite a Palestinian speaker to address Security Council members on the issue of Israeli treatment of Palestinian children and its failures to comply with its obligations as a signatory to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child?  <\/p><p> The Minister covered the issue of Tigray.  There are major concerns regarding Tigray, the involvement of Eritrea and the wholesale slaughter of innocent people.  We see the mass destruction of aid and the burning of villages.  I note the statement made by the Security Council.  Ireland can play a leading role given our strong links with Ethiopia.  While the Minister mentioned the issue, we need to do more.  We need to use our influence to address the appalling situation in Tigray.<\/p><p> We have received a number of briefing notes from the Minister and his Department on the situation in Yemen and the massive humanitarian crisis unfolding before our eyes in a conflict that has been largely forgotten by the international community.  What definitive actions are being taken by the international community?  On the one hand, we see statements issued condemning what is happening there and, on the other, we see many European and foreign countries providing arms to the Saudi Arabian regime.  Would the Minister and the Department support an international arms embargo to help bring that dire situation in Yemen to an end?<\/p><p> Syria was mentioned.  The situation there continues to be extremely concerning.  The Minister touched on the issue of Idlib, which is worrying, but I wish to raise the broader picture of more than 13.4 million people in all areas of Syria relying on humanitarian aid.  What is the Government's view on the unilateral sanctions on Syria, which are adding to the humanitarian crisis?  What action is being taken against Turkey, which is using water as a weapon of war in restricting the water flow of the River Euphrates into Syria?  That is impeding the generation of electricity and having serious consequences for irrigation and food production.  It has been reported there have been up to a dozen attacks on fuel being imported into Syria predominantly from Iran and it is suggested those attacks are coming from Israel.  I suggest there is piracy on the high seas and, as a result, ordinary people in Syria are having to live with the dire consequences of all of that.<\/p><p>I wish to raise two more issues.  This year marks the 60th anniversary of the blockade on Cuba.  Since 1992, the UN General Assembly has voted overwhelmingly for the US to end its policy of economic aggression against Cuba.  On 23 June, the UN General Assembly will again consider a resolution to put an end to the blockade on Cuba.<\/p><p>It is time to end that illegal blockade.  What are the Government's views on this?  Does the Minister think that there is an opportunity, with a new US President, even though the new Administration stated that Cuba is not a priority for it, to resolve this?  Can the UN and the Government use their influence to pressurise the US Administration to end the blockade of Cuba?<\/p><p> The final issue I want to raise is that of  trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights,TRIPS.  The WTO met on Friday.  There is a significant issue that is, unfortunately, playing out before our eyes in India.  It is only the tip of the iceberg.  In Thailand and Myanmar, cases of Covid are on the increase.  The Government did lend some welcome assistance, although, in my view, it was tokenistic, to India, helping out with oxygen supplies.  The real issue involved is the TRIPS waiver which needs to be introduced and implemented.  Until everyone is vaccinated, we will not be out of the Covid crisis.  The committee has done much work on intellectual property rights and the pharmaceutical companies that have developed and produced vaccines using substantial amounts of taxpayers' money.  Now is the time to sign up to a TRIPS waiver.  It is also time for the Government to sign up to the Covid-19 technology access pool, CTAP.  What are the views of the Government on this?  The European Commission said now is not the time for a TRIPS waiver or to address the issue of intellectual property rights.  When is the time?  There are 20 million cases of Covid in India and we see bodies being burned on the streets there.  If now is not the time for a TRIPS waiver, when is?  We can send over more oxygen supplies, which is welcome, but, in real terms, it is tokenistic.  The major issue is to ensure people have access to a Covid vaccine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021050400002#D00200","speaker":"1625","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620082800,"counter":264,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.  There is a great appreciation on the part of all parties and none of the high profile he maintains internationally and how proactive he is on all of these issues.<\/p> <p>  In Syria, 90% of the population is in poverty, with 13.4 million people in need of humanitarian aid.  After ten years of civil war, it is a horror story.  Will the Minister elaborate on getting access to aid for Syria at the Bab al-Hawa border crossing?  There is a huge crisis around Idlib and access to aid there is critical.  How confident is the Minister that we can maintain access in that area?<\/p> <p>  The issue of sanctions is a perennial one.  Over the years, right back to South Africa and apartheid, we have always discussed who they hurt.  Given that Assad has clearly won the war at this stage and in view of the fact that sanctions are hurting ordinary people, does the Minister think that now is the time to look at their removal and how might that impact the situation?<\/p> <p>  There are disturbing reports from Denmark and Lebanon about returning refugees to Syria on the basis that there is calm there.  From the Minister's presentation, however, it is clear that it is widely accepted that there is not the level of calm there that one could send people back in any involuntary way.<\/p><p>I would like the Minister to comment on the return of the refugees.  I am surprised by Denmark but I would like a comment on that.  The fact that we are all in the EU and friends together does not mean we should fail to criticise them for what is wrong.  Similarly, I believe there is a major effort to push back refugees from Lebanon.<\/p><p> Regarding Palestine, I would like the Minister to comment on the settlements and the demolitions.  My understanding is that the settlements and the demolitions are threatening the two-state solution, which we all aspire to and which the Minister rightly stated as an ambition in his presentation.  Could he comment on the extent that is the case?  Is he optimistic that through the use of diplomacy, our role on the UN council, etc., we can achieve anything in halting the illegal settlements, the demolition and, of course, the human rights abuses?<\/p><p> It is extraordinary that the elections are postponed.  Is that because of East Jerusalem and is it the specific fault for the postponing of the elections with Israel in East Jerusalem?  Is internal politics among the Palestinians a factor?  The fact that there was a difficulty with East Jerusalem people voting is a horror.<\/p><p> On vaccinations, I understand Israel has virtually vaccinated its own population.  It had been negligent with vaccinations to Palestine.  Covid-19 Vaccines Global Access, COVAX, had been coming in there, but how is the vaccination situation?<\/p><p> The Minister made a point about the sexual violence in Tigray.  It is a horror, almost, as he said, on an industrial scale.  It is almost as if it is a policy, which is dreadful, or a military option.  I would like him to comment on the Eritreans.  While it is officially said that they have gone, it is clear that they have not.  I understood that they were masking going in - using other uniforms and camouflaging their presence.  Could the Minister comment on the Eritreans getting out of Tigray and being removed from there, how optimistic he is and whether we can do anything practical about that in the short term?<\/p><p> Moving to Ukraine, I would like the Minister to comment on the situation in Donbas.  I understand the military build-up around Ukraine has been softened down and moved, but is he confident that the position is stabilising?  Is there any risk that there is deliberately stirred-up disturbance in Donbas?  What is his assessment?<\/p><p> I understand the breakdown of Navalny's apparatus or support base and the arrests but I would like the Minister's comment on both his personal situation and on the wider arrests of his people.<\/p><p>I had people on to me recently, including somebody known to many here.  I presume, if he was on to me, he has been on to all of the members of the committee.  It is a local agency dealing with Belarus.  Belarus remains one of the great horror stories of contemporary times.  I would like the Minister's comment on where we are at there.<\/p><p> Could President Biden's attitude to Saudi Arabia make a difference to Yemen?  Is the UK still providing arms to Saudi Arabia?  If so, and I am aware they are outside of our control to a degree, can anything be done about that?  Generally, the supply of arms is a major factor in the trouble there and I would be interested in the Minister's beliefs around what difference President Biden might make there.<\/p><p> Lastly, I agree with the previous speaker, Deputy Brady, regarding the crisis in India.  I would like the Minister to comment on what we are exactly doing, where he sees it going and what more we could do.  It is a very interesting point Deputy Brady raised about intellectual property rights, which are often talked about now.  There is an argument that if we make the vaccinations available and remove those rights that would be a disincentive.  I would like the Minister to comment on that.  Surely there is a compelling case to get vaccines to India, and to deal with the crisis there.<\/p><p> I thank the Chair for the opportunity and thank the Minister for being with us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021050400002#F00200","speaker":"1692","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620082800,"counter":266,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.

If I miss something, any member who wants to come back can do so, or if they want to give me a call after this meeting, I will happily talk through any of the issues they have that have not been fully addressed.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Leddin raised the issue of Syrian detainees.  I had a good conversation with Geir O. Pedersen, who is the UN special envoy for Syria on this and a whole range of other issues.  UN Resolution 2254, which has essentially been agreed by all member states of the UN Security Council, is the template to move forward.  It is about trying to put in place an acceptable political structure to have elections that would be free and fair and to look at the release of detainees, most of whom have been detained arbitrarily.  The truth is we have been making no progress on that for a long time.  We are potentially likely to see some new thinking and initiatives coming from the UN in trying to move some form of process forward.  Any process needs to involve the release of detainees who have been imprisoned, in the vast majority of cases with no charge at all.  They are simply seen as enemies of the Government and therefore they have been detained and in some cases tortured.<\/p> <p>  If there are individual cases the Deputy wants me to raise at UN level, he should send them onto me and we will try to find the right forum in which to raise those detentions and the fears people's families have on what has happened to many of their loved ones in detention.  If there is to be a political process to move forward in Syria, it has to involve one of the things that the Assad regime can do, and the international community needs to assist on it doing, namely, the release of many thousands of people who have been arbitrarily detained with no judicial system or legal protections.  That is what happens when there is a decade of war when no rules apply, which is what we have seen across Syria.<\/p> <p>  I will happily continue to update the committee on Syria because it will be an evolving issue, whether it is on access to humanitarian assistance, detainees, trying to move a political process forward, the safe return of refugees when they want to return and can safely do so, or how the EU engages in the reconstruction of Syria at some point in the future and what conditions are required for that to be facilitated.  We are spending hundreds of millions of euro on humanitarian assistance to people in Syria but we are not spending the kind of money that needs to be spent on rebuilding infrastructure in that country in a post-war situation because of the unwillingness of the Assad regime to move ahead on the basis of the UN resolution.  That is something we will need to follow closely and I would like Ireland to be involved in it, particularly on the humanitarian side and in the safe return of refugees, because we have some credibility in that space.<\/p> <p>  A number of other members mentioned the issue of the Bab al-Hawa crossing, which I visited.  There are hundreds of trucks per day crossing into Syria from Turkey, full of food, tents, medicines, clothes, blankets and the basic stuff on which families living in large-scale refugee camps, most of them tented villages, towns or cities in their scale, rely daily and weekly.<\/p><p>There is much tension around that crossing because Russia, Iran and the Assad regime see it as a crossing they do not trust with regard to supplies coming in to feed the resistance to the Assad regime in Idlib province, which is where most resistance still is.  There is a political element to this debate.  If we cannot find a way before the end of June to extend the resolution that allows for that crossing to be formally maintained under UN supervision and control, it will be closed and instead we will be relying on a far less transparent and less reliable series of crossings into Idlib from Turkey, with much tension and mass movement of people as a result.<\/p><p> Ireland is immersed in this along with Norway.  We are co-penholders for humanitarian assistance going in to Syria.  In simple terms, we have to find a way to persuade Russia to support the maintenance of that crossing, which is not straightforward, given the history of different perspectives about Syria and a ten-year war there.  We will leave no stone unturned in trying to ensure that crossing stays open.  It is currently supplying almost 3 million people.  It really is an enormous responsibility.<\/p><p> A number of members asked about Tigray.  We have probably been the most vocal country in the EU and the UN on this issue.  That is arguably because we are quite close to Ethiopia.  My political adviser is a former ambassador to Ethiopia.  We have really good knowledge about Ethiopia in the Department.  The Ethiopian Government is a partner for Ireland and has been for many years.  Our largest development programme is in Ethiopia.  We had staff in Tigray.  We had a really good agricultural project there.  I visited it as Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine nine or ten years ago.  This is a country we know well.  That is why Ireland has been so exercised by what has been happening there.  It has been brutal.  There has been much evidence to suggest breaches in humanitarian law and international law.  There is increasing evidence now of sexual violence against local populations of women and children by soldiers and paramilitary groups.  It is awful.  That is why we have contributed to gaining traction for an international response.<\/p><p> The culmination of that so far has been a statement at the UN Security Council that everybody signed up to, which is quite unusual at the Security Council.  We would have gone further if we did not have to get consensus across all of the member states, including the African three and the five permanent members.  We still got a strong press statement calling for full, unfettered humanitarian access to all parts of Tigray and strong reference to sexual violence and the need for a credible international investigation, which is now moving ahead under the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, OHCHR, working with the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission.  We are satisfied that investigation will be on the ground soon.<\/p><p> Having said that, there are still real problems.  We did not manage to get anything about Eritrean troops into the statement.  We could not get agreement on that, unfortunately.  Even though there is a commitment from Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed Ali and from the Eritrean side that troops will leave Tigray, we have not seen any evidence of that on the ground yet.  There is continuing tension and violence in that region that we, as a country that cares about Ethiopia, need to, and will continue to, shine a light on.<\/p><p>I hope we can make real progress on that.  The USA has become much more exercised about the Ethiopian issue in recent weeks, which has changed the tone of the debate in the Security Council in many ways.  It has added real impetus to the need for change and has put pressure on everybody, which is welcome indeed.<\/p><p> The Security Council held closed consultations about Western Sahara on 21 April.  Ireland made clear its long-standing position and urged de-escalation.  Our ambassador to the UN separately met with Colin Stewart, the head of the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara, MINURSO, about the mission's work and the challenges faced in implementation of its mandate.  I have made clear that negotiations must resume under UN auspices and that the parties should approach these negotiations without pre-conditions.  I spoke to the Moroccan foreign minister about this last week.  Ireland will continue to press for a new UN envoy to be appointed soon.  It has gone for far too long without a UN special envoy.  We will engage where we can be of most assistance to the UN-led process, ahead of the renewal of MINURSO's mandate on 30 October this year.  Our position on Western Sahara has not changed.  It has been consistent for a long time.  We have two Defence Forces personnel in Western Sahara.  They will probably not stay there indefinitely but I reassure the committee that Ireland's interest will remain consistent and strong.<\/p><p> Deputy Brady raised the Human Rights Watch report.  The official position on this is that Human Rights Watch is certainly a respected NGO and I value the role that it and other civil society organisations play.  I have been forthright in expressing my concerns regarding Israeli occupation of Palestine.  Ireland's position on this will continue to be based on international law, Israel's obligations as the occupying power under the Fourth Geneva Convention and the relevant resolutions of the UN Security Council that have been passed.  Our approach is rooted in the illegality of Israel's occupation and the right of Palestinians to self-determination.  The restrictions that are imposed on Palestinians undermine the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, a right which is at the heart of a two-state solution, which we continue to advocate for and insist upon as the only viable way forward.  Ireland remains committed to a two-state solution and will continue to work with partners to revive a political process in line with international law, which ensures equal rights and is acceptable to both sides.<\/p><p> I note the publication of this report and its contents, which my officials are reviewing in detail.  I will happily come back to the Deputy again about that report.  It is a lengthy and detailed report and our legal team is looking at it at the moment.  Anything that we describe as apartheid, or any other such term, has to be consistent with definitions under international law.  For us to be credible, we need to make sure that we examine that report fully before I make any determination about the terms that are used in it.  I am on the record on many occasions about settlements, their existence and expansion, what is happening in East Jerusalem and the deliberate actions of an Israeli Government that make a two-state solution more and more difficult to achieve as settlements continue to expand and we see more frequent demolitions in parts of the West Bank.<\/p><p>Perhaps most concerning, we have seen an unacceptable series of announcements around settlement expansion and moving ahead with building contracts in East Jerusalem and areas in close proximity to it.  I have probably been one of the most vocal EU ministers on this issue in recent months along with perhaps the minister from Luxembourg.  I will continue to be vocal at UN and EU level.  Essentially, we want a new round of real talks and consultations where there is equality of esteem between both sides and where a two-state solution can be progressed.  It certainly would have been helpful in terms of the mandate for the Palestinian Authority if elections had gone ahead this month because there have been no elections across the Palestinian territories for 15 years.  I spoke to the Palestinian foreign minister, Dr. Ryad Al Malki, last week about this.  Unfortunately, they have decided that they cannot proceed at this time because of the East Jerusalem issue.  This is regrettable but I have issued a statement on that to say that we would like to see a new date for elections as soon as possible.  We will do everything we can to work with the international community and the Israeli Government, which has not been fully formed after the election, to try to ensure that elections for Palestinians in East Jerusalem can be facilitated.  <\/p><p> I hope I can use the Irish presidency in September in respect of the Middle East peace process and the Israeli-Palestinian issue.  Ireland has been a very strong and consistent voice in this space and I would like us to ensure that at some point during our presidency from September, we can use that profile to be able to create some positive traction in this space, which we have not had for quite a number of years.  I dealt with the issue of Tigray but if there are more questions on it, members can certainly come back to me.  <\/p><p> I have spoken on a number of occasions to Martin Griffiths, who is the UN special envoy on Yemen.  He is an incredibly patient man and is doing everything he possibly can to try to get a ceasefire to stick and to move towards a political process that can guarantee that this ceasefire lasts but it has been a really difficult process.  Just when we think we are almost there and he injects some optimism at UN level, there is a setback.  When I was in Tehran, I spoke repeatedly to him because we were trying to use that visit not only in the context of the joint comprehensive plan of action but also to try to ensure that Iran would use whatever influence it has over the Houthis in Yemen to ensure that a ceasefire would happen and take hold.  There is ongoing fighting around the Marib region, winch is a particular focal point of concern, and there are broader concerns as well that are leading to a lot of humanitarian tragedy and, quite frankly, misery throughout Yemen that the international community needs to address.  We will remain vocal on that issue.  There is no consensus at EU level on an arms embargo on Saudi Arabia or any member of the coalition that has been involved on one side of the Yemen conflict.  Such decisions require the agreement of everybody.  Irish efforts are concentrated on ensuring the effective implementation of agreements to which member states have signed up.  This includes export controlled regimes, including the EU's common position on arms exports and the implementation of the 2014 arms trade treaty.  This has been signed and ratified by all member states and should be honoured.  These obligations require states to assess the potential that arms exports could be used to commit or facilitate serious violations of international humanitarian or human rights law and consider measures to mitigate the risk of these violations.<\/p><p> The EU has effective measures in place to monitor the trade of arms and other dual-use goods to ensure that the highest standards of international arms control are met and to tackle the illicit trade in arms.  We need to ensure these measures are being implemented and that is the focus of our engagement on the issue.  Several arms exporters in the EU have stated they will not export arms to Saudi Arabia until there is a permanent ceasefire in Yemen.  That is progress in this space and it is important to state that.  The change of Administration in the US has put a significant amount of pressure on Saudi Arabia in respect of Yemen.  In my view, there is certainly a political willingness in Saudi Arabia with regard to a ceasefire and a political process.  That is certainly my understanding from the conversations I have had with the deputy foreign minister of Saudi Arabia.<\/p><p> As regards Syria and the role of Turkey, if one looks at the Astana process, which is probably the most effective process in terms of finding a way forward in Syria, the roles of Turkey, Iran, Russia, the US and the EU are all relevant here.  All the issues in this context, whether it is humanitarian access, reconstruction, ongoing conflict or the future of the Assad regime, are interconnected and that is why, effectively, an understanding between Turkey and Russia is probably the most important element to the challenge we have here in terms of keeping the humanitarian access point at Bab al-Hawa open in the coming weeks.<\/p><p> On Cuba, I can be clear that we do not support the ongoing blockade of Cuba.  Ireland has been and will continue to be a committed supporter of Cuba's UN General Assembly resolutions calling for an end to the US embargo.  The injustice and severity of the US embargo is something that needs to be highlighted.  We have raised that issue both with the US and within the UN.  We believe these measures serve no constructive purpose and object to unilaterally imposed measures that impede economic and commercial relations of EU member states with Cuba.  I think we are pretty clear on that.<\/p><p> On the issue of TRIPS and the WTO, I caution members against assuming that a simplistic solution here will solve all problems.  I have a significant amount of sympathy for the argument that states we cannot allow intellectual property rights here to prevent the manufacturing of safe vaccines that can save people's lives.  The tragedy we are seeing unfold in India obviously reinforces that point.  As was stated, India is not going to be the only country facing extraordinarily traumatic scenes on its streets and elsewhere.  There other densely populated countries that have health systems which are probably far weaker than that of India, so we are likely to see aggressive strains of this virus wreaking the kind of havoc we are currently seeing in India in other parts of the world.  We have to find a way of significantly ramping up manufacturing capacity beyond the sites that are currently manufacturing, whether those sites are producing the Pfizer, Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson, Moderna, AstraZeneca or Sputnik vaccine or any other vaccine.  The intellectual property argument is one element of that.  Last week, for example, Moderna issued a statement indicating that it will effectively share its intellectual property in terms of the ingredients of its vaccine.<\/p><p>More than that, it wants to partner with sites and companies that have the capacity to safely manufacture huge volumes of vaccine.  That is part of the issue.  I do not think that by simply removing intellectual property protections we will automatically see a dramatic increase in the manufacturing and production of safe vaccines overnight.  We need these pharmaceutical giants to partner with countries like India and parts of the world such as South America, Latin America and other parts of Asia to build capacity as well as share property rights.<\/p><p> This will be an evolving debate.  We, in principal, support and have supported the CTAP proposals but these have effectively come to nothing, apart from there being a statement that sounds good.  It is a statement of intent on sharing of intellectual property, etc.  The real issue is how to work with the World Trade Organization as well as the pharmaceutical sector to make sure that the companies with the capacity to do so continue to invest heavily in research for the next generation of vaccines, which we may all need in six months or a year, and, at the same time, that they are sharing their intellectual property and partnering with other parts of the world to safely mass-produce large quantities of vaccines.<\/p><p> India and South Africa are bringing forward a TRIPS waiver-type proposal at the World Trade Organization.  We will look at that.  As of now, the European Commission negotiates on behalf of the EU and Ireland.  There needs to be and is an ongoing conversation within the EU on how to responsibly do this in a way that continues to incentivise the pharmaceutical sector to invest heavily, as it needs to, to ensure that we continue to develop the next generation of vaccines and that we mass-produce this generation of vaccines at the pace at which they are needed.  I hope Ireland can try to influence that in a way that most people asking the questions here would like to see.<\/p><p> On Deputy Brady's question with regard to asking a Palestinian speaker to address the UN Security Council during the September presidency, I confirm that we will have a debate on the Middle East peace process during our September presidency and we will look at the options for speakers, including Palestinian speakers, for that debate.  I will come back to the Deputy on that.<\/p><p> In respect of Senator Joe O'Reilly's comments, I have probably answered the question on Syria and the Bab al-Hawa crossing.  On sanctions, it is important to make distinctions between the EU approach to sanctions and the US approach.  People often talk about sanctions on Syria being hugely damaging to the broader population and so on.  The EU approach is quite different to that of the US.  The EU only sanctions individuals.  It seizes the assets of individuals, prevents individuals from travelling and so on.  These are individuals who have been associated with the regime, atrocities or breaches of international law.<\/p><p> I had a good conversation with Geir Pederson on this issue.  We should not and cannot support sanctions that reinforce hardship on a population in a wartime or post-conflict situation.  Sanctions are, however, an important part of trying to ensure there is a political way forward that the EU can support.  Sanctions are important leverage in that regard.  I take the point but we should always assess the sanctions being applied to make sure they are serving the intended purpose, which is not to add misery or suffering to people or economies nor to affect their ability to get aid or medicines in.  The EU is quite careful in the context of how sanctions impact on local populations, and that is the case for Syria.  I can follow up with more detail on that if somebody wants it.<\/p><p>The official note on sanctions in Syria states that EU sanctions are aimed at combating violent repression in Syria, violations of human rights and international humanitarian law as well as fighting against the use of chemical weapons.  They are targeted at specific entities and individuals.  There are specific mechanisms to ensure the delivery of humanitarian aid, most of which the EU pays for, including medical aid, is not hindered.  These humanitarian exemptions and derogations apply at all times.<\/p><p> Ireland has contributed almost &euro;200 million in humanitarian assistance to Syria.  It is by far the biggest contribution we have made to any conflict region or unfolding humanitarian catastrophe.  The last time I looked we had contributed &euro;193 million to Syria but I suspect it is probably up to about &euro;200 million.  We will continue to support the alleviation of suffering there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021050400002#H00200","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620082800,"counter":275,"content":"<p>I am sorry for cutting across.

I will not go over comments made or questions asked by other contributors but I will touch on something the Minister mentioned around the sexual violence investigation.  That is absolutely welcome.  While highlighting and acknowledging sexual violence as a weapon of war is a positive first step, we need to see action and accountability.  That will be key for those affected by that.<\/p> <p>   I move on to a recent presentation given to the committee about the disproportionate effect of Covid-19 on women, particularly displaced women, in terms of access to education and medical care and, more important, about how vital women's voices will be when it comes to rebuilding societies and economies after Covid and as we go through the emergence from Covid.  It is vital that women's voices are heard at the planning stage and when it comes to implementing the measures for rebuilding economies.  As activists and societal leaders, we must ensure Covid is not used as a mechanism to reverse any ground gained by women in relation to representation at any level.  What action and position do we take in support of these vital measures?<\/p> <p>  I will touch on the TRIPS waiver.  The Minister used the word \"simplistic\" when we spoke about it a few moments ago.  There are simplistic numbers around this.  Our current annual production capacity is 3.5 billion doses but the annual need is 11 billion doses to vaccinate 70% of the global population.  We are at a point where neither objecting nor the wait-and-see approach are tenable positions.  The Minister mentioned quality being an issue here.  Assuring quality around vaccines, while essential, is not an issue that vaccines currently on the market have been immune from.  Two vaccines manufacturers have had quality issues at their manufacturing plants.  They needed to close to address these issues, and that was a welcome step.  When one recognises there is a problem, one takes steps to address it.  That does not really hold up to scrutiny, particularly when one looks at the Covid-19 pre-qualification programme run by the WHO.<\/p><p>Another point raised by the Minister related to a partnership approach.  A partnership approach has been abandoned by other countries such as Canada, South Korea, Pakistan, and he mentioned India.  Bangladesh had previously tried a partnership approach.  What evident have we available now that indicates this will be an option when it has not been an option in the past and when steps to move down that road have been abandoned?<\/p><p> Finally, does the Minister support the TRIPS waiver, personally, because at this point something has to give?  Globally, humanity and health is on the line, otherwise we will be stuck in a cycle of illnesses, of deaths, and of lockdowns unless this issue is dealt with and dealt with effectively.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021050400002#O00300","speaker":"1495","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620082800,"counter":278,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his presentation.  I want to begin with the issue of the TRIPS waiver.  Notable commentators, such as our own Mary Robinson, have been to the forefront of calling for a TRIPS waiver.  It would not be a simplistic position to take.  The idea of partnership began when more than &euro;5 billion of public funding went into the pharmaceutical companies in Ireland to enable them to develop the vaccines in the speed and manner in which they have done.  It is at this point that the TRIPS waiver has been called for by both India and South Africa, with India being in a position of peril.  There is manufacturing capacity in India but it simply does not have enough vaccines to keep up with the surge of the virus.  The fact that India is in the condition that it is in means that surrounding nations will be unable to access vaccines because most of the them being produced there will, understandably, go to India.  The TRIPS waiver has been called for and I do not think it is simplistic in any way, shape or form.  We are at the risk of being too deferential to pharmaceutical companies and their knowledge, when most of this is being funded publicly.  What exactly is the Government's position when it comes to the TRIPS waiver?  We have always taken the lead on human rights, be it in famine or conflict.  We cannot find ourselves short on this issue.<\/p> <p>  I want to highlight two potentials for conflict and genuine tragedy over the next 12 to 18 months in Ethiopia.  One issue relates to the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, which has the potential to cause conflict with Egypt.  What is the status of diplomacy regarding the dam and the potential for conflict with Egypt?  Secondly, as a result of the current conflict in Tigray, there is the potential for famine in the coming 12 months because of the inability to plant seeds and crops.  How will we support the Ethiopians in offsetting any human rights crisis emerging from the crisis in Tigray, particularly with the threat of famine?<\/p> <p>  My final question is about the relationship with Russia.  Ireland has seen itself, in the absence of diplomacy, shouting into a vacuum when Russia encroaches on our airspace and sea space.  Where is the potential for diplomatic gain when it comes to Russia?  Who is working on that and what is the potential for that to be improved in the future?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021050400002#P00200","speaker":"1560"},{"type":"speech","time":1620082800,"counter":279,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for being here.  There has been some discussion on TRIPS.  I heard a very interesting discussion which suggested that releasing intellectual property is simply not 100% the answer.  Moderna, as the Minister pointed out, is looking for partners and that is the way forward.  We need to encourage these manufacturers to seek partners in developing economies to manufacture the vaccine under strict quality control measures which are required.<\/p> <p>  I congratulate the Minister for getting the Passport Office open.  That has been a vital step forward and it is great to hear it is starting to process passports.  Regarding travel within the EU, he will be aware that the aviation industry is on its knees.  Given the vaccine roll-out programme throughout Europe, are there plans for Ireland to join the remainder of the EU states and start travel again within Europe?<\/p> <p>  A bit closer to home, there is the issue of a border poll.  I have written to the Minister on this issue and I constantly receive contact from members of the unionist community, the moderate side of unionism in Northern Ireland, who are deeply concerned at the constant referencing of the need for a border poll.<\/p><p>Many of these people believe what is really needed is that we learn to speak to one another, particularly in the North of Ireland, as communities.  The Minister has done a huge amount of work and carries a great amount of respect from both sides of the community in Northern Ireland.  I have some concerns about this issue.  I appreciate the Minister may not be able to comment on it but I wanted to refer to it with him here.<\/p><p> We have a proud record of peacekeeping throughout the world.  With the decline in the Defence Forces, does the Minister see us continuing to be able to provide peacekeepers in all of the stations we currently have?<\/p><p> My final point is on the issue of the Iranian Embassy.  I have been an advocate of opening the embassy in Tehran for some time now.  I am aware there are organisations and people in this country with difficulties with the Iranian regime.  It is my view, and I think the view of the Minister, that we are better talking to the Iranians on the ground than staying away from the country and not being a party to it.

I want to make two points, briefly.  In regard to the international dimension of to Covid-19, COVAX and vaccine equity, the Minister will be aware of our report, which was published some weeks ago.  I hope the content of that will find favour with the Minister's office and Government colleagues.<\/p><p>On the Syrian refugees, we on this committee had a poignant presentation from Syrian spokesperson, Ghufran Khoulani, last week.  She spoke in graphic terms about the refugee situation, particularly in Lebanon.  It was noted that the majority of Syrians in Ireland have relations in Lebanese camps and that the deportation of refugees from Lebanon to Syria, from what we are told, appears to be in some way contrary to the international non-<i>refoulement<\/i>regime.  I am sure these issues have been brought to the Minister's attention.  I believe they are critical.<\/p><p>We also hear that in the context of future elections in Syria, there has been intensive canvassing or the exercise of undue influence by some Lebanese politicians canvassing on behalf of the Assad party, which is worrying.  The forcible return of Syrian refugees appears to me to be not right.  I wonder whether consideration, on the part of the Minister, would be given to making contact with his counterpart in Lebanon on the basis that we feel the Lebanese Government must have a role here and be held accountable.<\/p><p>Equally worrying is the situation in Denmark.  I would be grateful to hear the Minister's views on that and whether consideration has been given to a bilateral meeting between him and his Danish colleague expressing what we believe to be a worrying trend in Denmark regarding Syrian refugees.  I welcome what the Minister has said in relation to the individual cases of detention and that he is open to us raising this issue.  We will get back to him on that.  Overall, on the matter of the Syrian refugee crisis, we urge the European Union and the UN Security Council to be active and engaged.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021050400002#Q00200","speaker":"1589"},{"type":"speech","time":1620082800,"counter":282,"content":"<p>I will answer the Chair's question on the issue of refugee returns to Syria first.  Any returns of refugees or displaced persons must be voluntary, dignified and safe.  It is the assessment of reputable experts and, above all, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR, that such conditions are not in place right now.  EU law and other international legal obligations rightly prevent EU member states from returning individuals to situations where they would face extreme danger.  In our view, this is clearly the case in Syria right now.  <\/p> <p> As regards the Danish decision, I understand that authorities in Denmark have concluded that it is safe for refugees to return to parts of Syria.  It is for Denmark's authorities to come to their own conclusions.  Domestically, the Minister for Justice has a policy responsibility for this issue.  From my perspective, I note that the UN High Commissioner for Refugees does not consider Syria safe for refugees to return there.  I have a very good relationship with my Danish colleague and I will certainly raise that issue with him.<\/p> <p>  In relation to returns from Lebanon, since 2011, that country has absorbed an estimated 1.5 million Syrian refugees, which is a number equivalent to almost one third of its population.  The scale of the influx has placed enormous strain on the country.  I fully understand Lebanese concerns about the impact on the country of hosting such large numbers of refugees.  I am also aware of concerns raised about the situation of Syrian refugees in Lebanon.  I commend civic society organisations on their vital work in safeguarding the well-being and rights of refugees in Lebanon.  Ireland has been consistently clear that refugee returns must be voluntary and safe.  The UNHCR is clear that it is not safe for refugees to return to Syria, not yet at any rate.  Ireland has resettled more than 1,600 refugees from Lebanon.  In 2019, the Government further committed to welcoming 2,900 refugees between 2020 and 2023, most of whom will be Syrian, who are living in Jordan and Lebanon.  <\/p> <p>  I may have an opportunity to visit Lebanon before the D&aacute;il breaks up for the summer.  I hope to be able to visit our troops in the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, in southern Lebanon, perhaps in late June or early July.  If I do, I would certainly like to have political discussions in Beirut as well.  Even though there is effectively no functioning government in Lebanon right now, this is certainly one of the issues I can raise directly while there.  On COVAX and access to vaccines, we will certainly take note of the report the committee has put together.  <\/p> <p>  In relation to Deputy Clarke's questions on accountability and action as regards sexual violence in Tigray, the place to start is to shine a light on the issue, which is what we have been trying to do.  We have been asking many very uncomfortable questions, which is what we need to do.  We now have, effectively, the appropriate UN body investigating what is happening in Tigray.  I hope, if we get names, accounts and evidence, we will be able to follow up in order to hold to account individuals who have sanctioned, ordered or participated in sexual violence as part of that conflict.  That would ensure there will be no impression of impunity when it comes to sexual violence in conflict zones.  <\/p> <p>  The Deputy is right about the impact of Covid-19 on women.  Ireland will continue to focus on women's empowerment and gender equality in our development programme.  Economic empowerment programmes will be particularly important as women have lost ground economically in terms of employment during Covid.  It has also had a huge impact on education and education for girls is always what suffers first.  I do not have the exact figure to hand, but we are committing a considerable amount of money in our development programme, distributed through UN organisations, for the education of girls in Africa.<\/p><p>It is a big part of our Irish Aid commitment.  We will have to double down on those efforts because Covid has clearly set back sustainable development goals, generally, in terms of meeting targets by 2030.  It has also had a disproportionate impact on women as part of those goals.  That is very much recognised within the Department and in my office.<\/p><p> Deputies Gannon and Clarke both raised the issue of TRIPS.  When I said it is not simplistic, what I was talking about was upscaling output from 3 billion to 11 billion doses is not simplistic in terms of any one solution that can do it.  Am I saying or do I believe intellectual property rights should be an impediment to expanding the manufacturing capacity of safe vaccines globally?  No, I do not.  I do not believe intellectual property rights should not be allowed be an impediment to that.  How we expand manufacturing capacity in a way that continues to ensure companies invest heavily in the research needed to continue to advance towards the next generation of vaccines as well as sharing knowledge and intellectual property rights to allow countries like India, which have significant manufacturing capacity in pharmaceuticals, to ratchet up their output is something on which we have to find a way forward.  If it is the India-South Africa proposal we can work with, that is great.  If it is a version of that, that is what we will have to try to advocate for.<\/p><p> Ireland has to advocate within the European Union for an EU approach.  Perhaps first and foremost that is where we can be most impactful, because the Commission negotiates on our behalf on WTO issues.  Certainly, from my perspective, and I say this as somebody who lives ten minutes from the second-largest pharmaceutical cluster in the European Union, in Cork, it is not morally acceptable for us to allow a legal intellectual property argument to prevent or slow down the manufacturing of life-saving vaccines.<\/p><p> We have shown a capacity in the past to respond to other diseases in terms of vaccine output, but we must also ensure there is quality control and capacity because this is not just about intellectual property; it is also about know-how.  Producing these vaccines in the timeframe that will be demanded of companies requires partnerships and know-how that many of the operators that have researched and manufactured vaccines to date need to be a part of.  We should be seriously looking at a TRIPS waiver for the reasons I have just outlined, but that will not solve the problem on its own.  That is what I am saying.  It is a more complex problem in terms of ensuring we get the kind of volumes of vaccines that are needed.  As Deputy Clarke suggested, we must move from 3.5 billion to 11 billion doses to meet the global demand.<\/p><p> The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam concerns more than Ethiopia and Egypt but that is, of course, where the real tension lies.  It also involves Sudan.  There have been a number of attempts to try to get a diplomatic solution to this matter involving several countries and international organisations.  As of yet, it has not worked.  I was in Cairo, possibly two years ago at this stage, to discuss this issue with the Egyptian foreign minister and he was very uncompromising in his message.  This could be the source of real regional tension if we cannot get a solution to it.  There is enough conflict in this region linked to a whole range of other matters that we have not even had a chance to touch on, without this issue adding to it even further.<\/p><p> On girls' education and that large figure I talked about, Ireland will invest at least &euro;250 million by 2024 in girls' education and education in emergencies, which is everything from education in refugee camps to vulnerable and post-conflict populations and so on.  Do not forget there are approximately 75 million people in refugee camps.  When one thinks about that, it is quite extraordinary.  It is the population of Germany in refugee camps.  The challenges of education in the context of Covid-19, in particular, when many schools have been closed down in an effort to prevent spread, are huge.  Again, &euro;250 million over the space of a couple of years is a big commitment from an Irish perspective.<\/p><p> I apologise to Deputy Gannon who asked about Russia and there were questions earlier on Donbas.  There was a big military build-up on the Ukrainian border which, as one would expect, was causing much concern within the EU and, from what I hear, within NATO countries as well.  Perhaps that tension has eased a little bit but Ukraine is a real concern for the EU and the support for the Ukrainian Government and the sovereign integrity of that country is something the EU has to, and does, stand for.<\/p><p> The Navalny case is seen in the European Union as simply silencing a credible critic of the Russian Government.  Within the EU, there is real concern about Alexei Navalny's health and we continue to call not only for access to healthcare but healthcare that he can trust, which has not been the case.  Of course, we have been public, vocal and critical of arbitrary detention of people who are legitimately raising concerns through marches, rallies and peaceful demonstration.  It is not a good situation.<\/p><p> Likewise, in terms of Belarus, we have been as supportive as we possibly can be of the opposition movement in the context of the demand for free and fair elections which any country should be entitled to.  We do not believe that the last presidential election in Belarus was in any way credible.  I say that as someone who has been in Belarus and, ironically, the most high-profile opposition spokesperson who is outside of Belarus at present has strong connections with Ireland.  We have been as supportive of her as we can be.<\/p><p> Senator Craughwell referred to the Passport Office which, by the way, never closed during the pandemic.  I know the impression is there that it has been closed.  It was closed to the public for public health reasons but approximately 235,000 passports have been issued since the first restrictions were put in place in response to Covid-19 in March of last year.  This year, we continue to provide thousands of passports every week, predominantly the applications that are online and pretty straightforward and, of course, emergency passports people need.<\/p><p> However, we need to move beyond that and I anticipate a significant increase in demand for passports as we move through the summer because many people who have not even thought about international travel may start thinking about international travel again and other people may need passports for other reasons in terms of identity.<\/p><p> We regard passports as an essential service in terms of renewal and getting passports for children and so on, so we have had one third of our team in the Passport Office.  It is a confined office.  They work in close proximity to each other and we need to make sure that we do that safely.  We want to be able to move to 50% to 70% so that we can really ratchet up capacity.  There is an overhang, particularly in terms of people who have paperwork stuck in the system for a number of months.<\/p><p>Approximately 90,000 people are waiting.  We can clear that backlog quickly, in the space of approximately six weeks, once there is a significant increase in our team in the Passport Office but we must do it safely.  I hope people will understand that people working in close proximity to one another need be able to do that safely.<\/p><p> I do not want to go into the detail in terms of travel, but the Government will be looking at international travel in terms of a discussion as to how we approach the reopening of international travel over time.  We will be doing that later this month.  <\/p><p> The European Commission is developing what will be a helpful data tool to which countries throughout the European Union will contribute data on people's Covid-19 status and we have the systems to be able to do this.  It means that when a passenger comes through an airport, he or she will have a code on his or her mobile phone that can be scanned to give his or her Covid-19 health status in terms of whether he or she has been vaccinated, PCR tested or has had Covid-19 and recovered.  On the basis of having that consistent and trusted data throughout the European Union, countries will be able to make decisions as to what level of easing of restrictions on international travel they will facilitate and for what category of person.  <\/p><p> That is a debate we need to have but I hope that later on in the summer, we will be able to facilitate people who are fully vaccinated to be able to participate in international travel.  The restrictions and management of them, obviously, need to be discussed with our public health team to make sure we do it safely.  The public would expect that of us.<\/p><p> My view on a border poll is that we have many complex and difficult issues to resolve with the British Government and political leaders and communities in Northern Ireland.  Northern Ireland is a place of tension, polarisation, anxiety and worry at present.  Many people are worried about what the summer might hold in terms of a marching season, bonfires, potential protests, violence and so on.  We must try to reduce the temperature in terms of political interaction, not increase it.  I do not believe that calling for an immediate border poll is helpful in that context.  Instead, we must try to bed down and support the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement.  We must try to rebuild relationships that have been damaged - and I include myself in that - to try to rebuild an atmosphere of trust again.  Of course, the aspiration for a border poll is perfectly legitimate, just as is the aspiration to maintain Northern Ireland as part of the Union.  Many people hold strong views.<\/p><p> For now, whether it is Brexit, protocol issues, policing or protecting the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement, not just the Assembly and the Executive but also North-South Ministerial Council meetings and east-west infrastructure between Dublin and London, we must use all of those institutions to maintain calm and show people that politics works.  I hope that as we improve relationships, many of these discussions will be taken forward in time but there are immediate challenges we face and they need to be the focus.<\/p><p> We are focusing on peacekeeping mandates in the Security Council.  Senator Craughwell had recognised that.  We can maintain our current missions.  We may choose to evolve those missions into a focus on other parts of the world, over time, and we have had an initial discussion with the Defence Forces on that.  In terms of the numbers that we contribute to overseas peacekeeping missions, I have no intention of reducing Ireland's footprint overseas.<\/p><p> That means we must get better at recruitment and retention to make sure we build up the numbers.  We are 1,000 people short of where we should be in terms of our overall Defence Forces contingent, as Senator Craughwell knows, but we are working hard to try to change that and we will be successful but it will take some time.<\/p><p> On the Iranian Embassy, one should have embassies in countries with which one has disagreements and to which one has different foreign policy approaches, as well as in countries with which one has significant consistency in that regard.<\/p><p>In my view, Iran is a significant regional actor.  We have real concerns with much of what it has done and is doing but we have made a commitment to open an embassy by 2023.  Of course, our role on the Security Council reinforces the need for this.  We are the facilitator on the Security Council of Resolution 2231, which essentially is the Iranian nuclear deal.  Not to have a presence or footprint in Teheran in this context would be wrong.  This is why we will have a diplomatic footprint in Teheran very soon.  It will be in the German Embassy initially, working in partnership with Germany and using its facilities but having a separate office ourselves.  Over time we will go through the process of finding an appropriate location to have an embassy of our own at some point over the coming years.<\/p><p> I believe I have answered everybody's questions.  I apologise for going a little bit over time but they were important questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021050400002#R00100","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620082800,"counter":287,"content":"<p>I do not have time for a second round.

In recent years all official bodies in Ireland have come to use adjusted gross national income, GNI*, when comparing output and income in Ireland with other countries and increasingly this approach is accepted abroad, particularly by international bodies.  However, some foreign commentators are still unaware of this measure and its appropriate use.  Using this measure, adjusted for price differences, Ireland's standard of living in 2019 was approximately 109% of the EU 15 average, whereas the UK's was around 96%.  However, in a recent Central Bank paper, Professor Patrick Honohan has suggested an alternative measure which he calls alternative individual consumption.  This measure includes consumption by households and much of Government consumption.  Government consumption includes things like education, which is really important.  All of this is expressed per person and adjusted for prices.  Professor Honohan feels this may be a better comparative measure for some purposes and on this measure Ireland actually ranks below the UK.<br\/><br\/>In our 2020 paper, we used a variant of the Honohan measure and using this metric for 2016, the standard of living in Ireland was found to be slightly lower than in Northern Ireland and the UK because of public consumption.  That is because of the expenditure on education, the health service and so on.  Recent developments may have seen a change in this ranking; the data for 2016 are the latest data available on a comparable basis.  The metric we used in our paper is appropriate for comparisons of the situation today but it says nothing about the sustainability of that consumption.  It does not include the investment needed to maintain the standard of living which is where Northern Ireland is very low, or, as Dr. Adele Bergin and Dr. Seamus McGuinness emphasise in another recent paper, national saving, which could contribute to living standards in the future.  One of the problems of the Northern Ireland economy is that it has a very low level of investment in both physical and human capital.  Bergin and McGuinness, in a series of papers in 2020 and 2021, have suggested alternative measures including disposable income adjusted for price differences.  On this metric Ireland ranks above Northern Ireland.  Quite rightly, they highlight the fact that national accounting-type measures take no account of other factors that are hugely important in terms of standard of living, such as life expectancy.  In summary, the standard of living measured by national consumption is probably fairly similar North and South but measured by output per head, it is significantly higher in the Republic.<br\/><br\/>Due to the questions raised at the last meeting we append a note considering the subvention to Northern Ireland under a range of scenarios and that subject came up in a recent article in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>.  I will not attempt to read out the tables.

I found it very instructive.  It shows that, because kids from a working-class background, in Belfast, for example, get selected for secondary schools and do not get into grammar schools, they have poor educational prospects.  It is not necessarily the fault of the schools.  The evidence from the Republic and elsewhere shows that, when kids are segregated by ability, kids in the top half of the distribution do not do any better while those in the bottom half do substantially worse.  This segregation perpetuates a system that locks out those from working-class communities.  This has wider social implications, about which I am not qualified to talk.<\/p> <p>  The problem is that grammar schools in Northern Ireland are very good.  In talking to people in Northern Ireland and discussing this matter, I find great resistance, from both sides of the community, to anything that would disturb the grammar schools.  Middle-class parents get their children into these schools and they do very well there.  They are very good schools.  It is a question of how to move away from the situation that pertains today.  The secondary schools may be doing a really good job but the children attending them have poor prospects.  There is a question about how to move towards an integrated system such as we have in the Republic.  Shirley Williams, who died a few weeks ago, made a big change of this kind in England in the 1970s and faced great resistance.  It is difficult and problematic.<\/p> <p>  Vani Borooah has modelled and estimated what he calls the Catholic ethos advantage.  Kids from working-class or disadvantaged Catholic backgrounds do a bit better than kids from a Protestant background.  He raised the possibility that this could be because the schools are better but it is much more likely to be because the parents have different expectations.  I have seen this in the Republic, in my own area.  In the late 1980s, I heard parents saying that there is no point in their kids remaining in school.  In the late 1990s, the younger sisters and brothers of those kids continued on and went on to university.  There has been a dramatic improvement in participation in education across social classes in the Republic.  Parents' expectations are as important as the schools themselves.  I am no expert on Northern Ireland.  There are people here who know more about it.  The research evidence, however, shows that this is a significant problem for Northern Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021050400002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Professor John FitzGerald"},{"type":"speech","time":1620082800,"counter":303,"content":"<p>I certainly acknowledge that there are people here who know a lot more about Northern Ireland than me and who are living those politics and those issues every day.

It is good to have the opportunity to discuss the witnesses' perspectives on that.<\/p> <p>  In the papers they have provided, the witnesses go through the scale of the transfers from central government in the UK to Northern Ireland, which have masked part of the productivity gap for some time.  There are many questions being asked about the prospect of a united Ireland at some point in the future.  The witnesses highlight a whole range of issues to be considered including continuing pension obligations and Northern Ireland's share of the UK debt.  There is a whole range of different considerations.  We will draw out some of those issues as the meeting goes on.  I am interested in what the Government can do to support development and innovation in Northern Ireland.  What can we, as parliamentarians in Dublin, suggest to try to support the development of that innovative, forward-looking, strong and sustainable Northern Ireland economy?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021050400002#D00300","speaker":"1480"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620082800,"counter":304,"content":"<p>Would Professor Morgenroth would like to say something about infrastructure?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021050400002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Professor John FitzGerald"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620082800,"counter":305,"content":"<p>We know, from decades of economic research, that there are certain key drivers of growth and productivity.

There has been an ongoing plan in some of the infrastructure projects where I would not necessarily agree with the particular prioritisation but greater connectivity in infrastructure is something that we could do.  If one looks at Northern Ireland, and I have been living in Ireland for a very long time, back in the 1980s one always had this view that the roads got better as one crossed the Border.  Now it is the other way around.  Infrastructure in Northern Ireland has been lagging behind and the data supports that.  The infrastructure investment has not been as strong.<\/p> <p>  On innovation, tying Northern Ireland into the wider innovation system on the island of Ireland and, with that, into Europe is something that we want to continue to foster.  <\/p> <p>  It is quite interesting to look at some of the previous schemes before Brexit, which the EU had been running, such as the Horizon 2020, H 2020, and its predecessor funding.  Many of the Irish universities worked with UK universities but not with Northern Irish ones.  Building collaborations North-South is something upon which we can do much more on the innovation side.  There is scope for that.

We kept children in school until 16 years of age and they continued on to do the leaving certificate and to go on to university.  However, it takes a long time to replace my generation who did not have that opportunity.  The effects of education take a very long time.<\/p><p>I said to French counterparts at an international meeting that their problem in France was the high unemployment rate and that low-skilled people were locked out.  I said they needed education and they said that would take 20 years.  I said it takes 20 years but if they did not start now they would be going nowhere.<\/p><p> The one thing that could speed up the adjustment in Northern Ireland is the fact that there is a very large number of Northern Irish graduates abroad.  If they could be attracted back to Northern Ireland that is how to upgrade at the top.  However, that would not deal with the problem of the kids who are being failed by the educational system at the bottom.  A paper by Iulia Siedschlag of the ESRI for the Department for the Economy in Northern Ireland showed that education is hugely important in where foreign direct investment, FDI, locates, not just in these islands but across Europe.  That could make a difference in Northern Ireland and would speed up the process.  It is urgent that we attract those people back.  Large numbers of people emigrated from here in the 1980s and we - and they - thought they were going and never coming back.  They turned out to be homing pigeons and research by the ESRI and Professor Alan Barrett shows that people who emigrate and come back bring new skills and a different language with them.  Returning emigrants raised productivity by 10%.

It is very interesting to hear Professor FitzGerald's thoughts.  At a committee in Stormont in the region of 20 years ago, the economist John Simpson talked about how there were children in the vicinity of Stormont, only a few miles down the road, who at five, six, and seven years old were no longer suitable for an educational environment.  Those words stuck in my head.  I will never forget them.  That is a stark statement to make.  I agree that the ethos and value that is placed on education at home is certainly a major contributing factor.<\/p> <p>  Professor FitzGerald talked about the grammar schools.  That love affair with grammar schools is waning significantly, particularly in more rural areas, although it is different in Belfast than it is everywhere else.  We have excellent all-ability schools, like St. Catherine's College in Armagh or St. Ciaran's College in Ballygawley.  We have brilliant all-ability schools in the North that are bringing children through, bringing the best out of them and helping them achieve their full potential.  I would like to see more research and development.  We are going to be left behind by the digital innovation that is happening around the world and we need to ensure we are fit to compete in that sphere.<\/p> <p>  Professor FitzGerald has broken the subvention down into different categories, such as defence and residual spending, and that residual category includes things like museums, galleries, libraries and things on which we might not necessarily have the same level of spending.  Obviously, defence is a massive impact and we would not be spending the same amount on defence that the British Government currently does.<\/p><p>The British Government currently ring-fences 2% of GDP for defence and that is a large amount.  However, there are also other decisions to consider.  We are talking this week about the investment of &pound;200 million in a new royal yacht.  It is those kinds of expenses which make the subvention sound so ridiculously high.  Obviously, the subvention is based on the <i>status quo<\/i>.  <br\/><br\/>As for the savings which would accrue from doing away with some of the duplication on the island, I note we have two health systems and two education systems, for example.  Much spending is duplicated on the island of Ireland now.  There are some excellent examples, especially in health, where co-operation has been highly beneficial, not just financially but also in respect of the health outcomes for people.  I am thinking of the cancer centre in Derry or the all-Ireland paediatric centre in Dublin.  There are amazing outcomes from those centres.  <br\/><br\/>The <i>status quo<\/i>, therefore, is throwing up a different set of figures.  I would like to focus on a few of the more recent aspects.  Some of the statistics being used by Professor FitzGerald are a few years old.  I have been a constituency MP or an MLA for more than 20 years.  In the past five years, certainly, and mention was made of the 2016 standard of living index, I have seen great difficulties arising from the increase in poverty in my constituency such as the reliance on food banks, for example.  This is not just in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, but before that as well.  We certainly have seen a diminution in the level of disposable income in my constituency.  I would like to hear from Professor FitzGerald on some of those points.  Deputy Conway-Walsh will come in thereafter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021050400002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Michelle Gildernew","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620082800,"counter":323,"content":"<p>I listened to colleagues of Ms Gildernew regarding the subvention and I took account of it.  The excess expenditure on defence, to which Northern Ireland contributes, probably accounts for the best part of &pound;1 billion of the subvention.  However, even in 2018, if Northern Ireland had been part of the Republic of Ireland, the EU subvention would have been substantially higher than the UK's contribution to the EU's subvention.  With the UK leaving the EU, that will disappear.  Therefore, there are pluses and minuses, but there are more minuses overall.  When we adjust for these special factors, the subvention comes down significantly.  However, a large subvention remains.<\/p> <p>  In addition, when we did preliminary work on this in 2018, we did not treat pensions separately.  Listening to the arguments made by Dr. Adele Bergin and Dr. Seamus McGuinness and Ms Gildernew's colleagues, I believe she is correct that social insurance contributions by people in Northern Ireland entitle them to a pension paid for by the United Kingdom.  Irish people who work in the United Kingdom and who then come back to Ireland are then entitled to a pension for the period they worked.  Therefore, an allowance should probably be made for that element.  <\/p> <p>  Turning to the national debt, I have another paper with a colleague in Lund University in Sweden where we have looked at the history of this aspect.  There is no escape from the national debt.  It would be a good trade-off in Irish unification, were the UK to continue to pay the social insurance contribution, but a share of the UK's national debt would travel with Northern Ireland to a united Ireland.  That is what happened when West Virginia left Virginia 150 years ago.  When Ireland left the United Kingdom after the treaty of December 1921, it agreed to take a share of the UK's national debt.  It would have been 80% of Irish GDP.  The way we escaped that was through a deal in December 1925 with the UK, when Ireland sold the option of redrawing the Border with Northern Ireland in return for a write-off on the debt.  We basically sold a right to redraw the Border.  Now, the right was non-existent.  Regarding Scottish independence, the deal there was that an independent Scotland would have taken a share of the national debt.  The UK Treasury looked at the 1925 file and acknowledged that Scotland was not going to be able to sell Northern Ireland back to England to escape paying for the national debt.<\/p> <p>  Looking at it realistically, yes, the subvention would be significantly lower and I give the figures in the note.  However, it would still be quite large.<\/p><p>As regards the questions Ms Gildernew raised on efficiencies, there would definitely be efficiency gains.  These can be realised even without unification.  A very interesting paper was prepared by the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister and the Department of Foreign Affairs in 2006 or 2007, when there was no Executive.  It focused on health and education as areas in which Northern Ireland is lacking in provision.  In terms of third level places, that is particularly evident in the area of IT.  Letterkenny Institute of Technology, Dundalk Institute of Technology and Institute of Technology Sligo in the Republic could provide more in that case, although I think Derry needs more major investment in that regard.<\/p><p> I will leave the area of health to Professor Morgenroth, who knows more about it, living in a Border area.  However, there is a case for integrating the health services, even in terms of medical training.  The NHS training system is much better than the medical training system in the Republic because one needs to be part of a big system.  Having integrated medical training on the island would be better for everybody.  There are wins in that regard which are possible.<\/p><p> On the issue of poverty in Northern Ireland, the UK welfare system is grossly inferior to that of the Republic.  I refer to the disruption caused by the changes made by the Conservative Party in the past five to seven years.  I find it horrifying to watch the coverage on \"Newsnight\" or Channel 4 of the chaos those changes have caused for people at the bottom of the pile.  Nobody seems to care.  One would not get away with doing anything like that in the Republic.  Of course, Northern Ireland is powerless to influence the changes.  Ms Gildernew makes a really important point on poverty and the welfare system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021050400002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Professor John FitzGerald","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620082800,"counter":325,"content":"<p>On the issue of subvention, there is another way of looking at it.  Rather than simply looking at what is currently there, one can look at Northern Ireland or similar regions and how they perform within a country.  In the Republic of Ireland, certain areas, such as the midlands, for example, are vastly underperforming economically and are getting a very substantial subvention.  Northern Ireland is sort of in the realm of the midlands in terms of productivity.  That means there will inevitably be a substantial transfer, whether that be an explicit transfer such as the one that is implied by the Barnett formula or whether it is implicit, like what we have in the Republic of Ireland.  Dublin is the only part of the Republic of Ireland that makes a surplus.  I have published research on this in international journals.  The south-west region breaks even on taxes and expenditure but all the other regions are actually getting a subvention that is basically paid for by Dublin.  Dublin makes that revenue that can be redistributed.  Similarly, in a united Ireland, if Northern Ireland has lower productivity than the average, then it will be subject to some form of subvention.  We can argue about the size of that subvention but it certainly would be present.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of efficiency and duplication, there are areas in which we could make significant gains but we need to first elaborate on which system will be chosen.  For example, will something like the NHS be chosen for the health system or will the HSE be chosen?  There seem to be differences in efficiencies across those two organisations.  That is something about which we need to think.  It may be that a completely different and even more efficient system is what is wanted, but we would have to invent that.  There is already scope within Northern Ireland for a reduction in duplication.  Reference was made to education.  There are sort of parallel systems in that regard that do not seem to be fully utilised.  Many schools are not at capacity and there is extra cost involved in that which could probably be better used to help young people to achieve their best potential.  <\/p> <p>  On the issue of poverty, it is something that is particularly evident in crises.  The financial crisis and the Covid crisis seem to disproportionately affect the people at the bottom end of income distribution.  That is something with which we will need to deal in a far more systematic way.  There are issues around housing, for example, that are very significant in this regard and where the trends are all going in the wrong way.<\/p><p>However, that is not unique to Northern Ireland; we see it elsewhere.  That is certainly not going well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021050400002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Edgar Morgenroth","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620082800,"counter":327,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their paper.

What concerns me about the witnesses' paper is that they are talking about maybe 25 years, a generation, before we can make the changes that are needed.  We cannot afford to lose a generation for many reasons.  I want to ask the witnesses about the two main developments since we saw them last, namely, the protocol and its impact.  When the witnesses appeared previously, we discussed the possibility of a no-deal Brexit.  How important is it to the overall economic picture of the North that the protocol stays in place?

The protocol really is necessary and arises out of the nature of the kind of Brexit we have got, so it is a direct implication.  While we can argue about how this protocol or a protocol is applied, the basic need for it will not go away, and that is simply because of Brexit and the need to keep the integrity of the Single Market.  If we did not have the protocol and left the Border open, Ireland would end up having to take the hit of Brexit.  Nobody in the Republic of Ireland voted for Brexit and we can note again that the majority in Northern Ireland did not vote for it either.<\/p> <p>  There is clearly an issue.  Some imports from GB into Northern Ireland will clearly be impacted in this regard - there is no doubt about that - but there are opportunities as well arising out of Brexit and the protocol for Northern Ireland.  Northern Irish businesses can source within the EU where businesses in GB will have to face non-tariff barriers.  This is something that has not really been given enough attention, perhaps for political reasons, but economically there is a great opportunity here for Northern Irish businesses.  We need to explore that much more.  There is no doubt but that there are costs to Northern Ireland from the protocol but that is simply a cost of Brexit.  There is not very much room around this.  We can apply the rules a little differently but the rules will have to be there.<\/p> <p>  On corporation tax, Professor Fitzgerald might want to come in.

My colleague, Senator Blaney, is trying to connect to the meeting.  I welcome the contributions of Professors FitzGerald and Morgenroth.  It is great to have them with us for this discussion.<\/p><p>Professor FitzGerald gave a very impressive statistic on early school-leavers and the success we have had in this State in reducing considerably the percentage of pupils who leave school early.  That success was the result of direct interventions.  Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, was particularly important and second-chance education initiatives made a difference as well.  They show that specific interventions work and can bring a new belief in education not just to individuals and families but also to certain communities.  That has a great downflow effect.<\/p><p>I am a person who has always believed in, and aspired to, a united Ireland.  In the meantime, however, we must work as assiduously as possible within the existing political and constitutional architecture on this island.  That means we must work the Good Friday Agreement.  We have six implementation bodies operating under the agreement, including Waterways Ireland and Tourism Ireland.  Alongside those bodies, it was agreed at the time that there would be six areas identified for co-operation, including education, agriculture and health.  It has always disappointed me that we have not moved on and grown the number of implementation bodies.  I have argued in the past that education was an obvious choice in that respect.  When I was at college in UCD, there was a sizable number of students from Northern Ireland.  It is very disappointing that there is no longer the same number of students from Northern Ireland at third level in this State, and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  Such a movement of students would be very beneficial.<\/p><p>Do the witnesses agree that nobody could have any qualms or concerns from a political point of view about having an extra implementation body dedicated to further and higher education and perhaps research and innovation as well?  Do they agree that putting in place such a body to deal with the provision of education, research and innovation on an all-Ireland basis might help to reduce the problems we are discussing, particularly in terms of students from Northern Ireland who study and graduate in colleges in Britain and do not return to the North?  Keeping those qualified people and their pool of skills and expertise on our island would contribute to all of the island.  We can talk about a united Ireland and what needs to be done but we need to do practical things in the meantime.  I have always had a very strong belief that education can be a powerful force in that respect.  I sincerely hope some consideration will be given to this particular proposal.<\/p><p>Professor Morgenroth and I come from roughly the same area and we know the deficiencies and particular challenges that face communities in Cavan and Monaghan and north of us, in counties Fermanagh, Tyrone and Armagh, as well.  Professor Morgenroth mentioned human capital as being hugely important.  Might he envisage some major educational development focused on the central Border area that could be beneficial in dealing with some of the many challenges facing us in that area?  He wrote a paper some years ago which demonstrated very clearly the huge effect Brexit would have on the central Border area and the economy there, in Cavan and Monaghan and our neighbouring counties north of the Border.  Unfortunately, that challenge has not gone away.  We need specific interventions in those areas.  Could there be a thinking outside the box with a view to having some greater enhancement of further education, including research facilities or similar?  The fact we do not talk about education on an all-Ireland basis is a huge deficiency.  In the last D&aacute;il, when the Bill to establish technological universities was going through, I asked in the debate whether some of our institutes of education could merge with similar institutes or universities north of the Border to form alliances.<\/p><p>I do not think we were bold enough or progressive enough in terms of the potential to develop further and higher education on an all-Ireland basis.

As he will know, I agree with a lot of what he said.  Education, as we have talked about, is very important and I think we have missed a lot of tricks.<\/p> <p>  In a report that we did for InterTradeIreland some years ago, there was a proposal to have an all-Ireland internship for students.  In my university, DCU, most of our students do a year's internship in business but, typically, they do not go north of the Border.  Likewise, students in Northern Ireland third level institutions do not generally cross the Border either.  That is something we can do to gain a further understanding of the issues North and South and bring communities closer and also to have an educational impact.<\/p> <p>  On the Border area and Brexit, as the Deputy will know, the real issue with Brexit arises out of the reliance on agrifood production.  In County Monaghan, one in five jobs is in agrifood.  In County Cavan, the number is a little smaller but still fairly substantial.  That is where the greatest barriers are likely to be in terms of Brexit.  What is needed is some diversification to different sectors, which is an area we have failed in more generally.  This over-reliance on one sector means one will be much more subject to shocks to that particular sector.  Brexit is a particular one but one can think of other kinds of shocks that could hit that sector.<\/p> <p>  We need a diverse industrial structure in the Border area, North and South.  Across the Border in the Northern counties, there is a similar reliance and they face very similar issues.  That will probably require some educational interventions to develop the right skill sets to enable diversification.  If we look at what is happening both north and south of the Border, in this part of the world people in Cavan-Monaghan who go to university do not return to those counties but go elsewhere.  We face that a lot.<\/p> <p>  Some people have said that working from home, as part of Covid, will help and keep some people in the regions.  I am not so sure but it might do so in some cases.  We need to think a little more about what drives industrial development and where high-value added sectors end up locating.  We can do a lot in that respect in the Border area.  That will have spillover effects.  If something happens in Monaghan, it will have a spillover effect into neighbouring counties, including north of the Border.  That is something we should definitely tackle.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021050400002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Edgar Morgenroth"},{"type":"speech","time":1620082800,"counter":337,"content":"<p>Is Senator Blaney available?

This topic is like deciding when is the right time to have children in that we will say it is never the right time.  In this case, we must work towards that goal and create the best possible situation.  Do we need a dedicated unit in every Department to work on convergence and how best to operate on an all-Ireland basis to create synergies?  If or when we have reunification, or whatever our constitutional status may be, we would then be working with greater focus on an all-Ireland basis.<\/p><p>The theme of today's conversation is education.  For me education has been my freedom to my future, and access to education has been essential for me, to create opportunities through education, research and innovation.  We recently launched the economic corridor between Dublin and Belfast which presents a real opportunity.  As Deputy Brendan Smith said, should we create a cross-Border institution with, for example, DKIT and Queens University coming together?  It could create a body that would spread our education across the Border and stop the stop-at-the-Border mentality where someone coming from the North might go to England or Scotland, or someone from the Republic goes to Dublin, Galway, Cork or wherever.<\/p><p> Should we create a real university that is North-South, taking in Newry and Dundalk, thereby creating synergies?  There is nothing better for integration than education because education is the key to so much.  Do we have that dedicated body within a proper structured shared unit in each Department to create those synergies that will create better economies of scale?  Whether that university in the middle of that economic zone between Dublin and Belfast or elsewhere how will that, in Professor FitzGerald's opinion, be the tide that raises all boats?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021050400002#L00400","speaker":"1671","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620082800,"counter":340,"content":"<p>I am reluctant to prescribe new institutions.

Nobody had a plan in their drawer when that happened and it happened very fast.  It emerged within the space of three months; it was a political avalanche.  Mistakes were made when it came to reunification because nobody was prepared for it.  Those mistakes were costly for the people, particularly with the loss of jobs in East Germany and for West Germans with increased taxes.

It was enjoyable to hear from them.  I enjoyed the session the last time and the various questions and suggestions that members have made.<\/p> <p>  The key word Senator Erin McGreehan used was \"convergence\".  It will be about meeting and matching two different economies and different sets of governance and infrastructure.  I want to touch on infrastructure, in particular.  The focus of the witnesses on education in the research area is welcome, especially the selection aspect.  This pertains more to the economic discussion we are having.  Integration and sharing are part of this as well but the economic part is key.<\/p> <p>  I see a barrier there.  There are certainly vested interests and it is a complex issue, but the governance gap in Northern Ireland is the problem.  The Northern Ireland Assembly does not do small decisions well and it certainly does not do big decisions well.  I know that from looking at it as a public representative and as a parent.  The belief that the Northern Ireland Assembly has shown the ability to realise transformation on the scale that is required feels unrealistic.  I believe it is worth saying.  No elected representative could fail to see the extent to which academic selection is failing society in terms of the children who are getting bad outcomes and how unfair the system is.<\/p> <p>  It is always worth pointing out that we need to take the blame off parents.  I am thinking of the area I represent.  I will be going through this as a parent in the coming year or two.  There are excellent schools around but all local schools are over-subscribed and academically selective.  People are forced into certain decisions because they want to make the best choice for their children.  This is important in the debate when we talk about the flaws in the education system.  While people obviously try to do the right thing, it is not individual families who are at fault.<\/p> <p>  I see a governance issue.  In this centenary week we can say we have not enjoyed good governance at any point in the past 100 years.  We have not even enjoyed good governance in the 20 years when we have been in control of our own destiny with devolution.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses talked about the issue of bright young people leaving.  Few things are more economically short-sighted than investing in 14 years of a child's education and then essentially forcing the child to leave due to artificial caps on third level places or making the place such a basket case that the student does not want to come home subsequently.<\/p> <p>  I want to ask about the extent to which the economic consequences of governance are visible.  It seems our overall arrangements do not have the normal action-and-consequence cycle in politics.  The subvention comes from London.  It seems no matter how poor the decisions are, the cheque keeps coming for public services.  It would appear that in an electoral sense in some cases no matter how poor the decision-making is the votes keep coming.  Are these failings evident in the data seen by the witnesses?  What if we chip the fundamentals of the economy in terms of the inputs, resources and general context that we are dealing with, even if we factor in the unnatural divisions?  Can that be cut up better?<\/p> <p>  All of this is important in terms of the debate about constitutional change because for many of us changing the paradigm is the motivation.  It is the fact that we believe perhaps the only way to get good governance is to change the constitutional arrangement as it has not been working here.<\/p><p>Can the witnesses see that in the numbers?  Can they see how better decision making and better governance could have better outcomes, even looking at the fundamentals of this society and economy?<\/p><p> I also have a brief question on Brexit and its impact, further to Deputy Conway-Walsh's questions.  I agree about the potential opportunities.  The SDLP has been saying for the past three or four months that while we are handed lemons, we are trying to make lemonade in terms of realising those opportunities.  Can the witnesses comment on what the Assembly, the UK Government and bodies such as Invest Northern Ireland, Invest NI, need to do to realise those opportunities and in which sectors they see them?  Again, I see governance as a big problem here because investors are surely looking for stability and certainty in the rules and the environment in which they are going to be trading.  Will the witnesses comment on things we could do to prime those sectors in order to realise those opportunities?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021050400002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Claire Hanna","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620082800,"counter":349,"content":"<p>Does Professor Morgenroth wish to speak about Brexit first?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021050400002#P00200","nonspeaker":"Professor John FitzGerald"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620082800,"counter":350,"content":"<p>I will start with Brexit.  There are two aspects.  First, from an outside investor's perspective, if one looks at Northern Ireland and at what has happened recently, the violence that received air time not just in Ireland but also internationally is not very helpful.  This simply perpetuates a view that Northern Ireland is not a stable, secure place in which to invest for an external investor.  That is very difficult to fight.  The pictures that go out on international television stations are really damaging.  We can do without that.  It serves no purpose and undermines any good one might try to do.<br\/><br\/>From an institutional perspective, be it Invest NI or others, there is a difficulty, which Irish firms are also facing.  If a business is currently being supplied by a GB supplier and that supply is now becoming more expensive because of non-tariff barriers, where will the business find an alternative supplier?  If it is a small company, that is a really big task.  This is something we find in Ireland, where many companies have had UK suppliers.  We have seen the stories in <i>The Irish Times <\/i>about bakeries and flour.  It is not difficult to find flour.  It is a homogenous commodity.  One can get flour of an identical quality in France, but if one has a small bakery and one does not speak French or have connections to the French flour milling industry, how is one going to find a supplier?  That is the biggest issue many of these firms in Northern Ireland are facing.  If they are trying to make use of the fact that they can now get supplies from within the EU and use Northern Ireland as an entry point to GB for EU goods or intermediate goods, they do not have these connections.<br\/><br\/>Traditionally, we have always looked at exporting and promoting exports, but we might need to find ways of promoting imports and of connecting firms to potential suppliers.  That is something we face south of the Border and there is the same issue north of the Border.  One could probably replace pretty much every product that currently comes from GB into Ireland or into the island of Ireland with an EU equivalent.  I have done some research on this.  It is quite remarkable.  The problem is that one is not going to know where one will be able to buy it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021050400002#P00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Edgar Morgenroth"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620082800,"counter":351,"content":"<p>On governance, it would be interesting for the committee to have a session on what the Republic could learn from Northern Ireland because there are things it could learn.  In 2005, I met Mr. Michael Brennan, the then head of the economic service of Northern Ireland's civil service.  He had 120 economists.  Our Department of Finance was getting rid of its economists.  I asked him whether he could lend us a few.  When I spoke to our Department of Finance, though, it told me that it did not need economists.  Look at what happened in the Republic.  If we had had a few Northern Ireland economists, matters might have been different in the Department.  The committee could also consider the reform of the PSNI in respect of the Garda and the Northern Ireland Housing Executive in terms of managing social housing.  I will leave those matters for another day.<\/p> <p>  In terms of governance, there is a natural experiment in the UK involving Scotland and Northern Ireland.  Scotland has run with the ball whereas Northern Ireland has fought over the ball, the consequences of which we can see.  Ms Hanna mentioned how the cheque would keep on coming.  I was on the Northern Ireland Authority for Energy Regulation 15 years ago.  A scheme came up that I called a waste of taxpayers' money, but I was told that it was the UK taxpayer and that the money was coming to Northern Ireland, and I was asked how I could say \"No\".  It was still daft.  On the other hand, I once went to the UK Treasury representing Northern Ireland and came away incensed.  We had a scheme that would have saved money for Northern Ireland's consumers and UK taxpayers, but the Treasury told us that nothing good came out of Northern Ireland.  It was a frustrating experience.  My Northern Ireland colleagues were so used to it that they just laughed, but I was incandescent with rage after the experience.  There are problems, but Scotland has run with the ball.  Even if it is UK taxpayers' money, making good use of it makes sense.  As we saw with the renewable heat incentive, RHI, scheme, what is happening is corrosive.  Northern Ireland has a budget and the freedom to reallocate it.  Instead of saying \"We want more\", Northern Ireland should take responsibility for the budget.  Doing that is difficult, but Scotland has done it.

Before I get to my points, I will give some context.  It is worth stressing that the issue of educational under-attainment in Northern Ireland is a factor in some of the current tensions.  It is not cited as being a part of the protests, but it is there in the background.  It contributes to young people being vulnerable to exploitation by paramilitaries due to the absence of other alternatives for them.  In the educational context, I wish to stress the importance of good career advice and the need to break down the false hierarchy between academic and vocational pathways.  That hierarchy has been a feature in all parts of the UK for many decades, which tends to put us in a slightly different position from what is, on balance, found in some of the EU's countries, in particular Nordic ones.<\/p> <p>  I wish to flag four questions, although I do not expect comprehensive answers to all of them.  The first question is on corporate tax.  I am a sceptic on this matter now.  The time has moved past.  What could be the consequences of an even greater differential opening up between the North and the South, given that the UK Chancellor has announced plans to raise the UK's corporate tax rate to, I believe, 26% in three years' time?  To what extent does the differential contribute to a different type of investment in the South versus the North?  The South has been able to attract more what could be termed profit-based centres with a higher gross value added, GVA, whereas Northern Ireland has attracted more cost-based centres due to the different incentive packages available to them.<\/p><p>Looking to the future, to what extent can we think about opportunities to collaborate on a North-South basis, not just in terms of higher education but also around things like apprenticeship opportunities in terms of placement of students from the North into the South and <i>vice versa<\/i>?  This is not just for apprenticeships, but also work experience and other vocational training.  What approaches might be taken?<br\/><br\/>I flag an ongoing problem we see around the mutual recognition of professional qualifications and how that may impact collaboration on a North-South basis.  In the context of Brexit, I understand there has been limited progress in bilateral agreements being made between different professional bodies.<br\/><br\/>Given that climate change will be the central challenge for us around the world over the next 30-plus years, to what extent is there an opportunity for North and South to collaborate in the development of green economy interventions, given that we share an island?

Northern Ireland has not legislated for a target on climate change.  It is behind the curve when compared with GB.  GB, on certain things, has been a leader.  For example, it introduced a floor price for electricity, which has closed coal in Britain.  If Northern Ireland had introduced that as well, it could have closed Kilroot, but it would also have closed Moneypoint.  Now in the Republic we are talking about banning coal but if we do things here and the North does not, that will create issues.  More co-ordination on the island is important, but also on these islands.  It would help if Northern Ireland co-ordinated better with GB as well.<\/p> <p>  Mutual recognition is an important point.  I understand that an architect in Northern Ireland cannot certify a building in Dundalk.

There is no reason somebody in Mayo - Westport was mentioned earlier - could not be part of a project team with somebody in the North and <i>vice versa<\/i>.<\/p><p>I ask Professor Morgenroth to talk about the opportunities around the new technological universities, in particular the Connacht-Ulster Alliance comprising Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, Sligo IT, Letterkenny IT and Magee College.<\/p><p>I acknowledge what Dr. Farry said about apprenticeships.  A new apprenticeship plan is being developed.  There is no reason that some part of what will likely be four-year apprenticeships could not be done in the North.<\/p><p>I ask Professor Morgenroth to speak about the Connacht-Ulster Alliance and the return on investment in education being ten times higher than other types of investment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021050400002#S00500","speaker":"1501"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620082800,"counter":359,"content":"<p>Our paper started out looking at broadband, but we then decided to examine not just broadband but also education and a lot of other infrastructure.<\/p><p>We considered start-ups and attracting foreign direct investment.  The study is now published in the <i>Journal of Regional Science<\/i>, which is a top international journal.  We found that education is just so much more important.  We also found that without a high level of skills in an area, broadband is a waste of money because people need to have the skills to use it.  The two aspects complement each other; they are not substitutes.  Just investing in broadband is not really going to get a good return, particularly if there is a low level of human capital in the first place.  That leads to the point the Deputy made on how a skills base can be generated in the more rural areas.  This is clearly an area in which the institutes of technology, or technological universities, as they are now going to be called, can play a particular role.<br\/><br\/>As Professor FitzGerald mentioned, cross-Border collaboration between Letterkenny and Derry and Ulster University seemed like an obvious thing to do.  It is a question of how to do it.  The Deputy mentioned this.  There is now a Department responsible for higher education so it may be time that we came up with a strategy.  This is positive.  It has nothing to do with one's political persuasion.  In general, educational investment is a no-regrets policy regardless of the community one comes from.  Therefore, we should really maximise this.  To some extent, however, we have to realise that some of the institutes of technology and universities are competing.  We are all looking for student numbers.  Again, that is something to bear in mind when thinking about how to deal with this.  <br\/><br\/>It was noticeable the last time I looked, although I have not looked for a while, that while we might have low numbers of university students crossing the Border, the numbers are much more pronounced for institutes of technology.  I looked at the figures for Dundalk at one point and saw a very small number crossed the Border.  There was pretty much nobody crossing from the South to the North.  That is quite striking and probably not very good.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021050400002#S00600","nonspeaker":"Professor Edgar Morgenroth","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620082800,"counter":361,"content":"<p>Deputy Brendan Smith talked about how people who go on to third level can be kept in the area.

It is surprising that they go somewhere like Liverpool Brookes, where they are paying very high fees, when they could probably go to the Republic.  Better still, resources could be reallocated in Northern Ireland to allow more students to study there.<\/p> <p>  A really important feature of the institutes of technology is that they have been tied to the local labour market.  For example, if healthcare equipment is a big issue in Galway and Mayo, GMIT prepares students for it in terms of certificate and diploma courses.  The institutes' tie-in with the local labour market and skills needs has been undervalued in the Republic.  The absence of something like that in Northern Ireland has been a problem.  One of the problems in the North is that there is a need to reallocate resources to provide more places.  In the Republic, we can do so much, and we can do a lot more in terms of co-operation, but Northern Ireland has to make choices for itself on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021050400002#T00200","nonspeaker":"Professor John FitzGerald"},{"type":"speech","time":1620082800,"counter":362,"content":"<p>I believe Professor FitzGerald is right.<\/p> <p>  We have not mentioned Covid at all.

My background is working in the welfare system and I continue to do so on a daily basis.  What Professor FitzGerald said very clearly is that the welfare system in the North is much less than that in the South.  It is grossly inferior and I come across this on a daily basis.  Certainly the recent introduction of universal credit has caused tremendous problems.  If we look at what the Tories are doing, they seem to be intent on demolishing the last two pillars of the welfare state, namely, the welfare system and the NHS.  In the 1860s, Isaac Butt said in the British Parliament that the poor are often talked about in the House but never entertained.  Nothing has changed.  This leads, of course, to health inequalities.  A report a few years ago by the chief medical officer in the North indicated that people who lived in the leafy suburbs of Finaghy in Belfast had a longer life expectancy, by ten years or more, than someone who lived in the city centre.  This, of course, is due to poor diet and lack of funds.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the convergence, and convergence is a word that has been mentioned quite a lot today, of this type of system on an all-Ireland basis, there is a myth abroad, very much in the North, and I deal with both sides of the community on a daily basis, that the system in the North is better.  It is not and Professor FitzGerald has addressed that.  Perhaps this is something we need to start a bit more publicity on that people in the North are much worse off with regard to benefits.

I was listening to the debate but I was not in a position to log on officially in Leinster House until now.  This has been a very good debate and I welcome the witnesses.  I listened with intent about Letterkenny, which is my neck of the woods, and the reference to collaboration with Derry.  The heads of two educational institutions came before the committee recently.  Mr. Paul Hannigan and Mr. Malachy O N&eacute;ill both gave presentations on how they are collaborating, which they do in a number of ways.  It is about how they build on this.  I wanted to point out this collaboration, although perhaps it is not as much as we would like to see.  Both institutions in this case are very open to collaborating.<\/p><p>The presentations were very good.  We have heard of the polls and the ongoing drip from the poll by Kantar and the <i>Irish independent<\/i>, with all the talk about people wanting a united Ireland but not being able to afford it and that people are not prepared to pay for it.  I am really afraid that before the debate gets going the myth will be put out there that it is completely unaffordable and that we cannot afford Northern Ireland.  It is off-putting for many people.  I would envisage any arrangement North and South having a similar lead-up to that of the Good Friday Agreement, and I mentioned this on the previous occasion the witnesses came before the committee.<\/p><p>I envisage that the United States would have a role to play in that and that both Governments, Westminster and Dublin, would have a major role to play also.  I also envisage a possible concluding agreement being based on financial supports from Europe and the US.  I would like the witnesses' views on that.  I am not in a position to tell anybody what to do but if they agree that such a model is out there, so to speak, it would help the debate if they were to agree that such a possibility is out there also.  I do not believe in the myth that this is not affordable.  I believe it is absolutely affordable over a transition period.  There is a model in the South on which we can work in transforming Northern Ireland.  There are major areas of deprivation in Northern Ireland, much more so than in the South.  That is not to say my county has not suffered.  It is still suffering and we are trying to get what we deserve.  I would like both witnesses' views on that.

I support what Senator Blaney said.  If we look at what happened in Germany, there was a rush on the part of both the east and the west to have unification with consent but there was an increasing tax burden on people.  We are in the opposite position here.  If unification ever does happen a significant minority may not want to be part of a united Ireland.  In the poll published in the <i>Sunday Independent<\/i>at the weekend the question of who would pay for it and whether people would accept an additional burden was raised.  If and when it ever happens we would need to have an international fund involving the EU, the United States, our Republic and the United Kingdom that would plan for and meet some of those deficits over an agreed period of years.<\/p><p>The most important point that Professor FitzGerald and Professor Morgenroth have brought to the table is the same one they made on the previous day.  It is that the inequalities in education at the very basic level prevent ordinary people in the North reaching their full educational capacity and that those who do get that advantage do not work there to any significant extent.  Too many of them leave the North and work elsewhere.<\/p><p>What we need is a plan for the coming years.  Senator McGreehan mentioned that each Department would have a dedicated unit to examine where it might go and how it might converge.  We need people like the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, before the committee<b><\/b>to itemise some of those other issues.  In any event, it is a huge task and if we do not have consensus in that regard, it will not work.  That is my view.

There are six other areas for co-operation.  Would Professor FitzGerald or Professor Morgenroth see merit in a seventh implementation body being established in the area of further and higher education and innovation to give a structure to the type of issues we want to see addressed?  Professor FitzGerald rightly referred to the fact that in the late 1960s or early 1970s when the regional technical colleges were established, their remit was to be a driver and a major contributor to much-needed regional and economic development.  They have been hugely important.  He rightly cited their importance in attracting particular industry clusters and providing the skilled people and the people with expertise to service and lead those industries.<\/p><p>My understanding is that the further education colleges were established with a similar remit.  Having chaired one of those colleges in its early days, I have seen that one of their great traits and successes has been that they have improved access to education.  They catered for many people who, after the leaving certificate, would not have gone on to an institute of technology or a university.  In many instances, those young people went to a college of further education and then progressed to institutes of technology and universities.  We all know plenty of young people who not alone went on to get primary degrees but got master's degrees as well.  Access and progression are important.  Would the witnesses see merit in a structure being put in place on an all-Ireland basis to try to tackle those particular issues?<\/p><p> Like Professor Morgenroth, I very much regret the low numbers of students from Northern Ireland who are in colleges in the South and, similarly, the low numbers of students from the South who are in colleges in the North.

The big proviso here is that it should be a body that ends up doing what it is supposed to do.<\/p><p> On Senator Blaney's question, affordability is a bit like a beauty contest.  What someone thinks is beautiful, another person might not see that way.  I can only talk about what we have seen in the past.  In Germany, the cost was extremely high but, by and large, people were willing to pay the price.  As academics and economists, the part we can contribute is to identify the costs and let people decide whether it is a price they are willing to pay.  To do that, it is necessary to elaborate in much more significant detail on what it is we are looking at if we are thinking about a united Ireland.  That is the thing nobody did in Germany.  It happened overnight, there was total consent.  I do not think you would have found too many people who would have been against a united Germany at the time.  Also, there was no referendum.  Germany does not have a culture of referendums in any event.  It happened and then people reacted to it.<\/p><p> We should learn from Brexit and the referendum relating to it, which had absolutely no plan attached.  We have the opportunity to look at the issues we have - we have discussed quite a few but there are many more - look at the economic implications and then let people make a decision on that basis, if and when the time comes.  That is the important thing.  Ultimately, we are all agreed that we are looking at Northern Ireland, the Border region and Ireland, as a whole, having the best outcome.  We all want to achieve the highest level of prosperity in the broad sense.  Obviously, different people have different views as to how we might achieve that but that is ultimately the aim and it should be the aim regardless of whether there is a poll.  We are all hoping that people have a better life.<\/p><p> To respond to a question from Mickey Brady, life expectancy in the Republic of Ireland is nearly a year longer than in the North.  There are issues in that regard.  We might think the NHS is a better system, it still does not get a person longer life expectancy.  There are many issues we could continue thinking about that.  Ultimately, we need to consider the sorts of scenarios we can envisage and what are the costs.

Remember that Ireland is one of the richest countries in the EU.  The EU will contribute a token but it will be a token.  The case in terms of the US is similar.  Even with the complications involved, a united Ireland would still be one of the richest countries in the world.  I do not think expecting the rest of the world to provide a subvention is realistic.  In the context of an exit, the UK might be prepared to run down its subvention over a period of ten years.  I would be nervous about that, first, in the context of trusting whether it would continue and, second, that the window of opportunity would be well used.  In other words, when making the change, in order to avoid the need for a huge transfer from South to North in order to make it sustainable, there would be a need to transform the Northern economy.  Would this lead to delays?  For example, instead of dramatically changing the educational system on day one, would people say that we could delay doing so for?<br\/><br\/>The substance of our paper is that Northern Ireland needs to make the change now, whether it is for unification or to continue within the United Kingdom.  If it does not do so, it will find itself in a difficult place within the United Kingdom or will make a united Ireland very difficult.  It is the urgency of using the opportunity rather than expecting a <i>deus ex machina<\/i>or a fairy godmother or godfather to wave a magic wand and make it all come right.<\/p><p>We have to do it for ourselves.<\/p><p> I share Professor Morgenroth's opinion on North-South co-operation and implementation bodies.  If it can work, it can work.  Energy and climate change would be priorities for me.  That is where we need to work together.  I represented Northern Ireland, among others, in the negotiations with the Republic on setting up the all-island electricity market.  One of the reasons it worked was there was no implementation body and it passed under the radar.  It still works.  It is up to the politics of Northern Ireland to determine whether there should be a formal body or what will work there.  We need greater co-operation on energy, the environment and climate change.  That will also involve co-operation with the other island.  That is important.  Until now, the United Kingdom has been a leader on climate change, although I am a bit suspicious as to whether that is going to continue.  There has been a lot of talk.<\/p><p> We have talked about Germany.  Our job as researchers is to be honest with the people and tell them the costs involved.  This committee is discussing all the issues, and the economic costs are probably the least of the issues compared with how to create an integrated system.  Civil servants will probably need to be fired, North and South, to produce a more efficient system.  We must consider how to tell the people, North and South, what it means to set up a system.  We have to be upfront about the economics.<\/p><p> I have worked extensively in Vietnam over the past decade.  It is another country that has reunified.  The process there was pretty bloody and, thankfully, that is not relevant to Ireland.  It is interesting that I have not met anybody in the Administration from the rich south of Vietnam who is living in the north.  They do not work in the north because they are paid much more in the south.  The situation in Vietnam was that the poor North Vietnam took over South Vietnam and left the south of unified Vietnam to be rich.  That system that has worked in Vietnam but on a small island, I am not sure it would work.  To integrate, consideration would have to be given, as it was in German reunification, to the integration of the welfare system, wage rates and so on.<\/p><p> There has been a lot of talk about subvention.

We will be submitting our annual report to the committee in June.<\/p> <p>  It goes without saying that 2020 was a year of enormous challenge for the OPR, similarly to every organisation and citizen in the country, as we grappled with the Covid-19 pandemic.  It is a great credit to our staff and those we work with that the challenges posed by the pandemic were not only met but overcome.  All of us have very successfully adjusted to a new and flexible way of working.  It is also a great credit to the planning process in general, which the Government designated as an essential service from the get-go, that An Bord Plean&aacute;la, local authorities, the OPR and the Department maintained, to the greatest extent possible, delivery of planning services throughout the year.  Work continued unabated in preparing the plans that will shape our future, informed by learnings from the pandemic, in assessing planning applications and appeals, undertaking enforcement and conducting a wide range of research, training and public awareness exercises.  The pandemic also gave us as citizens and communities the opportunity to pause and reflect on our future, coincidentally and helpfully at a time when local authorities were preparing a new generation of city and county development plans right across the country. <\/p> <p>  I will now address our three statutory functions, focusing on the assessment of statutory plans, as the committee requested, but also mentioning reviews of local authority planning functions and our education, training and research and awareness functions.  Regarding our statutory assessments of local authority development plans, we engage proactively with all local authorities throughout the plan-making process, from before the plan is published through the various different stages.  We made 110 observations and 93 recommendations across 45 stages of plan-making processes.  Members of the committee will be aware that a development plan goes through various different stages, from the initial pre-draft to a draft to material amendments and so on.  We made quite a lot of observations and recommendations.<\/p> <p>  It is important to remember that the Oireachtas established the OPR not to set planning policy but to perform independent and thorough scrutiny of such plans, in order to ensure that the public are confident that the authorities reasonably and consistently apply relevant Government policies.  These include important matters like securing urban and rural regeneration, and the targets for same in the Government's national planning framework; the appropriate levels and locations for zoning of land for future development; how we move about; the delivery of quality and affordable housing; ensuring vibrant city and town centres; and a deeper respect and care for nature and our environment in planning for the future.  Over 2020, the vast majority of our recommendations were implemented by local authorities.  Ultimately, we only had one case of a recommendation to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to use his statutory powers under section 31 of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2018 to make a direction, which he accepted.  I have included some figures and tables at the end of my submission to make that point.  We worked very well with local authorities through 2020.<\/p> <p>  On the review of planning functions, we completed preparations and initiated our programme of systemic reviews of the procedures used by local authorities in the delivery of planning services.  There are currently two local authorities going through that review process, which will hopefully wrap up by the first half of the year or going into the second half.  All the preparatory work for that was done in 2020.<\/p> <p>  In relation to promoting public awareness of planning, research and training, the stand-out success of my team was the move to put in place an unprecedented level of training in planning for the 949 local councillors across the 31 local authorities, in conjunction with our colleagues in the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG. There were five events in total in 2020, which were attended by over 600 elected members of local authorities.<\/p> <p>  In our corporate functioning, we fully complied with all governance and financial procedures, implementing the code of practice for the governance of State bodies and we took possession of our permanent premises on the Technological University Dublin campus in Grangegorman, Dublin 7.<\/p> <p>  There are some key themes to our submissions on statutory plans.  I hope members of the committee have had a chance to look at the tables at the end of my statement.  The areas highlighted show where our independent and statutory assessments of local authority plans cover frequently recurring topics, including, for example, the issue of properly reflecting statutory ministerial planning guidelines across a range of topics from flood risk management to transport, housing and other matters.  The second issue was the consistency between statutory plans and the objectives of the regional spatial and economic strategies and the national planning framework.  Regarding the current round of regional strategies, we had no role in their development because they predated our establishment.  Lastly, there was the issue of climate action and ensuring that plans contain specific and measurable commitments to influence future development patterns and forms in a way that cuts energy needs, increases renewable energy sources and adapts to the effects of climate change.<\/p> <p>  Our sense is that the interventions we have made in the plan-making process are generally taken as constructive input to ensure that, like the proverbial jigsaw, all the pieces of our local authority plans fit together and that we have good alignment, which good government depends on, between national, regional and local policies.  We are getting there as local authorities are now monitoring that much more closely.  For example, when we issue a submission on one local authority, other local authorities are looking at that, anticipating and learning right across the sector.<\/p><p>That is a good thing.<\/p><p> I want to highlight some of the recent commentary on the work of the OPR which has, at times, been unhelpful and inaccurate in terms of the statements made about our work.  I refer in particular to some contributions made on 1 April during a debate on a Private Members' motion on Project Ireland 2040.  There were accusations that the work of the OPR was an assault on rural democracy and that we act in a dictatorial fashion.  There seems to be a pattern in that and other subsequent commentary seeking to suggest that our statutory role is attempting to restrict rural development when that is far from the case.  Indeed, any proper reading of our submissions will reveal that, taking our lead from Government policy, the OPR encourages a plan-led approach to rural development, in particular the renewal of many of our smaller towns and villages that many members of the committee would probably agree face a very uncertain future.<\/p><p> What is more striking about the commentary, however, is that it seems to be harking back to a previous and darker era of planning in this country when there was absolutely no oversight of the quality, effectiveness or cohesion of the roles of local elected members, local authorities and so on in determining and delivering planning functions.  We know what that gave rise to, namely, systemic failures and the establishment of the Mahon tribunal and, ultimately, the OPR in order to give back to the public confidence in the quality of the operation of the planning process. <\/p><p> As we grapple with battling our way out of the pandemic and face the even bigger existential challenge of climate change, we all need to work together for the common good and to align local, regional and national aims.  The Government has, to its great credit, hugely developed and strengthened not just the policies but also the investment going in to secure the very concept of proper planning and sustainable development called for in the preamble of the Planning Act passed by the Oireachtas. <\/p><p> It is true that local authorities have some discretion as to how to reflect these policies at local level, but it is not a limitless one.  The Oireachtas decided that in 2018 with the passage of legislation around the OPR.  Going further back, the statutory duties on councils to properly apply strategic policies existed long before our establishment.  The difference now is that, following the will of the Oireachtas in legislating for the OPR in 2018, we are statute-bound to oversee and ensure that relevant national and regional policies are actually implemented in broad intent and detail.<\/p><p> We are barely two years old, yet we have, in my view, built a strong and effective resource to bring about the better planning outcomes that government, the Oireachtas and, most importantly, ordinary citizens want to see.  I think of the hundreds of elected members who are attending the first ever national planning training programme for councillors, our research and practice notes for local authority planning staff, our planning leaflets, 14 of which have recently been published for the public, and the wide range of online resources available on our website.  <\/p><p> We have hit the ground running.  We are working hard to strengthen the integrity and cohesion of our planning process.  Moreover, we are confident that many of our submissions on development plans are seen as very positive and constructive advice in the development of the next generation of statutory plans and that they will represent major advances on many fronts.  Ms O'Connor and I are happy to take any questions for as long as the committee has time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021050400002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cussen","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620082800,"counter":389,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Cussen.

The fact that we have independent oversight of those development plans by the OPR is critical and important to that process.<\/p> <p>  The move towards plan-led and evidence-based planning has progressed over the years.

My question relates to the north fringe, which is undeveloped land lying between Fingal County Council and Dublin City Council.  Has the OPR considered the issue of land that sits between local authorities?  I refer in particular to the decision of Fingal County Council more than 15 years ago to allow large-scale development on the edge of a city without any of the services, such as community services and so on, that were needed and the impact that has had on the wider community in Finglas and on other fringe areas along the M50.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021050400002#B00300","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620082800,"counter":391,"content":"<p>Does the Deputy want to add a second question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021050400002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cussen"},{"type":"speech","time":1620082800,"counter":392,"content":"<p>My second question relates to height.  The previous Government's decision to allow height strategies to be set aside has had an impact.  I will outline an example.  Santry and Ballymun sit very close to each other.  One will benefit from a metro scheme but the other will not.  However, all of the large-scale development over the past 12 to 24 months has been in Santry.  That is because the height strategy has allowed development to take place where developers wanted it, rather than where councillors and officials might prefer to be.  What is Mr. Cussen's view on the height strategy?  Has the decision to set it aside benefited planning or does it need to be revisited?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021050400002#B00500","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620082800,"counter":393,"content":"<p>On the Deputy's first question on the north fringe and lands that straddle local authorities, he has raised a very good point.  We are raising this with Dublin City Council and Fingal County Council in respect of the co-ordination of plans for the areas the Deputy knows very well and which abut each other.  In some parts of Finglas, one does not know when one has crossed the border from the city council to the Fingal county area because it is part of a single community or area.  It is important that the plans are similarly joined up.  It is an area on which we were not especially strong before the Government strengthened the strategic framework for planning.  We will examine this matter.<\/p> <p>  When we examined a recent variation of Dublin City Council's development plan for some of the areas north of Finglas village, this was a specific point we made and we are following it up with Fingal County Council and Dublin City Council in terms of how their respective development plans will co-ordinate on this issue.  It is critical, in particular with the extension of the Luas network to Finglas which will be close to the area. <\/p> <p>  Going back to the regional spatial economic strategy which identifies areas that are strategically important along what will be the Maynooth DART line, which straddles the Dublin City Council and Fingal areas, it is important that there is a co-ordinated approach.  That also needs to extend eastward towards the area where the Deputy correctly identified there have been issues in terms of development getting ahead of social and community, rather than physical, infrastructure.  That can present issues. <\/p> <p>  We will examine this closely and engage with the relevant local authorities and encourage them to reach out to each other.<\/p><p>They do a lot of that themselves through various structural arrangements.  We will also be examining how the quality unfolds in the written statements, including the maps that the local authorities publish as part of their development plans.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021050400002#B00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cussen","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620082800,"counter":395,"content":"<p>What about the height issue?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021050400002#C00200","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620082800,"counter":396,"content":"<p>I am just coming to that now.

I share his concern about some of what I would describe as the attacks made recently on the Office of the Planning Regulator.  I want to be very clear about the fact that Deputies and councillors have every right to criticise policy.  That is what we are elected to do.  What concerns me about the comments, however, is that the criticism is not being directed where it should be, which is at the people who took the policy decisions, who in the first instance include the outgoing Government, in terms of the national planning framework, and the politicians involved in the regional assemblies.  I do not want anybody to suggest I am saying politicians should not criticise but, as Mr. Cussen stated clearly, it is not his office that makes the policies; it is politicians who do so and, therefore, criticism should be focused appropriately.<\/p><p>To inform the public debate, it would be very helpful if Mr. Cussen talked us through the issue of where the policies were decided on population targets and densities with respect to the national planning framework and the regional spatial plans of the regional assemblies.  Where a councillor in a certain council is not happy with the population targets and strategies, it is important that he or she understand who decided on them.  That is my first question.<\/p><p>My second question is with respect to a piece in the <i>Business Post<\/i>that seemed to suggest there was a departmental circular issued in the past week that somehow introduced flexibility into the density requirements.  My reading of that circular is that it introduces no such thing and that it is consistent with the broad approach of the national planning framework and regional spatial strategy.  If Mr. Cussen could clarify the facts of this issue, it would be very helpful.<\/p><p>Compact growth is a key part of Government policy.  It is a concept I support but when I examine what is being built, particularly outside the M50 in my constituency and in the commuter belt, I note that much more housing is being built in Kildare, Meath, north Wicklow, south Louth and west Dublin than inside the canals of Dublin city.  Could Mr. Cussen comment on that and give us his reflections on why he believes it is the case and why Government policy is not being adhered to given that compact growth has been a policy for some time?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021050400002#C00800","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620082800,"counter":402,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his comprehensive array of questions.  On the question on where the policies were decided, let me answer for the benefit of viewers and, indeed, the public.  The Minister can publish statutory guidelines under section 28 of the Planning Act.  There are around 30 of those, some of which date back quite a while.  Some of them, such as those on density, date back a couple of years.  The guidelines are published from time to time and there are consultative processes involved.  The views of the public are sought.  Usually, there is a large group of experts who advise the Minister.  Again, going back to what Deputy McAuliffe said, there are always balancing acts accounting for a range of views and so on.  The density guidelines date back a couple of years.  As Deputy &Oacute; Broin said, the Department recently issued a circular to local authorities that was not revising those guidelines but maybe drawing out some of their more salient elements.  I might ask Ms Anne Marie O'Connor to contribute on this because some of the issues that arose regarding density of development arose in the context of some of our assessments of plans.  Ms O'Connor can give an example of what arose and how we address it.  We are quite comfortable with the circular that was issued in that it highlights some of the approaches that are needed, particularly to managing the development of the edges of smaller towns and villages.  What is wanted is a blend of densities, ranging from higher densities in the centres of towns and villages to lower densities at the edges, remembering that towns and villages perform an important role in planning, providing an alternative to the pressure that often arises for one-off housing or sporadic housing at the edges of towns and villages.  Local circumstances have to be accounted for carefully.  One must judge carefully the densities that might be regarded as appropriate in particular locations.  The circular was really bringing out some of the detail in the previous guidelines.<\/p> <p>  On the last question, on compact growth, much of the housing delivery has tended to be in suburban or greenfield locations.  That is a point of concern.  We highlighted it in our annual report for 2019.  We conducted an analysis of house-building trends.  We will be looking at these more closely in the context of our 2020 annual report.  This gets to the heart of the broader housing challenge, which I am not here to discuss in detail, but there is no doubt that there are challenges ahead in delivering housing at the quantum and of the quality required, and ensuring affordability in our city and town cores.  The Government has been very clear about this.  People need homes.  For various reasons, it seems that it is challenging to deliver those homes, be they for purchase or rental, in a way that makes them affordable if they are closer to city and town cores.<\/p> <p>  Greenfield development is fairly straightforward.  The developer opens a site and gets stuck into it and so on.  Working on brownfield sites, urban regeneration and renewal require a very integrated, intricate approach.  One is working within existing communities that sometimes have very different views on what is appropriate in certain locations.  It tends to be more contentious and difficult.  Even though the infrastructure is often much more available, it can sometimes be very difficult to assemble sites and make them work with the existing fabric, but that is why the urban regeneration and development funds and various measures the Government is putting in place are so vital.  I might just invite Ms Anne Marie O'Connor-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021050400002#C00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cussen"},{"type":"speech","time":1620082800,"counter":403,"content":"<p>I am sorry but I have to interrupt.

We are in a crisis and there is great demand for all types of residential properties and all types of tenure.  I live in the constituency of Dublin South-Central, within which huge developments are planned on brownfield sites along Davitt Road, Bluebell and Kylemore.  They are close to the Luas and to the city.  There is an interesting balance, or interchange, between a need for density, climate and land availability, and all of these come into play.  How does Mr. Cussen adjudicate on infrastructural supports and their adequacy with regard to predictions for schools, existing village type infrastructures and amenities?  He has commented on how intricate it is.<\/p> <p>  One evening recently, a good friend counted all of the white vans she saw on a walk in the Bluebell and Kylemore area.  She counted more than 60.  She has also counted taxis.  If we look at the existing types of employment in these areas how do we protect them so that future residents have the possibility of similar employment given the reduced parking capacity and high density apartments?

They worked very hard on them and we are delighted with the feedback.  In fact, we would like to do more because anything that can be done to explain the workings of the planning process to people and how they can engage with it is great from our point of view.<\/p> <p>  The Senator asked about infrastructural supports and how we assess them and engage with them.  To reassure her on this point, we have a particular statutory role and we engage with other infrastructural providers, particularly through watching, listening and engaging with them in the context of their statutory engagement with the plan making process.  These include the Department of Education and the various transport agencies, Irish Water and the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  We maintain a close network with them regarding what they say on schools provision, amenities and the physical infrastructure.  As we put our view together, we keep an eye on ministerial guidelines, which stress the importance of engagement with soft and hard infrastructure providers when going through the plan making process and stress the tiered approach to zoning.  There is a lot at the back of the NPF which, in a nutshell, requires local authorities to ground their plans on solid evidence that the various infrastructure agencies know what is coming down the tracks and have made, or are capable of making, provision accordingly.  Plans are not flights of fancy and not a case of build it and they will come.<\/p> <p>  There are many arrangements in the plan making process.  We will be looking at this and the veracity of it, in other words, whether the local authority has evidently done its homework on all of this engagement.  Clearly if a number of infrastructure agencies stated they are short of this or that and do not have the budget, it would call into question the soundness of a plan where there was doubt about whether the money would be there for the necessary infrastructure.  The Government is putting &euro;116 billion into the NDP and billions of euro into urban regeneration funds and many other infrastructure funds.  It is putting serious investment behind the planning frameworks.  The resources are there where there is a focused, prioritised and structured approach.  We are the backstop to make sure the homework is done.<\/p> <p>  The Senator raised a very interesting point about Bluebell, Kylemore and Nangor Road.  I know the area well.  They are probably areas that are transitioning as they move from warehousing and industrial use with a mix of residential into more mixed use residential and new employment and new opportunities for local communities.  The Senator touched on a very important point.  It is very important that the plan making process is mindful of the needs of the existing community and the particular functional needs it has regarding issues such as parking, where people will use their work vehicles or where they will locate their work vehicles once an area has gone through a development phase.  We will be watching this very closely through the local plan making process.  I cannot highlight enough the investment of resources and time and space being available to go through the detail of this at the local plan making process.<\/p> <p>  We have not yet seen the local plans that will fill in a lot of this detail.  The city and county development plans set out a very high level framework and then the urban master plans and local area plans come together.  South Dublin County Council and Dublin City Council, as the Senator is probably aware, are working on an arrangement to facilitate this coming forward as and when the main county development plans are finalised.

I have been very critical of An Bord Plean&aacute;la on the record because for a number of years it has had it in its plan but does not seem to have progressed it.  I ask Mr. Cussen to speak to this because it is a very interesting way of communicating.<\/p> <p>  While I accept the independence of the office, will he share with the committee its relationship with An Bord Plean&aacute;la, other planning authorities and groups and the Department?<\/p><p>We need to understand where the office fits into all of that.<\/p><p> On the issue of local authorities, I am familiar with D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown because that is where I live.  I spoke to some members before Mr. Cussen issued his report and they said they were waiting to see what the Office of the Planning Regulator says about them.  There was an anticipation and it is clearly well documented in the media that the office suggested there were over-zoned lands in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  Who is available to assist the elected members to decide which lands should be down-zoned versus others?  For the past 25 years there has been a history of land zoned residential in D&uacute;n Laoghaire that has never been built on.  The elected members will have choices now but I am not sure if they fully understand their powers in terms of that choice.  Mr. Cussen knows that, ultimately, this is a reserved function.<\/p><p> I wish Mr. Cussen well.  He is two years down.  He is respected greatly across the local government sector.  <\/p><p> We need to do more to assist the elected members, many of whom are new, in doing their work.  Mr. Cussen's office is doing a good deal.  Covid is a problem but it has literally become a full-time job for many local councillors and they need support.  I will leave that with Mr. Cussen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021050400002#D00300","speaker":"1634","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620082800,"counter":409,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator, and I thank him for his kind words.

I take issue with personalised attacks, however.  The team I have working with me in very difficult circumstances through Covid have been exceptional.  All of them are hard-working public servants and they are doing a job that is expected of them by the public.  It is set out under the statute so when we are into the territory of name-calling and so on I do not think that is appropriate.  There have been some very good pieces in the media from other parliamentarians about people being thoughtful in respect of the language they are using.  It is not a good aspect of public life when we are calling people names and so on.  That is not appropriate.  The appearance here today is one of the few opportunities I have to set things out from our point of view.<\/p> <p>  We absolutely get the piece about the elected members at local level being passionate about their areas.  We are all from different areas of the country.  We are all very passionate about our local place.  We absolutely get that.  We want to do more to support the elected members.  My team here are engaged in literally monthly training events, as the Senator knows, sometimes with more than 200 elected members registering in individual events.  Is it not a sobering thought that now that our office is established, which reflects the vision of the Oireachtas and so on, this is the first national training programme for planning done nationwide and on a regular basis?  <\/p> <p>  In terms of supports and notes, there are many different materials available for download from our websites.  We video our events.  The presentations are available.  Papers and pamphlets have been prepared and we will do more on that.  We will engage with the elected members to see how they can be supported more while at the same time remembering that their advisers are the executives of the local authorities.  The officials in the local authorities are there to support, inform and advise the elected members in respect of their statutory functions.<\/p> <p>  I am glad the Senator raised the impetus on online planning because Covid has put into sharp focus that the planning service probably was not quite where it needed to be in terms of the delivery of online services.  It is perhaps a bit more complex for planning than other aspects of public services.  A planning application, as the Senator knows, is a complex beast with many different drawings and papers, especially if it is a large scheme.  It is different from renewing one's television licence.  I refer to how one views that and the infrastructure that has to go on in the background in servicing that.  That is probably the reason An Bord Plean&aacute;la has taken more time than it would have liked to deliver a proper online service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021050400002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cussen"},{"type":"speech","time":1620082800,"counter":410,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Cussen.

I have been at council meetings, as many of us probably have, where the Department, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, the National Transport Authority, NTA, the chief executive or the senior planners may be advising councillors not to adopt a certain objective that has been submitted as part of a development plan process or a local area plan and councillors decide to ignore that advice and proceed to approve that and have it included in a draft plan or a plan.  That plan then has to be inspected by Mr. Cussen's office, which then makes a recommendation to the Minister and the Minister may make a direction to the planning authority to correct or amend an objective that does not comply in his or her view.  Could he explain that process to us?  Is there scope for a councillor who does not agree with it to be able to appeal to Mr. Cussen's office to highlight that or should it be expected that the Office of the Planning Regulator, OPR, is so well resourced that it can take the time to view all of these plans and issue recommendations on them?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021050400002#E00500","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620082800,"counter":413,"content":"<p>In a nutshell, we have a good team in the OPR that will examine the plans and all the different views that have fed into them because we get the chief executive's report and the story, so to speak, of how the plan has been prepared in a particular instance.  Our job is always to compare the broad shape of a plan with the requirements of national and regional policies, the guidelines published by the Minister and so on.  Ours is not a job to impose our view of planning.  It is purely to read the plan across to what the national planning framework, the regional strategies and various ministerial guidelines have recommended or require local authorities to do in different instances.<\/p> <p>  In the example the Chairman mentioned, if a local authority, say, in finalising its development plan makes an amendment that clearly breaches a requirement of national policy or Ministers' guidelines that comes back to us for assessment in terms of whether the breach is serious or strategic enough that it would warrant making a recommendation to the Minister to issue a draft direction.  That draft direction is subject to a focus process of public consultation.  The outputs from that are also taken into account in a report of the chief executive back to the Minister as to how to give effect to the Minister's draft direction.  It is then for the Minister to finalise the process.  We have a good system and procedure, and expertise, internally to read the plans carefully.

For example, we are working closely with the City and County Management Association, the Local Government Management Agency and the Department in undertaking a decent baseline analysis of the exact staffing across the various local authority areas.  It is difficult to get very detailed statistics on the people and skills that are in different local authorities.  As part of that work, we also hope to employ that knowledge and evidence in the development of a learning and development strategy that would inform training, reskilling and even looking at skills deficits where there is perhaps a gap.<\/p> <p>  Another area of our work that I would like to mention is our review function.  We are looking at local authorities.  I hope that next year, when we are back into full operation once the Covid restrictions that are hampering us a little bit at the moment are eased, we will review five to six local authorities on the broad scope and delivery of their planning functions, how they compare with their neighbours and in terms of national yardsticks.  We have published a methodology for undertaking the reviews, which is on our website.  We developed it with the local authorities, the Department and the various stakeholders.  That will give a very good picture over the next year or two of where the various local authorities are at.<\/p> <p>  If you grant me a little bit of leeway, Chairman, I will say that the issue of resources is pressing.  It goes back to the point raised by Senator Boyhan on the need for investment in online services.  Planning application fees in this country have been static since 2001.  My recollection of the National Oversight and Audit Commission's report of 2018 is that it cost approximately &euro;140 million to run the local authority planning service, net of the board, and fees represented approximately 17% of the cost of running the service.  That is probably one area for examination in the context of ensuring that local authorities have the income that is needed to defray the cost of running what is becoming a much more complex planning process than has been the case heretofore.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021050400002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cussen"},{"type":"speech","time":1620082800,"counter":421,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Cussen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021050400002#F00300","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1620082800,"counter":422,"content":"<p>I have a couple of quick questions.  I will try not to focus on what other members have already asked.  Could Mr. Cussen comment on the observations that have been made on the D&uacute;n Laoghaire development plan in terms of zoned land for housing?  It seems odd to me that the planning regulator would make such a decision on somewhere within the county of Dublin in the midst of a housing crisis.  I want to know the reasoning and the rationale behind the observations on the zoned land.<\/p> <p>  Second, I want to ask about the eplanning framework and some of the more practical ends of what happens in planning.  We have proposals on strategic housing developments, SHDs.  There is a very limited timeframe for residents to engage in what are very complex planning applications.  I wish to ask a couple of questions on that.  In terms of the dissemination of the website, has the planning regulator done anything to result in some of those websites being taken down?  Currently I can go onto the local authority website and I can have a look back through plans for recent years.  All of that documentation is with the developer of the strategic housing development.  For the sake of posterity, how do we maintain those plans and ensure they are easily accessible and can be researched, in particular as so few of them are actually going to be built given that the sites are being flipped?<\/p> <p>  In terms of local authorities getting plans online, as we always do, we had a rush of applications on 23 December.  There was a short period when people could make observations on plans.  I am aware of cases in a number of inner city sites where we had three to four days following the information going up in the middle of the pandemic to get it online.<\/p> <p>  I also have a question on finding planning applications on the An Bord Plean&aacute;la website.

Could you keep some time at the end for her, Chairman, to respond on that specific point?  There were a lot of very positive aspects of that development plan that we were very happy with, but there was one issue we thought needed to be looked at more closely.  It would be erroneous to suggest that we were calling the D&uacute;n Laoghaire development plan into question in any significant way.  We might just have some time for Ms O'Connor to come back on that point because she manages that part of the operation.<\/p> <p>  On the SHD, the operation of the website, and eplanning generally, I must be honest with Senator Moynihan that we have probably not had the focus we would like on online planning services.  One thing we have been doing is undertaking a survey of the effectiveness of the online offer of the various local authorities in terms of their planning application viewer facilities, how quickly drawings go up online, how easy it is to navigate and the quality of what one can see online, among other issues.  We will publish that shortly.

The online planning application project is coming along and will be trialled in Tipperary County Council in the very near future.

There is a subtlety in terms of the D&uacute;n Laoghaire development plan that perhaps is not there in some of the other plans that we have dealt with that have been more straightforward.  What happened in that instance is that the D&uacute;n Laoghaire plan came out around the same time as the new Government guidelines on housing supply targets, so the local authority did not have the benefit of the guidelines and data to inform and develop the plan.  What we identified when we were reviewing the plan was that there was perhaps a misalignment and that too much land had been zoned to accommodate the number of housing units that would have been predicted through the guidelines and through the housing supply targets.  Our submission is really to try to address that and focus on it.  One of the previous speakers talked about choice; that is the case in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, it is about trying to prioritise and making sure we prioritise and develop first the areas that are better located in terms of access to public transport and other social and physical infrastructure in advance of the more remote areas that are still dependent on new infrastructure, particularly public transport.  That is the subtlety around the D&uacute;n Laoghaire development plan.  It is not that we are saying D&uacute;n Laoghaire should not grow.  We should remember the national planning framework goes up to 2040.  All we are dealing with is the six-year plan period.

I very much welcome the establishment of the Office of Planning Regulator.

Often a plan will go online and the website is then taken down.  We were talking earlier about the importance of planning enforcement and how it is under-resourced.  It is important that communities have access to those plans because planning enforcement often occurs when people in a local community say, \"Wait a minute, I don't think that is what got planning permission.\"  They then check the plans, contact a councillor, Deputy or the planning enforcement section of the council and the matter is then investigated.  Not having access to those plans is very serious for local communities and planning enforcement.  Can the regulator take action to ensure SHD plans are available online in an accessible format and are not lost when websites are taken down but are made available or stored elsewhere?  It is important that the OPR do that.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to the way in which Dublin City Council and Fingal County Council interact and the work the regulator is trying to do to ensure there is co-ordination between them.

Close to where I live, between Baldoyle and Portmarnock, there is a park that separates the two areas.  Similarly, Portmarnock and Malahide are separate areas.  That is important for identity.

That point is in the same vein as another we just discussed.  We will certainly examine that more closely on foot of this engagement.  The facility to see drawings online through the SHD process and the websites established by the proposers of particular projects duplicates the paper file, which is always available.  The Deputy is asking, in effect, if and how those particulars can be hosted in some shape or form on the local authority website, as would be the case with normal section 34 applications.  The Deputy makes an interesting point, and I understand exactly what he is getting at.  Representatives of local authorities will be before the committee soon, so the Deputy could raise the matter with them.  However, I will be happy to look at it more closely and revert to the Deputy with the information we get.<\/p> <p>  As a rule of thumb, given that the normal section 34 application, the particulars approved and so on are available online, people should also be able to see what was submitted in SHD applications.  If they have a sense that something is awry, they will then have an instant point of reference rather than beating their way to the council office, queuing at the counter and so on.  In fairness, local authorities encourage people to use the online facilities.  There has to be a solution to that.  I have made a note of it and we will take a closer look.  I thank the Deputy for raising the matter.<\/p> <p>  We hope that the quality of the integration of the plans will be enhanced because of our work.  Before our establishment, no one was doing that work.  Nominally, the Minister or Department would have had the oversight role but Ministers, in a normal sense, are reluctant to get into very close detail and have other more strategic issues to address.  The benefit of our office having a multidisciplinary team with the time and focus to look at how the pieces of the jigsaw click together is that we can probably drive a much improved and much better integrated set of plans in the future than we have seen in the past.  <\/p> <p>  The Deputy made an interesting point about urban villages.  The local area plan guidelines and the forthcoming urban design guidance on which the Department is working cover this issue in one sense.  The national planning framework includes many good policies around identity.  It is the case that our major urban areas should not grow in such a way that a person travelling from one district to another will have no sense of place or identity.  The Dublin city development plan, in its current iteration, promoted very strongly the urban village concept where particular nodes, centres or districts in different parts of the city would have an identifiable sense of being distinct from other parts of the city and would perform different functions.  People want to have that sense of community and identity.  It is very important to bring that out in the local plan-making process.  The Deputy should watch that space, particularly around the urban design guidance coming forward from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  Ultimately, it is a matter for the Minister and Government to set the policy.  There are good foundations to that policy approach in several of the documents I mentioned and it will probably be strengthened further in the area I mentioned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021050400002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cussen"},{"type":"speech","time":1620082800,"counter":428,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Cussen for appearing before the committee for this important discussion.

Like many other members, I come from a local authority background having served as a county councillor for almost a decade.  I represent Dublin Mid-West which stretches from Palmerstown and Lucan through to Clondalkin and across to the villages of Rathcoole, Newcastle, Saggart and Brittas.  It is a constituency with two strategic development zones, Adamstown, Ireland's first SDZ, and Clonburris, which I and others feared did not deliver a holistic plan of phased development along with much-needed infrastructure.  There is a plethora of active SHDs and a fairly large volume of large planning applications.  Dublin Mid-West is, therefore, very much a growing area but what we want is to be a growing community.  We want to grow in a cohesive way that delivers infrastructure and amenities hand in hand with housing and protects the history, heritage and character of the seven villages.  Mr. Cussen said that planning is all about balance.  That is the balance that many of my constituents want us to strike in Dublin Mid-West.<\/p> <p>  The Office of the Planning Regulator has responsibility for the review of planning functions.  What are its findings and recommendations with regard to SHDs and whether they have achieved their objectives?  Has the OPR found the prevalence of SHDs has led to an increase in judicial reviews?  On SDZs, is the OPR looking at ways of using the experience of existing SDZs to shape the process for new ones?  For example, residents in Adamstown feel their experience should be taken on board by the planners who will oversee the development of the Clonburris SDZ.  Similarly, has the OPR given any consideration to appointing for each of the SDZs a local point of contact that could report to local authorities on a quarterly basis?<\/p><p>I would love to hear Mr. Cussen's views on planning regulations in general, not just in the context of strategic development zones and strategic housing developments.

Mr. Cussen made similar comments.  In my area, during the level 5 lockdown, an SHD was proposed on lands adjacent to the Foxhunter pub.  People were hiking into the city centre, despite the 5 km restriction, to lodge their submissions on the development.  That was not fair and probably highlighted for many people who would not be in touch with An Bord Plean&aacute;la too often that some of the system is still archaic.<\/p><p> To give Mr. Cussen some feedback on his collaboration with the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG, and the planning education he has been doing with county councillors, I know many of my local Fine Gael councillors attended his sessions and found them extremely useful.

That is a simple statement of fact.  As our annual report from last year showed, and our annual report from this year will show, the amount of judicial reviews has increased somewhat.  They are a tiny fraction of the 30,000 planning applications that are decided by planning authorities every year, around the majority of which there are little or no judicial reviews.  We are talking about a very small subset but, nonetheless, there have been significant increases from a low base.  Much of that has related to SHD cases, for a variety of reasons.  We have not looked at that in any close detail at this stage.  It is important to remember that, under the programme for Government, the SHD process will come to a close early next year.  I hope that good things have been learned from the SHD process.  The planning process has been in a constant state of reform and evolution since it was introduced in October 1964.  The planning process we have now is unrecognisable when compared with that in place a long time ago.  It therefore follows that we will, I hope, have learnings to take from the SHD process to, if you like, apply in a reform context in terms of looking at the process now and how it might evolve into the future.  The mandatory pre-application consultation and engagement with different stakeholders is a good, strong point.  These are matters of which the Minister and the Department must take account.  I gather the Department has a group working on some of those learnings.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also raised a question about enforcement and resourcing.  My colleague, Ombudsman and Information Commissioner, Mr. Peter Tyndall, has highlighted every year in his area of work that enforcement is a big area of complaint to the Ombudsman's office in the context of individual matters in which we are not allowed to be involved.  We are looking at the overall system.  We have a good day-to-day engagement with the Ombudsman's office in terms of the performance of local authorities in that area.<\/p> <p>  Going back to the response I gave to some of the earlier questions, we will be looking at and analysing more closely in the coming 12 months or so where the different local authorities are from a resource standpoint for the delivery of planning services.  We will also do reviews.  We have two authorities going through the review process right now.  We ask a series of questions across 11 different broad headings, one of which relates to enforcement, how authorities are delivering and how that compares, etc.  All of those reports will ultimately be published.  The Deputy will see the output of that in due course if she gives us a little bit of time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021050400002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cussen"},{"type":"speech","time":1620082800,"counter":431,"content":"<p>I have a few questions to which I would like responses.  There are numerous developments going on in Cork city and county at the moment.  My concern has been the infrastructure, especially in my constituency of Cork North-Central where there are issues.  There is no northern ring road or road infrastructure.  Articulated and heavy goods vehicles run through residential areas.  If we are talking about sustainable planning, there is a proposed light rail system for Cork with no connection on the north side of the city.  There is a deficit in the whole areas of planning sustainable communities, jobs and education.  Planning needs to be balanced.<\/p> <p>  Churchfield Industrial Estate is an area in Cork North-Central where there are a number of recycling and waste collection services in the middle of the residential areas of Gurranabraher, Churchfield and Farranree.  The estate is surrounded by sports grounds on the other side.  How these facilities ever got planning permission in the first place is a mystery to me.  A new recycling centre has set up without planning permission.  It is getting a bin collection service.  We are talking about planning and enforcement and people are just riding roughshod over the regulations.<\/p> <p>  I have serious concerns about regeneration and densities.  I come from Knocknaheeny which is an area of Cork city that has been regenerated.  There are also places such as The Glen and Mayfield in which there have been social issues.  My worry is that if we keep the densities high, it will be counterproductive to the work we are doing in trying to regenerate these areas.  The density issue is important.  Mr. Cussen spoke earlier about high, medium and low-density areas of regeneration.  I believe the areas about which I am talking should be low density so the social issues can be tackled.  I have raised a few points on which I would welcome the thoughts and comments of Mr. Cussen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021050400002#H00300","speaker":"1453"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620082800,"counter":432,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  It is nice to hear from Cork.  My immediate point of concern in what the Deputy said is the unauthorised development.  If he has evidence that a particular development in the waste management sector is taking place without planning permission and causing impacts on the community, that has to be dealt with in the strongest of terms by the planning authority.  Waste management facilities, if not carefully managed, have the potential to have impacts.  That will ultimately be a matter for Cork City Council.<\/p> <p>  I hear what the Deputy is saying about the issues around numerous developments in Cork and the north inner city area.  These matters are, first and foremost, for Cork City Council.  The Deputy is probably aware that Cork City Council has begun the process of renewing its city development plan.  The Taoiseach and the Government unveiled a tremendous investment package for the city in the context of urban generation under Project Ireland 2040.<\/p><p>The metropolitan area transport strategy of the National Transport Authority is coming forward.  While there may be issues about its reach into the north inner city, these are all matters to be teased out in the context of the city development plan.  The good news is that there are unprecedented levels of resources being invested by the Government in the regeneration of those areas.<\/p><p> The Deputy, being familiar with Cork, will be well familiar with the historical imbalance in the strategic development of Cork, resulting in many social issues in some parts of the northside and a lot of growth, particularly along road corridors, on the southside.  The Cork area strategic plan, CASP, process tried to address this previously when there were very few resources on the table.  I genuinely believe the city development plan is the opportunity to try to tease out these issues, including that of density and the question of what is appropriate to a given location.  In striking the balance on density, people will say we should have an approach involving very low density but, where this occurs, residents are moved increasingly far from the amenities and services, which can be accessed only by car.  Some people might not have the means to have a car, or it might not suit them because of their age or another reason.<\/p><p> People also talk about the ten-minute or 15-minute city or town.  That requires the striking of a balance and good design not necessarily in high-rise development in a particular location but in the reasonably effective and decent use of the land we have available.  Once we build on land, it will be a long time before it is renewed.  Any development will be in place for generations so we need to take our steps very carefully.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021050400002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cussen","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620082800,"counter":434,"content":"<p>Mr. Cussen referred to the Government's recent announcement of &euro;405 million for Cork, with &euro;350 million for the docklands.

Wexford County Council is one of the first in this regard.  In Wexford, but also in many local authority areas, there is concern over rural planning.  My argument is essentially that the difficulty for the Office of the Planning Regulator is its interpretation of \"local rural area\".  There is a legitimate fear in many rural communities that the office does not understand the nature of local rural settlements.  The submission the office would have made to Wexford County Council, for instance, was effectively interpreted as stopping all one-off rural housing because it meant small villages and rural nodes would be impacted if we allowed rural development.  The concern is really that the Office of the Planning Regulator may not understand rural settlement patterns.  One of the difficulties in many villages is that there are no water and wastewater facilities.  This means there is no possibility of building in such a village.  Also, the land may not become available where families have land in rural areas.  What I am looking for is an assurance from Mr. Cussen that where a family is living in a rural community, the Office of the Planning Regulator is not going to stop them from being able to apply for planning permission in the area.<\/p> <p>  The second question, concerning the impact of planning on rural communities, is on the inadequacy of water and wastewater infrastructure.

Such issues have been prevalent in Wexford and many counties close to Dublin that are dealing with an overspill.

Will Mr. Cussen share his thinking with us?  Is there a general consensus among people in this area?  I have concerns about an increase but also understand that someone has to pay for it.

On his last question, planning fees are set by the Minister.  It is ultimately a matter for the Minister to determine planning fees.  As the Senator said, they were most recently revised in 2001.  From the point of view of the administration of the planning process and how it works in an overall sense, local authority executives are faced with the dilemma of an ever-increasing requirement for resources in the planning process, enforcement, local plan making, pre-application consultation, online services and all manner of technical and environmental assessments that are required in a much more detailed way.  Local authorities must be able to resource that while running libraries, keeping street lights on and cleaning streets, all the good stuff that they do and people take no notice of until the services are missing.<\/p> <p>  There is a case to be made for looking at fees.  A planning application for one house may include people going out and doing site inspections, checking the site notices, undertaking the technical assessment of the drawings, all of that sort of stuff.  Is it reasonable that the level of income coming back on that public process is a &euro;65 administration charge?  Is it right or fair that taxpayers and ratepayers pay for that service that benefits an individual or developer who is carrying out a particular project or projects?  It is something we need to look at because there is an unreasonableness about asking more and more of planning authorities and so on.  They may be struggling to put their resources together.  It is fair to say in terms of staffing sanctions and so on that the Department and the Minister have been supportive of local authorities increasing staffing and so on.  Staffing is only one thing because staff also must be paid.  Various different functions have to be resourced etc.<\/p> <p>  The online planning service may also offer efficiencies.  There are some new technologies, including remote sensing, artificial intelligence and being able to map development patterns much more efficiently from satellite imagery.  Some fantastic work is being done by Ordnance Survey Ireland with great scope for integration into the planning process and online planning services.  Covid-19 has taught us the absolute criticality of online services.  Although many planning services are available online, I think we need to improve the quality of the offer.  Committee members earlier pointed to a couple of gaps that need to be looked at in that regard.  Those considerations fundamentally come back to the resourcing piece.  I understand the Minister intends to look at the area of planning fees in the context of the roll-out of online planning services.  As has been the case in other Administrations, people can be encouraged to engage more with the online service by differentiating planning fees between the online transaction and the paper transaction and so on and so forth.  I am sure all of that is being looked at by the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021050400002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cussen"},{"type":"speech","time":1620082800,"counter":464,"content":"<p>I confirm I am in Leinster House.  I will start by thanking Mr. Cussen and his team for the work they are doing.  I echo the comments made by my colleague, Senator Seery Kearney, about the planning leaflets.  They have gone down well with anyone who has used them and with whom I have engaged.  I compliment our guests in that respect.<\/p> <p>  The development plan process is ongoing across the country at present.  Waterford, for example, has targets to grow by 30,000 to 35,000 people over the time period covered by the Project Ireland 2040 national planning framework.  It is in that context I will make my comments.  It is essential for us to have sufficient zoned land to be able to facilitate development.  It is not as much of an issue in Dublin where most of the land is already zoned or can be interchanged to facilitate development.  In our regional cities where there is room for further expansion, it is important that we do not place onerous restrictions on local authorities.  We must allow them the scope to facilitate development over the lifetime of this plan and beyond.  In that context, would Mr. Cussen agree that we should be treating differently the likes of the brownfield sites, about which he spoke earlier?  If a local authority is going to take a former industrial zoned parcel of land that no longer has that function and encourage residential development on it, the authority should not be penalised by putting that in with its residential zoning.  Such a development could be treated in parallel.  Is there scope for that?  Is that something to which Mr. Cussen would be amenable?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021050400002#L00400","speaker":"1647"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620082800,"counter":465,"content":"<p>I might bring in my colleague, Ms O'Connor, to answer some of the specifics on this matter if there is time.  I thank the Senator for his comments about the leaflets.  We are delighted with that feedback.  A theme running through the conversation this morning has been that planning is, ultimately, about choices.  One of the choices that has clearly been teed up in the national planing framework is that planning authorities structure their development plans so that it is advantaging urban regeneration.  There is a target in the national planning framework to secure 40% of residential delivery in our key urban centres from brownfield development.  The question I would put back to the Senator is if we zone all the land for residential delivery, assuming that it can all take place in greenfield locations, when or how will brownfield regeneration ever happen?<\/p><p>The cards are stacked against regeneration if large tracts of land are being zoned and there is a much more straightforward and simpler solution.  How will it be possible to regenerate the north quays of Waterford or some of the central urban areas if there is not a measured approach to ensuring greenfield and brownfield endeavours and that they are working in tandem?<\/p><p> This is critically important from the perspective of infrastructure requirements as well.  I refer to where we have infrastructure in place, as we do in the case of the north quays in Waterford, in respect of rail access, water services and the ability to walk to the fantastic centre of the city.  Yet, we are then going to zone the land for whatever we would like to take place on the north quays and also in the wider greenfield context, while providing the same infrastructure.  We are encountering a double cost by increasing infrastructure and not getting regeneration.  The development plan, therefore, is the forum to tease out these issues.  Much of this activity comes down to phasing and how the development is structured.  Ms O'Connor might want to comment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021050400002#L00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cussen","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620082800,"counter":467,"content":"<p>Mr. Cussen has set the situation out well.  When we talk about the concept of density in our submissions, that is related to this aspect.  I refer to the number of houses local authorities must provide and how much land they must zone to achieve that aim.  If local authorities use too low a density in that calculation, it means they are overestimating the quantum of land needed.  This is the classic issue, as raised earlier, of how can we avoid a situation where easier greenfield sites are developed but not the brownfield ones.  Sites zoned on the edge of centres are likely to be developed in advance of more central and compact growth.  It undermines the whole basis for the plan, namely, to develop a sustainable settlement and transport strategy.<\/p> <p>  The issue regarding infrastructure is also important.  It confuses matters and makes it much more difficult for the infrastructure agencies to decide where they are going to invest.  It also makes it more difficult in providing schools.  We have a forum where we discuss these issues with the Department of Education and Irish Water, for example, to attempt to tease out these issues when we are considering making submissions on development plans.  It is an aspect of which we are aware.  We are also aware that there is only a certain amount of money and the focus must be on where such investment should go and on aligning it with the zoning of residential land, for the most part.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021050400002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Marie O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1620082800,"counter":468,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair.

I suspect, however, that we are not going to be able to conclude our discussion of this issue today.  A critical part of the vitality of rural Ireland is unlocking the development conundrum and the resulting potential of some of the smaller towns and villages, particularly in the Senator's part of the world in the south-east.  In Tipperary, there are approximately 160 or 170 smaller towns and villages.  I cannot recall the exact number.  We must, therefore, strike a balance between trying to service them all, or the ones deficient in services or infrastructure, and working within a programme, while at the same time supporting sustainable rural development.

I have one question now on densities and another on the appeals process in respect of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I refer to the view that the OPR is trying to force higher densities on provincial towns.  A town such as Gorey, for example, is no different from Newbridge, Navan, or Clonmel.  The idea in respect of higher densities is that we must look at building duplexes and apartments, when there is not a market for them in many of those towns.  My home town of Gorey has a population of approximately 11,000 people now and it is growing rapidly.  If we talk about developer-led endeavours, developers like higher densities because packing in more people will enable them to make more profit.<\/p> <p>  However, demand in those provincial towns is not for that higher density of development but for three-bed, semi-detached starter homes.  From the perspective of getting houses built, it is more difficult for developers expected to build blocks of apartments because there are many more complications, as Mr. Cussen will be aware.  It is much harder to provide housing if we focus on that approach.  <\/p> <p>  My final question, because I will not get a chance to come back in, concerns An Bord Plean&aacute;la and appeals.  Mr. Cussen mentioned some reviews happening in that regard.  However, one of the big challenges for housing and infrastructure generally concerns cranks, as I will call them, but Mr. Cussen would not, in the system lodging appeals to An Bord Plean&aacute;la against planning and holding up major infrastructure projects.  What actions can we take against such objectors?  I am not talking about people who have legitimate issues, obviously, but about people who, for whatever reason, object to projects over on the far side of the country and, in turn, delay the planning process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021050400002#M01800","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620082800,"counter":484,"content":"<p>Those are ultimately matters of policy for the Minister and the Department.  I am not going to be drawn on so-called serial objectors and so on.  That is for the Oireachtas.<\/p> <p>  If we have time Ms O'Connor might say something on density.  I would not want this to be seen as our response to the Wexford development plan but the Office of the Planning Regulator is not insisting on apartments or duplexes in various rural or small town locations.  All we require is a broad consistency with the Minister's own guidelines.  They refer to an average density of around 35 dwellings to the hectare, which is about making effective use of building land that is extremely expensive to service.  We were just talking about the Irish Water issue a minute ago.  Most people listening to this might wonder what 35 dwellings to a hectare looks like.  It is like a modern, 1990s of 2000s housing development, which is different from the much lower density estates of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.  It is wrong to say that it is getting into apartments, duplexes and so on.  Our assessment of some of the development plans recently have concluded that local authorities are actually putting quite average or low densities into their development plans so that they can then use it as a basis to zone more land in a more extensive, sprawled approach around towns and villages.  When the Minister's guidelines seek an average of 35 dwellings per hectare for that category of towns, we have to point out that a development plan that is founded on the basis of promoting densities of 25 dwellings to the hectare or less is not in broad compliance with the guidelines.  That is not to say that one might lower the densities in one particular part of a town or village because of the nature of the character of the area, and increase it in another, that is all envisaged in the Minister's guidelines, we are just pointing that out.  We are not in the business of setting policy, we are in the business of ensuring that it is reflected.

Once we see that in a plan, that is the benchmark we are looking for.  We are not looking to see 12 storey towers in places like Gorey or anything like it.
