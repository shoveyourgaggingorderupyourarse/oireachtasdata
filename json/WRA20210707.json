Specifically, the Code requires regulated entities to disclose, on a dedicated section of its website, details on charges that may be imposed on personal consumers in arrears. In addition, the Code provides specific information to be provided to personal consumers where an account remains in arrears 31 calendar days after the arrears first arose. Such information includes the interest rate applicable to the arrears and details of any charges in relation to the arrears that may be applied.<\/p>  <p>  Separately, if the Deputy is referring to the interest charged on judgment debt, this is governed by legislation under the remit of the Minister for Justice. The Courts Act 1981 (Interest on Judgment Debts) Order 2016 (S.I.

Revenue issues Remote Bookmakers&rsquo; Licences in accordance with provisions of the Act and collects Betting Duty from the operators concerned. Revenue&rsquo;s role in this area is confined to that of a tax administration i.e. the collection of the relevant taxes and duties and the issue of the relevant excise licences on foot of:<\/p>  <p>  - payment of the relevant excise licence fee,<\/p>  <p>  - confirmation of tax clearance status by the applicant for a licence,<\/p>  <p>  - confirmation that the applicant for a licence has a Certificate of Personal Fitness as provided for in section 5 of the Betting Act 1931. <\/p>  <p>  A Certificate of Personal Fitness is a certificate indicating that an individual, or the relevant officers of a body corporate, is a fit and proper person to hold a Remote Bookmaker&rsquo;s Licence.  For applicants that reside in the State, the Certificate of Personal Fitness is issued by the superintendent of the Garda Sioch&aacute;na located where the applicant ordinarily resides.  For applicants that reside outside of the state, the Certificate of Personal Fitness is issued by the Minister for Justice and queries in that regard should be addressed to my colleague.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Justice may revoke a Certificate of Personal Fitness for stated reasons which are outlined in sections 5(C) and 6 of the Betting Act 1931. The Minister may also apply to the District Court for the revocation of a Remote Bookmakers Licence. In such instances Revenue will be informed of the revocation and will remove the relevant entry from the register.  It is also open to a Court under section 17 of the Betting Act 1931 to direct that an operator be removed from the Register of Remote Bookmakers in cases of conviction for an offence under that Act.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy is asking about a specific entity which, it is understood, has had its licence from the UK Gambling Commission suspended and is currently in administration in relation to its trading activities in that jurisdiction.  I am advised by Revenue that an entity trading under the same name is currently on the list of Remote Bookmaking Operations licensed in this State under the 1931 Act.<\/p>  <p>  It will be for the UK courts alongside the administrators to resolve issues relating to the collapsed firm, including the potential for return of funds to affected consumers.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, on a broader note, the Deputy may be interested to know that the Department of Justice is currently leading work on legislative proposals to comprehensively reform the regulation of gambling activities in Ireland and to provide for an independent Gambling Regulator. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070700083#WRC03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":77,"content":"<p>Question No. 52 answered with Question No. 51.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":78,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070700083#WRC03700"},{"type":"question","counter":79,"qnumday":53,"qnumall":"[36743\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070700083#WRC03800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will address the anomaly in which an e-bike qualifies under the cycle to work scheme but an e-bike kit does not; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1594","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":80,"content":"<p>It is understood that the Deputy is referring to an e-bike conversion kit, which enables a push bike to be converted into an e-bike. <\/p><p>I am advised by Revenue that section 118 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides that a charge to tax will generally arise where an employer provides a benefit to a director or employee.<\/p><p>The Cycle to Work scheme provides for an exemption from this charge to tax and allows an employer to purchase a bicycle and safety equipment for a director or employee without a taxable benefit-in-kind (BIK) arising.

An employer may incur expenditure in excess of the above limits, and this does not preclude the employee or director from availing of the exemption, however any amount in excess of the relevant limits will be liable to tax. A salary sacrifice arrangement is subject to the same monetary limits.<\/p><p><b>- Time Limit -<\/b>an employee or director can only avail of the Cycle to Work scheme once in any 4-year period, commencing with the date the employee is first provided with a bicycle or bicycle safety equipment. Prior to 1 August 2020 an employee or director could only avail of the Cycle to Work scheme once in any 5-year period. A salary sacrifice arrangement is subject to the same time limits and any salary sacrifice arrangement entered into must be completed within a 12-month period.<\/p><p>An e-bike conversion kit of the type referred to by the Deputy would not be covered by the Cycle to Work scheme or salary sacrifice arrangement as it does not meet the definition of a &lsquo;pedal cycle&rsquo; and would not come within the other allowable expenditure category of &lsquo;bicycle safety equipment&rsquo;, as set out in the legislation. <\/p><p>The inclusion of such kits in the scheme would create an additional cost and that cost must be recovered elsewhere.

These reforms will involve bringing new homes, which are currently exempt from LPT, into the taxation system as well as providing for all money collected locally to be retained within the county. This will also be done on the basis that those counties with a lower LPT base are adjusted via an annual national equalisation fund paid from the Exchequer, as is currently the case. <\/p>  <p>  My colleague, the Minister for Finance, recently published the Heads of the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Bill 2021. The Bill will give effect to a package of measures in line with the Programme for Government to address the future of the LPT. Minister Donohue also signalled the Government&rsquo;s intent to move to 100% local retention from 2023. Any changes to the allocation process may be considered in that context.<\/p>  <p>  As the LPT revaluation process is likely to take a number of months, detailed information on the new yield per local authority will not be available until later in the year. Accordingly, LPT allocations for 2022 will provisionally be based on updated information regarding the 2021 yield, on a no change basis i.e. the 80:20 model. All other elements are also be based on 2021 figures, including the LPT baselines, the equalisation contribution and self-funding of housing and roads from surplus LPT. It is recognised that the yield will change following the revaluation and the matter will be revisited at that point. <\/p>  <p>  My Department recently confirmed provisional LPT allocations to local authorities for 2022 amounting to &euro;528m. These allocations include the Exchequer contribution to equalisation funding of &euro;34.3m. There will be no change to allocations for the 20 local authorities requiring equalisation funding, as their LPT yield is below their funding baseline. When detailed information on the new LPT yield becomes available, my Department will progress work on the planned move to 100% local retention of LPT and the effects on the funding system for local authorities. <\/p>  <p>  As previously, every local authority has the power to vary the basic rate of LPT in their local area by up to 15%; those variation decisions have not yet been made and are not reflected in these allocations. The proposed LPT Amendment Bill referred to above will bring forward the deadline for notifying Revenue of the Local Adjustment Factor (LAF) to 31 August in a revaluation year, such as this year.

The Expert Group is tasked with examining the current model of funding, its effectiveness in delivering quality, affordable, sustainable and inclusive services and considering how additional resourcing can be delivered for the sector to achieve these objectives, drawing on international practice in this area.

Phase 1 of this consultation and engagement took place between August and December 2020, comprising a call for submissions, a parental poll, two webinars and focused discussions with providers, practitioners and parents. Phase 2 is now complete, and involved a series of facilitated events that brought together a broad range of participants to engage deeply in the conversation about how the various issues of affordability, sustainability, quality and inclusion interact and how the new funding model can best support these objectives.

These developments have been crucial to throughout the pandemic, and will continue to be after it subsides.<\/p>  <p>  There are a number of measures in place to ensure affordability for parents. Families may be entitled to subsidies under the NCS, which aims to improve outcomes for children, reduce poverty, facilitate labour activation, and tangibly reduce the cost of early learning and childcare for tens of thousands of families. The scheme comprises of two types of subsidies: <\/p>  <p>  - A universal subsidy for children of pre-ECCE age who are availing of ELC services from an approved provider. The universal subsidy is not means-tested and is available to all qualifying families of any income level.  <\/p>  <p>  - An income-assessed subsidy is payable for children from 24 weeks to 15 years of age who are availing of ELC\/SAC services from an approved provider. The level of subsidy is determined by the family's reckonable income. <\/p>  <p>  With NCS, those earning less than &euro;26,000 net per year will get the highest level of subsidy for up to 45 hours per week, provided they are involved in some level of work, or some study, significantly contributing to affordability. <\/p>  <p>  NCS offers different types of application processes to suit families and ensure they are being assessed on the most accurate and up to date circumstances.  For example, families can apply for a &lsquo;Sudden Change Assessment&rsquo; option allows for applicants to declare that they have had an ongoing change to their income. This applies to people who have lost a job or their income has reduced on an ongoing basis for reasons outside of their control as may be the case in the context of the economic impact of Covid-19.<\/p>  <p>  Since the onset of Covid-19, my Department has put in place a range of supports for ELC\/SAC services. The objective of these supports have been to:<\/p>  <p>  - support providers&rsquo; sustainability to enable services return to normal once restrictions were lifted; <\/p>  <p>  - support providers to retain their staff; <\/p>  <p>  - ensure that ELC\/SAC could reopen and remain open, even at very low levels of occupancy; <\/p>  <p>  - nensure that ELC\/SAC could operate safely for children, families and staff; <\/p>  <p>  - ensure that increased costs associated with public health requirements, and lower demand \/ occupancy were not passed on to parents; <\/p>  <p>  - achieve administrative efficiency through the continued use of existing funding schemes and other whole of economy supports; and <\/p>  <p>  - protect exchequer investment.<\/p>  <p>  Supports have included the continuation of DCEDIY subsidy schemes on an ex-gratia basis (12 March &ndash; 5 April 2020); the Temporary Wage Subsidy Childcare Scheme (6 April &ndash; 28 June 2020); the Reopening Funding Package (29 June &ndash; 23 August 2020), the July Stimulus Package that included the EWSS and a Sustainability Fund (from 24 August to end December 2020) and tailored funding arrangements to respond to Level 5 restrictions in the post-Christmas period, that included a new Covid-19 Operating Support Payment and a new Covid-19 strand of the Sustainability Fund, in addition to continued eligibility for the EWSS.<\/p>  <p>  Following engagement between my Department and the Department of Finance, and in line with the Economic Recovery Plan, ELC\/SAC employers continue to be entitled to access the EWSS with an exemption to having to demonstrate the drop in turnover that applies to other sectors.  Since October 2020, EWSS has been paid at enhanced rates and these rates are estimated to cover, on average, 80% of staff costs in the sector, or 50% of total operating costs.  <\/p>  <p>  Government has committed to continuing the payment of these rates throughout quarter 3 of 2021.  My Department will continue to engage with the Department of Finance in the planning for quarter 4 of this year and beyond in respect of the ELC\/SAC sector.   There is strong evidence of the effectiveness of these supports.

The deadline for the 2021 survey has recently passed and this data will now begin to be cleaned and analysed. I anticipate this data being available in the coming months to assist in planning.  <\/p>  <p>  Looking to the future, my Department will be developing a new funding model for early learning and care and school age childcare that provides additional resourcing to services in line with measures to improve quality and affordability. An Expert Group has been progressing this work since late 2019 and I expect their report to be finalised in November.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070700085#WRE04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Children's Services","counter":208,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070700085#WRE04500"},{"type":"question","counter":209,"qnumday":97,"qnumall":"[30595\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070700085#WRE04600","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the status of the public consultation process relative to the proposed national standards for children&rsquo;s services; if he plans to have a separate standard for foster care similar to the 2003 document; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1496","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":210,"content":"<p>I am informed by Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) that while the recent public consultation has been completed there is ongoing consultation with HIQA's Advisory Board to the development of the draft standards.

Failure to do so will be grounds for objection to the renewal of the licence, even if, at the time of renewal, the licensee has ceased to operate the outdoor seating area.  It should be borne in mind that, in the context of supporting business to operate in outdoor seating areas, extended hours would not be suitable for many licensed premises operating in these outdoor areas in light of community and neighbourhood concerns. There is a balance of considerations in all such decisions. <\/p><p>  The Act also makes it an offence not to comply with a direction by a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to take any steps necessary to ensure compliance with the licensing legislation. This is liable on summary conviction to a fine of up to &euro;2,500 and\/or a term of imprisonment of up to 6 months. Compliance with the relevant COVID-19 health regulations will also apply to outdoor seating areas.<\/p><p>  From a longer term perspective, the Justice Plan 2021, published on 22 February, commits to reviewing and modernising alcohol licensing.It is my intention as part of the work of the Night-Time Economy Taskforce looking at innovative approaches to support and develop a vibrant, diverse night-time culture and economy in Ireland, to bring forward legislation that will contain proposals to update the law relating to the sale, supply and consumption of alcohol in licensed premises and registered clubs, by replacing both the Licensing Acts 1833 to 2018 and the Registration of Clubs Acts 1904 to 2008 with streamlined provisions more suited to modern conditions.

The Authority, established under the Health Act 2007, has significant and wide-ranging powers up to and including withdrawing the registration of a nursing home facility, which means that it can no longer operate as a service provider. This responsibility is underpinned by a comprehensive quality framework comprising of Registration Regulations, Care and Welfare Regulations and National Quality Standards.   <\/p>  <p>  HIQA, in discharging its duties determines, through examination of all information available to it, including site inspections, whether a nursing homes meets the regulations in order to achieve and maintain its registration status.  Should a nursing home be deemed to be non-compliant with the Regulations and the National Quality Standards, it may either fail to achieve or lose its registration status. In addition, the Chief Inspector has wide discretion in deciding whether to impose conditions of Registration on nursing homes.   <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Nursing Homes Expert was established, on foot of a NPHET recommendation, to examine the complex issues surrounding the management of COVID-19 among this particularly vulnerable cohort. This Expert Panel report has added further to our knowledge and learning. This report clearly outlines the key protective measures that we must ensure are in place across our nursing homes. These actions are based on learning from our own and the international experience of COVID-19 to date. The report also recommends additional analysis and examination of the relevant public health and other data sets in order that further causal and protective factors for COVID-19 clusters are identified.  HIQA and the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) recently jointly published an &ldquo;Analysis of factors associated with outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 in nursing homes in Ireland&rdquo;, delivering on recommendation 6.7 of the Expert Panel report, to further the learning from the pandemic. Further data analysis work and learning will also continue, in line with other recommendations of the Expert Panel, but unfortunately have been impacted by the recent cyberattack on the health system. <\/p>  <p>  Work to progress the recommendations of the Expert Panel report, particularly those recommendations requiring a priority focus in the response to COVID-19, is ongoing across all of the health agencies and stakeholders. Many of the short to medium term recommendations of the Expert Panel report have now been implemented. Continued learning and understanding of progression of the disease in Ireland is an integral part of those recommendations. <\/p>  <p>  At a broader level, there has been significant and ongoing consideration of this impact since the start of the pandemic, with various examinations and development of reports with a focus on COVID-19, its impact on nursing homes and the pandemic learnings that can inform future policy, regulation and the model of care for older persons. There has been a very clear national commitment to continue to learn from the pandemic as the national and international understanding of the virus evolves, and where necessary to ensure that the public health-led approach evolves, as evidence and learning materialises. Findings of these reports confirm that the very infectious nature of COVID-19 makes it difficult to prevent and control the virus in residential care settings.  The reports produced nationally identify findings consistent with international evidence, which have highlighted that the probability of COVID-19 introduction into nursing home depends on the levels of the disease circulating in the community, with a higher risk associated with higher incidence rates in the community.<\/p>  <p>  While significant progress has being made in relation to the roll-out of the vaccination programme and the current situation in nursing homes is broadly stable, the prevalence of the more transmissible Delta variant is rapidly increasing in Ireland and this poses a significant risk, in particular to those who are not yet fully protected though vaccination.  It must be recognised that the pandemic has not concluded and at this time a priority focus of Government remains on the ongoing management of the COVID-19 response, to ensure that the positive gains now been experienced are preserved, and that those most vulnerable to the virus continue to be safeguarded, having regard to the residual risk. <\/p>  <p>  I am very aware that listening to families can bring great learning to many situations. While we are still dealing with a level of risk in nursing homes, we are continuing to look at options which may be available to the State in relation to listening to the voices of those who have lost a loved one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070700087#WRG04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":328,"content":"<p>Question No. 134 answered with Question No. 132.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vaccination Programme","counter":329,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070700087#WRG04300"},{"type":"question","counter":330,"qnumday":135,"qnumall":"[30444\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070700087#WRG04400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if those who require the vaccine for essential reasons such as travelling for education will be considered for vaccination outside of their age cohort; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1473","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":331,"content":"<p>The COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation Strategy sets out a provisional list of groups for vaccination.

All stakeholders, including the COVID-19 Nursing Homes Expert Panel, have highlighted the significant contribution these new teams have made to supporting nursing homes throughout the pandemic;<\/p>  <p>  - The HSE Temporary Accommodation Scheme;<\/p>  <p>  - HSE training and development resources, including the opening up of HSeLanD to private and voluntary providers.<\/p>  <p>  - IPC support and advice;<\/p>  <p>  - The substantial suite of publicly available guidance developed to support the sector.<\/p>  <p>  These measures and supports reflect a significant investment by the State to support nursing homes and other services and measures, such as the COVID-19 Response Teams, and are a clear signal of the work that is ongoing to integrate the wider health system.<\/p>  <p>  Nursing homes, like all other service providers, should continue to follow and apply enhanced public health advice and guidance as required in line with the pandemic risk. All nursing homes, as registered providers with HIQA, have well established obligations under the legal framework in terms of the delivery of safe care to residents. Nursing homes are required, by law, to comply with current infection, prevention and control standards - these standards have been in operation since 2018. Good and effective IPC procedures should be in place across the entire health and social care service as a matter of course.<\/p>  <p>  In February 2021, a revised plan 'Resilience and Recovery 2021 Plan: The Path Ahead' was published by the Government. This plan recognises the need for longer-term reform of both older persons and nursing home care, broadly reflecting the lessons learned from the COVID-19 Nursing Homes Expert Panel and the pandemic. However, these structural reforms, including the policy and regulatory framework, extend beyond the scope of a temporary financial support scheme aimed at a specific, time-limited public health objective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070700087#WRG05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vaccination Programme","counter":344,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070700087#WRG05800"},{"type":"question","counter":345,"qnumday":139,"qnumall":"[30448\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070700087#WRG05900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason for delays for vaccination appointments at the vaccination centre Punchestown, County Kildare; the actions being taken to address same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":346,"content":"<p>As this Parliamentary Question relates to an operational issue, it is a matter for the HSE.

It is therefore not open to Irish authorities to grant a marketing authorisation for orphan medicines outside of this framework. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE has statutory responsibility for decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medicines under the community drugs schemes, in accordance with the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.<\/p>  <p>  In line with the 2013 Health Act and the national framework agreed with industry, a company must submit an application to the HSE to have a new medicine added to the reimbursement list. <\/p>  <p>  Reimbursement is for licenced indications which have been granted marketing authorisation by the EMA or the Health Products Regulatory Authority. <\/p>  <p>  As outlined in the national framework agreed with industry, and in line with the 2013 Act, the HSE will decide, within 180 days of receiving the application (or a longer period if further information is required from the company), to either add the medicine to the reimbursement list or agree to reimburse it as a hospital medicine, or refuse to reimburse the medicine.<\/p>  <p>  In making a reimbursement decision, the HSE is required under the Act to have regard to a number of criteria including efficacy, the health needs of the public, cost effectiveness and potential or actual budget impact. <\/p>  <p>  While the 2013 Health Act does not include provision for a different ruleset when assessing orphan drugs, the HSE seeks as far as possible to take into account issues such as the small patient numbers and the nature of the condition to be treated when evaluating these medicines.  The criteria that apply to the evaluation process allow sufficient scope for the HSE to take on board the particular circumstances that pertain to orphan drugs and rare diseases. <\/p>  <p>  There has been a number of key changes in the HSE assessment process of medicines within the confines of the 2013 Health Act.  These have included changes to the HSE Drugs Group, whose membership has been expanded to include representatives from the National Patients Forum and more clinical expertise in the area of rare diseases. <\/p>  <p>  In June 2018, the HSE Leadership appointed a Technology Review Committee for Rare Diseases (RDTRC). The Committee&rsquo;s recommendations regarding reimbursement of orphan medicines are not intended to replace any part of the existing medicines appraisal or reimbursement process but rather complement it.<\/p>  <p>  The additional funding of &euro;50m provided for new medicines in Budget 2021 will allow the HSE to provide access to medicines which have been recommended by the HSE Drugs Group, on the basis of efficacy and value for money in line with the 2013 Health Act, and ultimately provide more medicines to Irish citizens.

This places a potentially onerous burden on family successors and could challenge the future viability of these productive assets.<\/p><p>Therefore, the Department of Health has proposed a policy change to the Scheme, to cap contributions based on farm and business assets at three years where an appointed family successor commits to working the productive asset for a period of 6 years. To be considered for the 3-year cap, the proposed legislation requires that an asset owned by an applicant for the Scheme, or recently transferred to a family member, is a productive family asset that has been actively worked by a family member for a significant period of time in advance of the person entering care. <\/p><p>Where an applicant retired and ceased working the farm or business themselves prior to entering long-term care, it is expected that their partner or a family successor will have taken over from them. In order to acknowledge the fact that many older people will have reduced their engagement in the family farm or business, but that a successor may not have taken over immediately, it is only required that the farm or business was worked by the applicant, their partner, or a family successor, for three of the five years preceding admission to long-term care, and this time need not be continuous. <\/p><p>Although land mobility has been a policy objective of various agricultural reliefs since the 1990s, the policy intent of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme is to protect family farms and businesses that will remain within the family as a source of employment and income into the future, and to ensure the future viability of these productive assets. This policy would not be advanced if income from leasing arrangements was included in the cap.<\/p><p>There is no prohibition of leasing arrangements in the Bill. However, assets that are leased will not be covered by the Bill and both the value of these assets and the income derived from the leasing arrangements will be assessed as part of the financial assessment for the scheme on an ongoing basis.<\/p><p>The Bill passed Committee Stage on 30th June, and is due for Report and Final Stage in the coming weeks. It is expected that the Bill will be enacted prior to the summer recess and will commence shortly thereafter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070700091#WRL01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":531,"content":"<p>Question No. 206 answered with Question No. 205.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medicinal Products","counter":532,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070700091#WRL01600"},{"type":"question","counter":533,"qnumday":207,"qnumall":"[30667\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021070700091#WRL01700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to Parliamentary Question Nos. 840 and 847 of 3 February 2021, the status of same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1603","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":534,"content":"<p>As this Parliamentary Question relates to an operational issue, it is a matter for the HSE.

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. In this way, for a decade, the scheme has ensured that long-term residential care is accessible and affordable for everyone who needs it.  <\/p><p>Approximately 80% of nursing home places funded under the NHSS are in private or voluntary nursing homes that are funded by the State based on prices negotiated with the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF). The maximum prices chargeable by private nursing homes for residents funded under the NHSS are agreed between each nursing home and the NTPF, which has a legally designated function to negotiate with nursing homes under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009. The NTPF has statutory independence in this regard, agreeing rates with each nursing home according to a consistent set of criteria.  <b><\/b><\/p><p>The current NTPF criteria for price negotiations are:<\/p><p>1. the costs reasonably and prudently incurred by the home and evidence of value for money;<\/p><p>2. the price(s) previously charged;<\/p><p>3. the local market price; and<\/p><p>4. budgetary constraints and the obligation of the State to use available resources in the most beneficial, effective and efficient manner.<\/p><p>Over 460 private nursing homes are registered with HIQA to operate as nursing home providers. It should be noted that public (HSE) nursing homes are not subject to the negotiation process; the HSE determines the cost of care for public nursing units.<\/p><p>The <i>Review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, A Fair Deal<\/i>highlighted the need to re-examine the pricing mechanism used by the NTPF in relation to the NHSS. The Minister for Health subsequently requested that the NTPF carry out a review of the pricing system. A steering group was established with representation from various departments and agencies and expert advice and stakeholder submissions were sought. <\/p><p>The review, published in June 2021, makes four recommendations:<\/p><p>1. That the NTPF carry out a formal assessment of using a &lsquo;formulaic approach&rsquo; in the pricing system. <\/p><p>2. That the NTPF carry out a formal assessment of amending the approach to the assessment of &ldquo;Local Market Price&rdquo; to reflect prices within other nursing homes within a certain distance of the nursing home rather than within the same county <\/p><p>3. That the NTPF engage with Nursing Homes Ireland to seek improvements to its appeals process <\/p><p>4. That the pricing system should be amended to better allow for the costs of high-dependency residents <\/p><p>Minister Donnelly and I have agreed to these recommendations and have requested that the NTPF commence implementation of the first two recommendations and engage with Nursing Homes Ireland on the third recommendation. The formal assessments are based on an approach whereby the NPTF will, in parallel with its normal negotiations, calculate a national price (for internal purposes) based on the 'formulaic approach' and the amended approach to 'Local Market Price'. These assessments will give an understanding of the cost impacts of any future change to the pricing system.
