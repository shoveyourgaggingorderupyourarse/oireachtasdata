He is joined by Ruth Foley, deputy director of audit.  We will have a private session in the afternoon to review a discussion document.  I propose that we use a relatively short period to deal with correspondence and then proceed to our engagement with the HSE and the Department of Health.  We have received apologies from Deputies Pat Deering and Alan Kelly.  We are holding over the minutes and will come back to them shortly.  The next item I want to get clearance from the committee in connection with is No. 3, a motion on the second periodic report relating to NAMA.  We discussed this at the last meeting.  It relates to the terminal surplus and possible consideration of NAMA's activities after its wind-down.  We agreed that we have to put a formal motion to the D&aacute;il to discuss this matter.  The clerk circulated wording last Friday regarding our recommendation for a D&aacute;il debate on the wind-down of NAMA.  The motion is:<\/p><blockquote>That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann notes the report of the Committee of Public Accounts entitled Periodic Report No.2, November- December 2017, copies of which were laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 28 March 2018; and, in particular, the Committee&rsquo;s recommendations that the D&aacute;il should debate- the utilisation of NAMA&rsquo;s projected terminal surplus and<br \/><br \/>- the orderly wind down of NAMA or the possible consideration of NAMA for other specific purposes<\/blockquote> <p>It is in my name as Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts.

We recommended that there should be a D&aacute;il debate on the projected terminal surplus of NAMA on the basis that NAMA is so unique that there are no EU rules on it.  There is no requirement in EU rules to pay down Government debt.  It is a domestic political decision.  We cannot prevent the Government from having a view but we did not make a formal decision either way because there could be mixed views on the final surplus.  It could be used partially for debt and partially for investment, or whatever.  Let us have a debate and present the committee's point of view.  There is nothing preventing individual parties from coming back with their own motions but the committee, in our last report in March, did not say anything either way.  We said there should be a D&aacute;il debate because we feel that is lacking.  We have an announcement from the Taoiseach on his views but there are other views that have not been discussed in the D&aacute;il.

I expect this motion will be debated in early January.  If the Government tables amendments, while it is going in as a Committee of Public Accounts document, it is a broader issue once it gets to the D&aacute;il Chamber.  We will have done our bit by initiating the debate.  That is as far as we can take it.  The outcome of the debate is for the D&aacute;il to decide, not the Committee of Public Accounts.  At least we are getting the matter in there and aired.  We will have no problems if different people have different views on it once we get it to the D&aacute;il Chamber.  I will present it as is.  I might express a personal view or members might express personal views.  Is it agreed to present the motion to the D&aacute;il?  Agreed.  The clerk will send the motion to the Journal Office with a view to having it added to the Order Paper.<\/p> <p>  There are three categories of correspondence.  The first is category A, briefing documents and opening statements for today's meeting.  Nos. 1730A and 1732A are from the HSE, enclosing opening statements and briefing documents, which we will note and publish.  Nos. 1735A and 1736A are from the Department of Health for today's meeting and we will note and publish them.<\/p> <p>  We have a large pile of correspondence which we have been holding over for quite a while due to the sheer volume of it.  I want to run through some today.  We will not clear it all but I hope that, next week, we will clear anything we have not cleared today.  They will be on the screens if members have not brought hard copies.<\/p> <p>  The first is No. 1482B.  In our previous report we included the issue of prepayments and the risk associated with them arising from the lessons learned from the Dublin Institute of Technology which paid upfront for its library services and lost over &euro;700,000.  We asked the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to look at that.  It is now recommending that the Government accounting unit of the Department will work with the Office of Government Procurement to clarify the position on upfront payments for procured services as part of general procurement.  The current rules did not prevent the current problem from happening but the Department will clarify the position for the future.<\/p><p>I know that the issue of upfront payments will come up again.  We will note the correspondence and publish the response to it. <\/p><p> The next item is No. 1486 which is a brief note.  The correspondence which we will note and publish is from the Department of Education and Skills and concerns the Thorn report on Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board.  It was received during the summer.  It is the intention of the Minister, once he has had an opportunity to consider the report fully, to arrange for its publication.

It is an old letter that was received in August.  As we have discussed it, we will note and publish it.  According to the schedule, it was held over. <\/p> <p>  No. 1526 is correspondence received from Mr. Ray Mitchell of the HSE providing follow-up information.  There is so much in it that I will deal with the items one by one.  We will note and publish the correspondence today.  It is a voluminous document and I want people to be aware of what is contained in it.  I will give a quick outline.  At a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts on 5 July we asked a series of questions to which we have now received written responses.  Members should feel free to come back in on them.  We could spend a day on this issue, but we will note and publish the correspondence and people can respond to it.  I want them to know the issues about which we asked and on which we have received information.  They include the cost variation by staff type and the reason agency staff cannot be recruited into the HSE.  I will not get into the responses.  I am letting people know that the responses contained in the letter will be published.<\/p> <p>  There is a response to the Hannaway report on HSE properties.  Following completion of the Deloitte report on Government arrangements for section 38 and 39 agencies, the letter also includes a breakdown of how each agency was rated.  Deloitte stated it was expected that the report would be finished in October 2018, at which stage, it would compile a composite report on the external reviews.  We will ask the HSE for a copy as soon as it is available.  <\/p> <p>  There is a note providing up-to-date information on community health organisation 4, about which somebody asked individually.  There is also a note on psychiatric services in the south east and bed management and overcrowding in St. Luke's General Hospital in Kilkenny.<\/p> <p>  The next question we asked concerned the contract entered into with Deloitte to conduct the review.  There is a note included on the matter.  We also asked about the staffing of the national compliance unit, which is relatively new.  There was a staff complement of 12.  <\/p> <p>  There is a note on the number of planned and random audits in HSE agencies in 2018 to date.  There were 11 planned audits and three random audits up to the date of receipt of the letter. <\/p> <p>  The next issue is important in the context of our ongoing work.  We asked for a note on the introduction of a mandatory system of retraining and supervision following legal settlements without an admission of liability.  It is very much what we are talking about today, that is, medical negligence, which will probably be the subject of a report of the committee in the spring.  The first sentence states there is no mandatory retraining and supervision following legal settlements without an admission of liability, although retraining and supervision takes place.  Enough has been said for now.  It is what we all suspected and has been confirmed in writing.<\/p> <p>  The correspondence includes a note on the different categories of consultant in non-specialist positions who are not on the specialist register.  There is a note on the process in respect of the cath lab at University Hospital Waterford.  <\/p> <p>  There is a note on the assessment of needs and the provision of healthcare and plans to take steps to address the issue.  Detailed information is given on a region by region basis.  There is a detailed breakdown of the &euro;50 million inpatient transport costs by area, including a breakdown of the type of transport used, including taxis, minibuses, private ambulances or other means.  <\/p> <p>  There is a note on whether matters related to procurement compliance were included in the risk register.  There is also a note on the section 38 and 39 agencies that have submitted their accounts.  Last year 100% of accounts were submitted.<\/p> <p>  There is a note on whether matters associated with CervicalCheck were placed on the risk register in previous years.  We know that they were not.  That is something that will come up in discussions on medical negligence.  There is a detailed history of the audit related to CervicalCheck with which we are dealing on an ongoing basis.<\/p><p>Then there is a note on the number of protected disclosures made to the HSE.  It is indicated that 78 were received in 2017 and there is breakdown of the categories of those on page 20 of this 26-page letter.  There is a note on the provision of a cardiac cath lab laboratory in Sligo; the figures and trends regarding moneys owed by health insurance companies, which is in the order of &euro;300 million at the end of each calendar year to which we can come back; the different categories of agency staff; and the contract awarded to the private operator in Mount Carmel.  I am reading out all these headings because people forget the volume of work we cover.  I am not reading to members the responses.  There are notes on the sale of a property in respect of Our Lady's Hospice, Harold's Cross, which is the subject to a Garda investigation and is an item on our correspondence list; the position regarding high-risk dental treatment patients; the number of unfilled posts in the HSE; the prompt payment interest and compensation paid during the course of the year; and the patient private property retained interest and where the money goes.  We will not discuss the entire detail of this, Deputy Cullinane.  I have given a sample of the 29 detailed questions we asked on the day.  The responses are now on the public record, and they contain a lot of information.  If members want to come back next week on any aspect of this or use this information, they should feel free to do so.  They may choose to use it in any event because it is public now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018112200002#C02500","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542877200,"counter":51,"content":"<p>I do not want to refer to any of the detail but some of it relates to CervicalCheck.

We had been talking about the large contingent liability before the CervicalCheck cancer scandal broke.  That was the work we were going to do.  In many ways the two issues have become conflated but it has been a useful example to tease out with the likes of the State Claims Agency, SCA, the Department of Health and the HSE in seeking to understand exactly what the process is when a scandal happens.  One of the areas we were going to examine was open disclosure and the possibility of reducing the liability by virtue of the fact that part of that liability is a legal cost liability and that if there were a different process, one could well end up with a smaller liability in some cases and still a reasonable outcome for people who have been damaged.  By conflating the two, we have taken the focus away from where it should be.  These are two very distinct issues.<\/p> <p>  There are many other issues, and we will deal with one later which is another example.  What is obvious - and we have not reached this point - is that if one is damaged and wants to pursue something, one is almost required to go through the SCA.  A mediated process is not available.  We will never get to the point of open disclosure if the systems are not in place to allow for an alternative dispute resolution to take place.  This is an aspect we must set apart from others and do something definitive about.  We have to come back to it with the SCA.  We have done some useful work on CervicalCheck.  Perhaps that should be pulled together so we can see what we have that is distinct from the health committee.<\/p> <p>  I refer to process and value for money.  We must put them into that category so we are properly within the remit of the committee.  We wrote to the SCA last week about the \"lack of candour\", to use the Chairman's term, regarding giving us correct information.  I have eight women telling me they still cannot get their slides.

The next correspondence is No. 1530, a follow-up from Mr. Ray Mitchell.  We note and publish that.<\/p> <p>  I refer back to No. 1528, attached to which is a letter dated 24 August 2018 in response to Committee of Public Accounts correspondence No. 1014 with the Department of Health seeking information following the appearance at the committee on 12 July 2018.  It deals with a note on the expansion to 7-7 for general adult mental health services, a note on the cost of hiring private investigators, the process and safeguards in place on consultant-compliance contracts.  Members might be interested in this.  They have asked about the cost of hiring the private investigators and it states on page 2 of that letter that surveillance was a proportionate exercise and not indiscriminate, that three of the lead cases were ultimately the subject of surveillance and that the HSE advised that the cost was &euro;117,853.  I am just putting that on the public record as people were interested in the cost.<\/p> <p>  We also asked for a note on the reasons for the non-disclosure of information in the accounts under No. 62 in respect of legal costs.  As a result of our letter and following consideration in the finalisation of the 2017 appropriation accounts in conjunction with the Comptroller and Auditor General in the context of the raising of the matter at the committee, the Department is now in a position to report in accordance with the relevant circular.  It was not publishing legal costs.  In the Department of Health in 2017, there were 70 cases totalling &euro;5.699 million and the total in the previous year was &euro;14.655 million for 138 cases.  That is in the accounts for 2017.  Following us pointing out the Government circular at the committee, information which was not clearly available is now there.<\/p> <p>  We asked for an explanatory note on the three different schemes available for treatment abroad and people will find that helpful.  There is also reference to the European health insurance card and the cross-border directive.  The public are a bit confused regarding the cross-border directive.  We will recirculate it.  I do not have the reference in front of me, but it was dated 24 August 2018 in reference to our correspondence No. 1014 or 1528, I am not sure.  It is good to separate the issues as people are confused between the cross-border directive and the treatment abroad scheme.  Table 6 is an up-to-date note on the national children's hospital funding and a review of the money owed by insurance companies, which I touched on earlier.  We note and publish that.<\/p> <p>  The next correspondence, No. 1538, is also from the HSE.  This is a short letter with a large appendix comprising hundreds of pages.  It is a copy of the records relating to the quality assurance visits, to include minutes of discussions and final reports submitted following the tests.  That relates to CervicalCheck.  We discussed this at our previous meetings but we note formally and publish that substantial document even though we have referred to it before.<\/p> <p>  Next is No. 1561, correspondence from the Higher Education Authority, HEA, regarding the famous retirement event for the former President of CIT and the fact that the HEA is considering the most appropriate means to recuperate the money from the college, which was not approved.  We have discussed this correspondence before but never noted and published it.  I have a note that it is held over.<\/p> <p>  Then there is No. 1672, which is correspondence from Professor O h&Oacute;gartaigh of the NUI on the non-competitive procurement of &euro;5.12 million.  There is a detailed scheduled on the back of that providing the breakdown.  For G4 security, it was &euro;373,000, which was probably a roll-over of a contract.  The full breakdown of the &euro;5.12 million is there.  There is an issue regarding the severance payment and out-of-office leave payroll costs of &euro;91,000.  We note and publish that and members will be free to use the information as best they can.<\/p> <p>  That is all I have from previous correspondence which we had not published to date and which has been sitting on our desks for the last while.

The Deputy has sent us a letter, No. 1733 C.  We were coming to it shortly.  It is specifically about seeking a detailed note regarding the removal of the gates in the Phoenix Park and their repair, restoration and re-erection.  It asks whether it had been discussed before it was known that there would be a papal visit.  The correspondence also says \"in view of the spreadsheet of costs supplied by the OPW, the Deputy wishes to explore the way in which some companies were selected to provide services and infrastructure, were correct tender protocols and procedures adhered to, was the competitiveness of the tendering robust and so on.\"  We will inquire about all of that at the Deputy's request.<\/p><p>I will come to the letter in a moment.  We will note and publish No. 1700B.  We will also note and follow up on Deputy Murphy's request, No. 1733C.<\/p><p> No. 1715B is from Mr. Ray Mitchell, assistant national director, Health Service Executive, and is dated 12 November 2018.  It deals with the transfer of properties from religious congregations to the HSE under the various agreements from 2002 and 2009.  We are on the case.  The Committee of Public Accounts will ensure progress is made.  Progress was not made for years.  Some of the properties fall under the remit of the HSE, which states that of the 2002 offers, there were two remaining properties, namely, the Sacred Heart centre in Waterford and a property in Cappoquin.  The closing documents for the property in Cappoquin were received last week from the congregation's solicitor and similar documentation for the centre in Waterford is expected soon.  It is hoped the transfers will be finalised in the next couple of months.  We will ask the HSE to provide an update in January.<\/p><p> In 2009, six properties were offered, of which five were accepted by the HSE, only one of which has transferred.  Four properties are outstanding.  One is the St. Bernard's Group Homes in Fethard.  The correspondence states that the transfer document has been competed and the consent of the Minister and the Charities Regulatory Authority have been received.  The property is now being registered.  That is fine.  The contract documents for the Catherine McAuley centre in Kells have been received and signed, the Minister's consent has been requested and is awaited.  The committee will write to the Minister asking that he give that consent as quickly as possible to allow this transfer to proceed.<\/p><p> With regard to a property on Gracepark Road, on 14 June last, the solicitors were advised by the congregation's solicitor that the contracts and title documents would issue shortly.  The documents are awaited.  The committee will write to the HSE to ask its solicitors to contact the congregation's solicitors forthwith in order that this can proceed.<\/p><p> On the National Rehabilitation Hospital property, the position appears a little complicated.  HSE estates say it will reach a transfer and lease-back arrangement for the National Rehabilitation Hospital lands.  This will result in a change to the National Rehabilitation Hospital Trust.  The original trust owns the land and the new trust will be involved in the sale and lease-back.  A due diligence process on the new trust has commenced and will have to be completed before the lands can be transferred.  The target date for the completion of this process is the end of 2018.  The committee will ask for a note to be provided on this issue in January.  We will keep on top of that issue.<\/p><p> No. 1717B is from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment regarding electricity interconnectors, the need for windmills or wind farms to produce surplus energy and what happens to this surplus.  Some of it can be exported and the Department advises that in 2017 the rate of curtailment of available wind energy was 4%.  The committee will send this detailed response on the utilisation and export of excess wind energy to the correspondent.  It has been suggested that this excess is dumped at an uneconomic price to the UK.  The reply will be of interest to many. <\/p><p> No. 1718B is from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General, Department of Education and Skills, dated 12 November 201.  It relates to seeking information on the powers of the Minister and the Higher Education Authority, HEA, to carry out different types of investigations.  We can note and publish this correspondence, which makes some interesting points.   It is the Department's view that the HEA has the power to review compliance with conditions when it is granting funding.  The Department states it has received the advice of the Attorney General on this issue and it is being assessed by Department officials.  A further update will be provided to the committee members as soon as possible, once the Department has finalised its assessment of the legal advice.  That is important and we will monitor that.  The letter refers to a timeline for a review of the HEA legislation and the results of a public consultation.  The consultation took place during the summer and 14 submissions were received.  A consultation forum will be held tomorrow in the Department to provide an update on the HEA legislation.  All of those who made submissions are invited.  This process will ultimately lead to heads of a Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018112200002#F04600","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542877200,"counter":121,"content":"<p>While the questions asked have been partially answered, the issue before the committee, namely, the Waterford Institute of Technology, WIT, report, has not been dealt with.

Mr. Love was concerned about the Act and its limitations in the context of the HEA carrying out reviews.  A review of that legislation would be welcome.  It seems the Attorney General's advice has been received but we do not know what it is.  The WIT report is wrapped up in all of this.  There are a number of different options.  I was not so much looking for information on what the HEA will do in respect of future reports, examinations and investigations.  All future examinations may change as a result of the review of the legislation.  There are options regarding the WIT draft report, which is in legal limbo.  One option is to modify the existing report.  Mr. Love told us it was his intention to publish the report but it may need to be modified.  There were concerns as to whether that was possible given the Attorney General's advice and the limitations of the HEA's role in doing these reviews.  The other option was a ministerial appointment.  It could be the case that the Department would have to wait for an amendment to the Act, before starting again.  My question was not less about where the process was that about what would be done with the WIT report.  I want to get a response for once and for all because this issue has dragged on.  At some point, somebody has to call it and decide what will happen with the draft report.  Will the report be modified in some way or will we start again?

However, it is a pity the agency did not provide information on the one substantive, negative issue that we raised on the day and that I raised in particular.  I asked for the locations and breakdown of the properties that had been offered to local authorities but not taken up.  The Chairman alluded to section 2 and the 2,475 units that have been delivered, which is included in the breakdown in tabular form by county.  It is a pity the Housing Agency did not provide in tabular form the location of the 2,424 properties which were deemed unsuitable by reference to location or sustainability issues.  I consistently pressed the agency on the day on the so-called, to use its word, over-concentration of certain amounts of property which made them unsuitable.  What is going on at the moment is a national scandal.  It is something for all of us to press with our local authorities.  On the day we had representatives of the Housing Agency and the Department here, I had answers from the Minister to parliamentary questions.  They were all blaming each other.  The Department jumped in to bail out the Housing Agency as well.  It is unfortunate that although we have plenty of good information, we do not have it on the issue of the 2,424 properties that the Housing Agency considered unsuitable by reference to location or sustainability based on what it calls \"an over-concentration\".  In some cases it was claimed there was no demand.  There are 10,000 homeless but supposedly according to the Housing Agency there is no demand in some of these areas.  It is a pity we do not have a table setting out the areas of \"no demand\" because it would be highly informative.

We will write back to the agency requesting that list.  In addition, when we get that list we will write to the Department for a breakdown by local authority as to the reasons.  In my local authority I have gone through the units that were not accepted and there were various issues.  The issue could have been financial, for example, the price, or it may have been that it would have taken too long or there was an over-concentration in an area where there was already social housing.  There may have been an offer of 50 houses in a local authority area where there was demand for only five houses.  Those are the types of issues.  We will get the list by local authority from the Housing Agency.  We will ask it to send the list to the Department simultaneously and we want the Department to give us a breakdown.  If it is a case of a local authority refusing 47 houses, we want to know where each of them was -  there would probably be four or five different locations - and why each offer was rejected.

It is only one page.  NAMA had given us a breakdown of where the purchasers of NAMA property sold in Ireland were from and we asked for the breakdown of all secured assets worldwide.  The letter indicates that the jurisdiction of the purchasers in respect of the &euro;24 billion of secured assets, both Irish and foreign, is as follows: 33% of the purchasers were in Great Britain; 31% were in Ireland; 9% were in the USA; 5% were in Germany; and 22% were from \"other\", which figure relates to 45 individual purchasers in other countries.  We will write back.  What surprised me was the figure of only 9% for US companies.  We want to know who was the ultimate owner.  A US company might have set up a company in Ireland to buy assets.  NAMA is telling us 31% of these assets were sold to Irish-based companies.  I want to know if they were part of a group.  This does not make sense to me.  NAMA is playing games with the committee.  It knows what we were looking for.  We wanted to know the ultimate owner.  The information provided does not tally with anybody's knowledge of these matters.  We know many of these companies are controlled by American vulture funds.  NAMA says only 9% of its sales are to US companies.  There is a lack of candour in the answer and we want a full answer.  We want to know the ultimate owners and NAMA has to know that.  I am sure Cerberus alone accounts for more than 9% of NAMA sales.  We want the full picture of the ultimate owners of the &euro;24 billion of secured assets purchased from NAMA.  I am finding that NAMA is not giving full answers.

The note lists the top five or six tender prices, with the winning tender highlighted in red on the chart.  People can print it off themselves, but it will be noted and published.  In many cases, it is clear that the lowest bidder did not get the contract.  A second ranking is called \"Ranking of winning tenders following an EAT analysis\".  \"EAT\" means most economically advantageous tender, which is not necessarily the cheapest tender.  It incorporates wider issues such as ability to deliver, track record and access to resources.  According to this document, price accounted for approximately 40% of the score, not 60%.  Some companies forfeited the job even though they were the lowest tender.  Perhaps they had been granted four or five projects but, because they were unable to handle them all, the project fell to the next company on the list.

When representatives of NAMA have come before us, we have expressed the most serious concerns about the lack of governance and so on in some instances.  Is it not ironic that we are here in this position all over again now?  We are struggling with an organisation that was ostensibly set up to deal with the outfall of the lack of governance, regulation, consensus and thought about things that were being done in a very wrong way.  We are back struggling in a David and Goliath position.  I have used that phrase fairly often.  We are trying to deal with little bits of information.

We will also be looking at the HSE's efforts to prevent medical negligence cases.  We had a meeting with the State Claims Agency on the management of medical negligence costs and open disclosure.  We have teased out many of the associated issues, to which we should not return today.  This meeting is important as it gives us an opportunity to review hepatitis C treatment, its implications and whether lessons have been learned.  What, if anything, has been learned by the HSE from hepatitis C cases?  The State Claims Agency has told us that there is an estimated liability of &euro;2.4 billion arising from active clinical claims and this figure is growing each year.  We have discussed with the agency how the figure could be reduced through open disclosure and mediation.  However, to quote the old saying, prevention is better than cure.  If costs are to be meaningfully reduced, it will only be done by ensuring there is a reduction in the number of serious medical incidents in the first place.  We need to focus on what institutional learning has taken place in the HSE and understand the changes that have been implemented as a result of cases such as those involving hepatitis C and CervicalCheck.  We need to hear what the HSE has been doing in general to reduce the risk of cases of medical negligence.  <\/p><p>I hope what I have said serves to frame the discussion in order that we will not move beyond that issue today with the Department of Health and the HSE.  We can come back to other broader HSE-related issues on another day.  We are here to discuss hepatitis C treatment, in particular.  We are joined by Mr. John Connaghan, director general of the HSE, who is accompanied by Dr. Colm Henry, Ms Michele Tait, Professor Aiden McCormack and Mr. Ray Mitchell.

The Health Service Executive estimates that between 20,000 and 30,000 people in Ireland may have the hepatitis C virus, many of whom may go on to have significant medical needs if they are not successfully treated.  Recent advances in the drugs used to treat hepatitis C have resulted in significantly improved treatment outcomes and the Health Service Executive has set a target to make hepatitis C a rare disease in Ireland by 2026.  Each course of treatment is expensive, however, and varies between &euro;23,000 and &euro;92,000 per patient, depending on the strain of the disease.<\/p> <p>  Approximately 1,700 people, most of whom were women, were infected with the hepatitis C virus through the administration of contaminated blood and blood products during periods in the late 1970s and again in the early 1990s.  A number of schemes put in place to compensate and support those affected were subsequently extended to include persons similarly infected with HIV.  Expenditure on these schemes is accounted for in a variety of ways.  In undertaking this review, I wanted to compile an overview of the expenditure already incurred as a result of the contamination.  I also wanted to assess the progress being made by the HSE on its current strategies and plans for treatment of hepatitis C.<\/p> <p>  The expenditure in 2017 under the schemes to compensate or assist those who contracted diseases due to contaminated blood or blood products totalled &euro;36.4 million.  Between 1996 and 2017, a total of just over &euro;1.5 billion was spent.  Compensation schemes, including insurance subsidy payments, accounted for &euro;1.18 billion of that total.  Almost &euro;300 million has been spent on the provision of hospital and primary care services for those affected.<\/p> <p>  The HSE published a comprehensive national strategy for dealing with hepatitis C in 2012.  It included 36 recommendations covering the areas of surveillance and data collection; education, prevention and communications; screening and testing; and treatment.  The implementation of the recommendations has been mixed, with just ten considered to have been fully implemented and most partly implemented.  The national strategy noted that a comprehensive programme had been put in place for patients who had acquired hepatitis C through contaminated blood products, but recognised that the needs of those who had acquired the disease through other means had not yet been adequately addressed.  The Department of Health published a plan in 2014 for the establishment of a multi-year national hepatitis C treatment programme, which commenced in 2015.  It aims to prioritise treatment for those at greatest clinical risk.<\/p> <p>  Since 2015, the Department has allocated &euro;30 million a year to fund delivery of the treatment programme.  In the period 2015 to 2017, more than 2,100 patients completed treatment.  As my report was being compiled, information about treatment outcomes was available for 90% of those treated in those years.  This indicated that the treatment was successful in clearing the hepatitis C virus in approximately 94% of cases.  The majority of the annual budget allocation is used to purchase treatment drugs.  Under the terms negotiated with the drug suppliers, a percentage of the purchase price for a course of treatment is subsequently refunded in the form of a rebate.  The average cost of treatment, net of the rebate, was just under &euro;28,000 per patient in 2017.<\/p> <p>  It is a complex challenge to ensure treatment delivery to the maximum number of highest-priority patients in eight main treatment centres, with varying drug costs per virus strain, within a set budget, and this is further complicated by the price rebate arrangement.  In 2017, the HSE envisaged the smooth utilisation over the year of the available budget of &euro;30 million.  Payments for treatment accelerated ahead of planned levels in the second quarter, however, resulting in the majority of the available budget having been spent by the end of July.  This led to the suspension of the programme in the middle of the year and uncertainty about what would happen thereafter.  As indicated in figure 15.7 in the report, significant rebate receipts in the third quarter brought the net spending level back into line.  Figure 15.8 indicates the impact this had on treatment delivery, with significant front-loading in the first half of the year and a stop-start pattern in the second half.<\/p> <p>  The chapter makes a number of recommendations for management of the treatment programme.  The HSE indicated it accepted all the recommendations and I am sure the director general will be able to update the committee in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018112200002#M00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1542877200,"counter":235,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy.

I am joined by my colleagues, Mr. Michael Conroy of the Department&rsquo;s blood policy unit and Mr. Finian Judge of the community pharmacy policy unit, as well as the HSE director general, Mr. John Connaghan, and colleagues.<br\/><br\/>The Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s review of hepatitis C treatment in Ireland, set out in chapter 15 of the report, provides a comprehensive overview of this issue.  I do not propose to go over that ground in detail, but I will speak to some of the issues examined in it and in particular, the compensation tribunal established for people infected by blood and blood products and the national programme for treatment of people with the hepatitis C virus.  <br\/><br\/>Infection of people through the blood supply was a tragedy of immense proportions, causing great pain and suffering to many people.  Approximately 1,700 people in Ireland became infected with hepatitis C or HIV through infected blood products over the period up to 1994.  These included women who received anti-D immunoglobulin, people with haemophilia, people who received blood transfusions and people being treated for renal disease.  The hepatitis C and HIV compensation tribunal was set up to compensate these individuals.  It was established on a non-statutory basis in December 1995 and on a statutory basis in 1997.  In 2002, the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal Act was amended to extend the tribunal&rsquo;s remit to include HIV and allow for claims by dependants of people who had been infected.  <br\/><br\/>The tribunal is made up of six ordinary members, all of whom are barristers and solicitors, and is chaired by Ms Karen O&rsquo;Driscoll, who is a senior counsel specialising in medical law and employment law.  The compensation tribunal is independent of both the Minister and the Department of Health.  It considers cases and makes awards in line with the legislation.  Claims are dealt with by an<i>in camera<\/i>oral hearing before at least two members of the tribunal or by an offer of settlement.  Claimants are entitled to be legally represented at the hearings.  The Department&rsquo;s role is to make payments in line with awards made by the tribunal.  The tribunal has heard claims continually since 1996, and it made 3,569 awards up to the end of 2017.  Expenditure is approximately &euro;25 million per year and, to the end of 2017, the tribunal had cost a total of &euro;1.18 billion, covering awards, legal fees and administrative costs.  <br\/><br\/>In the years since these infections were discovered, a wide range of actions were taken, based on the recommendations of the Finlay and Lindsay tribunals, to ensure the safety of the blood supply.  The Consultative Council on Hepatitis C was established in 1996, while the National Haemophilia Council was established in 2004.  Both bodies ensure those most concerned have a say in matters involving hepatitis C and the care of patients with haemophilia and other bleeding disorders.  The Irish Blood Transfusion Service, IBTS, documented a range of policies and procedures covering all aspects of blood transfusion screening and the implementation of these is reviewed by the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA.<\/p><p>Ireland has a sophisticated testing regime for screening blood donations, which is kept under continuing review as science and technology develops.  The annual HPRA, inspection of the IBTS, a key recommendation of the Finlay tribunal, addresses compliance of its blood-related operations with relevant EU and national legislation.  The latest report, from 2017, found that the IBTS was in compliance with legislation.  No critical deficiencies which represent a risk to patients and the safety of the blood supply were identified.<\/p><p> On the national hepatitis C treatment programme, hepatitis C is a very serious disease.  The public health risk involved is much wider than that pertaining to those who were infected through the blood supply.  It is estimated, in line with international data, that more than 30,000 people in Ireland are infected with the hepatitis C virus, with over half of those cases undiagnosed.  It is also estimated that over 70% of people with hepatitis C are or were intravenous drug users.  In line with the recommendations of a Department of Health advisory group established by the chief medical officer, in 2015 the HSE established a national treatment programme for people with hepatitis C.  Although treatment was in place for patients before 2015, it tended to be local and without consistency of approach and outcome measurement was fragmented.  The national hepatitis C treatment programme is a multi-annual public health plan to treat all people with hepatitis C in Ireland, irrespective of the source of infection.  It is delivered in a range of healthcare settings with a view to making hepatitis C a rare disease in Ireland by 2026 and eventually eliminating it.<\/p><p> The programme has received &euro;30 million in annual funding since 2015.  This structured, programmatic clinical approach allowed for the early and timely introduction of very expensive but cost-effective direct-acting anti-viral treatments for very seriously ill citizens, which were new treatments at that time.  The treatments are capable of effecting a cure in over 90% of cases.  The programme has a programme manager and a clinical lead who are supported by a clinical advisory group and an overall advisory committee.  As well as access to anti-viral treatment, it provides a national register to measure treatment plan outcomes; access to treatment based upon agreed clinical prioritisation in line with international criteria; a clear decision pathway for treatment access, involving patient prioritisation, registration and reimbursement approval; treatment for both State-infected and other patients; and that all State-infected patients, clinically prioritised or not, were to be offered treatment by the end of 2017 in conjunction with clinically prioritised patients being treated.  I am pleased to state that the latter goal has been met.  All State-infected patients identified as suitable for treatment have commenced or been offered treatment.  The HSE has advised a 98% success rate in this group of patients.<\/p><p> The HSE has consistently driven down the net cost of treatment per patient and as a result it expects to treat four times as many patients in 2018 within the existing annual budget as it did in 2015.  Among the programme's achievements are that nearly 3,000 people have been successfully provided with treatment for hepatitis C since 2015 and hepatitis C was eradicated in the Irish haemophilia population by the end of 2016.  Treatment commenced in paediatric patients in 2017.  More patients are being treated each year, up from 350 in 2015 to an expected 1,800 in 2018, as the programme achieves better value in drug procurement.  Treatment is available to all patients who are clinically prioritised, with no restrictions on availability other than treatment capacity.  Treatment is provided outside the hospital setting through HSE addiction treatment centres.  This began on a pilot basis in 2017, with plans for additional sites, including prison and homeless services.  A treatment registry has been established with the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics.  The current virus clearance rate at 12 weeks after treatment is over 95%.<\/p><p> The Irish health service is a vast undertaking delivered by people for people.  The Department recognises the overriding importance of patient safety and quality in the delivery of health services.  By any measure, the planned and programmatic treatment of hepatitis C has been very successful.  However, it is time to move to a new phase of identifying and treating at-risk individuals and populations.  The Department has received a proposal from the HSE to use some of the savings in the annual &euro;30 million budget to develop treatment capacity, which would enable more people to access services.  The Minister has given his agreement in principle to the proposed broadening of the model of care into community-based programmes, subject to details on the deployment of resources being worked out with the HSE.  This should lead to an even more comprehensive programme which will include all elements of care including screening, testing and treatment.  It will be a significant step forward in realising Irish, European and World Health Organization goals of making hepatitis C a rare disease and eventually eliminating it.  When I was before this committee in October 2015, I noted that &euro;30 million had been made available by Government to roll out the hepatitis C treatment programme and that, although we could not undo the damage of the past, it was expected that this would represent a very good use of the State&rsquo;s resources.  I am glad that the results have confirmed this to be so and that by any measure the programme has been very successful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018112200002#M00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Breslin","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542877200,"counter":238,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members for the invitation to attend the committee meeting today.  I am joined today by my colleagues Dr. Colm Henry, chief clinical officer, Ms Michele Tait, programme manager of the hepatitis C programme, and Professor Aiden McCormick, clinical lead to the national hepatitis C treatment programme.<\/p> <p>  With the permission of the Chair, I will begin part of the way through the provided opening statement in order to avoid repetition.  The national hepatitis C treatment programme is led by a clinical lead and a full-time programme manager.  It is supported by a programme advisory group which provides oversight and strategic advice.  The group is representative of key internal and external stakeholders including researchers, public health specialists, clinicians, pharmacists and service planners and aims to ensure successful implementation of the multi-annual public health plan for the treatment of hepatitis C in Ireland over the coming years.<\/p> <p>  Since 2015, the national hepatitis C treatment programme has provided treatment to some 3,600 patients, beginning with those most in critical need.  The programme has commenced the extension of hepatitis C treatment away from the traditional hospital-based model where appropriate and integrating it into community-based healthcare within a number of HSE addiction treatment centres.  The initial outcomes from these programmes are extremely positive, with each patient engaging fully with his or her treatment.  Those who have completed their treatment have each received a sustained virological response, that is, a cure.  The programme is planning a further extension of treatment availability within the community setting outside of these clinics.<\/p> <p>  The programme has established a treatment registry, which records anonymised data relating to patients provided with treatment.  The registry monitors treatment uptake, activity, prescribing trends and patient outcomes.  It provides a platform for clinicians to register patients they intend commencing on treatment.  The Comptroller and Auditor General examination of the treatment of hepatitis C in Ireland recommended the linking of data collected through the notifications of hepatitis C under infectious diseases regulations to the national hepatitis C treatment registry.  The HSE agrees that linking these data is beneficial in planning treatment.  However, it presents a range of difficulties in terms of patient consent, data privacy and feasibility.  Our division of public health is examining the barriers that need to be overcome in relation to linkage.  The HSE is continuing to develop its existing treatment registry to ensure any patients diagnosed with hepatitis C are registered with the national treatment registry.  The Comptroller and Auditor General report also makes recommendations regarding the continued planning of treatment and monitoring uptake to ensure patients continue to be identified for treatment and linked to care in order to make hepatitis C a rare disease in Ireland by 2026.  <\/p> <p>  On the management of and learning from serious incidents, it is the policy of the Health Service Executive that all incidents are identified, reported and reviewed in order that learning from events can be shared.  In support of this policy and based on us learning from incidents across the health service, in 2018 the HSE published its incident management framework.  It sets out elements of the systems required for a responsive and proportionate approach to the prevention of incidents and the management of and learning from incidents which have occurred.  It places considerable emphasis on the importance of learning and the sharing of this learning at all levels in the organisation, including nationally and at hospital and community levels.  When an incident occurs, services are required to carry out a rapid risk assessment and take any immediate actions required to ensure that no other person is harmed.  Following a formal review, the findings and the recommendations must then form the basis of the development of an action plan with a focus on the improvements required to reduce the risk of recurrence.  The framework stresses the importance of sharing the outcome and findings of the review with other services.  Cognisant of the criticism that some incidents recur, step 1 of the incident management process focuses on incident prevention.  There are six steps in total in the framework.<\/p><p>We know that there is a strong link between the need to proactively manage risks and the occurrence of incidents.  An example would be where a service puts in place a fall prevention strategy and monitors the occurrence of preventable falls against it.<\/p><p> The HSE recently established a project team to develop a mechanism in order that the learning from local reviews could be considered alongside information from a number of other sources, for example, closed claims and complaints related to the provision of clinical care.  Since 2013, the HSE has undertaken an annual review of completed incident reports.  The analysis focuses on both the quality of reports and the analysis of findings.  The findings are themed to identify key areas of weakness.<\/p><p> The national incident management system, NIMS, hosted by the State Claims Agency enables services across the HSE and relevant funded agencies to report and manage all safety incidents.  As an end to end risk management system, it facilitates the management of a safety incident though its life cycle, from initial reporting through the review process to the tracking of implementation of recommendations, while also fulfilling the legal requirement to report incidents to the State Claims Agency.  A range of reports are produced by the NIMS at each level of the organisation.  They allow services to monitor trends in levels of reporting, the timeliness of reporting, the severity of incidents reported, active claims and outstanding liabilities.  The reports are used as part of the performance management processes and in conjunction with other measures at local patient safety and quality forums to disseminate information and set out objectives for improvement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018112200002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Connaghan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542877200,"counter":240,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Connaghan.

I will focus on where we are as opposed to the tragedy of people being infected with blood products.<\/p><p>The United Nations has a target to eliminate hepatitis C by 2030.  Our aim is do so by 2026.  I am concerned that the low hanging fruit have been targeted in the initial phases, by which I mean people who are more likely to adhere to a medical regime or are easier to reach.  Let us estimate that the number of patients is 30,000 and we say we will deal with 18,000 a year.  The HSE will not achieve its target of eliminating the disease by 2026 unless we double resources or the HSE doubles its efforts to eliminate it.  Hepatitis C is a communicable disease.  The medical treatment emerged in 2014 and was licensed for use in Ireland in 2015.  There has been a significant price reduction.  I compliment the people who negotiated the price reduction.  However, I would not give them too much credit as most countries negotiated a significant price reduction.<\/p><p>Do the witnesses know whether tests on students have been conducted or whether the disease burden or load has been eliminated for 3,000 people?  Do they have data to show how many more have been infected, either through intravenous drug use or the exchange of bodily fluids or whatever else?  <\/p><p>I assume that the lead agency is in charge of reaching targets, but I did not see an annual target included in any of the reports.  Therefore, it looks as if the can has been kicked down the road to 2026.  The view seems to be that everything will be fixed by then, but I am concerned that no annual targets have been set.<\/p><p>Intravenous drug users are the cohort of patients who are the hardest to reach and make up probably half of the estimated number of patients.  They tend to be hard to engage with because they have chaotic lifestyles.  In my experience, as a community pharmacist who worked in a methadone service ten years ago, usually one finds when one engages with people such as these - I do not mean to paint everybody with the same brush - that they tend to adhere to regimes and turn up at their community pharmacy.  The relationship tends to be strongest between a community pharmacist and the person receiving the methadone treatment.  I very much welcome the suggestion treatment be moved to a community setting because I do not see how else we can target that portion of the population.  Obviously, the service will involve prescribing doctors.  I am sure pharmacists will be anxious to negotiate a very good price for the provision of such treatment.<\/p><p>It was stated each course of treatment cost between &euro;23,000 and &euro;92,000 per patient.  I understand the negotiated drug cost is around &euro;10,000 per patient.  Can whoever knows the answer explain the difference between the figures of &euro;23,000 and &euro;92,000?  Is it the price of administration or doctors' fees?  Have I missed something?  <\/p><p>I have seen evidence from other countries that there have been deals done with the drug companies whereby &euro;100 million, for example, would be given to treat whatever number of patients, but if we find another 2,000, they must be treated.  Have the witnesses come up with innovative actions to get the best value from the drug companies when it comes to dealing with this issue?<\/p><p>I am concerned about the database and confidentiality issues.  It seems completely unacceptable that one does not know how many people have hepatitis C, who they are or where they are.  As hepatitis C is a communicable disease, it is very important to know the dataset and who has the disease.  The approach seems to be <i>ad hoc<\/i>.  To tackle an infectious disease one must go at it and include every strain.  It looks like the easiest people have been dealt with and that the hardest ones to reach have been left until the end.  I find that concerning and do not think we will reach our target.<\/p><p>With reference to intravenous drug users, apparently one out of every three homeless people is hepatitis C positive.  That is a big concern if people are living in communal hubs or hostels because I imagine the risk of transmission is extremely high.  Do the witnesses have any idea of how many have been reinfected?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018112200002#O00300","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542877200,"counter":242,"content":"<p>Most of the questions are probably for the HSE.

Part of the confusion is caused by the notified results.  Up until 2012 people who were antibody positive were notified.  They included those who had the virus and had cleared it.  That gives a figure of 15,000 which includes about 4,000 who have cleared the virus.<\/p> <p>  I agree entirely with Deputy O'Connell that we have targeted the low hanging fruit, the people who will come to clinics.  We have to target people who are in the community and that is exactly what we are doing.  We now have four treatment programmes linked with methadone.  I share the Deputy's observation that the patients who are on a methadone treatment programme are extremely good and compliant.  As the one thing they know about is drugs, they know when to take them and we have had a very positive uptake.<\/p><p>We are expanding out to the community and we hope to expand it to level 1 and level 2 GPs and to community pharmacies so the process is ongoing.

I was one of the lucky ones who got a negative result but some of my contemporaries got positive results and the prognosis was awful at the time.  There was worry about contamination.  Some people were infected in the late 1970s and would have subsequently had more children.  They were worried about the children being infected, as well as partners and husbands.  It was a crisis at the time.  I remember it well because when something affects one personally one does not forget it.  When one looked at others who were not as lucky and got a positive result to the test one could see the challenges they faced with fatigue and so forth.  The changes as a result of the drug advances are incredibly important from that point of view because it is an awful infection if one does not have the ability to manage it.  We have the drug and there are people in that position.  Deputy O'Connell made the point that a person will have to be managed in a hospital if the infection is not managed.

There was contaminated blood in the blood supply and that continued after the service gained knowledge of it.  There is an absolute understanding across the health service of the need for immediate intervention to prevent further harm resulting from a patient safety issue which has an ongoing implication.  Another learning is that one must look back to see who was potentially affected by the issue.  Another is that while legal processes and other things take their course, those affected will require supports and one should work proactively to put such supports in place.

The Minister for Health or his Department has initiated a review of 335 positive BRCA genetic tests.  Some 3,500 negative tests remain to be reviewed.  This goes back to the issue of problems being foreseen or earlier identified.  The 2014 Donnai and Newman report initiated by the HSE showed serious dysfunctionality in this area.  However, a review is now being initiated based on claims published in a Sunday newspaper.  This appears to be a very serious issue which may be on a par with Cervical Check and the blood contamination scandal.  It strikes me that the early identification of issues, as referenced by Mr. Breslin, is not happening.  If serious dysfunctionality was identified in 2014, but now in 2018 no root and branch review on how to deal with that has been carried out, a lot remains to be learned.

It is in line with good practice.  There is a serious incident team managing this in Crumlin through the children's hospital.  Again, even in a situation where something like this has happened and, again, it is truly wrong and tragic in the individual circumstances, the incident management approach is to look beyond the individual circumstances into any wider risk there might be and to do a look-back through that.

In 2018, &euro;9 million was made available for a range of initiatives including the supervised injecting room and for addiction services for under 18s.  The Deputy spoke about treatment places and beds but it also is about getting people into communities to work on a multidisciplinary basis with children who have addiction and putting in place young people's counsellors, clinical nurse specialists and so on.

I made the question simple by only referring to external reviews.  What was the cost of those reviews and who carried them out over the past ten years?  Extraordinarily, I was told that the HSE did not have that information.  Following a search for the information I had requested, I was told that the HSE did not have a system to record the number and cost of all external reviews or investigations of patient care at University Hospital Galway.  I do not expect Mr. Connaghan to have an answer for me now.  I am just drawing his attention to this.

We do not know how many people have hepatitis or how many more new cases there are, so we do not know if we are running at a standstill.  There is no database but there are data-sharing issues which the witnesses hope to have dealt with by the first quarter of 2019.  As one of my colleagues said, this has been going on since 2004.  It appears as if nothing happened until 2017.  I refer to the Eastern Health Board report that was never published.  I understand that it fed into the national strategy.  I found a graph somewhere last night which I cannot find now.  The highest number of cases was in the eastern region under the old health board.  Those data would still be useful.<\/p> <p>  The strategy from 2011 to 2014 is out of date because it is from before the drug came into use.  I do not see why it cannot be updated.  There are no annual targets.  A comment was made about accountancy and clinicians but it all comes down to money at the end of the day and when the money runs out.  A clinical decision was made in the frame of accountancy when everything stopped in mid-2017.  The two go hand-in-hand.  I welcome the move to community care.  It is in line with Sl&aacute;intecare but there is not much connection there apart from it being a good idea.<\/p><p>No guidelines were published until 2017, when the pilots started.  There was another issue in the report, and I am not sure if someone brought it up when I was outside, which is the treatment centres did not notify the national treatment registry in 2017.  What was that breakdown in communication?  The drugs cost so much.  If the doctors prescribing them are, for whatever reason, whether it is paperwork or because they do not have to, not notifying that they have started person X on it, it does not seem possible to audit outcomes if the centres were not telling us how many people started on the drugs.  I am concerned at this entire process.  While I concede that moves have been made in the past year - and we have hopes for early 2019 - I would be concerned if this sort of approach was taken to CervicalCheck in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018112200002#Y03700","speaker":"1297","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542877200,"counter":555,"content":"<p>I know the Deputy might have to leave in a moment or two, so we will ask Mr Connaghan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018112200002#Z00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1542877200,"counter":556,"content":"<p>I have to leave.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018112200002#Z00300","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speech","time":1542877200,"counter":557,"content":"<p>The Deputy will get the answer in the transcript.

In his opening statement, Mr. Breslin said that in the years since these infections were discovered, a wide range of actions were taken, based on the recommendations of the Finlay and Lindsay tribunals, to ensure the safety of the blood supply.  That encapsulates the problem.  A problem arises and it is examined to make sure it does not reoccur but I would have liked wider lessons to have been learned from what happened with the blood supply.  This is the undercurrent of today's meeting.  The issue is dealt with but in a way that is totally divorced from everything else.  I do not get the connection in this regard.<\/p> <p>  At a meeting with the HSE on 5 July this year, we asked a series of questions and we got a reply back dated 16 August 2018, which we read into the record today.  The State Claims Agency was before us recently and we asked if it was possible that there were clinicians who were involved in multiple cases.  The agency said that if a clinician was listed in legal proceedings, the agency wrote back to say the name of the clinician did not need to be given, on account of the fact that it was the enterprise which was defending the case.  It seems the system is geared not to identify cases where learning is needed.  The letter we received said the HSE asked for a note on the introduction of a mandatory system of retraining and supervision following legal settlements without admission of liability.  It said there was no mandatory retraining and supervision following legal settlements without admission of liability, although retraining and supervision takes place.  The letter stated that the HSE talks to the State Claims Agency and looks at the trends the agency has identified but it seems to me that this is not just acting after the horse has bolted - it is acting after the horse is dead and buried.  The identification of these issues should be the role of the HSE, not the insurance company which is writing the cheque, which may be years after the event.  The last line in the reply states that the office of Dr. Colm Henry, the interim chief clinical officer in the HSE, will have the ultimate responsibility for implementing any necessary retraining and supervision of medical practitioners.  We are told that the State Claims Agency sends a report back to each of the institutions but these are landing all over the place.  Whose job is it to identify these needs?  The State Claims Agency is not picking up on them.  The report states that cases can be brought to the medical council but that is not what we are talking about.  That is for cases when somebody is judged not fit to be a doctor but that does not solve the problems where a practice is not up to scratch in some way.<\/p> <p>  This is why we are here.  The medical negligence bill is increasing every year.  The taxpayers have to pay it and that means less money for everything else.  The figure has gone up every year for the past ten years and before that, but we did not get any indication that anyone was really worried about it.  There is a demarcation between the HSE and the State Claims Agency.  Once a case goes into the latter, the HSE is out of the picture.  All it wants to know is what it owes at the end of the quarter.  This demarcation does not help the learning process.  The HSE should not have to learn anything from the State Claims Agency as the problems happened in the HSE to start with.<\/p> <p>  In his opening statement, Mr. Connaghan said the HSE had recently established a project team to develop a mechanism so that the learning from local reviews could be considered.  He might give us details of that and send them on to us.  He went on to say that, since 2013, the HSE had undertaken an annual review of completed incident reports.  Are they published?  Who is tasked with reducing medical negligence in the organisation when they come into work on a Monday morning?  Without this being addressed, it will mean less for patients and lower budgets for the HSE as a whole.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018112200002#AA01200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542877200,"counter":659,"content":"<p>Dr. Henry, in response to Deputy MacSharry's points, talked about some of the specifics of the points the Chairman has just made.  The first question was about what we learned from things going wrong in the blood service.  The Finlay and Lindsay tribunals identified a range of specific quality control issues within the blood service.  It was vitally important that we re-established confidence in the Irish blood service and a programme of work has been put in place to bring the service to a quality level that compares with international standards.<\/p> <p>  What the Chairman says, however, is correct.  The consequences of what happened in the blood service were defining moments for the Irish health service.  Internationally, all health services are dealing with the importance of prevention in achieving patient safety as the complexity of services has increased over the years.  At both policy level and operationally within the HSE, we have tried to move that agenda forward.  There is nobody saying our work is over and all of us are strong advocates for patient safety because we know the importance of it.<\/p><p>The actions that have been taken since then include the establishment of HIQA and the Mental Health Commission to put people who are not in the operating line or the hierarchical structure in to examine services and see how they are operating.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018112200002#AA01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Breslin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542877200,"counter":661,"content":"<p>How many reports has HIQA done?

We have put in place the National Patient Safety Office.  We have a surveillance programme and a legislative programme.  The committee will be aware from our previous engagements of the legislation that is under way in this area.  The HSE has put in place a quality and patient safety directorate.  There is very much a focus on this at the provider level.  Mr. Connaghan has spoken about the serious incident management protocol, which started with maternity hospitals publishing monthly patient safety statements that set out the levels of safety within our hospitals and explain how the risks that exist are managed.  All hospitals are now doing that.  There is lots of learning.<\/p> <p>  I would like to mention another learning from the blood service.  There is a need for patient involvement and patient advocacy.  I have spoken about how the haemophilia and hepatitis C community has come into the design of the service.  That is a critical aspect of how we need to operate as a health service in general.  In the coming weeks, we will award a national patient advocacy service.  When something goes wrong, people lose trust in the health service and need someone to work with them to find answers to their questions.  We are going to put in a national patient advocacy service involving skilled people who understand the health service, but are not employees of it, to work with people in such circumstances.  I am not telling the committee that we have cracked patient safety in Ireland.  It has not been cracked in any healthcare system.  We have to work each day to try to improve this.  We also have to improve our processes for mediation and engaging with people when things go wrong.  I was in Northern Ireland three or four weeks ago for a conference with colleagues there.  They spent &euro;117 million on medical negligence and they have every single issue we have here.  We are going to work together on those issues.  Dr. Henry has spoken about the work that has been done in England, particularly with regard to mediation.  We can learn from others.  We have done a lot in this space.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018112200002#BB00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Breslin"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542877200,"counter":667,"content":"<p>At the committee's hearing with the SCA weeks ago, we learned that the number of claims is steady but the amounts are going up.  We heard that this is just one element of quality, whether it is of doctors or of services themselves.  Some services, such as obstetrics, are more complex and more prone to claims than others.  Approximately half of all claims pertain to catastrophic birth injuries, the consequences of which sometimes do not become apparent for many years.  I assure the Deputy that there is a great deal of learning going on.  The national women and infants health programme is examining the introduction of proxies for catastrophic birth injury.  That would involve doing immediate incident reports in cases of neonatal cooling, which happens when there is hypoxia, and also in cases of perinatal events.  It is absolutely the case that we want to learn.  We do not want to wait for claims to come through four years down the line when cerebral palsy becomes evident.  We want to learn from the at-risk cases as they happen.  We want to apply that learning to all 19 maternity units in their safety statements and the measurements we provide to them through the Irish maternity indicator system, which is a quality report we give to all 19 units.

The demarcation line is a bit too strong.  There needs to be more collaboration and earlier learning.  I know about the costs.  We know about mediation.  We know all that.

The HSE has a lot of work to do on risk management and patient safety.  The claims that are lodged are one element of that.  They are a bigger piece of the jigsaw that needs to be done.

As Deputy Connolly said, even though this is substantially an historic matter, one of the specific reasons we are here today is the case of the late Brigid McCole.  It was just a few weeks ago that we spoke about the case of Emma Mhic Mhath&uacute;na in the context of the cervical cancer issue.  The public sees a connection when these cases of medical negligence arise.  The State had a responsibility 15 years ago and following a tribunal, &euro;1.5 billion in compensation was rightly due to those affected.  Fifteen years later, it looks as if we are starting down the exact same road again.  All of our successors who are here in 15 years' will talk about the cost of that.  I am worried that some other case will come up at that stage and the wheel will start turning again.  That is where broader learning is needed.  Every time there is a problem, we try to solve it.  We cannot foresee everything that might happen.  People have a sense of \"Here we go again\".  I ask Mr. Breslin to make an observation on that.  He can understand people feeling that they are not totally disconnected from these issues, even though medically they are.  I am sure Mr. Breslin understands the point I am making.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018112200002#BB01300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542877200,"counter":673,"content":"<p>Yes.

There are many other things we need to do, but that must be the primary focus of all health service practitioners.  We need to build systems that support people to make safe decisions as they go about their duties and we need intelligence that spots things before they become a problem.  I will give some examples of the scale of this.  Every year, we have 3.3 million outpatient attendances, 1.3 million emergency department attendances, 1.6 million admissions to hospital and 20 million GP attendances.  It is not enough to get 99% of those right.  If we get 1% of them wrong, that has significant implications.  That is the culture we need.  A great deal of work will be needed in the health service.

The intention behind the Bill is to clarify the standing of student-specific accommodation with respect to the powers of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, with particular regard to the issues of rent reviews, rent pressure zones and access to dispute resolution at the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB.<\/p> <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in takes the view that student licences and private student accommodation are already covered under the 2004 Act.  That view has been confirmed to the committee by the Residential Tenancies Board and the board repeated this view in its written submission today.  We are not seeking to change the law, but to make it more explicit.  Everybody will accept that there is a degree of confusion as to whether student-specific accommodation provided by private landlords or investors is covered in the 2004 Act.<\/p> <p>  The legislation was provoked by very substantial rent increases proposed by private student landlords in Galway and Dublin at the end of last term.  Members will know, because we heard from the students at the time, that rents increased by between 18% and 24%.  Our view was that an amendment to the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 was required to ensure that everybody was fully clear as to where these licences stood with respect to the legislation.  People will be aware of the impact of very high rents on students.  If a student is asked to pay rent of &euro;1,000 a month over nine months, it could act as a significant barrier to his or her education.  As we heard from the Union of Students in Ireland, USI, students are being forced out of education and prevented from taking their preferred option because of these charges.  <\/p> <p>  I found the written submissions from the Departments of Housing, Planning and Local Government and Education and Skills a little disappointing.  We can go through the detail with the relevant officials when they appear.  However, I did not get a sense from the submissions that the Departments appreciated the urgent need to address this issue.  Student rents were set at very high levels at the start of this term.  Unless we rectify the matter now, this will happen again.  This is, therefore, an urgent issue.<\/p> <p>  Another problem with the Departments' approach is that both submissions repeatedly state that the solution to the affordability crisis in student accommodation is supply.  We know that supply in and of itself will not address the issue unless it is accompanied by some degree of affordability.  That is a weakness.<\/p> <p>  The submission from the Residential Tenancies Board is very helpful.  It confirms that licences are already covered under the legislation.  However, there is a lack of clarity.  The RTB submission also helpfully identifies two weaknesses in our Bill and, as its sponsors, it is important that we acknowledge that.  Later today, the RTB will make the case that it would be helpful to have a definition of student-specific accommodation.<\/p><p>The Fianna F&aacute;il Bill that was published around the same time as our Bill does that.  It would be a helpful amendment to our Bill and it would be a good way of resolving the RTB's concern on our Bill.  We would see such an amendment as friendly if and when we get to that on Committee Stage.<\/p><p> The other issue the RTB rightly raised is whether our Bill would have an unintended consequence of giving students access to Part 4 tenancy rights.  That is not the intention of our Bill and that is not the current legal situation.  We can tease this out with the RTB but with some advice from it we could make an appropriate amendment to our Bill to ensure the rights that students are looking for around rent reviews, rent pressure zones and dispute resolutions are the rights they would accrue and the Part 4 tenancy rights would not apply to licences because the whole purpose of licences is that they are shorter term.  We would be more than happy to accept amendments on that.<\/p><p> The Minister is bringing forward a residential tenancies amendment Bill either before the end of this year or early next year.  Many of us in this committee have indicated support for it in principle, subject to the detail, but it would be much more helpful if the Minister dealt with this issue in that Bill.  Deputy Darragh O'Brien and myself have met with the Minister to encourage him to do that.  If he does that in the Bill or by way of amendment on Committee and Report Stages, Sinn F&eacute;in would be more than happy to withdraw its Bill, but in the absence of the Minister bringing forward his own proposition, we would prefer if the committee would proceed with ours, if only to send a clear signal to the Minister that the view of this committee is that we need this issue clarified and resolved as a matter of urgency.  However, if the Minister finds a way of resolving this in his legislation, we would fully support that and withdraw the Bill at whatever stage it is at in the Oireachtas process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018112200002#C00400","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542879000,"counter":687,"content":"<p>I will be brief because I know there is a packed agenda today and Deputy &Oacute; Broin has covered a lot already.<\/p> <p>  We cannot underestimate the impact the housing crisis is having on students, particularly those from a rural area.  My constituency is a mix of rural and urban areas and I am sure other members of the committee will have constituents in a similar situation.  A student might work hard, get the points and get the college place but many students cannot take up their places because of the lack of accommodation and the issue of affordability.  Many students even have to drop out after first year because they cannot manage the issues of the cost and quality of accommodation that they are expected to live in.  Unfortunately, some 60% of students do not receive their deposit back.  There is a myth out there that students are not the best tenants but that is unfair.  Many students get lumped into that category and, therefore, there are issues around raising problems with landlords and getting back their deposit.<\/p> <p>  It might seem like a trivial thing to some people but students work part time, at weekends and during the summer just to get that deposit together and that can be the difference between them staying in college or not because the Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, grant has not been increased for the past ten years and that has an impact.  We all know people who do not qualify for the SUSI grant and are struggling as it is, so it is important that it is clarified and that they have stronger rights in this area.<\/p> <p>  It is also a big issue for parents, particularly when they are sending their kids off to college for the first time or when they are leaving home for the first time.  They need to have some sort of reassurance.  We talk a lot about the housing crisis in this institution and we also talk a lot about mental health and the well-being of students and young people.  This is a small issue but it can help with the quality of accommodation, students having their rights respected and being able to access education.  It is not fair that just because a student is from a rural area that might be a three hour drive from Dublin that he or she might not have the same opportunity as somebody else.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018112200002#D00200","speaker":"1266"},{"type":"speech","time":1542879000,"counter":688,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies &Oacute; Broin and Funchion for coming in and for doing the work they have done on this.<\/p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Broin spoke about the submissions and I was disappointed with the submissions that I read.

I have no difficulty with overseas students and I see the benefits of it for our economy and everything but I am familiar with a particular international language school that has many hundreds of students here in Dublin and they are at a higher level because they are postgraduates, they are sponsored by professional companies and they speak better English than most people who speak English but they are here with a lot of money and staying for a year and they are occupying a lot of student accommodation.  There are great benefits from that too and I am all for the free movement of people across the European Union and everywhere else but there is no great sense from all of these reports how urgent the situation is.  The other side of it is that we have students sleeping in cars, sharing beds and popping up for two or three days and we have students who are literally trying to sleep on the edges of campuses and that is the reality of it.  That does not help someone to get on with their academic achievements.  There is a major crisis.<\/p> <p>  USI had a really good and informative submission which touched on some of those key issues around the vulnerability of students who simply do not have the money to provide accommodation and yet have a yearning for learning and want to pursue their academic careers.

I know about the tax relief that is offered to them and I stand to be corrected on this point but a single individual can rent out a room to students.  We should increase this resource to make it more available to couples or even families who live near or adjacent to universities so that they could offer accommodation.  In many cases, older people would benefit greatly from the social aspect of having somebody staying in their home.  It is attractive for certain individuals at the moment but maybe we could make it more attractive using tax incentives.<\/p> <p>  The other issue that is probably slightly more difficult is that there used to be a condition in local authorities years ago in respect of people applying for a home and whether an extension could be built onto their own home that would meet their needs.   Could we build on that principle?  Is it a possibility that we could encourage householders to build on extra accommodation in their home if they are in a zone that is adjacent to a university or a third level institution?<\/p><p>They could then enter an agreement with that university or with the appropriate body for a tenure agreement or whatever it might be.

This is a very proactive committee which has worked very well with the Department in arriving at solutions, although we do not always agree with it.

When we look at the figures for student accommodation coming on-stream this year, next year and in 2020, we are definitely on target.  When legislation comes before us, we must ensure it will withstand a challenge.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin has recognised that certain definitions require clarification and the Government must have these definitions before it can present a Bill to the committee.

Only recently, I met a group of students in UCD.  I fully recognise the burden, stress and financial fear they are experiencing.

Some 11,000 of those are on-campus or run by education institutions and about 20,000 are private.  Our view is that we cannot have a scenario in which one set of tenancy rights applies to one group of students and not to another group.  Our preference is that all student-specific accommodation is included in that sense.   That would require a change because the Residential Tenancies Act specifically excludes higher education institution student-specific accommodation.<\/p> <p>  It is also important to note that the Government, in its student accommodation strategy, proposes to increase the number of student-specific accommodation units from 33,000 to 75,000 by 2024.  Even if those targets are met, the shortfall between supply and demand will remain the same, at in or around 20,000.  There is a shortfall of 21,000 bed spaces now and at the end of this strategy, if all the targets are met, there will be a shortfall of 20,000 bed spaces.  Even if the targets are met, there will still be pressure on prices.  <\/p> <p>  Coming back to Senator Boyhan's point, one of the big difficulties is that the bulk of the student-specific accommodation being built, particularly in Dublin, Galway, Limerick and Cork, is being funded by private investment firms with a very specific business model.  They avail of very generous tax reliefs which are not available to universities or others.  Their business model is to build high-end, high-price, student-specific accommodation to target either the international student market or those who have the means to afford very expensive accommodation.  It is not enough just to say we need the supply because if supply is not provided at a price that students can genuinely afford, particularly those from families with average and modest incomes, there is a problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018112200002#E00300","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1542879000,"counter":695,"content":"<p>The Deputy is clarifying the USI position that Trinity Hall would be important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018112200002#E00400","speaker":"1432"},{"type":"speech","time":1542879000,"counter":696,"content":"<p>Our preference is that all student-specific accommodation would be included.

I will make a number of introductory comments before asking my questions.  The intention behind the Bill relates to a concern shared by all committee members, namely, that student rents, particularly in the purpose-built private sector, are rising too rapidly.  Many of us share the view expressed by the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, in a written submission to us that student licences, certainly in purpose-built private student accommodation, are already covered under many provisions of the Residential Tenancies Act, particularly in terms of rent reviews, the rent pressure zones and dispute resolution.  Therefore, we are not necessarily trying to change the law, but clarifying it to ensure that all students have those protections.  We are mindful not to, for example, confuse matters by extending to student licences the entitlements of a Part 4 tenancy.  We, the sponsors of the Bill, mentioned our willingness to make amendments to address that issue, but our preference is for the Minister to introduce amendments to the upcoming residential tenancies (amendment) Bill.  If he does so, we have stated on the record that we will withdraw our Bill, as that would be the most effective way to proceed.<\/p> <p>  I have a number of concerns with the two submissions.  For example, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government is of the view that the most effective way of limiting the cost of purpose-built student accommodation generally is to increase supply.<\/p><p>Many of us have been arguing for a long time that supply increases alone will not guarantee affordability without adequate protections, such as the rent-review mechanisms.  We have already seen a very significant increase in private sector supply, but we are also seeing very significant increases particularly in areas of high demand such as Dublin and Galway.  On the targets in the student accommodation strategy, we have a shortfall of 21,000 beds in the system.  By 2024 if all the targets in that strategy are met, we will still have a shortfall of about 20,900 bed spaces at that point.  Therefore the demand-supply problem will not be resolved even though the targets are ambitious and we will significantly increase supply.  Unless we deal with affordability now, we could have this problem throughout the timespan of that strategy.<\/p><p> The Department's submission refers to striking a balance between regulating prices in the market and providing certainty for students, but without creating disincentives for investment.  That balance has already been broken with students being asked to pay in many instances &euro;800, &euro;900 or &euro;1,000 a month.  In spite of the protection of the rent-pressure zones, landlords can hit students with rent increases of 18% to 24%.   My concern is that that line in the Department of Education and Skills submission suggests it does not fully understand the extent to which that balance has been broken for a significant number of students.  We will hear later from USI about the very negative impact it is having on students' ability to take up the courses they are offered or the very significant additional stress it places on them as a result of having long commutes to and from college, particularly for students from rural areas.<\/p><p> Do both Departments accept the view in the Residential Tenancies Board's submission today that student licences in private student-specific accommodation are already covered by rent-review, rent-pressure-zone and dispute-resolution legislation?  Can the officials reassure us that they appreciate the urgency of it and that work is going on behind the scenes?  Do officials from both Departments intend to assist the Minister to introduce his own wording to amend the Residential Tenancies (Student Rents, Rights and Protections) Bill to deal with the issue?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018112200002#G00200","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542879000,"counter":703,"content":"<p>I have a question from Mr. Crosby.  I read his statement and welcome that the Department of Education and Skills is open to extending some of the protections, improving quality standards and allowing students access to dispute resolution.  However, allowing students access to dispute resolution is of little value to students who cannot get into accommodation in the first place, which is increasingly the case for many of the students who cannot afford the prices they are being quoted by the student-accommodation providers.<\/p><p>A new student-accommodation centre a little over a mile away from here opened in the autumn.  It is charging &euro;249 for a single room <i>en suite<\/i>with shared kitchen.  It is charging &euro;349 for a studio.  In Cork city a new student accommodation provider based a few hundred yards from University College Cork is charging &euro;215 for its cheapest room and prices are higher for many of the other rooms.  <\/p><p>These days it costs students &euro;1,000 a month for many of these accommodation centres.  It is unaffordable for students from working-class homes and for most students from ordinary middle-class homes.  Increasingly people from very affluent and well to do backgrounds and some of the international students seem to be taking the places.<\/p><p>In his opening statement, Mr. Crosby said a balance had to be struck between prices and certainty for students on the one hand on the other hand being careful not to provide a disincentive for student accommodation providers.  He also referred to legal requirements, which we can discuss further in the meeting.  What are the legal requirements which provide an obstacle, presumably, to cutting these prices?  There is no balance.  Where is the balance between the rights of a multinational global corporation which is a major player in the international property scene charging &euro;1,000 in rent and the rights of a student who needs a roof over their head when they come to Dublin or Cork city to study?  Does he not accept there is a gross imbalance in that situation?<\/p><p>The rents need to be cut - not trimmed, but slashed - to make these places affordable.  If that means a disincentive - in other words that the student-accommodation providers go elsewhere in order to maximise profits - does it not put us back to square one with the issue we need to face in the first place which is that we need public investment to assist the institutes of higher education to provide public affordable accommodation for students on campus?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018112200002#H00200","speaker":"1432"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542879000,"counter":704,"content":"<p>Deputy &Oacute; Broin said that our statement stated supply was the best way.

I apologise if I miss anything.  If I do, the members might raise it again.<br\/><br\/>I do not believe there was a suggestion in my opening statement that a balance needs to be maintained.  We are saying that a balance needs to be struck.  In the measures being introduced by us, there is a need to ensure a balance.  It is important to clarify that this is what the provision meant.<br\/><br\/>My next point probably segues into the other question we were asked on the point of controls if students do not have access to accommodation.  In referring to striking a balance, I am speaking very much from the perspective of my Department and Minister, and based on our concern for the students.  If measures are put in place that disincentivise supply significantly, there will be no supply.  If there is no supply and if accommodation is not built in the first place, students will not have access to accommodation, whether it is affordable.  From that point of view, our objectives are to maximise supply and achieve rent predictability in a balanced way.<br\/><br\/>There was a question on legal requirements in this regard.  As Mr. Dunne stated, people are well aware that the Residential Tenancies Act is complex.  I do not characterise the legal requirements we are referring to as obstacles <i>per se<\/i>.  First, the issue is that the legislation is complex, and sections of it tend to relate to each other.  We need to work through the issues together and in consultation with the Attorney General to make sure the law we bring forward is sensible.  In doing what we do, we have to have regard to the law as it stands and the Constitution.  This is a matter in which my colleagues in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government have expertise.  We have to make sure that what we do will withstand legal challenge.<br\/><br\/>I missed out on the point on the RTB submission.  I have to admit that I am not familiar with its content.  If our understanding is open to challenge, it is open to challenge.  Our understanding is that where purpose-built student accommodation is definitively under licence, it is effectively not under tenancy.  If it is under tenancy, it has the full range of protections and full access to dispute resolution and so on.  Mr. Dunne has touched on this.  Our objective is to ensure RPZ protection, rent predictability and access to dispute-resolution mechanisms for students, and to ensure they have access to affordable accommodation in the first place.<br\/><br\/>On the question of public and private investment, the most recent update we have on the implementation of the national student accommodation strategy and the provision of purpose-built student accommodation shows there is a significant tilt towards private or commercial sector provision in the current development pipeline.  Between what is complete on site and plans approved, the figure for the public side, which is effectively the higher education institutions, is of the order of 3,500 or 3,600.  The figure for the preplanning work being done by the public side - again the higher education institutes - is approximately double that, amounting to approximately 7,000.  As well as trying to make sure there is private and commercial investment, an effort is being made in this area.  Issues that arise are the capacity of universities to put measures in place and the capacity of institutes of technology and how they might be assisted.  All these issues are also associated with the policy side of what we do.  It is, therefore, not just a simple matter of saying we believe there is a balance in place and that this is the only measure.  As Mr. Dunne said, this is not a matter one deals with quickly.  Equalising supply and demand is a more long-term objective.  In the meantime, there are measures to be taken.  We would not want it believed that this is the only thing being done.<br\/><br\/>If I have missed any point, I can pick up on it again.  I believe I have covered all the questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018112200002#J00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Philip Crosby"},{"type":"speech","time":1542879000,"counter":710,"content":"<p>One of the submissions referred to how housing constitutes a barrier to access to education and staying in education.

Deputy &Oacute; Broin made the point this morning that we are willing to work with the Minister and Department to ascertain what amendments can be made, or whether they can come up with something that would allow us to withdraw our Bill.

We wish to clearly indicate our support for the Bill and thank its proposers, Deputies &Oacute; Broin and Funchion.  We support the imperative of giving students living in student-specific accommodation under licence the full protections of the Residential Tenancies Acts, including access to the TB and inclusion in RPZs.<\/p> <p>  On the night of the census in 2016, there were 429 homeless students in Ireland, comprising more than 8% of the total homeless number that night.  When the Government&rsquo;s student accommodation strategy was launched in July 2017, the excess demand for purpose-built student accommodation was more than 23,000 beds.  That is expected to increase to almost 26,000 by 2019, which means that even if all projected purpose-built student accommodation is successfully completed, we will still be short 16,000 beds.<\/p> <p>  Casting an eye over Dublin inner city, one would be forgiven for thinking that student accommodation sufficient to meet the need is being built.  However, there has been a 2% increase in student numbers each year for the past decade and that growth is expected to continue for the next decade.  The Government has not built enough student accommodation to cover the increase, let alone addressing the existing shortage.  The housing system is buckling under the pressure and becoming a significant barrier to accessing education.  According to a DIT student life survey, the estimated cost of living per annum while studying at third level is &euro;12,495, including fees of &euro;3,000, which are the second highest in Europe.  Grant rates were massively cut in budget 2012 and have not been adequately restored, in particular for postgraduate students.  <\/p> <p>  Three key issues in regard to purpose-built student accommodation are cost and lack of affordability, the lack of RPZs governing increases and the lack of tenant rights.  Much new student accommodation is built as purpose-built student accommodation by Irish and global property investors, but the rents being charged are often unaffordable for the average student.  In our experience, such accommodation is predominantly targeted at international students, who usually pay higher fees and are thus attractive for underfunded colleges.  This new supply will not relieve the student accommodation crisis.  This form of accommodation and the large profits being made from it by real estate investors are being subsidised and encouraged by Government policy that allows investors to pay little tax.  Furthermore, they do not have a Part V social housing obligation and the units are far smaller than normal apartment regulation size.  Importantly, the new units are exempt from the rent cap and allow a higher market rent which embeds permanent unaffordability into Irish student accommodation.  This shows that current Government policy has a strong influence in supporting speculative and unaffordable housing provision.  The purpose-built student accommodation currently under construction may include cinemas, bowling alleys and games rooms that are unnecessary for students who face high education costs.<\/p> <p>  Students in purpose-built student accommodation are treated as licensees rather than tenants and do not have the same rights.  Purpose-built student accommodation in RPZs does not fall under the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016.  This summer, there were rent increases of up to 18% in Galway, affecting NUIG students among others, and 27% in Dublin, affecting DCU students among others.  The inclusion of student accommodation in RPZs is the least that should be considered.  Students are sleeping in cars, staying late in the library and couch surfing with a friend or commuting for hours to get to lectures, all of which affect their ability to get a decent education.  The system is perpetuating and worsening educational inequality because many students who are considering going to college will not pursue their first-choice courses in places such Dublin, Cork or Galway because of the cost of accommodation in urban areas.<\/p><p>In effect, this is reducing the social capital of upcoming generations.<\/p><p> It is important to note that the Bill at hand applies to some \"student specific accommodation\" but may not apply to all of it.  The Residential Tenancies Act, at section 3(1)(c), states that the Act does not apply to accommodation let \"by or to\" a public authority.  At section 4(1), a public authority is defined as, among other things, \"a recognised educational institution, namely, any university, technical college, regional technical college, secondary or technical college or other institution or body of persons approved of, for the purpose of providing an approved course of study, by the Minister for Education.\"  In short, places such as Trinity Hall, owned and operated by a university, are already excluded from the Act.  It is not clear how this would square with the provisions of the Bill, which state that a tenancy will include a licence in student-specific accommodation.  Residents of Trinity Hall are under a licence and it is clearly student-specific accommodation but it is excluded by another section of the Act.<\/p><p> It would be important to clear up this aspect before the Bill proceeds further.  USI would support bringing halls under the remit of the act, as it would be unfair that students in these residences should be treated differently by virtue of renting from a university rather than a private landlord.  There has been an 11.3% increase on the average asking rent in 2018 up to September and it is already clear that the rent pressure zone concept is failing new entrants to the market.  Rent pressure zones do not fully function as intended but the increases therein are still substantially less than the 27% increases we saw in student accommodation near DCU.<\/p><p> Purpose-built student accommodation is the most preferred option for students according to the USI housing survey.  However, the opportunity to build is hindered due to institutes of technology being unable to borrow to build student accommodation.  USI has called on the Government to provide capital grants for higher education institutes to specifically build accommodation and lobbied for this to happen in budget 2019.<\/p><p> Over one in five of respondents to our 2017 survey experienced unexpected increases in rent before or shortly after moving in or outside of the allowed or agreed period.  A quarter of all respondents had a dispute with their accommodation provider, out of which the majority were in purpose-built student accommodation and privately rented accommodation.  Of those who experienced conflict, 17% sought professional help.  Most frequently, students looking for assistance turned to their local student union or Threshold.  Of the students in purpose-built student accommodation, 70% have a signed lease agreement.<\/p><p> Unless there is a radical change in the direction of housing policy, this crisis is going to continue to deepen and worsen but many solutions exist.  They are outlined by the new broad civil society alliance, the Raise the Roof campaign and the national housing and homeless coalition.  They were detailed in the Opposition motion passed by a majority of Deputies in the D&aacute;il.  The housing crisis has reached the point where the Union of Students in Ireland is leading with housing charities, trades unions and other civil society groups in calling for change.  Students are frustrated but it is more than that.  This is affecting their access to education and their success even within that system.  Next September and August will be even worse for accommodation and we all know it.  Students will then have to go into the private rental sector when we qualify; we are the generation rent who will suffer significantly later in this crisis.  However, we do not intend to accept the current situation, one without adequate rights, rent caps and rent pressure zones.  We will continue to campaign for the right to affordable and adequate housing for students and for a housing system that will ensure we can have affordable secure housing for our lives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018112200002#K00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Michelle Byrne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542879000,"counter":722,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Byrne for her presentation.

I will not make a big speech but rather I have one or two points and a couple of questions.  Maybe there can be a bit of back-and-forth.  On 3 October, I was really struck by the number of students participating in the protest.  If there were 10,000 people there that day, I would bet my right arm that at least half were students.  They were pouring off buses from around the country.  Students were there not for a day out but rather to make a very serious point about how the housing crisis is touching their lives on a daily basis.  It is not as easy to get out on a Saturday as it is on a college day but I am confident there will be a strong representation of students from the colleges at the next protest to keep the pressure on the Government.  It is on Saturday, 1 December.<\/p> <p>  There is much strong information in the report but there is one striking figure.  On the night of the census in 2016, 8% of all people who listed themselves as being homeless in the State were students.  That is nearly one in ten people.  Ms Byrne has spoken about the phenomenon of students going to classes during the day, staying in libraries late and night before staying in a car at night and continuing studies the next day.  Is she in a position to give the committee some more information about that?  Is it continuing to happen and, if so, where is it happening?  What impact is that having on students?  How many people are in that position?  I am sure she does not have an exact figure but perhaps she has a broad idea, which might be helpful.<\/p> <p>  I received a report about a public meeting held recently in Maynooth dealing with the establishment of a housing action group.  There were people there from the town but there were many students there also.  There were more than 60 people at a meeting on a weeknight.  For those of us who are educating, agitating and organising public meetings on a regular basis, having more than 60 people at a public meeting tells us something is going on.  I was not at the meeting but I understand that one of the points emerging from the discussion was another phenomenon.  Landlords may have a house with three or four bedrooms but partitions start coming out near the start of term and the house would be subdivided.  One room becomes two or three rooms.  Instead of having three or four students in the house paying rent, there could be nine, ten, 11 or 12 students staying in little cubicles in partitioned rooms.  I know of cases in Cork city with students being asked for &euro;400 per month to cover such an arrangement where they are packed in like sardines.<\/p><p>Do the representatives from the USI have any information, even anecdotal, about that happening, how widespread it is or any facts and figures?  If that could be shared with the committee it would shine a light on the reality on the ground?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018112200002#L00300","speaker":"1432","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542879000,"counter":725,"content":"<p>I do not have many questions.

I will address Deputy Barry's question on the hidden homeless.  Almost one in ten students were registered as homeless on the night of the census.  We are seeing a lot of hidden homelessness in couch-surfing, for example, where people do not identify with the word &quot;homeless&quot;.  They see themselves as students attending college.  They are commuting and couch-surfing.  They do not register that they are part of the homelessness epidemic.<br\/><br\/>This week I was in a Cork college - we were running a piece about housing - and a student came up to me and said she was travelling from Dublin to Cork every day to complete her master's.  It was not because she could not afford rent.  She is paying rent in Dublin.  She could not afford the rent she was asked to pay upfront for one term with a deposit on top of her fees, which would amount to &euro;14,000 in September.  That is the reality.  They are the stories we hear every day.  It is affecting academic performance.  She told me that next year when her timetable changes, classes will not start at 12 o'clock anymore but at 9 o'clock.  She knows already she will miss those classes because she cannot get from Dublin to Cork in time to attend them.  That is how it affects academic performance.<br\/><br\/>With regard to housing standards and partitions, we are in a housing crisis and housing standards are not being adhered to in any way.  Students are thankful they have their heads on beds and have roofs over their heads.  They are desperate.  They are not willing to challenge it.  They cannot because they will be told if they do not like it they should get out because there is another person waiting.  They are issues we see all the time.  We recognise that the RTB got extra resources in budget 2019 and we hope we will be able to look at auditing houses like this and clamping down on the problems we see daily.  I hope that gives Deputy Barry some insight.  <br\/><br\/>I will comment on what Deputy Funchion said about additional resources to SUSI.  There is the student assistance fund and the chaplaincy fund, which is given out on an <i>ad hoc<\/i>basis.  I think the student assistance fund is the one the Deputy was referring to when she stated that students have to qualify for a grant first.  It is done per institution.  I have heard stories of certain guidelines where extra criteria have been added to cut waiting lists for the student assistance fund but it is not across the board.  From my experience in Waterford Institute of Technology a number of years ago, it was not the case; anyone could apply for the student assistance fund regardless of their eligibility for the SUSI grant.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018112200002#M00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Michelle Byrne"},{"type":"speech","time":1542879000,"counter":730,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Byrne for that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018112200002#M00700","speaker":"1266"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542879000,"counter":731,"content":"<p>No problem at all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018112200002#M00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Michelle Byrne"},{"type":"speech","time":1542879000,"counter":732,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Byrne and Ms Cahill for appearing before the committee.

I am joined by my colleague, Janette Fogarty, head of enforcement and legal affairs.<\/p> <p>  This is a very difficult time for students and in the housing market as a whole, with issues around supply and affordability.  There have been significant increases for students, which have caused worries for the students themselves and for their families who have to support them.  It can also impact on their studies.<\/p> <p>  It is important to understand the current position in respect of the law.  There can be misunderstandings and I do not want people to go away from this meeting thinking there are no rights for people.  The Residential Tenancies Act applies where a tenancy is in place.  This includes students renting from a private landlord, for example in a house share with other students or friends, and private, purpose-built student accommodation where a tenancy exists.  We believe that this incorporates the majority of private purpose-built student accommodation.  It does not cover student accommodation that is provided and managed by an educational institution which is a public authority, nor does it apply where people are renting through the rent-a-room scheme.<\/p> <p>  One of the main issues is that there is often confusion between licences and tenancies.  Many accommodation agreements are called licence agreements, but in practice they are tenancies.  Just because something is named as something does not mean that is what it is - it has to act as such in a material way.  A licence can be defined as permission to enter or occupy a dwelling.  It typically refers to a hotel, a hostel or a shared house.  We have a number of disputes over the question of something being a licence as opposed to a tenancy and people tend to relate it to commercial law, whereas we talk about residential law, which is very different.  Licences do not come within our remit and people who offer them are not required to register with us.  In cases of licences, a dispute cannot be referred to us.  However, there are very limited circumstances in which a licence can occur in the market.  It is really important that students understand this and are encouraged to bring a case to the RTB for a determination on the matter.  Unfortunately, not many have done so and we recognise that there is an information deficit in this area and some confusion in the market.  When they have done this, however, students have proved that what they have is a tenancy agreement.<\/p> <p>  One of the key weaknesses at the moment, in the area of our registration powers, is that we cannot proactively enforce registrations of tenancies across the market.  We do not have investigation powers but the Bill being put forward by the Department will give us those powers and will enable us to go out and question people as to what are those licence agreements or tenancy agreements.  This is an important first step to enable us to test the law.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the Bill before us today, we support reform in this area, particularly given the increased student-specific accommodation that is coming down the line.  However, we believe a lot of the law already covers what is in the Bill.  It is about clarification and strengthening the law.  We recognise that there is uncertainty and a lack of transparency and students often do not know whether they are licensees or tenants.  We will work with the new legislation coming from the Department and we have worked closely with the Department on the issues in question.  If this particular Bill is enacted, we would suggest some changes to strengthen it.  In that respect, there are three points we would raise.  The first is a definition of student-specific accommodation.  Does it include a house share in which there are four students, as opposed to something that has been designed for students?  Other properties are refurbished by private companies and used as student-specific accommodation.  There are many nuances to this that would need to be sorted out to avoid grey areas.  It is also important to have a definition of a student to clearly set out who qualifies.<\/p> <p>  We believe the issue of security of tenure also needs to be considered further.  Under Part 4 of the Residential Tenancies Act, tenants get security of tenure rights after six months, which entitles them to a further five and a half years' occupation subject to specific grounds that allow a landlord to end a tenancy.  A provision in section 25 of the Act means this does not apply to student-specific accommodation but it was specifically linked with section 50 accommodation, which was a revenue-supported tax scheme.  This scheme has now gone so the provision no longer applies and the matter needs to be looked at again.  Student-specific accommodation needs to remain within a nine-month term.<\/p> <p>  The third area comprises technical amendments which have to ability to trip us up as we try to implement the legislation.<\/p><p>One example of this is the issue of multiple occupancies.  With most purpose-built student accommodation there might be six units within one self-contained unit.  We believe that the legislation would benefit from clarification to say that this was six different tenancies and not one tenancy.  Otherwise, in implementing rent pressure zone legislation we are dealing with a one-tenancy situation.  This would cause a huge degree of confusion in implementation.   These are some of the technical amendments that the Residential Tenancies Board believes warrant further consideration.<\/p><p> We welcome the forthcoming legislation from the Department and from this area, once the overall areas that we have just outlined are addressed.  There is an opportunity for us to try to test this a little bit more in respect of the investigation powers we are getting.  Ultimately, we want the law to work and to work well, and that we would take the time to consider all of these issues.  I am aware that we are in an extremely pressurised environment, particularly for those people who are living in those accommodations.  It is about trying to balance those two things.  Perhaps we could take some consideration of these matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018112200002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Rosalind Carroll","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1542879000,"counter":738,"content":"<p>Deputy Maria Bailey resumed the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1542879000,"counter":739,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Carroll for her presentation.  In our session earlier this morning, Deputy Funchion and I commented on how helpful Ms Carroll's submission was.  First, it was helpful because we agree with the Residential Tenancies Board's interpretation of the Act as it applies to student accommodation licences in the private sector.  It is also important for us because we take our role seriously in proposing alternative legislation.  If the people at the front line are saying there are weaknesses in this that need to be addressed we must take those comments seriously.  As the sponsors of the Bill we are more than open to ensure that if it comes to Committee Stage, we amend it as appropriate.<\/p> <p>  Our preferred option has always been for the Government to do this because it has a level of expertise in the drafting of this legislation, including better access to the Residential Tenancies Board and its advice.  It would also mean that the legislation would happen because it would get through more quickly.  Deputy Darragh O'Brien and I met the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and  made a clear commitment that were the Minister to bring forward his own Bill or amendments to his upcoming residential tenancies Bill that satisfied the intent of our proposals, then we would withdraw our proposal from the table and support the Minister's Bill.  There was some very good news today when Paul Dunne from the Department said that this is precisely what they are doing.  Mr. Dunne indicated his hope that the Government will be in a position to bring forward amendments on Committee Stage of that Bill to deal with what we want and which reflect all the concerns outlined by Ms Carroll.  We expect this to take place in the first quarter of next year.  While I was not expecting it, it was particularly welcome that the Department said it wants to ensure the legal clarification - which is what the Department called it - applies to all student-specific accommodation.  This would mean the publicly-provided accommodation, as well as the private accommodation.  This was certainly a very important development.<\/p> <p>  Our view remains that until such a time as we see their amendments we would like to continue to progress our Bill, as much as a pressure point as anything else to be honest.  Ms Carroll's comments here today make sure that whatever we do - be it teasing out the Minister's amendments or some other form - we are better informed.  I do not have any questions but would say that as the sponsors of the Bill, we fully accept the concerns Ms Carroll has raised.  In whatever format it comes back to the committee, we will do our very best to address those in a way that makes her job much easier when the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, is implementing this legislation later next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018112200002#O00300","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1542879000,"counter":740,"content":"<p>I am interested in exploring the issue that most students believe they do not have protections in respect of rent pressure zones, the right to take a case to the RTB and so on.  I am hearing that in fact, many students and probably most students do have that right.  Let us drill down into that a little bit.  Ms Carroll mentioned that there have been a number of cases.  From what she has said I get the impression that it is very few.  I do not know if she has a specific number or a range.  Can Ms Carroll say if there have been four cases, for example, or that there were somewhere between three and six cases?  I would like to get an idea on that.<\/p> <p>  A student accommodation provider may be a big, global, corporate entity.  I am thinking perhaps of an area in Cork, which is the area I represent.  Some of the new student accommodation providers coming in there are charging more than &euro;200 per week.  Most of the students there are operating on the basis that they do not have the type of protections to which we have referred.  In the case of a student who signs up for a 39-week agreement, which would be fairly typical for the college year, is Ms Carroll saying that such a student probably has the right to take a dispute before the RTB?  Crucially, were the landlord or owner of the complex to turn around and increase the rent by 18%, which is an example we were given in Galway not so long ago or by 27%, which was noted on the north side of Dublin recently and were that student accommodation provider based in a rent pressure zone, would that provider have massively overstepped the mark?  If that case was taken before the board, is it as likely as not that the accommodation provider would be told it had overstepped the mark and that any rent increase would have to be pegged back to 4%?  I am not sure if I am getting this right and I ask Ms Carroll for clarification on those points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018112200002#O00400","speaker":"1432"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542879000,"counter":741,"content":"<p>The Deputy's first question is on how many cases.  He is right in the sense that it is a handful but it is difficult for us to know because student accommodation is not a category when landlords register.  It is difficult for us to identify cases.  Given the recent history, say over the last six to 12 months, and with us trying to look at the issue, it is probably a new phenomenon.  My sense is that the Deputy is correct that it is a handful of cases.  As an organisation with responsibility for registration of tenancies, regardless of the student accommodation piece we have been in court a number of times about licences versus tenancies.  Apart from the student accommodation piece, it is an issue about which we have been to court a number of times.

Currently, non-registration is a criminal offence and we would then prosecute that through the courts where we have proof.  It sometimes is difficult for us to get that proof.  That is the difficulty sometimes of having criminal legislation; it means that the person has the right to not incriminate themselves, and therefore we do not have investigative powers.  The whole point of the new legislation coming in is that it is a civil sanction, which sometimes seems less but actually gives my organisation the power to go out and deal with issues more practically.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of trying to get to the Deputy's understanding of the protections afforded by RTB, I will try to explain and perhaps my colleague might also come in.  With regard to licence agreements, many of these student accommodation providers - whether on purpose or not - will have deemed these to be licence agreements.  Many of the providers might think genuinely that they are licence agreements.  In our opinion, and it is only our opinion because a court would have to decide with us, in a lot of those cases it may be labelled as a licence agreement but in practice, a tenancy agreement is actually in place.  It is the practice that matters.  Where there is an uncertainty we want tenants to come to us.  We can hear it as a jurisdiction matter in the first instance of a dispute being raised.  It can come to us a dispute and we can hear whether the RTB has jurisdiction in the matter.  We can then get into the whole issue of proving whether it is a tenancy or a licence agreement.  We would be able to deal with it on an evidence-based format within that.  If it is then found to be a tenancy agreement, we can deal with the second dispute or matter if there is an issue regarding rent, or something else.  It could be about a deposit or landlord obligations around maintenance.  Equally, it could be the landlord taking a case on rent arrears or another issue.<\/p><p>That is my understanding.  Ms Fogarty, who is our head of legal affairs, is much more familiar with the technicalities in terms of licences and tenancies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018112200002#O00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Rosalind Carroll","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542879000,"counter":745,"content":"<p>As Ms Carroll stated, it is about examining the legalities of a licence agreement.  What the courts will examine is substance over form.  The legislation was brought forward to create tenancies, and people have certain rights within those tenancies.  If, for instance, a licence is created to circumvent the creation of a tenancy, it is in fact a tenancy.  The Residential Tenancies Board has the power to look behind the agreement to determine if it is a tenancy and to test the reasons the licence was created.  As Ms Carroll said, we have not seen many cases tested and we believe it is an area open to interpretation.  When we went before the courts, they examined the typical type of licence agreement that included certain aspects such as tenants not having exclusive occupation of the dwelling and questioned the reason for that.  One is trying to circumvent the legislation so therefore, in essence, it is a tenancy.  It is on that basis we would examine it.  That is where our powers lie, and we would encourage people to take cases regarding that.<\/p> <p>  On the rent pressure zones the Deputy mentioned, once the case has been considered, and the RTB looks at the jurisdiction element, as Ms Carroll mentioned, they can investigate where the person is paying rent over and above that outlined in the rent pressure zone measure.  There are powers in legislation for our panel members - our decision makers - to seek to have the rent paid back, and we have seen cases where that has been done.

To pick up on Deputy Barry's point and talk about a real case because sometimes talking about hypothetical cases makes it more difficult, there was an important decision by the Residential Tenancies Board in August, following on from the rent increases in C&uacute;irt na Coiribe, in Galway.  While ultimately the case was unsuccessful because the student was not taking up a new licence in that property, the determination is very clear in that that student property was subject to the jurisdiction of the Residential Tenancies Board and therefore was covered by the rent pressure zones measure.  In my view it was very unfortunate that the student who took the case did not have standing.  If somebody who was subject to the rent increase had taken the case, one assumes he or she would have been successful and the landlord would then have been forced to reduce the rent, which emphasises the value of the RTB having those additional investigation powers.  For the purposes of clarity, will the witnesses confirm to the committee if my interpretation of that case is correct, namely, that somebody who was on a student licence took a case to the RTB and that one of the important findings was that that licence was a tenancy and therefore, in that instance, is covered by the RTB if the person taking the case is subject to the rent increase?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018112200002#P00600","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1542879000,"counter":750,"content":"<p>We are engaging in a detailed scrutiny of the current Bill so I ask everyone to adhere to that as much as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018112200002#P00700","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1542879000,"counter":751,"content":"<p>Apologies, Chairman.

As members are aware, in line with other EU and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, countries, reduced rates for jobseeker's allowance were introduced by the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government in 2009 to tackle high unemployment.  The measures were to guard against the development of long-term welfare dependency by providing jobseekers with a strong financial incentive to engage in education, training or employment opportunities.  The Department is already finalising a report examining the impact of the reduced payment rates on jobseekers between the ages of 18 and 25, as we already committed to in the Pathways to Work 2016-2020 initiative.<\/p><p>As part of this process, the Department is also considering the contents of research undertaken by the National University of Ireland, Maynooth.

As far as I am aware, in many countries throughout the OECD there is a differential between the rates of pay to people under a certain age and those over a certain age.  That is a fact.  In 2010, when these changes were made in Ireland, we were just coming into line with international practice.  That includes practice in the UK, including Northern Ireland, where Deputy Brady's party presided over that system when they condescended to sign up to government for a number of years.  In any case, the fact of the matter was that the initial differential was introduced by a Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government in 2009.  I cannot recall the figures at the time but the difference was marginal.  It has been widened considerably since.<\/p> <p>  The Minister mentioned the rationale for it.  There was robust debate on the matter at the time.  That will be shown in time when Cabinet minutes are released etc.  The Minister has said that the wisdom of the policy is proven by the results.  I do not think this is necessarily a case of cause and effect.  The question must be asked as to whether, had this change not been introduced, we would be in roughly the same position in respect to youth employment as we are today.  There is no definite proof of that and as far as I know, that is what Deputy Brady is trying to ascertain in his amendment.  <\/p> <p>  He wants the study to see if the differential rates of pay have had the desired impact and what type of downside consequence it has had.  There are always going to be downside consequences when one cuts social welfare benefits to whomever.  I am not totally convinced, being mindful of the arguments made at the time, that the policy actually achieved the results it was brought in to achieve.  We have a record low rate of youth unemployment now but I do not know whether that policy has anything to do with it.  While I am open to correction, my understanding from the Minister's reply, to bring the matter up to date, is that she is doing this anyway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2018112200002#B01900","speaker":"1227"},{"type":"speech","time":1542880800,"counter":799,"content":"<p>Yes, I-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2018112200002#B02000","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1542880800,"counter":800,"content":"<p>I will let in Deputy Brady first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2018112200002#B02100","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speech","time":1542880800,"counter":801,"content":"<p>I am sorry.

The Minister will be well aware of the issues facing full-time carers across the country who provide a phenomenal service and enable the State to save millions, if not billions, of euro on an annual basis through their caring duties.  There are significant issues for carers, including financial constraints.  They have to provide full-time care for a minimum of 35 hours per week but receive a mere &euro;16 in addition to social welfare rates so they are providing a service for little or nothing.

It would be a useful report for us to have in general.  I do not have the figures in front of me but carers provide significant service to the State by providing full-time care at home.  If we treated them better and took them more seriously, we would get a lot more out of the population in terms of minding those who need to be minded.  It is far better to be minded at home than to be minded in a healthcare facility or hospital.  I cared for my mother for a couple of years and was able to work 15 hours per week.  I was doing some part-time work for my union at the time in the form of tutoring.  It all worked well for me.  My mother has since died but, following the care I provided, my sister cared for her for 15 years.  My sister is now in her early sixties and has nowhere to go in the labour market.  She has been discarded, which is depressing for her.  A report could tell us a great deal about the role of women in society as well.  It could have a more holistic vision of what we want to do for women and family carers.  I worry that people like my sister could suffer ill-health because of the sense that having sacrificed so much of their lives doing something that is valuable to society, they are now useless and nobody cares about them.  I am sure the Minister recognises the value of the work they, as do all of us, but the consequences of not having the facts, figures and an insight into it are that we will miss out on something.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2018112200002#E00300","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1542880800,"counter":858,"content":"<p>I am supportive of the final point made by Deputy Smith because one in 20 people in Ireland is a carer.  The projections are that by 2030, that figure will increase to one in five.  A significant volume of unpaid caring work is provided free to the State.  Various figures have been bandied around but the volume of unpaid caring carried out is a significant boon to the State.  Only 25% of carers are in receipt of the carer's allowance, which means that 75% of carers do not get any payment for it or any recognition from the State.  It is a rapidly growing phenomenon with which we must come to grips.  A report like this would certainly be useful in formulating policy in that direction.<\/p> <p>  A number of points have been made to me and a number of points have been made by Family Carers Ireland in its various submissions, which we all read.  First, carers, many of whom I know, and many of whom are working literally around the clock and hardly have time to go to mass, are only paid &euro;16 per week more.  I know they are paid the annual allowance of &euro;1,700, which would enable them to take a break for a short time.  I assure members that this break is badly needed in every case.  <\/p> <p>  Second, there are concerns regarding the rigidity of the rules surrounding carers' ability to work.  I have come across cases where somebody is working on a flexible basis.  For example, they might work 12 or 13 hours per week, which means they are within the requirements for carer's allowance, but some weeks, they might work 17 hours.  When one adds it up over the year, the person comes in with an average of less than 15 hours, yet because he or she worked more than 15 hours on one or two weeks, he or she is barred.  That is wrong.  I understand that if somebody is judged by the Department to be a full-time carer, there must be restrictions on his or her ability to work.  Few people have the stamina, energy and time to be full-time carers and work at the same time but there is a need for flexibility and discretion.  A report, as suggested by the amendment, could explore that.  I have come across a number of case studies where poverty traps are beginning to emerge because of the rigidity of the 15-hour rule.  I have one person in mind but I am sure I have several others on my books.  This person came to me last week.  She is a very active woman in her thirties who works as a special needs assistant, SNA.  She is getting the carer's allowance for her disabled child and taking on SNA positions as they are offered to her.  She has had to turn down work even though she badly needs the money and could work because she is young and wants to work as much as she can.  She would be able to work more and thereby increase the family income, which is badly needed, but she is prevented from doing so by the rules.  <\/p> <p>  Another point averted to in the amendment is the fact that sometimes when a middle-aged or elderly person is caring for somebody else and the caree dies, an easy and recognisable pathway back into the workforce is not there.  On balance, a report along the lines suggested in the amendment would be useful.  We must formulate policy because of demographics, etc., and we need all the help we can get.  I do not know if a report along the lines suggested in the amendment could be done in three months.  I would be flexible about that.  However, such a report would be useful and we should have one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2018112200002#E00400","speaker":"1227"},{"type":"speech","time":1542880800,"counter":859,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for their contributions.  Everybody in the D&aacute;il or Seanad recognises and appreciates the caring that is provided by friends, family members and people in our communities up and down the country.  All Members recognise that the country's common good could not survive without the thousands, if not millions, of hours given by those people to other neighbours, friends and family members every week of the year.  The carer's payment is unique insofar it is an allowance towards an income; it is not a payment.  Since arriving in this Department, I have often wondered how it ever came about over and above the provision of services on behalf of the State because that is the only reason it is in existence.  It is not a payment because if it was, we would be paying pretty poorly for the volume of work that is being done.  That needs to be stated and recognised.<\/p> <p>  My Department has made changes in the past number of years.  The income disregards have been increased.  Deputy O'Dea mentioned the rules but there must be rules.  If the rule did not involve 15 hours, it would involve 14 or 17 hours.  There is a reason for rules.  I know what he is saying and I agree with it.<\/p><p>We have tried to move in the last number of years to provide different supports.  We now have health and safety training so we spend a couple of million euro every year trying to provide training courses and specific supports for carers so they can improve their safety, health and well-being during their caring years.  We provide bereavement counselling after the person who is being cared for passes away.  They are only small things but it is an effort to appreciate and recognise that wraparound support is needed for these people.  There is also special training in our Intreo service for people who have been caring for a number of years and then, as Deputy Smith said, find themselves isolated or removed from the workforce.  The training will help to integrate them back into the workforce.<\/p><p> I do not have a problem doing the report but it might not be exactly what the Deputy is seeking.  When we do the report the Deputy might then say that the Department is doing X, Y and Z and the Department of Health is doing A, B and C, which will not look at where the gaps are.  Rather than the Department doing a report in isolation, would the Deputy consider us having a series of hearings and perhaps have a body of work done, to which I will contribute, by the joint Oireachtas committee?  The committee could have oral hearings and invite not only carers' associations and advocates but also carers themselves to hear at first hand what they are experiencing daily and what they would like us to do for them.  It is not always just about increasing the payment each week.  There are many more complexities involved.  However, I do not have a problem doing a report.  Deputy O'Dea is right that three months is probably pushing it a little given that there are other reports to be done.  This might not work exactly the way we want it to in isolation and I believe there is value in opening it further if that is possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2018112200002#E00500","speaker":"1338","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542880800,"counter":861,"content":"<p>Everybody here acknowledges the work carers do, the savings for the State and the issues that affect them.  I have been struck over the last number of years by the number of young people who are providing a caring service for family members.  The restrictions there are affecting them over the long term as well because they cannot study for more than 15 hours a week.  There are also long-time carers who might be caring for over 20 years.  That has an impact in terms of their pension entitlements.  The impact of all that must be examined.  Deputy O'Dea is correct that there is the carer's support grant but that amounts to only approximately &euro;4.65 per day.  It is welcome but when one boils it down it is not even half of the minimum wage per day, although I realise the intent of the grant was not to provide a wage but to give carers some respite.<\/p> <p>  The Minister said the committee could do a piece of work on it by inviting carers to appear before it and by examining this in a holistic way.  That would be welcome.  However, the difficulty is that we have done that already in numerous areas.  The committee went through an exhaustive process in the case of lone parents.  We invited in all the groups representing lone parents and we produced a comprehensive report which made clear recommendations on how to address the issues facing lone parents.  The report had cross-committee support but, unfortunately, the vast majority of the recommendations have fallen on deaf ears.

They discuss their priorities and wishes for the budget the following year.  The priorities that emerged in this year&rsquo;s consultation included a higher rate of payment for dependent children aged 12 years and over.  That message came through loud and clear and we were happy to examine it.  Establishing a benchmarking of social welfare rates was an area that emerged from several people at that meeting.  The budget 2019 &euro;5 increase in the maximum weekly rate of social welfare payments to pensioners, lone parents, people with disabilities, workers on maternity or paternity leave and jobseekers are all above an inflation-rate increase, which is for the third year in a row.<\/p> <p>  As I said in my speech on budget day, now that the core rates have been restored in the main, it is time to fundamentally examine how we approach how they are set annually.  The Deputy might be surprised, therefore, to find that I very much agree with him.<\/p> <p>  Other countries have shown that by doing this and instituting a process of benchmarking welfare rates typically use a system where the core rates are fixed each year, with reference to either market earnings, particular prices levels and indices, and this works very well.  On a very snowy day in March this year, we launched the roadmap for pension reform.  The Government had already committed to adopted benchmarking for pensions.  I indicated that day that we would develop proposals to develop this commitment before the end of this year and we are on target to do this.  My view, as I said on budget day, is that we should extend this to all core welfare rates.  If a system was implemented, it would provide the context and the framework and it would be informed, measurable and evidence-based as to why a determination is reached on what a new social welfare rate should look like.<\/p> <p>  There are some concerns that we would have both an evidence-based determination of welfare rates and an additional political input, and that rather than having one new system there might be an amalgamation of the two.  However, the system of the Low Pay Commission which was established several years ago works very well.  I refer to its establishment and its composition of employers, employees and independent people.  How the Oireachtas respects and carries out its wishes each year is a very good model that we could use in the future.  I am very happy to say that while this amendment does not fulfil what I think the Deputy wants me to do, namely, to consult, which we already do.  I do not need to be told in legislation to do what I already do, but it would be very worthwhile if we moved towards establishing a body which would do a proper analysis annually on what welfare rates should be and to be mindful of it.

Firstly, the Department does not distinguish between child maintenance and adult maintenance generally.  The purpose of means testing social welfare payments is to ensure that when resources are targeted, they hit the targets at whom they are aimed, that is, the people who need them most.  Social welfare legislation provides for the means testing of social assistance schemes to take into account all income into households and all assets belonging to the people who seek support from the State.  Any income into a household must be seen as income, therefore, we do not differentiate between child and adult maintenance.  However, we very much recognise that there is a cost associated with providing accommodation which is why there is an income disregard of &euro;95 weekly towards housing.<\/p><p> We do not differentiate between child maintenance and adult maintenance but what we very much recognise is that there is a cost associated with providing a roof over one's head.  That is why there is an income disregard of &euro;95 per week towards housing.  Whatever is left in the maintenance payment is divided by 50% before we take the remaining portion as reckonable income into that household.  Ironically, Deputy Brady has a later amendment relating to errant people who are not paying financially towards their children.  We want to ensure that we have a system that is easier and more efficient for parents and we want to place it on a legal footing.  In the main, it is women who have to chase the other parent for maintenance payments.  I know other people in this chamber have an interest in that.  At the same time, when somebody makes a payment towards his or her child's welfare, Deputy Brady thinks the State should disregard that payment as if it is not being made and thereby diminish and discount the value of the parent who is contributing towards their child's upbringing support, care and maintenance.  The Revenue Commissioners, the State and the laws of the land indicate that income is income.  We have tried to be as flexible as we possibly can when determining disregards of that maintenance income into a household.

They are the two groups that especially stand out in terms of the statistics.  By disregarding maintenance payments entirely one would increase the level of income of those very low income families.  That would be a very good targeting measure.  I do not know what it would cost but I imagine it would be very little in the overall context.<\/p> <p>  I do not know whether it is still official policy but some people in the Department seem to be of the view that if a woman - it is usually a woman - goes to court and goes through all the hassle and confrontation involved in getting a maintenance order, yet the order is not obeyed and the maintenance is not paid, why does the Department insist on assessing that as income?  In practice, it only deters and discourages people from seeking maintenance.  If one seeks maintenance, one's lone parent allowance is either not payable at all or payable in a diminished form and one might not be getting the compensating payment.  Sometimes it can be very difficult to get money from some of those people.  Surely that is a deterrent to seeking maintenance in the first instance.<\/p> <p>  What is the situation with maintenance recovery?

When one looks at the statistics, it is evident that Deputy O'Dea is correct.  People on disability payments and those in lone parent families are two of the categories where we have the highest poverty levels.  It is difficult for a one-parent family to even try to get maintenance in the first instance.  I will deal with that in due course.  I take issue with the fact that maintenance is taken as income.  Difficulties arise when maintenance is awarded and then not paid yet it is still taken as income even though the lone parent does not receive it.  Significant issues arise in that regard and it would be helpful to have a report carried out which would set out clearly the impact that is having on parents and children in those situations.

First, that used to be the case but the practice was changed earlier this year for a number of reasons.  We started looking at lone-parent families and the conditionality that was set and some of the precarious situations some women were put in and we addressed that.  We also looked at the practice, which was not universally applied around the country, where some people were including the promise of a payment of maintenance in the overall assessment of means of the income of a household.  Promise my eye.  We only deal in hard facts so if there is no payment, there is no disregard.  One cannot have a disregard that is not coming into a household so the practice has changed.<\/p> <p>  Deputy O'Dea and I had a conversation last week about our own involvement with the Department in maintenance recovery.  I am conducting a review, which is very close to being finalised, as to what our input should be and what the conditionalities should be in particular for one-parent family payments.  I expect that to be ready early in the new year and then to make determinations on it.  If we are in, we should be all in.  If we are not in, then we should be all out.  I would value Deputy O'Dea's advice on that when we come back with the report, perhaps after Christmas.<\/p> <p>  I am not in a position to accept the amendment for two reasons.  First, there is no such thing as child maintenance.  When court orders are made for maintenance they do not apportion X amount for children.  If a maintenance order is made for &euro;200 a week, it is not stated that &euro;27 is for the mammy and the remainder is for the children.  A maintenance order is made against the parent that is not living with the children.  It would be very difficult for me to determine the impact on child maintenance of what the Deputy is trying to do when there are no data on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2018112200002#H01000","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1542880800,"counter":904,"content":"<p>I must interrupt the Minister.

As somebody who practices in the courts, I am a bit taken aback by what was said about maintenance.

The maintenance payment is severable.<\/p><p>The argument I have is about even getting a court order when everything is in place.  The judge orders someone to pay a certain amount, but that collapses after a month or six weeks.  If the man does not pay the money, the judge then tells his spouse to come back in.  The process starts all over again but in four months' time, the person will still not have a penny.  The Minister should grab the ball now.  She is innovative; I will say that for her.
