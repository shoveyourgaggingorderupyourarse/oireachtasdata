In other words, it is the ability to get national car test, NCT, data in order that one has the right to access to data if one wants to buy a vehicle.  It brings the position regarding privately owned vehicles into line with work already commenced in respect of the commercial sector.

I take it he envisages that the amendment will also contemplate that.  We all know what is under the bonnet of the petrol and diesel cars.  We are already seeing the second and third iterations of electric vehicles.

These amendments give a person, on showing his or her temporary residency certificate or right to it on arriving in the country, the capability of accessing a driving licence.  In circumstances where a person might be in the protection process, and who, thankfully, will now be able to work, this will ensure that if he or she can drive and meets all the other requirements, he or she will be able to access a licence.<\/p><p>There is another series of amendments.  I will not go into all the details but the amendments before us set out how that will be allowed.  The amendments provide for the endorsing of a licence, for a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to retain a licence and forward it to the Minister if it is revoked and for certain provisions under the relevant Act that apply to learner permits to also apply to driving licences.

To answer Deputy O'Rourke, this database is very important.  It provides knowledge of what is happening, which will benefit us in a whole variety of ways.  One of the issues with regard to the database of the motor insurance register was that it was felt that there was no need for the actual address.  Many of those details are captured because details of the driving licence have to be included and this includes much of this information.  It was felt that it was better to capture the person's name and licence details and that the address is not required.  There is a benefit there with regard to ease of use, management, monitoring and updating the database.  Not having to put in the address in that particular category makes the database simpler and more efficient to use.  It is to simplify the working of the database.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022062200002#D01000","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1655852400,"counter":54,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":55,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 12 to 15, inclusive, and 18 are related and may be discussed together by agreement.

Approximately 8% of private cars are fleet vehicles.  In the published Bill, we asked for information relating to &quot;the classes of persons whose liability is proposed to be covered by the policy and the number and classes of vehicles&quot;.  Following further consideration, we now propose to recast this and divide it into two subsections.  The first will require the name of persons covered in the policy and the second will require the class of driver covered.  It is an important distinction because a policy will sometimes name drivers while other times it might cover a class of drivers, for example, heavy goods vehicle, HGV, drivers employed by a firm.  By splitting the named drivers and class of drivers provisions into two subsections, we give ourselves the option to commence them separately.  While I hope not to do that, it would be a useful option if the roll-out of the database was to take place in stages.  We are not talking about the vehicles here.  This is about the classification of the drivers.  Reporting on vehicles held by a fleet is not to the insurer but directly to the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland, MIBI, and therefore to the database under section 56A(2) of the Act.  This amendment is to provide greater flexibility in how companies might provide information on their drivers to the database.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022062200002#D01300","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1655852400,"counter":57,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":58,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 13:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 13, to delete lines 1 to 3 and substitute the following:  \t&ldquo;(d) in relation to a policy in respect of a fleet owner or motor trader&mdash; <blockquote> \t(i) the names of any persons mentioned in the policy, and<br \/><br \/>(ii) where applicable, the class of driver whose liability is proposed to be covered by the policy;&rdquo;.&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022062200002#D01500","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1655852400,"counter":59,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":60,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 14:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 13, line 11, before &ldquo;applies,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or (d)(i)&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022062200002#D01700","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1655852400,"counter":61,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":62,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 15:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 13, line 18, before &ldquo;applies,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or (d)(i)&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022062200002#D01900","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1655852400,"counter":63,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":64,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 16 and 17 are related and may be discussed together by agreement.

The first is to drop the reference to the address.  I referred to that earlier.  We changed that in the context of the information provided to the insurer or agent by the client.  The address of the persons on the policy is not required because, as I stated, we get that from the driving licence.  The second change, which may relate to a question asked by Deputy O'Rourke, is to remove the term &quot;insured&quot; as a way of referring to the policy holder.  As the Deputy stated, a policy holder is not necessarily the insured.  In other words, a person may own a car but not drive it.  He or she could take out a policy on the car so that another person can drive it.  That is not common but it is something for which we need to allow.  That is the nature of the amendment.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 38 changes the data to be provided by the insurers to the database in respect of fleet policies.  The published text states that the insurer will provide the classes of persons covered by the policy.  This will now be the names of the persons.  We are also adding reference to policies held by a motor trader as these are similar to fleet policies but would not be captured by the present text, as referred to in a previous amendment.  Finally, we are removing references to the vehicles covered.  This is because that information will be provided directly to the database by the policy holder, rather than by the insurer.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 39 and 40 are small additions of a type we are making in a few places to add reference to intermediaries such as managing general agents, MGAs, after insurers.  They, as well as insurers, will have to notify the database if a policy holder notifies them of changes to the information they have supplied.  They, like insurers, will have to notify the database when a policy is cancelled.  <\/p><p>Amendment No. 41 is more substantial.  It adds an additional reason to the purposes for which the Minister may have access to the data.  This will allow my Department to verify the validity of insurance coverage for vehicles to be authorised on a road transport operator licence.  This is often an issue for the Department.  For example, in the case of supports to the haulage industry recently, certain licensed vehicles were able to access such supports, while others were less able to do so.  The amendment provides a joint capability within the Department in the context of sharing the insurance database details with the road transport operator licensing details.  We currently rely on self-declarations and that would continue to be the case without the amendment.  We do not have evidence that a person is in compliance with his or her insurance obligations.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 42 adds a reference to intermediaries alongside insurers.  This will allow them to see the data they have uploaded to the database in order to verify or correct it.  Under the amendment, MGAs will now be able to do the same.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 43 simply adds definitions of two terms, namely, &quot;National Vehicle and Driver File&quot; and &quot;operator&rsquo;s licence&quot;, used in the insurance-related amendments made by the Bill.  It is largely a technical amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022062200002#E02300","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":116,"content":"<p>The Minister referred to intermediaries.

We should probably look to give this power to other road authorities as well as the TII so that we move beyond national roads to other roads.  Local authorities should also have this power in the Bill.  Is the intent of the legislation prescriptive with regard to traffic flow or is it broader than this?  There are all kinds of reasons we might have variable speed limits, including safety, noise reduction and air quality emissions.<\/p> <p>  This might be the section of the Bill where we could look at a national kilometre reduction target as other countries have introduced.  We have one in the climate action plan that is specific to fossil fuel vehicles.  Other countries are applying such a target to all vehicles.  If we are to be true to the policy approach of avoid, shift and improve, we should try to reduce the number of kilometres driven throughout the State.  This is being done in other jurisdictions.  It would probably fit into this section of the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022062200002#F02100","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":163,"content":"<p>I would add the word \"share\" to the avoid, shift and improve approach.  There will be a move towards shared mobility in a range of ways.  This is a slightly pedantic point.<\/p> <p>  It Deputy Leddin were to table an amendment on Report Stage in the interim I would look have to look to the Office of the Attorney General to see whether there is any reason we could not accept an amendment whereby we change the title of the authority.  We would have to be careful that we would not miss anything because the legislative block is unconsolidated.  I am also conscious of time.  I do not know how long such a trawl would take.  I would certainly consider it if the Deputy were to table an amendment on Report Stage.<\/p><p> On the variable speed limits and the management of it, the primary reason is safety.  Near the port tunnel we have a monitoring service on the M50 and other roads approaching the capital.  I happened to be there last year when a car broke down on the outer lane, the fastest lane, as it were, and was stuck there.  It was an incredibly dangerous situation to look at.  You had passing traffic going at 100 km\/h.  Emergency workers, an ambulance, garda&iacute; or a fire truck coming to that incident would have a real challenge with how to manage what is a real safety problem.  Thus, the primary purpose here is for safety management of the road and potentially other roads, as I said, nominated by the Minister of the day.  That could include part of a national road.  We could do it section by section.<\/p><p> There are other potential benefits, such as alleviating traffic congestion problems.  Often the road is not acting optimally when you have a certain speed limit.  You may see you get greater capacity use out of it by regulating for speed but that is a matter for TII to decide on and we are giving it powers to make those judgment calls.<\/p><p> On the wider issue of avoiding, reducing, controlling, and management of emissions, there may well be cases, for example with issues of serious air pollution, and there are such issues.  There is a real issue around the M50 and the surrounding suburbs.  The emission of particulate matters, ozone, benzene and all sorts of chemicals is a very significant issue.  If TII is looking, as I said, and it can be shown there is an optimal way of managing that, I do not believe this legislation would restrict it but the primary purpose is safety.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022062200002#F02200","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":165,"content":"<p>That is fair enough.

It might make sense that at certain times you could slow the traffic down to reduce the noise, such as at night-time when people are more disturbed by it.

It is to do with amendment Nos. 72 to 74, inclusive, and the setting of special speed limits.  The Bill seems to deal mainly with national roads, TII roads, and not roads managed by local authorities directly within their areas.  I see in the proposed section 55(10E) there is scope for ministerial policy direction on certain speed limits.  Is there scope to be stronger on that?  We have had the RSA in here.  We have had many activist groups and cycling groups that are all keen to see a 30 km\/h speed limit set in urban areas.  That would of course assist us with active travel and also deal with the issues of noise and pollution that were just spoken about and generally make our roads a little safer and more inviting in the urban centres.  Is there scope within this to be stronger in that the Minister just may, from time to time, issue a policy directive?  I believe it lies with the local authorities to implement 30 km\/h speed zones.  We got advice recently, following committee sessions, there is no legal impediment to local authorities implementing those 30 km\/h zones but that would seem to conflict with what is in the guidelines for setting speed limits.

Some of them currently refer to the Road Traffic Acts 1961 to 2010.  That original Road Traffic Act 1961 has been amended many times in the past five decades and more of its existence, including amendments made post 2010.  In some of those previous updates, therefore, the citation, in the context of the Garda charging people under the legislation, could be to powers under the Road Traffic Act 2016, as amended by the Road Traffic Act 2010, for example.  Some previous updates could refer to the Road Traffic Acts from 1961 to 2016.We have not updated every collective citation.  That would be a significant task.

Typically, these are e-scooters or other similar devices.  In the published Bill, certain technical details characterising such vehicles are included in the revised definition for PPTs.  We are amending paragraph (b) of section 16(e) by lowering the maximum unladen weight permitted to 25 kg and paragraph (d) of section 16(e) by increasing the continuous rated power permitted to 0.5 kW.  The maximum speed of 25 km\/h set out in paragraph (c) of section 16(e) will remain unchanged.  These specifications are proposed as standard for vehicles falling under this category.  Following expert advice, I am also amending paragraph (d) of section 16(e) by clarifying that for vehicles where there is more than one motor, a combined rated power of 0.5 kW is the maximum limit.  Making these changes to the specifications for this class of vehicle will ensure that PPTs remain outside the scope of the EU motor insurance directive, which applies to mechanically propelled vehicles, and consequently will not require insurance for use on Irish roads.<\/p><p>Even in the time since work on this Bill commenced, the reality of a maturing e-scooter market has been noted.  The work of the Road Safety Authority informs our thinking.  My solution is therefore to satisfy the recommendations of that organisation and the wider public interest is to insert or such other values &quot;as the Minister prescribes&rdquo; in paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of section 16(e) in order that the weight, speed, and power output in the definition may be revised as needed through regulations.<\/p><p>This will future-proof our road traffic legislation, allowing us to make necessary updates as the sector grows and providng an opportunity for further consultation once the Bill has been enacted.

We will probably see that in every city and large town in Ireland in time as it becomes easier to travel in our urban areas by smaller vehicles.  We can expect tradespeople to travel by cargo bike as well as families.  There is evidence that families are getting rid of their second cars and getting a cargo bike in lieu.  I would be concerned that this section is restrictive on cargo bikes and especially the line about reducing down from 55 kg to 25 kg.  We must be careful when we discuss the power outputs of cargo bikes.

Under &quot;busway&quot;, section 43 provides for an amendment to the definition of a road in section 2 of the Roads Act 1993.  To provide clarity on what constitutes part of the road, it is proposed to make a change to paragraph (b) by substituting &quot;carriageway (whether single or multiple and whether or not designated for a particular class of vehicle)&quot; with &quot;carriageway (whether single or multiple)&quot; and to paragraph (c) in the definition of &quot;road&quot; by inserting of the word &quot;verge&quot; after &quot;margin&quot;.  These changes are included in the existing Bill, but as further changes are being made to the definition of a road, it is proposed to delete section 43 from the Bill and restate the proposed changes set out above.<\/p><p>There is also an amendment proposed to allow for a change to paragraph (d) of the definition of a road in the Roads Act 1993.  It is proposed to insert the words &quot;used, or the use of which is reasonably required, for&quot; in place of &quot;necessary for&quot;.  The reference to &quot;necessary&quot; potentially sets too high a threshold and needs to be altered to make it clear that the definition extends to anything used or reasonably capable of being used in connection with the safety, convenience, benefit and amenity of road users, including the provision of information.  This amendment will reflect the reality of the range of facilities and infrastructure that is now provided as a matter of course as part of a public road and are not strictly speaking &quot;necessary for&quot; the safety, convenience or amenity of road users.<\/p><p>On the second of these amendments, which deals with CCTV, it recently came to the attention of the Department that Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, is using a network of CCTV for cameras to monitor traffic and to assist with enforcement.  Local authorities use similar systems for traffic management and monitoring.  Cameras are used to monitor and manage the movement of general traffic, public transport and various other different transport modes.  These allow TII and local authorities to identify incidents, accidents, congestion, delays and other appropriate actions.  Enforcement cameras can be located at toll plazas or along road gantries, such as those on the M50.<\/p><p>At each enforcement location, the system of enforcement cameras monitors vehicles and captures necessary information, such as number plates, to support the management of the road.  These cameras are generally fixed mounted and generate images that are used for post-image capture processing, such as automatic number plate recognition.<\/p><p> Traffic cameras are also used to monitor and manage other incidents, such as marches, protests and other events, including weather-related events.  TII and road authorities share the data from these cameras with a number of bodies, in particular the emergency services, public transport operators such as Dublin Bus and Luas, and local authorities.  On behalf of TII, several contracted service providers also have access to this information.<\/p><p> These cameras, and particularly the use of data, are being used without a proper legislative basis.  The enforcement use of cameras, by its nature, requires identifying individual vehicles.  While most of the traffic management information is captured from a distance and does not include individually distinctive information, it is possible for the cameras to zoom in, and some images of registration plates and at times faces may be captured.  This amounts to personally identifying data and can raise concerns about the protection of the data in question and of individual rights in light of the general data protection regulation, GDPR.<\/p><p> Legal advice obtained is that this matter can be addressed by regulations in the short term.  However, this solution will have effect only until 6 December 2022 due to section 6(2) of the Data Sharing and Governance Act 2019.  It is, therefore, imperative that proper provision be put in place in an Act of the Oireachtas before that date.<\/p><p> It is proposed to address this situation by an amendment to insert a new section 77A into the Roads Act 1993 to allow for the provision of cameras by both TII and the local authorities, including CCTV cameras, and for the use of data from those cameras.  The proposed additional section 77A will give a basis for the provision of cameras, including setting up and operation of cameras, first, for the safe and efficient management, operation and use of public roads, including traffic management and providing information to the public; second, for charging and collecting tolls and the operation of toll roads; third, for the deterrence, prevention, investigation and detection of criminal offences, including road traffic offences; and, fourth, for any other purpose to be prescribed by the Minister.  The amendment will also address the publishing by TII or each relevant local authority of a schedule of the cameras in question operating on public roads.  Finally, we will provide a legal basis for the sharing and processing or use of data from cameras in operation between a local authority, TII, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the National Transport Authority, the Road Safety Authority and any other person the Minister considers necessary for the purposes outlined above.<\/p><p> We are making sure that appropriate protections are in place for the sharing of data, for data sharing agreements, for the safeguarding of data and for directions, guidelines, standards and regulations.  This is obviously not a position any of us want to be in.  Traffic cameras are an essential tool for managing traffic.  Come December, it will be necessary to have primary legislation in place to enable them to be used in a way which protects data in an appropriate manner.  I hope the committee will appreciate that we reacted promptly to this matter as soon as it came to our attention and that we have developed the necessary proposals here to address it.  In fact, it might have been a Limerick case that prompted this need for legislation before 6 December.  It is a highly sensitive issue.  It is important that we get the regulations right and that we respect the need for privacy as contained within the GDPR but also that we do not have an unenforceable use of cameras, which would be the case if we did not legislate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022062200002#L01500","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":321,"content":"<p>The Minister might give us an update on the engagement in this regard.

However, as a cyclist, I have experienced close passes and while I do not have a camera on my helmet, many cyclists do.  There is the ability to upload and send those data to the Garda or whoever it might be.  We all frequently witness very poor traffic management and behaviour in our towns and villages, such as illegal parking on footpaths and in disability bays.  Do we have the opportunity here to expand the use of cameras for managing and monitoring traffic to allow citizens who observe traffic offences to upload this to the Garda?  I understand the photograph itself may not be an admissible piece of evidence in order to take a prosecution but it will allow the Garda to build up a pattern, for example, if they are getting 40 photographs a week of illegal parking in a certain area.  While the photograph itself may not be used directly, the accumulation of photographs kept by the Garda would inform it of traffic offences that are happening regularly.

As Deputy Matthews noted, there is value in uploading that kind of evidence to a central system and that value may go as far as taking action against individual motorists and road users.  While it seems to fit in here and is something we should be seriously considering, it is not in the provisions of the Bill.  Also not in the provisions is the possibility of doing what is done in other jurisdictions, namely, having cameras on buses to pick out the bad behaviour of motorists and other road users.

I think we should be very ambitious in how we move forward in this particular area, as others have mentioned, in replicating the good work of other jurisdictions.  One of those jurisdictions quite close to us, just across the Irish Sea, has successfully put in place a portal for the uploading of dashcam evidence and camera evidence from all road users, not alone cyclists but also motorists and others.<\/p><p>It is also important, as others have mentioned, that cameras are used within buses and bus lanes in general to ensure they are the most efficient way of moving people about, particularly in more heavily trafficked towns and cities.<\/p><p> I recently asked the Minister for Justice a parliamentary question about the creation of a portal for the uploading of dashcam evidence.  The Minister's response was somewhat neutral but reasonably supportive.  It referred to the Department of Transport, stating, \"The Department of Transport has advised that any decision to allow film by members of the public to be used in evidence in road traffic cases would raise questions of reliability of, and possible tampering with, the apparatus used, as well as potential privacy issues.\"  This will hopefully address some of the privacy issues.  The fact of the matter is the Garda has sought and secured numerous successful prosecutions in our courts over the last four to five years using camera evidence submitted by cyclists.  There is already a provision within legislation, due to good work done by the Minister's predecessor Shane Ross, creating a unique offence of dangerous overtaking of a cyclist.  That legislation, combined with camera evidence submitted by cyclists, has already provided for the successful prosecution of a number of motorists with penalty points issued and fines imposed.  There is no question about the reliability of this evidence.  The courts have already decided it is perfectly acceptable to use that evidence in the prosecution of such cases.  I implore the Minister and his colleagues to engage amongst themselves and with the Department of Justice to provide for such a portal under the very significant road safety plan recently published by the Road Safety Authority and the Department, Towards Vision Zero.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022062200002#M00500","speaker":"1483","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":326,"content":"<p>This is a critical issue for us as policymakers and legislators.  Digital video CCTV cameras are increasingly prevalent and full of potential, as well as risks.  We need to be careful in getting the balance right between the requirement for privacy and the need for good enforcement of road safety and other measures.  There was extensive consultation with the Office of the Attorney General on these provisions regarding CCTV cameras because it had a central role in assessing some of the recent court cases and advising us on the steps we are taking.  We have also referred the matter to the Data Protection Commission and will have to continue to do so very extensively because it has a critical role in making sure whatever regulations are put in place get that balance right between the right to privacy and the protections needed in the sharing of data.  This legislation solely relates to cameras operated by TII and local authorities, for whatever purposes.  It does not relate to personal private cameras and how they might be used in evidence.  That is a matter for the Department of Justice and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There will be evolving legislation in that area and the Minister for Justice is working on that.  This does not relate to Garda cameras or cameras other than the ones operated by TII and local authorities.<\/p> <p>  This is a step in the right direction.  It gives certainty around the use of these cameras but it does not address the wider fundamental issues raised here.  I understand the potential benefits from the use of personal cameras, and prosecutions on the back of that, but I have some concerns about this in a world where AI capabilities and other mechanisms are being used.  Concerns around the erosion of personal privacy are real and we have to get the balance right in how we use this technology.  What we are doing here primarily relates to traffic management.  While faces or numberplates may occasionally be seen, this legislation does not carry those risks of breaching people's privacy.  The regulations we will create in conjunction with the Data Protection Commissioner will give us assurance in that regard and we will not do it without that reassurance.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the wider issue of the use of personal and-or Garda cameras, I would be slightly nervous about adopting what the UK or other countries are doing .

Section 46 amends section 44(6)(iii) of the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 to provide that the NTA cannot be interpreted as stepping into the role of a local authority under section 178 of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  The section also provides for the insertion of a new subsection 6A into section 44 of the 2008 Act, which relates to the requirement to acquire lands by agreement or by means of a compulsory purchase order for the purpose of mitigating the impact of any public transport infrastructure on the environment generally, any particular site, building or structure, the availability of parking, or trees and landscaping.

Section 56 of this new Part concerns functions of the Minister for Transport in respect of zero-to-low-emission vehicles.  This new section, along with the associated amendments in this group, are related to the establishment of an office of low-emission vehicles, as recommended in the electric vehicles policy pathway report that was published last September and mandated under action No. 274 of the Climate Action Plan.  Preparations are under way in my Department to establish this office, to be known as &quot;Zero Emission Vehicles Ireland&quot;, or &quot;ZEVI&quot;, which will play an important role in our transition to zero-emission vehicles.  ZEVI will have a broad remit in support of the Government's goal of achieving almost 1 million electric vehicles, EVs, on Irish roads by 2030 and will play an important role in Ireland's transition to zero-emission vehicles by co-ordinating measures to support the uptake of EVs and the roll-out of charge point infrastructure.  It will work across the government and society to support this transition.  Its operations will include: supports for EV uptake; infrastructure delivery; strategy; and policy lead, including in respect of taxation and regulation, research and innovation, communications and public and stakeholder engagement.  ZEVI will have an objective voice on EVs, providing advice to the public and private sectors and carrying out significant stakeholder engagement.<\/p><p>Currently, ZEVI's functions are split across four organisations: my Department; the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI; the NTA; and TII.  It is intended that these functions will continue to be delivered by the named organisations but under the umbrella of the new office, which will bring these policy and delivery functions into one hybrid organisation with a single identity and focus to enable delivery of the ambitious EV targets under the Climate Action Plan.<\/p><p>I anticipate that ZEVI will be established in my Department next month.<\/p><p>To facilitate the establishment of the office within my Department, the new sections 56(1) and 56(2) give the Minister for Transport new statutory functions in relation to zero- to low-emission vehicles and the related charging and refuelling infrastructure to enable him or her, as the case may be, to establish ZEVI to operate in the EV and infrastructure space.  ZEVI will be mandated to promote and seek to accelerate the uptake of EVs and to promote, increase and develop public awareness of such vehicles and the availability of the related infrastructure to support this uptake.<\/p><p> In this context, the new section 56(3) sets out a number of actions the Minister for Transport, essentially ZEVI, may take, as required, to achieve these objectives.  The Minister may assist in the provision of recharging and refuelling infrastructure, carry out EV and infrastructure training and research, promote and assist research of new EV technologies, advise on design, standards, accessibility, operation and use of EVs and related infrastructure and, critically, engage with key stakeholders with regard to electricity network development requirements to facilitate EV infrastructure. <\/p><p> In parallel to the foregoing, amendment No. 61 inserts a new section 45, which in turn amends section 19(1) of the Road Traffic Act 1993 concerning the specific functions of the NRA by inserting a new section 19(1)(cc) to confer a new function on the NRA or, more specifically, TII.  This section will enable TII to prepare schemes for the provision of recharging and refuelling infrastructure for zero to low-emission vehicles in relation to national roads or proposed such roads.  TII will be empowered to provide and maintain this network.  The Minister for Transport may prescribe, by regulation, the vehicles in respect of which one or more refuelling or recharging networks will be delivered by TII.  The purpose of this amendment is to enable TII to deliver EV charging infrastructure on the national roads network in the context of its role as a roads authority<\/p><p> Government amendment No. 77 provides for the consequent amendment of the Long Title to the Bill arising from the proposed inclusion in the Bill of matters relating to new functions for the Minister for Transport in respect of zero- to low-emission vehicles and related infrastructure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022062200002#P01900","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":365,"content":"<p>ZEVI sounds like a brand of clothes.

It is a positive amendment.  I do not need to list the benefits of electric vehicles, especially with regard to emissions.  This refers to carbon emissions but we also have to consider air pollution and noise pollution.  I wonder if there is an opportunity to address within the Bill the issue of internal combustion engines idling.  It is particularly problematic where vehicles are congregating around schools.  Is there an opportunity in the Bill to address the issue of leaving engines idling for periods of time at specific locations?<\/p> <p>  I have another comment.  In encouraging the uptake of electric vehicles, which rolling out the network will do, we have to ensure that we are not encouraging extra-large electric vehicles onto our roads.  These take up an unnecessary amount of space and the extra weight they carry makes them less efficient.  There seems to be a general move among car purchasers in Ireland to go for those larger vehicles.  This is probably more of a policy issue than something to cover within legislation but there are probably legislative changes that could be made to disincentivise the purchase of unnecessarily large EVs and to encourage the purchase of much more suitable EVs for personal use.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022062200002#Q01700","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":381,"content":"<p>I support Deputy Matthews's comments.  I welcome the amendment.  There might be an opportunity to go a bit further.  Electric bikes and cargo bikes are electric vehicles as well.  We could get into that space.  Deputy Matthews talked about smaller and lighter vehicles.  The main driving force - pardon the pun - with respect to vehicular transport should be the smaller, the lighter and the slower.  There are all kinds of very good reasons to go in that direction and I believe we can go a little bit further here.  If the Minister is agreeable, we might come back with some proposals on Report Stage.<\/p> <p>  In this section, section 45, there is an interesting part on An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  It states that it \"shall approve a scheme, or a proposed road development, that contravenes materially any development plan or any local area plan [...] only if it considers that one of the following is the case:\" before listing four scenarios, any one of which can apply.  The first is that \"the scheme or proposed road development is of strategic, regional or national importance\".  The second is that \"there are conflicting objectives in the development plan or the objectives are not clearly stated, insofar as the scheme or proposed road development is concerned\".  The third relates to the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008, the regional, spatial and economic strategy for the area and any statutory obligations therein.  The fourth is that \"the scheme or proposed road development should be approved having regard to the pattern of development, and planning permissions granted, in the area since the making of the development plan.\"  It seems that there is very wide scope for this to be misinterpreted or applied in a way that is not intended, especially when one considers the stories around An Bord Plean&aacute;la in recent weeks.  With the way An Bord Plean&aacute;la is set up, a great deal of power is vested in very few people.  It seems that this section might cause some difficulty for Ministers down the line.  It should be tightened up so that its intent, which I believe relates to BusConnects, is clear before the legislation is passed by the Houses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022062200002#Q01800","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":382,"content":"<p>I support Deputy Leddin's point.

I will start with the last one.<\/p><p>As I read it, amendment No. 61 amends that section with regard to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  In section 45(19)(1)(cc), we are saying that we would also \"prepare, or arrange for the preparation of, schemes for the provision of a safe and efficient network of recharging infrastructure and refuelling infrastructure for such zero to low emission vehicles as the Minister may prescribe and provide and maintain, or secure the provision and maintenance of, such a network\".  That amends the same section the Deputy is concerned about, if I am correct on this.<\/p><p> I will go back to the wider point about the BusConnects infrastructure we need to deliver.  People will be aware that the Government will have real difficulty in meeting our climate change targets, particularly in transport, which is probably the most challenging area.  One of the mechanisms the Government is developing is the acceleration of certain key areas, one of which is sustainable mobility.  That will require some of the infrastructure we are looking for to be delivered in a very quick timeframe, especially in towns and cities throughout the country.  For that to work, An Bord Plean&aacute;la will have to have a critical role because if the ordinary timeframes it takes for us to deliver infrastructure apply, for example, the cycleway to Clontarf being built at present has been in the planning system or process for almost ten years, we will have to accelerate those timeframes.<\/p><p> That has been recognised by the Government through a variety of different factors.  We have increased the staffing within the likes of the NTA and our Department to be able to do that work.  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, has also recognised that An Bord Plean&aacute;la needs enhanced staffing and other resources, especially in the public planning realm and ecology, including the transport planning and marine planning side, to be able to deliver quick decisions, particularly on projects that will be central to meeting our climate targets.  We have set up a special acceleration team to look at this.  We are looking for projects within local authorities throughout the country that might be what could be called pathfinder projects, which can be delivered very quickly at low cost.  Obviously, these have to be within our planning system and planning structures but it will require An Bord Plean&aacute;la to play its part in making sure such decisions are given very quick attention and that it has the resources in place to be able to turn around decisions.  This cannot come from the top down and it cannot ignore local and public interests.  It has to come from the local authorities.  It has to be from the councillors themselves looking at what the examples might be in their towns, cities or villages.<\/p><p> That transformative approach to accelerate development will characterise where we are at present.  The historical approach, which was very much based on roads and a sprawled, ever-outwards development model, will not work in a low-carbon environment.  The overriding legislation behind all this is our climate law, as well as European law, which requires us to meet these targets.  If we fail to do so in transport, we will have to introduce policy measures to go quicker and faster.  The historical concern the Deputy has would be the case if the situation continues, but it will not be the defining characteristic.<\/p><p> I will briefly address the issue of idling vehicles raised by Deputy Matthews.  Many of those measures, and some of the regulations, are sometimes best done at European level where, for example, new cars could have mechanisms whereby they are switched off.  Certain cars already do that.  However, the wider reality is, and I expect it will come up at the European Council meeting next week, Europe is moving towards a stage where there will be no new combustion engine vehicles by 2035.  There has to be recognition that we are going towards better electric vehicles.  It would be terrible for us if we just replaced a fossil fuel vehicle fleet with a heavy vehicle fleet that used up a lot of other resources, be those rare earths, lithium or other batteries.  What the Deputy said about the need to make sure we are very efficient in our transport system is true.  It is not just about replacing all of one type of car with another type of car.  As the Deputy said, the characteristics of our current fleet, where almost half the private cars last year were heavy vehicles by any definition, will not work.<\/p><p> This Bill cannot solve all those problems.  This specific amendment No. 61 relates to the EV charging infrastructure I mentioned, as well as the creation of an EV office.  Those wider concerns are best addressed elsewhere.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022062200002#Q02000","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":385,"content":"<p>Does this EV office include zero emission vehicles such as bikes, e-bikes and e-cargo bikes?

I think the debate has been very useful and very good.  This amendment is more on the technical nature.  Amendment No. 76 is designed to address an irregularity in the enabling provisions for certain road traffic regulations with regard to the construction and use of vehicles, that is, the maximum weights and dimensions permitted for vehicles driven on our roads.  Based on advice from the Attorney General's office and my Department&rsquo;s legal advisers, I am proposing to insert new text to state that the construction and use of vehicles regulations made between 2003 and 2007, and those made in 2015 and 2018, do not have statutory effect and were validly made under the Road Traffic Acts, including section 2 of the Road Traffic Act 2006.  This change confers the appropriate <i>vires <\/i>to give effect to European legislation and allows us to make further amendments to those regulations from time to time as needed.<\/p><p>As I said, it is a purely technical amendment and so does not itself imply any change to broader policy in the area.  Our next steps, once this has come into effect, will be to transpose European regulations to allow an increase in permitted weights for zero-emission vehicles as part of our ongoing efforts to support the switch away from fossil fuels.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 78 follows this with a consequential change to the Long Title of the Bill.  A gap has been seen in the implementation of EU directives and this is an opportunity to clean it up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022062200002#S04300","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1655852400,"counter":437,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1655852400,"counter":438,"content":"<p>TITLE<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":439,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 77:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 7, line 5, after &ldquo;Act&rdquo; to insert the following:  \t&ldquo;to confer functions on the Minister for Transport in relation to zero to low emission vehicles and recharging and refuelling infrastructure relating to such vehicles;&rdquo;.  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022062200002#S04600","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1655852400,"counter":440,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":441,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 78:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 7, line 7, after &ldquo;2008;&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;to provide for the effect and validity of certain regulations;&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022062200002#S04800","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1655852400,"counter":442,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1655852400,"counter":443,"content":"<p>Title, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":444,"content":"<p>Pursuant to Standing Order 187(3), the clerk will report specifically to the D&aacute;il that the committee has amended the Title.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022062200002#S05200","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1655852400,"counter":445,"content":"<p>Bill reported with amendments.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":446,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and his officials for their engagement with the committee today, for their hard work and for the briefing they provided earlier in the week.
