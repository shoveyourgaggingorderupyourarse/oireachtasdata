As numbers are quite high at the moment, we strongly advise members and others in attendance to practise good hand hygiene and to leave some distance between themselves and others attending.  They should always maintain an appropriate level of social distance during and after the meeting.<\/p> <p>  Before we begin, I will explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence by witnesses who are physically present or by those who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory with regard to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirements that members must be physically present within the confines of the place in which Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.<\/p> <p>  Today, we will engage with the Department of Finance, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to consider tax expenditures.  After some debate and consideration, the committee has agreed to examine three specific tax expenditures almost as a kind of model for how we might look at them in general.  Those expenditures are related to research and development, the knowledge development box and the film credit.  The committee has written to a number of stakeholders inviting written submissions regarding the review of these tax expenditures and, next week, will hear evidence from some of these groups.  Today, the committee will hear from evidence from the main officials and bodies with the remit of these three tax expenditures.<\/p> <p>  On behalf of the committee, I welcome Ms Deirdre Donaghy, head of business tax; Ms Aisling Greene, assistant principal officer, R&amp;D tax credit and KDB tax credit; Ms Ian Kavanagh, assistant principal officer, film tax credit; Mr. Matthew McGann, principal officer; and Mr. Paul Cotter, principal officer, Department of Finance; Mr. Alan Carey, principal officer; and Ms Jacqueline O&rsquo;Callaghan, principal officer, Office of the Revenue Commissioners; and Mr. Dermot Coates, principal officer; and Mr. Felix O&rsquo;Kane, assistant principal officer, Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  I thank each of the witnesses for attending today and for providing information regarding the three tax expenditures in advance to the committee.<\/p> <p>  I call Ms Donaghy to make her opening statement.<\/p><p>On behalf of the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners, I thank the committee for their invitation to come here today to discuss expenditure reviews of the research and development tax credit, the knowledge development box and the section 481 film tax credit.  The Chair has gone through the names but I will mention that Mr. Matthew McGann and Mr. Paul Cotter are from our economics division and they have oversight of the tax expenditure guidelines and also provide the economic analysis elements of tax expenditure reviews.<br\/><br\/>My colleagues from Revenue will be speaking on the detail of the three tax credits in their statement, so I am going to focus on the expenditure review process.  Subsequently, colleagues from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment will provide an opening statement.<br\/><br\/>Tax expenditures represent a reduction in tax revenues which would otherwise accrue to the State, so it is appropriate that they should come under scrutiny to ensure they are fit for purpose.  This scrutiny takes a number of forms, ranging from annual consideration as part of the budget process, to consideration in tax strategy group papers, to full econometric reviews.  The work of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight has also contributed to the process of tax expenditure reviews, and I recall engaging with a number of the current members in this committee's formation under the 32nd D&aacute;il in January 2019.<br\/><br\/>In 2014, the Department developed and published tax expenditure guidelines to set out a best practice approach to the review of tax expenditures.  The guidelines indicate that tax expenditures should be used in limited circumstances of demonstrable market failure and where a tax-based incentive is more efficient than a direct expenditure intervention, and that expenditures should be reviewed regularly.  A proportionate approach to the scope and frequency of <i>ex post<\/i>evaluations is recommended to be guided by the expenditure cost.  For example, it is recommended that a level 1 expenditure, which would be one with an annual cost between &euro;1 million and &euro;10 million, should have a criteria-based review every five years.  Level 2 expenditures with a cost between &euro;10 million and &euro;50 million, which would include the knowledge development box, should be reviewed every five years with an interim review after three years if annual costs exceed &euro;25 million.  Level 3 expenditures costing more than &euro;50 million per annum, which would include the research and development and film tax credits, should be reviewed every three years.  The briefing paper provided to committee members provides an overview of the expenditure review process and the questions to be considered in <i>ex ante<\/i>and <i>ex post<\/i>reviews, and also contains a link to the full tax expenditure guidelines document if further detail is required.<br\/><br\/>Stakeholder engagement is a key element of the review process for all formats of review.  As the body with responsibility for the administration of the tax system, and therefore also having the most comprehensive taxpayer data, the Revenue Commissioners are essential contributors to the review process.  The data, where available and suitably anonymised, can be used to analyse existing expenditures or to model potential new measures.  However, of equal importance are Revenue&rsquo;s operational insights into the tax system, which can inform the design of new measures to ensure they are operable in practice.  In the case of existing reliefs, Revenue may also identify and bring to our attention issues of concern, or unintended consequences arising from legislation, which may require further review.<br\/><br\/>We also engage regularly with other relevant Departments - for example, with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science in respect of the research and development tax credit and the knowledge development box, and with the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media in respect of the film tax credit.  Tax expenditure reviews often also incorporate a public consultation in order to seek views of taxpayers, representative bodies and other interested persons.  Department officials may meet with respondents to discuss their submissions, particularly where detailed technical matters are the subject of consultation.<br\/><br\/>More broadly, the Department is also committed to the regular publication of information on tax expenditures, for the purposes of transparency and to inform contributors who wish to engage with the policymaking process.  For example, each year the Department prepares and publishes a series of papers for the tax strategy group, a group chaired by the Department of Finance with membership comprising senior officials and political advisers from a number of Civil Service Departments and offices.  The papers contain analysis of a range of issues, often including reviews requested by Members of the Oireachtas during finance Bill debates.  A significant volume of analysis is also published each year on budget day, containing analysis of the budget and expenditure measures and economic forecasts.  This includes an annual tax expenditures report, containing an analysis of tax expenditure data, the outcomes of reviews completed since the previous report, and tables of tax expenditure costs across all tax heads.<br\/><br\/>I hope this overview and the briefing paper provided to committee members is of assistance in framing discussion at this meeting.  I am happy to engage with any questions from members, following the remaining opening statements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022062200002#A00200","speaker":"1559","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":7,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Donaghy.

I am joined by my colleague, Ms Jacqueline O&rsquo;Callaghan, who is also a principal officer in the business, taxes, policy and legislation division of the Revenue Commissioners.  I understand from the invitation letter that the committee wishes to discuss matters relating to the following tax expenditures: research and development tax credits, knowledge development box, KDB, and film relief.  I am sure the committee will appreciate Revenue&rsquo;s role in relation to the review and evaluation of tax policy measures.  As the tax administration in the State, Revenue collects taxes and duties.  Through this, Revenue has access to, and is able to provide, statistical information and analysis of tax returns and receipts as well as insights from our compliance activities.  To assist the development and evaluation of tax policy, Revenue publishes information in relation to tax statistics, tax receipts and costings on a dedicated section of the Revenue website.  While it is Revenue&rsquo;s role to provide facts and advice to inform the policymaking process, it would not be appropriate for us to make any comment on policy matters.<\/p> <p>  I will give a brief overview of the three tax reliefs under consideration by the committee, including some high-level statistics in relation to them.  We will be happy to address any questions the committee might have in relation to these topics.  While we will provide whatever assistance we can, the committee will appreciate that Revenue is constrained by law, and specifically by section 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, from discussing the tax affairs of any taxpayer on confidentiality grounds.  This includes providing any information that might lead to the identification of any taxpayer.  <\/p> <p>  The research and development tax credit allows a company to claim a 25% tax credit in respect of expenditure incurred on qualifying research and development activities.  The credit is available in respect of expenses incurred in the carrying on of research and development, as well as on amounts spent on plant and machinery used and on buildings used to house research and development.  The research and development credit is available for offset against a company&rsquo;s corporation tax liability in both the current and preceding accounting periods.  Where there is an excess research and development credit remaining, a company may claim the excess as a payable credit, with 33% of the payable credit available in the first year, and the balance payable over the next two years.  There is a limit on the amount of the payable credit a company can claim, with the limit being determined by reference to the amount of corporation tax paid by the company in the previous ten years or by the amount of payroll taxes paid by the company.  <\/p> <p>  The latest year for which claims and cost figures for the research and development tax credit are available is 2020, when the total cost of the credit was &euro;658 million in respect of 1,616 claims.  In that year, small and medium-sized enterprises accounted for approximately 88%, or 1,420, of the total research and development tax credit claims.  Larger companies dealt with by Revenue&rsquo;s large corporates division, LCD, accounted for 73% of the total value of research and development claims made in 2020.  Companies which claimed these tax credits in 2020 paid &euro;5.6 billion of net corporation tax receipts in that year - that is, net of the research and development credit.  <\/p> <p>  Table 1 sets out the total cost of the research and development credit for each of the years from 2004 to 2020 and the total number of claimant companies in each year.  Table 2 provides a breakdown of the cost and number of research and development tax credit claims between large companies dealt with by LCD and small and medium enterprises which are not dealt with by LCD.  Table 3 provides an overview of the total value of expenditure, in respect of which the research and development credit is claimed, for each of the years from 2012 to 2020, broken down between small and medium enterprises and large enterprises.  In 2020, of the &euro;3.1 billion total value of expenditure on research and development, &euro;2.6 billion was by foreign-owned multinational companies.  Research and development credit expenditure by Irish-owned multinationals was &euro;215 million and non-multinationals accounted for the remaining &euro;293 million. <\/p> <p>  The knowledge development box, KDB, was introduced in Finance Act 2015 and applies for accounting periods commencing between 1 January 2016 and 31 December 2022.<\/p><p>The KDB provides for relief from corporation tax on income arising from qualifying assets such as computer programmes and inventions protected by a qualifying patent or, in respect of smaller companies, other intellectual property that is similar to an invention which could be patented.  A company qualifying for the KDB may claim a deduction equal to 50% of its qualifying profits.  This means that the company&rsquo;s qualifying profits may be taxed at an effective rate of 6.25%.  A company has 24 months to submit a claim for the KDB.  Table 4 provides a breakdown of the overall cost of the KDB for each of the years 2016 to 2020.  Statistics for 2020 are provisional due to the 24-month timeline for making a claim.<\/p><p> Regarding the film tax credit, a tax relief relating to the film industry was first introduced by section 35 of the Finance Act 1987.  Prior to 2015 the scheme operated by giving tax relief to individuals investing in the film industry.  Since 2015 the scheme provides direct support to film producer companies in the form of a corporation tax credit.  Producer companies that meet certain requirements may claim a credit at a rate of 32% in respect of the production costs of a qualifying film.  The credit is available on the lower of: eligible expenditure, 80% of total qualifying film production costs or &euro;70 million.  The maximum value of relief that may be claimed is &euro;22.4 million.  A total of 186 producer companies have received &euro;600 million in respect of film tax credits relating to the making of 592 films.  Table 5 provides a breakdown of the value of claims and the number of projects for each of the years 2015 to 2021.<\/p><p> When the corporation tax credit scheme was first introduced, the Revenue Commissioners administered both the certification and the payment of the credit.  Following amendments in Finance Act 2018, the producer company must apply to the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media for a cultural certificate in advance of commencing the film.  A cultural certificate is a confirmation that the film is a qualifying film for the purposes of the film tax credit.  The credit was moved onto a self-assessment footing from March 2019 to bring applications under section 481 within the normal penalty and prosecution regime where an incorrect claim is made.  Producer companies are required to calculate the value of credit due and make their claims through their corporation tax returns.<\/p><p> In summary, the role of the Revenue Commissioners in the review of tax expenditures is primarily to support the process through the provision of statistical information and insights gathered as part of our administration of taxes.<\/p><p> We will answer any questions from members of the committee on these issues, subject to the constraints I noted in my opening comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022062200002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alan Carey","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655852400,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to participate in this meeting of the committee.  I am chief economist in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and I am accompanied by my colleague, Mr. Felix O&rsquo;Kane, professional accountant in our economic and tax policy unit.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the matters under consideration today, it is important to note that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is not involved in determining which tax expenditures will be selected for review in a given year.  My understanding is that the Department of Finance generally follows guidelines as laid out in the guidelines for tax expenditure evaluation which were published in 2014.  While the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has an interest in the tax expenditures on which we are concentrating today, in addition to a number of other similar tax incentives, it does not have a role in deciding which expenditures should be reviewed or when those reviews should take place.<\/p> <p>  Officials from the tax policy unit in our Department tend to engage regularly with officials from the various taxation areas within the Department of Finance.  Each year our Department prepares a pre-budget submission which proposes options for adjustments to aspects of the tax system, including tax expenditures, often in the form of proposals for amendments to existing legislation aimed at enhancing the taxation landscape for enterprises.  This document is the Department&rsquo;s primary means of communicating enterprise tax proposals to the Department and Minister for Finance.  In the event that a tax expenditure review has been decided on by the Minister for Finance, officials may discuss aspects of the review, for example, timelines would frequently come up for discussion, but these discussions tend not to guide the focus of the review.<\/p> <p>  With regard to tax expenditures more generally, it is useful to point out that many such expenditures can also be considered as tax incentives.  There is little doubt that from an enterprise perspective, tax incentives can bring about many positives.  Indeed, the OECD states that the tax regime is a key policy instrument that may negatively or positively influence investment and the achievement of wider policy goals.  While our Department is supportive of ongoing and timely reviews of tax incentives, it is important that the members of the committee appreciate that measurement of the revenue forgone relating to a specific incentive is unlikely to provide a complete picture of the impacts of that incentive.  Benefits resulting from the changes in behaviour which incentives drive are extremely challenging to assess and cost-benefit analyses should be used where possible, but even these will have limitations.  It is often the case, therefore, that evidence must be generated from a wider variety of sources than would ideally be the case.<\/p> <p>  Looking at the research and development tax credit, for example, establishing the counterfactual position around innovation investment in the absence of the incentive would be very challenging, so we must seek other evidence.  In the case of this tax credit, it is instructive to see that similar innovation incentives are offered by 25 of our fellow EU member states.  Recent contributions to the ongoing review of the research and development tax credit also reinforced the importance of the credit in incentivising activity in Ireland.  For example, a KPMG survey found that 74% of respondents would markedly decrease activity in Ireland in the absence of the incentive.  Similarly, the American Chamber of Commerce reported member feedback indicating that in the absence of the credit, there would be a significant reduction in the proportion of research and development activities taking place in Ireland.  These contributions back up findings from the 2016 review of the credit by the Department of Finance which found that 60% of research and development activity conducted by firms since 2009 was additional research and development activity which would not have occurred in the absence of the tax credit.<\/p> <p>  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment believes that to best support enterprise to achieve its potential, a mix of direct expenditures and tax incentives will work best.  There are instances where each method of support is more appropriate.  Some of the advantages of tax-based supports are that they tend to require a lower degree of administration, they are more generally accessible and they are more flexible than direct supports in that they allow the taxpayer to largely determine the nature of the expenditure within defined legislative parameters.  These benefits lend themselves to innovative activities, in particular where the prescriptive nature of direct subsidies can inhibit progress in fast-moving sectors of the economy.<\/p> <p>  In conclusion, while the Department has no role in the selection of tax expenditures for review, it does feed into the review process on an ongoing basis via our interactions with Department of Finance officials and our engagement in the budgetary process.  The Department is supportive of regular review of these expenditures and acknowledges the presence of the expenditure review guidelines and adherence to them as being an important advance which provides protection for the Exchequer and ultimately the taxpayer.  Regular reviews present opportunities to examine the effectiveness of incentives and make changes if they are not achieving their desired policy objective.<\/p> <p>  We look forward to participating in the discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022062200002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Dermot Coates"},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for appearing before an coiste and for the three presentations.  I will start with the research and development tax credit, the larger of the three being discussed.  All members of the committee recognise the importance of developing innovation, high productivity and a high-wage economy, and the importance of research and development in that regard and in fostering research and innovation, particularly in indigenous companies.<\/p> <p>  It is clear from all the statistics we heard in the presentations and the statistics we have that there is an imbalance in the beneficiaries of the research and development tax credit, with the vast majority of expenditure under research and development going to foreign direct investment.  The figures for 2020 show that 84% of the &euro;3.1 billion in expenditure in respect of which the tax credit was claimed was by foreign-owned multinationals.  Committee members will know that since 2018 and over the following years I have been calling for an increased rate of 30% to be made available to small and micro companies under the research and development tax credit.  In fairness, the Minister took up this proposal in the Finance Act 2019, but it has not been implemented due to the communications his Department has received from the European Commission with regard to state aid.<\/p> <p>  Can the witnesses clarify the specific issues which resulted in this measure, the increase of the research and development tax credit rate from 25% to 30% for small and micro companies, not being progressed and being dropped?

We did a review in that year specifically looking at aspects of small companies and how we could try to incentivise that.  A number of measures were introduced.  It was intended they would operate by having the existing research and development tax credit which is available to everybody and gives a rate of 25%.  Micro- or small-enterprises would be able to top that up by an extra 5% in order to get an overall rate of 30%.  As that element would be targeted it would have to get state aid approval because it would be a targeted aid.  When we began discussions with the Commission on that we looked at the various ways in which it could be introduced under the various approvals processes that exist.  Essentially in order to approve it we would have to make slight changes to the definitions, for example, the definition of what qualifies as research and development or to the reporting procedures that would apply and to how it is declared and reported as an aid.  The difficulty created there was that, for example, if you were doing &euro;100 worth of research and development in order to get a credit of &euro;25, you would have one sets of rules applying to it, and to get the next &euro;5 credit there would be slightly different rules.  That would mean that some of the &euro;100 might not qualify and then again something else that did not qualify for the main &euro;25 credit could potentially have qualified for the &euro;5.  They did not match up.  We were talking about small and micro companies and some of the biggest issues they consistently raise with claiming the credit in the first place is that there is an administrative burden to it and they have a difficulty in understanding and following the criteria and having the right documentation to prove it and meet the science tests.  If we then brought in a system where one set of rules applies to the first 25% of the credit and slightly different rules for the next 5% that would have been overly complicated and we did not think it would be practical to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022062200002#D00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Deirdre Donaghy"},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":13,"content":"<p>The principle of having an enhanced tax credit for small and micro businesses was not an issue for the Commission.

To be honest, the main difficulty and why it has not progressed is that Covid-19 intervened.  There was then a significant diversion of resources by both ourselves and Revenue to Covid-19 measures.  We are hopefully coming out of that now and can come back to this.  We are doing the review again this year and while there are other policy objectives we have to address this year as well, we are coming back to the idea of looking at what can we possibly do.  We have one potential difficulty in the avenue suggested by the Deputy which was to separate it out.  We then need to look at what happens with the main tax credit.  If you separate it out and just have it for the uplift it becomes a 5% credit.  That is probably too much of an administrative burden for just 5%.

Many SMEs do not have access to the large accountancy firms.  It is acknowledged that the process in Britain and in the North is much simpler and less risky for SMEs.  The Department commissioned the OECD in 2019 to do a report on SMEs and entrepreneurship policy in Ireland.  Part of that stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe cost of preparing, filing and defending a claim is too high.  The criteria for making claims, recording and justifying claims and so on as laid down by Revenue are onerous for SMEs &ndash; the rules appear to have been designed with large established R&amp;amp;D intensive (e.g. pharmaceutical) companies in mind, where development processes are very detailed and structured.  In contrast, the rules are not a good fit with, for example, new, agile software development companies, where processes are fluid and fast and documentation is less necessary. <\/blockquote> <p>Helpfully, it went on to make three proposals, namely, to simplify the approval procedure for research and development tax credits to facilitate the participation of SMEs in this initiative; to introduce a pre-approval procedure of research and development tax credits to help reduce uncertainty for SMEs - in Norway, for example, there is list of things that are likely to get approval; and to maintain the research and development tax credits while trying to increase their update by smaller enterprise by design change and awareness raising.  <\/p><p>That was commissioned in 2019 from the OECD.

When it comes to trying to raise awareness or to assist, in particular smaller firms to claim credits, both ourselves and the Revenue Commissioners work on that to try to engage.  There are industry representative bodies which represent all research and development active firms.  It is not just the big four but specifically research and development bodies.  They will have annual conferences at which ourselves and Revenue give presentations and give the context in order to try to build the awareness of it and where to find further information about it.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the administration of it, my colleague, Ms O'Callaghan, from Revenue might have more information on it.

Again, there is a cost to this but it is a cashflow cost because these are being paid out anyway.

Again, in that year, they have to first offset against corporation tax and then claim a bit.  All of the time, it is trying to link it to make sure it is something that has substance in the State.

The surprising figure is that only 17 companies are availing of this.  Can Ms Donaghy give us any indication in regard to FDI versus SME or indigenous companies?  There is a crucial question I would ask in regard to the knowledge development box.  What is Ms Donaghy's understanding of how the knowledge development box and the R&amp;D tax credit could be affected by the US tax changes, particularly the global intangible low-taxed income, GILTI, credit and also the pillar 1 OECD agreement?  Where do those lie?  Some of those carve-outs have not been agreed at the minute.  Can Ms Donaghy give us any insight into the importance of that in terms of the final agreement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022062200002#E00900","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655852400,"counter":39,"content":"<p>In terms of the claimants, we have very limited information because my colleagues in Revenue will tell me they cannot give it to me either.  When the numbers come down so low, they are prevented from going into details that would identify.  The numbers are low but not unexpectedly low on the knowledge development box because it is quite a restricted relief.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the future changes, R&amp;D and the knowledge development box are both potentially being affected, particularly by pillar 2, which is the minimum effective tax rate.  The changes to GILTI are obviously tied in with that as well.  Under pillar 2, a country has to calculate a minimum effective rate of 15% based on the global anti-base erosion, or GloBE, base.  The question is that if someone has a tax credit, is that something that reduces their effective rate or is it not?  All of the countries involved recognise the value of R&amp;D and recognise it is something they want to be supported.  Provided it meets the definition of what they called a qualifying refundable tax credit, it is not treated as reducing someone&rsquo;s effective tax rate.  The idea is that if someone has something that is not a qualified credit, the credit is treated as basically reducing the tax they have paid, which reduces their effective rate, which makes it more likely they have to pay a top-up, whereas if they have a qualifying tax credit, it is treated instead as income.  It effectively comes in almost above the line, in a way.  Instead of saying that someone has &euro;100 in income and they paid &euro;12 in tax and got &euro;5 in tax credit, it means they only paid &euro;7 in tax.  That would be the non-qualifying version.  The qualifying version would be that they had their &euro;100 in income, they paid their &euro;12 in tax and, with the &euro;5 offset of the tax credit, the way it is treated is that they still paid &euro;12 in tax but they had &euro;105 in income.  Therefore, it increases their income and, effectively, they will have to pay the 15% on that, but it preserves the majority of the value of it.<\/p> <p>  There is a definition in those rules of what a qualifying refundable tax credit is.  Our R&amp;D tax credit is very close to that.  It is possible there may need to be some small changes to it but that is something we are looking at this year in the context of the review.<\/p> <p>  For the knowledge development box, it is a different element of pillar 2 that might affect that.  Outside of the GloBE rules, there is a separate element called the subject to tax rule.  This is where a jurisdiction has any element of its tax system that provides an effective tax rate of less than 9%.  Because the knowledge development box effectively allows a tax rate of 6.25%, because what it does is halve the income and it then taxes that-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022062200002#E01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Deirdre Donaghy"},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":40,"content":"<p>It halves it, yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022062200002#F00100","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655852400,"counter":41,"content":"<p>Yes, and then it taxes you, so effectively it gives you 6.25%.

There are two separate parts of who is engaging.  If you have the smaller companies there is certainly more of a financial pressure on them to try to do research and development because with research and development, in order to meet the definitions that are there, you have to be trying to resolve an uncertainty, so there is no guarantee anything beneficial for your business will come out of it.  It is a much higher risk than investing your business's money in something you know for sure will deliver a return, albeit possibly a smaller return than if your research and development works out for you.<\/p> <p>  When it comes to the larger companies, what the Deputy needs to consider is whether there be a market failure in Ireland without the credit.  What we consistently hear from all the companies that engage with us is some of the biggest competition they face in trying to locate research and development projects here is from other arms of the same firm in other jurisdictions because there will always be a lot of competition to get the research and development located in any jurisdiction.  The reason people want it to be there is it brings a lot more with it.  If you locate your research and development here it is more likely you will have manufacturing processes associated with it, for example, or that you will build other functions around it because whatever the outcome of it is, you need to manage it, develop it and protect in the long run.

I do not think we are.  Ms Donaghy can put that case and I am sure people will put that case but then I think of the fact that educational counselling and psychology are not funded for people to do doctorates, yet we have a chronic shortage of psychologists to do assessments for children.

We are not getting that level of scrutiny, oversight and hearing from the different stakeholders so we can make a proper evaluation.  We should find ways to have that discussion with all those stakeholders in a more structured way.<\/p><p>We have discussed the film tax credit many times.  According to the EU, state aid to film must meet two tests, namely, the industry development test and the culture test.  The industry development test is worth reading out.  It states there will be:<\/p> <blockquote> \t... [an] aim to generate the critical mass of activity that is required to create the dynamic for the development and consolidation of the industry through the creation of soundly based production undertakings and the development of a permanent pool of human skills and experience. <\/blockquote> <p>Then there is &quot;... the primary cultural aim of ensuring that the national and regional cultures and creative potential are expressed in the audiovisual media of film and television&quot;.  How are we evaluating that?  I believe we are not doing so at all, to be honest.  Margrethe Vestager, as the Commissioner with responsibility for state aid, wrote to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, in 2019 to express concerns about whether we were meeting the cultural test.  There are very serious question marks.  It is interesting that on foot of that that this year an Irish film won a load of awards at the Irish Film and Television Awards.  I do not think that was a coincidence.<\/p><p>I am sure it was deserved, but it was very interesting because it was the first time it had happened for yonks .  In my view, that was because it was being called out on it.<\/p><p> How are we evaluating this?  I would be interested to know if anyone has ever been refused section 481 support on the grounds of not meeting the culture test.  Has anybody ever been refused on the grounds of not meeting the industry development test?  One of the biggest recipients of section 481 support is producing &ldquo;Vikings: Valhalla&rdquo;, which is being shot in Wicklow at the moment.  It was reported in the newspapers recently that: \"A note attached to the accounts states that the majority of workers employed are contract workers.\"  This raises serious questions about the industry development test.  If the majority of people working on a production for one of the biggest - if not the biggest - recipients of section 481 tax relief year in, year out, are contractors rather than individuals who have an employment relationship with the recipient, that is a big problem.  In the context of any reasonable understanding of the EU rules around this test, that clearly does not meet the industry development test.  It is not creating a permanent pool of skills, and it involves using a load of contractors who have no employment relationship whatsoever with the recipient of the relief.  That relief is given specifically on the grounds of creating quality employment and training, and creating a permanent pool of skills.  How are we checking this?  It appears to me that we are not.  We are listening to the producers who get the relief and they are saying that it is brilliant.  Of course they are saying it is brilliant because they are getting the relief and benefiting from it.<\/p><p> Previously, this criticism was coming from people who were employed on construction crews, stage crews, etc.  I do not know if our witnesses have had a chance to read the Equity submission.  Equity raises some very interesting questions and expresses concerns about section 481.  Equity, the film workers who have expressed deep concerns and I all want to see money going in to create an industry.  However, Equity has asked some serious questions.  It states that the risks regarding the way in which it is done at the moment relate to: excluding new and emerging independent producers and having a large amount of industry power concentrated within a small group of players; the potential abuse of the tax credit through a range of practices, including internal pricing and artificially depressed income strategies; and the flaunting of national and international copyright legislation. This latter concern relates to the question of residuals and royalties.  Nearly all of the major recipients of section 481 relief in this country tell people who want to work in film productions that in order to get jobs, they have to sign up to buy-out contracts where they sign away all of their royalties and residuals.  Their counterparts in Britain are not asked to do that.  This is absolutely outrageous.  Residuals are one of the major ways whereby artists and performers who are in very precarious situations might get a little bit of money back over the years from a film that continues to be shown again and again.  The recipients of section 481 in this country are insisting that most performers and artists must sign away their rights to the particular production in question.<\/p><p> This also raises a very interesting question as to whom those rights are being assigned?  Who then gets the royalties over the years?  Is it the DAC that disappears after 12 months following the end of the production?  This is the mushroom-like nature of the DAC.  Where employees have grievances and go to the WRC and raise issues relating to their employment on a production or in respect of instances where they may have been wrongfully dismissed or badly treated, the film production company, which receives the money on the basis of developing the industry, quality employment and training, goes before the WRC and the Labour Court again and again and states that not only is the relevant person not its employee but also that the structure of section 481 means he or she could never be an employee of the company.  The employer is the DAC and the DAC is gone.  As a result, nobody is accountable for how a person is treated on a particular film production.  I do not even know the answer to the question as to what happens to the royalties and residuals because they are not going to the performers.  Where are they going?  I presume they are going to the production company, which has always existed and which is the recipient of section 481 relief.  This is the company that has managed to disown responsibility for everybody who has worked on the film production and got all of them to sign away their rights to further royalties.  When are we going to start looking seriously at these things?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022062200002#F01200","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":53,"content":"<p>Do I have any takers as to who would like to-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022062200002#G00200","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655852400,"counter":54,"content":"<p>I have a list that I could start with.  I may have probably missed some of the questions along the way.  In that context, I ask the Deputy to feel free to ask me again if I do not answer any of the questions.<\/p> <p>  I could not say if anyone has been refused a culture certificate because that is dealt with the by the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.  The application goes to the Department, which then carries out the assessment.  I know that officials from the Department have appeared before various committees to discuss this matter previously.  The Department will be able to give the committee any data specifically around that.<\/p> <p>  When it comes to the issue of quality employment, it is one which we have discussed with the committee on many occasions over the years and we have been paying attention to the issues.  We do not just listen to Screen Producers Ireland.  In fact, it complains that we do not listen to its members enough.  We have met with employee representative groups also and deal a great deal with Screen Ireland, which is the official body.  There have been many changes over the past three or four years in order to try to ensure that we are substantiating that in the screen development aspect of it.<\/p> <p>  I know that the committee has received a submission from Screen Ireland that gives some of the detail around that but, essentially, back in 2019, the skills development aspect of it was much less well developed.  It went around a system that for every X amount of credit you claimed, you had to have Y amount of interns or trainees.  Queries were raised - and they were fair ones - as to how we ensure that someone will not be an intern or a trainee forever, that there is proper development and that people can make actually make progress through the industry.  From 2019 onward, Screen Ireland has been progressively developing an entirely new process for that and is now focusing on skills development.  It is not just interns or trainees; Screen Ireland is looking at skills development at every level.  It is not just about getting a trainee in; it is also about getting a mid-level unit manager and training him or her up to be a head of unit.  This is happening at all levels to show that the company involved is actually developing somebody&rsquo;s career as it goes along.<\/p> <p>  When we split the credit in 2019, one of the benefits of that was that the application has to go in for the culture test before the application with the financial details goes through to Revenue, which can be further along in the process.  One has to engage upfront on one skills&rsquo; development plan with Screen Ireland and with the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.  That is staggered because the bigger the production, the more you have to engage and the more detail you have to provide.  In the case of a larger production, there is a compliance stage at the end of the production to ensure that this is signed off and that the company has met the criteria.  The Department has sent through details to say that since April 2019, over 140 skills development plans have been submitted to Screen Ireland for approval and more than 1,500 skills participants have been tracked through those productions.<\/p> <p>  On a regional basis, because we also have a focus on trying to move those talent pools out of Dublin and Wicklow and around the country in a more broad way, we have the regional spend uplift.<\/p><p>If you are applying for the regional uplift, there have to be additional skills development participants for that to show that you are developing the talents in those areas.  Since April 2019, Screen Ireland has had over 45 regional skills development plans, over 500 participants have been tracked and it is continuing to move forward.  It has engagement now on higher and further education and training.  There are new Springboard and traineeship programmes at institutions like the Technological University of the Shannon, the Atlantic Technological University and Limerick and Clare Education and Training Board and Screen Ireland is establishing five new talent academies across Ireland, in Wicklow, Limerick and Dublin and two in Galway.  It is moving so far forward in that respect that it is the first to link this type of structured skills training to the film tax credit and other jurisdictions are now coming in to learn from Screen Ireland about what it is doing.  The latest innovation being introduced towards the end of this year is a new digital skills tracking system, so there should be more transparency and accountability about what is there.

The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform had already published something on expenditure.  We are in the early stages of looking at green budgeting, as are other countries.  It lends itself more to expenditure than to tax.  We have set out the issues with green budgeting before taxes apply.  It is a green tagging system for various tax measures based on existing measures.  This could be used on a per year budgetary basis to assess, as a first step, the monetary value of the greenness of the budget.  The only people I have seen who are ahead of us on this are the French.  They have more developed criteria.  They assess the environmental effect on six criteria rather than just the monetary value.  They have a four-point scale of how green a particular measure is.  With regard to the tax base, even though our system is relatively rudimentary, it is one of the most advanced.

During budget or finance Bill debates, the Minister may often commit that something be examined, for example a tax strategy group paper might be produced on it.  Political debate can prompt something to be reviewed.  We have discussed that there are many more expenditures than the Department has capacity to review so it is always a case of trying to identify those that give the best value.  We have to do a cost benefit analysis of doing a cost benefit analysis really.  It is always a case that there is more work to be done than the Department has capacity to do and those are the criteria that bring the ones that get reviewed up to the top of the list.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022062200002#N00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Deirdre Donaghy"},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":197,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Donaghy and the Chair.

One last thing, the stakeholder issue is a theme that comes across in terms of the reviews and I ask the committee to consider that we significantly up the ante on that.  We had an arts committee that recommended a stakeholder forum around section 481 a few years ago.  Certain participants said they were not participating and then, even though a Minister and a committee was in favour of it, the committee was gone because one or two stakeholders decided they did not want to participate.  I seriously recommend that this is just not allowed.  If people say they are not participating, they are the ones who should be penalised.  How on earth can somebody get public money and then refuse point blank to participate in a stakeholder forum that the elected representatives and the Minister say is going to happen, and they are let away with that?  It is beyond belief to me.  I ask the committee to consider that point because we need more stakeholder engagement and a proper structured process.  Frankly, if stakeholders and beneficiaries of these reliefs are not playing ball, they should be told to take a hike.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022062200002#N01300","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655852400,"counter":204,"content":"<p>Stamp duty is a very archaic tax on documents but essentially it is when an asset transfers and inter-group is where it moves from one arm of a company to another arm of a company.  The reason there is a relief is that there is no real economic change in the owner.  It is still owned within the same group and provided you meet the criteria, stamp duty is not charged.  It would not be viewed as a loss of revenue to the State because if there was a stamp duty charge on it, moves just would not happen.  It exists for things like reconstructions, amalgamations, moving things around a group.  They are all part of the normal way in which a group operates.

To answer Deputy O'Rourke, this database is very important.  It provides knowledge of what is happening, which will benefit us in a whole variety of ways.  One of the issues with regard to the database of the motor insurance register was that it was felt that there was no need for the actual address.  Many of those details are captured because details of the driving licence have to be included and this includes much of this information.  It was felt that it was better to capture the person's name and licence details and that the address is not required.  There is a benefit there with regard to ease of use, management, monitoring and updating the database.  Not having to put in the address in that particular category makes the database simpler and more efficient to use.  It is to simplify the working of the database.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022062200002#D01000","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1655852400,"counter":326,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":327,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 12 to 15, inclusive, and 18 are related and may be discussed together by agreement.

Approximately 8% of private cars are fleet vehicles.  In the published Bill, we asked for information relating to &quot;the classes of persons whose liability is proposed to be covered by the policy and the number and classes of vehicles&quot;.  Following further consideration, we now propose to recast this and divide it into two subsections.  The first will require the name of persons covered in the policy and the second will require the class of driver covered.  It is an important distinction because a policy will sometimes name drivers while other times it might cover a class of drivers, for example, heavy goods vehicle, HGV, drivers employed by a firm.  By splitting the named drivers and class of drivers provisions into two subsections, we give ourselves the option to commence them separately.  While I hope not to do that, it would be a useful option if the roll-out of the database was to take place in stages.  We are not talking about the vehicles here.  This is about the classification of the drivers.  Reporting on vehicles held by a fleet is not to the insurer but directly to the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland, MIBI, and therefore to the database under section 56A(2) of the Act.  This amendment is to provide greater flexibility in how companies might provide information on their drivers to the database.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022062200002#D01300","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1655852400,"counter":329,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":330,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 13:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 13, to delete lines 1 to 3 and substitute the following:  \t&ldquo;(d) in relation to a policy in respect of a fleet owner or motor trader&mdash; <blockquote> \t(i) the names of any persons mentioned in the policy, and<br \/><br \/>(ii) where applicable, the class of driver whose liability is proposed to be covered by the policy;&rdquo;.&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022062200002#D01500","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1655852400,"counter":331,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":332,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 14:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 13, line 11, before &ldquo;applies,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or (d)(i)&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022062200002#D01700","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1655852400,"counter":333,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":334,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 15:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 13, line 18, before &ldquo;applies,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or (d)(i)&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022062200002#D01900","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1655852400,"counter":335,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":336,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 16 and 17 are related and may be discussed together by agreement.

The first is to drop the reference to the address.  I referred to that earlier.  We changed that in the context of the information provided to the insurer or agent by the client.  The address of the persons on the policy is not required because, as I stated, we get that from the driving licence.  The second change, which may relate to a question asked by Deputy O'Rourke, is to remove the term &quot;insured&quot; as a way of referring to the policy holder.  As the Deputy stated, a policy holder is not necessarily the insured.  In other words, a person may own a car but not drive it.  He or she could take out a policy on the car so that another person can drive it.  That is not common but it is something for which we need to allow.  That is the nature of the amendment.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 38 changes the data to be provided by the insurers to the database in respect of fleet policies.  The published text states that the insurer will provide the classes of persons covered by the policy.  This will now be the names of the persons.  We are also adding reference to policies held by a motor trader as these are similar to fleet policies but would not be captured by the present text, as referred to in a previous amendment.  Finally, we are removing references to the vehicles covered.  This is because that information will be provided directly to the database by the policy holder, rather than by the insurer.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 39 and 40 are small additions of a type we are making in a few places to add reference to intermediaries such as managing general agents, MGAs, after insurers.  They, as well as insurers, will have to notify the database if a policy holder notifies them of changes to the information they have supplied.  They, like insurers, will have to notify the database when a policy is cancelled.  <\/p><p>Amendment No. 41 is more substantial.  It adds an additional reason to the purposes for which the Minister may have access to the data.  This will allow my Department to verify the validity of insurance coverage for vehicles to be authorised on a road transport operator licence.  This is often an issue for the Department.  For example, in the case of supports to the haulage industry recently, certain licensed vehicles were able to access such supports, while others were less able to do so.  The amendment provides a joint capability within the Department in the context of sharing the insurance database details with the road transport operator licensing details.  We currently rely on self-declarations and that would continue to be the case without the amendment.  We do not have evidence that a person is in compliance with his or her insurance obligations.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 42 adds a reference to intermediaries alongside insurers.  This will allow them to see the data they have uploaded to the database in order to verify or correct it.  Under the amendment, MGAs will now be able to do the same.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 43 simply adds definitions of two terms, namely, &quot;National Vehicle and Driver File&quot; and &quot;operator&rsquo;s licence&quot;, used in the insurance-related amendments made by the Bill.  It is largely a technical amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022062200002#E02300","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":388,"content":"<p>The Minister referred to intermediaries.

We should probably look to give this power to other road authorities as well as the TII so that we move beyond national roads to other roads.  Local authorities should also have this power in the Bill.  Is the intent of the legislation prescriptive with regard to traffic flow or is it broader than this?  There are all kinds of reasons we might have variable speed limits, including safety, noise reduction and air quality emissions.<\/p> <p>  This might be the section of the Bill where we could look at a national kilometre reduction target as other countries have introduced.  We have one in the climate action plan that is specific to fossil fuel vehicles.  Other countries are applying such a target to all vehicles.  If we are to be true to the policy approach of avoid, shift and improve, we should try to reduce the number of kilometres driven throughout the State.  This is being done in other jurisdictions.  It would probably fit into this section of the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022062200002#F02100","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":435,"content":"<p>I would add the word \"share\" to the avoid, shift and improve approach.  There will be a move towards shared mobility in a range of ways.  This is a slightly pedantic point.<\/p> <p>  It Deputy Leddin were to table an amendment on Report Stage in the interim I would look have to look to the Office of the Attorney General to see whether there is any reason we could not accept an amendment whereby we change the title of the authority.  We would have to be careful that we would not miss anything because the legislative block is unconsolidated.  I am also conscious of time.  I do not know how long such a trawl would take.  I would certainly consider it if the Deputy were to table an amendment on Report Stage.<\/p><p> On the variable speed limits and the management of it, the primary reason is safety.  Near the port tunnel we have a monitoring service on the M50 and other roads approaching the capital.  I happened to be there last year when a car broke down on the outer lane, the fastest lane, as it were, and was stuck there.  It was an incredibly dangerous situation to look at.  You had passing traffic going at 100 km\/h.  Emergency workers, an ambulance, garda&iacute; or a fire truck coming to that incident would have a real challenge with how to manage what is a real safety problem.  Thus, the primary purpose here is for safety management of the road and potentially other roads, as I said, nominated by the Minister of the day.  That could include part of a national road.  We could do it section by section.<\/p><p> There are other potential benefits, such as alleviating traffic congestion problems.  Often the road is not acting optimally when you have a certain speed limit.  You may see you get greater capacity use out of it by regulating for speed but that is a matter for TII to decide on and we are giving it powers to make those judgment calls.<\/p><p> On the wider issue of avoiding, reducing, controlling, and management of emissions, there may well be cases, for example with issues of serious air pollution, and there are such issues.  There is a real issue around the M50 and the surrounding suburbs.  The emission of particulate matters, ozone, benzene and all sorts of chemicals is a very significant issue.  If TII is looking, as I said, and it can be shown there is an optimal way of managing that, I do not believe this legislation would restrict it but the primary purpose is safety.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022062200002#F02200","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":437,"content":"<p>That is fair enough.

It might make sense that at certain times you could slow the traffic down to reduce the noise, such as at night-time when people are more disturbed by it.

It is to do with amendment Nos. 72 to 74, inclusive, and the setting of special speed limits.  The Bill seems to deal mainly with national roads, TII roads, and not roads managed by local authorities directly within their areas.  I see in the proposed section 55(10E) there is scope for ministerial policy direction on certain speed limits.  Is there scope to be stronger on that?  We have had the RSA in here.  We have had many activist groups and cycling groups that are all keen to see a 30 km\/h speed limit set in urban areas.  That would of course assist us with active travel and also deal with the issues of noise and pollution that were just spoken about and generally make our roads a little safer and more inviting in the urban centres.  Is there scope within this to be stronger in that the Minister just may, from time to time, issue a policy directive?  I believe it lies with the local authorities to implement 30 km\/h speed zones.  We got advice recently, following committee sessions, there is no legal impediment to local authorities implementing those 30 km\/h zones but that would seem to conflict with what is in the guidelines for setting speed limits.

Some of them currently refer to the Road Traffic Acts 1961 to 2010.  That original Road Traffic Act 1961 has been amended many times in the past five decades and more of its existence, including amendments made post 2010.  In some of those previous updates, therefore, the citation, in the context of the Garda charging people under the legislation, could be to powers under the Road Traffic Act 2016, as amended by the Road Traffic Act 2010, for example.  Some previous updates could refer to the Road Traffic Acts from 1961 to 2016.We have not updated every collective citation.  That would be a significant task.

Typically, these are e-scooters or other similar devices.  In the published Bill, certain technical details characterising such vehicles are included in the revised definition for PPTs.  We are amending paragraph (b) of section 16(e) by lowering the maximum unladen weight permitted to 25 kg and paragraph (d) of section 16(e) by increasing the continuous rated power permitted to 0.5 kW.  The maximum speed of 25 km\/h set out in paragraph (c) of section 16(e) will remain unchanged.  These specifications are proposed as standard for vehicles falling under this category.  Following expert advice, I am also amending paragraph (d) of section 16(e) by clarifying that for vehicles where there is more than one motor, a combined rated power of 0.5 kW is the maximum limit.  Making these changes to the specifications for this class of vehicle will ensure that PPTs remain outside the scope of the EU motor insurance directive, which applies to mechanically propelled vehicles, and consequently will not require insurance for use on Irish roads.<\/p><p>Even in the time since work on this Bill commenced, the reality of a maturing e-scooter market has been noted.  The work of the Road Safety Authority informs our thinking.  My solution is therefore to satisfy the recommendations of that organisation and the wider public interest is to insert or such other values &quot;as the Minister prescribes&rdquo; in paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of section 16(e) in order that the weight, speed, and power output in the definition may be revised as needed through regulations.<\/p><p>This will future-proof our road traffic legislation, allowing us to make necessary updates as the sector grows and providng an opportunity for further consultation once the Bill has been enacted.

We will probably see that in every city and large town in Ireland in time as it becomes easier to travel in our urban areas by smaller vehicles.  We can expect tradespeople to travel by cargo bike as well as families.  There is evidence that families are getting rid of their second cars and getting a cargo bike in lieu.  I would be concerned that this section is restrictive on cargo bikes and especially the line about reducing down from 55 kg to 25 kg.  We must be careful when we discuss the power outputs of cargo bikes.

Under &quot;busway&quot;, section 43 provides for an amendment to the definition of a road in section 2 of the Roads Act 1993.  To provide clarity on what constitutes part of the road, it is proposed to make a change to paragraph (b) by substituting &quot;carriageway (whether single or multiple and whether or not designated for a particular class of vehicle)&quot; with &quot;carriageway (whether single or multiple)&quot; and to paragraph (c) in the definition of &quot;road&quot; by inserting of the word &quot;verge&quot; after &quot;margin&quot;.  These changes are included in the existing Bill, but as further changes are being made to the definition of a road, it is proposed to delete section 43 from the Bill and restate the proposed changes set out above.<\/p><p>There is also an amendment proposed to allow for a change to paragraph (d) of the definition of a road in the Roads Act 1993.  It is proposed to insert the words &quot;used, or the use of which is reasonably required, for&quot; in place of &quot;necessary for&quot;.  The reference to &quot;necessary&quot; potentially sets too high a threshold and needs to be altered to make it clear that the definition extends to anything used or reasonably capable of being used in connection with the safety, convenience, benefit and amenity of road users, including the provision of information.  This amendment will reflect the reality of the range of facilities and infrastructure that is now provided as a matter of course as part of a public road and are not strictly speaking &quot;necessary for&quot; the safety, convenience or amenity of road users.<\/p><p>On the second of these amendments, which deals with CCTV, it recently came to the attention of the Department that Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, is using a network of CCTV for cameras to monitor traffic and to assist with enforcement.  Local authorities use similar systems for traffic management and monitoring.  Cameras are used to monitor and manage the movement of general traffic, public transport and various other different transport modes.  These allow TII and local authorities to identify incidents, accidents, congestion, delays and other appropriate actions.  Enforcement cameras can be located at toll plazas or along road gantries, such as those on the M50.<\/p><p>At each enforcement location, the system of enforcement cameras monitors vehicles and captures necessary information, such as number plates, to support the management of the road.  These cameras are generally fixed mounted and generate images that are used for post-image capture processing, such as automatic number plate recognition.<\/p><p> Traffic cameras are also used to monitor and manage other incidents, such as marches, protests and other events, including weather-related events.  TII and road authorities share the data from these cameras with a number of bodies, in particular the emergency services, public transport operators such as Dublin Bus and Luas, and local authorities.  On behalf of TII, several contracted service providers also have access to this information.<\/p><p> These cameras, and particularly the use of data, are being used without a proper legislative basis.  The enforcement use of cameras, by its nature, requires identifying individual vehicles.  While most of the traffic management information is captured from a distance and does not include individually distinctive information, it is possible for the cameras to zoom in, and some images of registration plates and at times faces may be captured.  This amounts to personally identifying data and can raise concerns about the protection of the data in question and of individual rights in light of the general data protection regulation, GDPR.<\/p><p> Legal advice obtained is that this matter can be addressed by regulations in the short term.  However, this solution will have effect only until 6 December 2022 due to section 6(2) of the Data Sharing and Governance Act 2019.  It is, therefore, imperative that proper provision be put in place in an Act of the Oireachtas before that date.<\/p><p> It is proposed to address this situation by an amendment to insert a new section 77A into the Roads Act 1993 to allow for the provision of cameras by both TII and the local authorities, including CCTV cameras, and for the use of data from those cameras.  The proposed additional section 77A will give a basis for the provision of cameras, including setting up and operation of cameras, first, for the safe and efficient management, operation and use of public roads, including traffic management and providing information to the public; second, for charging and collecting tolls and the operation of toll roads; third, for the deterrence, prevention, investigation and detection of criminal offences, including road traffic offences; and, fourth, for any other purpose to be prescribed by the Minister.  The amendment will also address the publishing by TII or each relevant local authority of a schedule of the cameras in question operating on public roads.  Finally, we will provide a legal basis for the sharing and processing or use of data from cameras in operation between a local authority, TII, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the National Transport Authority, the Road Safety Authority and any other person the Minister considers necessary for the purposes outlined above.<\/p><p> We are making sure that appropriate protections are in place for the sharing of data, for data sharing agreements, for the safeguarding of data and for directions, guidelines, standards and regulations.  This is obviously not a position any of us want to be in.  Traffic cameras are an essential tool for managing traffic.  Come December, it will be necessary to have primary legislation in place to enable them to be used in a way which protects data in an appropriate manner.  I hope the committee will appreciate that we reacted promptly to this matter as soon as it came to our attention and that we have developed the necessary proposals here to address it.  In fact, it might have been a Limerick case that prompted this need for legislation before 6 December.  It is a highly sensitive issue.  It is important that we get the regulations right and that we respect the need for privacy as contained within the GDPR but also that we do not have an unenforceable use of cameras, which would be the case if we did not legislate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022062200002#L01500","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":593,"content":"<p>The Minister might give us an update on the engagement in this regard.

However, as a cyclist, I have experienced close passes and while I do not have a camera on my helmet, many cyclists do.  There is the ability to upload and send those data to the Garda or whoever it might be.  We all frequently witness very poor traffic management and behaviour in our towns and villages, such as illegal parking on footpaths and in disability bays.  Do we have the opportunity here to expand the use of cameras for managing and monitoring traffic to allow citizens who observe traffic offences to upload this to the Garda?  I understand the photograph itself may not be an admissible piece of evidence in order to take a prosecution but it will allow the Garda to build up a pattern, for example, if they are getting 40 photographs a week of illegal parking in a certain area.  While the photograph itself may not be used directly, the accumulation of photographs kept by the Garda would inform it of traffic offences that are happening regularly.

As Deputy Matthews noted, there is value in uploading that kind of evidence to a central system and that value may go as far as taking action against individual motorists and road users.  While it seems to fit in here and is something we should be seriously considering, it is not in the provisions of the Bill.  Also not in the provisions is the possibility of doing what is done in other jurisdictions, namely, having cameras on buses to pick out the bad behaviour of motorists and other road users.

I think we should be very ambitious in how we move forward in this particular area, as others have mentioned, in replicating the good work of other jurisdictions.  One of those jurisdictions quite close to us, just across the Irish Sea, has successfully put in place a portal for the uploading of dashcam evidence and camera evidence from all road users, not alone cyclists but also motorists and others.<\/p><p>It is also important, as others have mentioned, that cameras are used within buses and bus lanes in general to ensure they are the most efficient way of moving people about, particularly in more heavily trafficked towns and cities.<\/p><p> I recently asked the Minister for Justice a parliamentary question about the creation of a portal for the uploading of dashcam evidence.  The Minister's response was somewhat neutral but reasonably supportive.  It referred to the Department of Transport, stating, \"The Department of Transport has advised that any decision to allow film by members of the public to be used in evidence in road traffic cases would raise questions of reliability of, and possible tampering with, the apparatus used, as well as potential privacy issues.\"  This will hopefully address some of the privacy issues.  The fact of the matter is the Garda has sought and secured numerous successful prosecutions in our courts over the last four to five years using camera evidence submitted by cyclists.  There is already a provision within legislation, due to good work done by the Minister's predecessor Shane Ross, creating a unique offence of dangerous overtaking of a cyclist.  That legislation, combined with camera evidence submitted by cyclists, has already provided for the successful prosecution of a number of motorists with penalty points issued and fines imposed.  There is no question about the reliability of this evidence.  The courts have already decided it is perfectly acceptable to use that evidence in the prosecution of such cases.  I implore the Minister and his colleagues to engage amongst themselves and with the Department of Justice to provide for such a portal under the very significant road safety plan recently published by the Road Safety Authority and the Department, Towards Vision Zero.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022062200002#M00500","speaker":"1483","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":598,"content":"<p>This is a critical issue for us as policymakers and legislators.  Digital video CCTV cameras are increasingly prevalent and full of potential, as well as risks.  We need to be careful in getting the balance right between the requirement for privacy and the need for good enforcement of road safety and other measures.  There was extensive consultation with the Office of the Attorney General on these provisions regarding CCTV cameras because it had a central role in assessing some of the recent court cases and advising us on the steps we are taking.  We have also referred the matter to the Data Protection Commission and will have to continue to do so very extensively because it has a critical role in making sure whatever regulations are put in place get that balance right between the right to privacy and the protections needed in the sharing of data.  This legislation solely relates to cameras operated by TII and local authorities, for whatever purposes.  It does not relate to personal private cameras and how they might be used in evidence.  That is a matter for the Department of Justice and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There will be evolving legislation in that area and the Minister for Justice is working on that.  This does not relate to Garda cameras or cameras other than the ones operated by TII and local authorities.<\/p> <p>  This is a step in the right direction.  It gives certainty around the use of these cameras but it does not address the wider fundamental issues raised here.  I understand the potential benefits from the use of personal cameras, and prosecutions on the back of that, but I have some concerns about this in a world where AI capabilities and other mechanisms are being used.  Concerns around the erosion of personal privacy are real and we have to get the balance right in how we use this technology.  What we are doing here primarily relates to traffic management.  While faces or numberplates may occasionally be seen, this legislation does not carry those risks of breaching people's privacy.  The regulations we will create in conjunction with the Data Protection Commissioner will give us assurance in that regard and we will not do it without that reassurance.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the wider issue of the use of personal and-or Garda cameras, I would be slightly nervous about adopting what the UK or other countries are doing .

Section 46 amends section 44(6)(iii) of the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 to provide that the NTA cannot be interpreted as stepping into the role of a local authority under section 178 of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  The section also provides for the insertion of a new subsection 6A into section 44 of the 2008 Act, which relates to the requirement to acquire lands by agreement or by means of a compulsory purchase order for the purpose of mitigating the impact of any public transport infrastructure on the environment generally, any particular site, building or structure, the availability of parking, or trees and landscaping.

Section 56 of this new Part concerns functions of the Minister for Transport in respect of zero-to-low-emission vehicles.  This new section, along with the associated amendments in this group, are related to the establishment of an office of low-emission vehicles, as recommended in the electric vehicles policy pathway report that was published last September and mandated under action No. 274 of the Climate Action Plan.  Preparations are under way in my Department to establish this office, to be known as &quot;Zero Emission Vehicles Ireland&quot;, or &quot;ZEVI&quot;, which will play an important role in our transition to zero-emission vehicles.  ZEVI will have a broad remit in support of the Government's goal of achieving almost 1 million electric vehicles, EVs, on Irish roads by 2030 and will play an important role in Ireland's transition to zero-emission vehicles by co-ordinating measures to support the uptake of EVs and the roll-out of charge point infrastructure.  It will work across the government and society to support this transition.  Its operations will include: supports for EV uptake; infrastructure delivery; strategy; and policy lead, including in respect of taxation and regulation, research and innovation, communications and public and stakeholder engagement.  ZEVI will have an objective voice on EVs, providing advice to the public and private sectors and carrying out significant stakeholder engagement.<\/p><p>Currently, ZEVI's functions are split across four organisations: my Department; the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI; the NTA; and TII.  It is intended that these functions will continue to be delivered by the named organisations but under the umbrella of the new office, which will bring these policy and delivery functions into one hybrid organisation with a single identity and focus to enable delivery of the ambitious EV targets under the Climate Action Plan.<\/p><p>I anticipate that ZEVI will be established in my Department next month.<\/p><p>To facilitate the establishment of the office within my Department, the new sections 56(1) and 56(2) give the Minister for Transport new statutory functions in relation to zero- to low-emission vehicles and the related charging and refuelling infrastructure to enable him or her, as the case may be, to establish ZEVI to operate in the EV and infrastructure space.  ZEVI will be mandated to promote and seek to accelerate the uptake of EVs and to promote, increase and develop public awareness of such vehicles and the availability of the related infrastructure to support this uptake.<\/p><p> In this context, the new section 56(3) sets out a number of actions the Minister for Transport, essentially ZEVI, may take, as required, to achieve these objectives.  The Minister may assist in the provision of recharging and refuelling infrastructure, carry out EV and infrastructure training and research, promote and assist research of new EV technologies, advise on design, standards, accessibility, operation and use of EVs and related infrastructure and, critically, engage with key stakeholders with regard to electricity network development requirements to facilitate EV infrastructure. <\/p><p> In parallel to the foregoing, amendment No. 61 inserts a new section 45, which in turn amends section 19(1) of the Road Traffic Act 1993 concerning the specific functions of the NRA by inserting a new section 19(1)(cc) to confer a new function on the NRA or, more specifically, TII.  This section will enable TII to prepare schemes for the provision of recharging and refuelling infrastructure for zero to low-emission vehicles in relation to national roads or proposed such roads.  TII will be empowered to provide and maintain this network.  The Minister for Transport may prescribe, by regulation, the vehicles in respect of which one or more refuelling or recharging networks will be delivered by TII.  The purpose of this amendment is to enable TII to deliver EV charging infrastructure on the national roads network in the context of its role as a roads authority<\/p><p> Government amendment No. 77 provides for the consequent amendment of the Long Title to the Bill arising from the proposed inclusion in the Bill of matters relating to new functions for the Minister for Transport in respect of zero- to low-emission vehicles and related infrastructure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022062200002#P01900","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":637,"content":"<p>ZEVI sounds like a brand of clothes.

It is a positive amendment.  I do not need to list the benefits of electric vehicles, especially with regard to emissions.  This refers to carbon emissions but we also have to consider air pollution and noise pollution.  I wonder if there is an opportunity to address within the Bill the issue of internal combustion engines idling.  It is particularly problematic where vehicles are congregating around schools.  Is there an opportunity in the Bill to address the issue of leaving engines idling for periods of time at specific locations?<\/p> <p>  I have another comment.  In encouraging the uptake of electric vehicles, which rolling out the network will do, we have to ensure that we are not encouraging extra-large electric vehicles onto our roads.  These take up an unnecessary amount of space and the extra weight they carry makes them less efficient.  There seems to be a general move among car purchasers in Ireland to go for those larger vehicles.  This is probably more of a policy issue than something to cover within legislation but there are probably legislative changes that could be made to disincentivise the purchase of unnecessarily large EVs and to encourage the purchase of much more suitable EVs for personal use.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022062200002#Q01700","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":653,"content":"<p>I support Deputy Matthews's comments.  I welcome the amendment.  There might be an opportunity to go a bit further.  Electric bikes and cargo bikes are electric vehicles as well.  We could get into that space.  Deputy Matthews talked about smaller and lighter vehicles.  The main driving force - pardon the pun - with respect to vehicular transport should be the smaller, the lighter and the slower.  There are all kinds of very good reasons to go in that direction and I believe we can go a little bit further here.  If the Minister is agreeable, we might come back with some proposals on Report Stage.<\/p> <p>  In this section, section 45, there is an interesting part on An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  It states that it \"shall approve a scheme, or a proposed road development, that contravenes materially any development plan or any local area plan [...] only if it considers that one of the following is the case:\" before listing four scenarios, any one of which can apply.  The first is that \"the scheme or proposed road development is of strategic, regional or national importance\".  The second is that \"there are conflicting objectives in the development plan or the objectives are not clearly stated, insofar as the scheme or proposed road development is concerned\".  The third relates to the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008, the regional, spatial and economic strategy for the area and any statutory obligations therein.  The fourth is that \"the scheme or proposed road development should be approved having regard to the pattern of development, and planning permissions granted, in the area since the making of the development plan.\"  It seems that there is very wide scope for this to be misinterpreted or applied in a way that is not intended, especially when one considers the stories around An Bord Plean&aacute;la in recent weeks.  With the way An Bord Plean&aacute;la is set up, a great deal of power is vested in very few people.  It seems that this section might cause some difficulty for Ministers down the line.  It should be tightened up so that its intent, which I believe relates to BusConnects, is clear before the legislation is passed by the Houses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022062200002#Q01800","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":654,"content":"<p>I support Deputy Leddin's point.

I will start with the last one.<\/p><p>As I read it, amendment No. 61 amends that section with regard to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  In section 45(19)(1)(cc), we are saying that we would also \"prepare, or arrange for the preparation of, schemes for the provision of a safe and efficient network of recharging infrastructure and refuelling infrastructure for such zero to low emission vehicles as the Minister may prescribe and provide and maintain, or secure the provision and maintenance of, such a network\".  That amends the same section the Deputy is concerned about, if I am correct on this.<\/p><p> I will go back to the wider point about the BusConnects infrastructure we need to deliver.  People will be aware that the Government will have real difficulty in meeting our climate change targets, particularly in transport, which is probably the most challenging area.  One of the mechanisms the Government is developing is the acceleration of certain key areas, one of which is sustainable mobility.  That will require some of the infrastructure we are looking for to be delivered in a very quick timeframe, especially in towns and cities throughout the country.  For that to work, An Bord Plean&aacute;la will have to have a critical role because if the ordinary timeframes it takes for us to deliver infrastructure apply, for example, the cycleway to Clontarf being built at present has been in the planning system or process for almost ten years, we will have to accelerate those timeframes.<\/p><p> That has been recognised by the Government through a variety of different factors.  We have increased the staffing within the likes of the NTA and our Department to be able to do that work.  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, has also recognised that An Bord Plean&aacute;la needs enhanced staffing and other resources, especially in the public planning realm and ecology, including the transport planning and marine planning side, to be able to deliver quick decisions, particularly on projects that will be central to meeting our climate targets.  We have set up a special acceleration team to look at this.  We are looking for projects within local authorities throughout the country that might be what could be called pathfinder projects, which can be delivered very quickly at low cost.  Obviously, these have to be within our planning system and planning structures but it will require An Bord Plean&aacute;la to play its part in making sure such decisions are given very quick attention and that it has the resources in place to be able to turn around decisions.  This cannot come from the top down and it cannot ignore local and public interests.  It has to come from the local authorities.  It has to be from the councillors themselves looking at what the examples might be in their towns, cities or villages.<\/p><p> That transformative approach to accelerate development will characterise where we are at present.  The historical approach, which was very much based on roads and a sprawled, ever-outwards development model, will not work in a low-carbon environment.  The overriding legislation behind all this is our climate law, as well as European law, which requires us to meet these targets.  If we fail to do so in transport, we will have to introduce policy measures to go quicker and faster.  The historical concern the Deputy has would be the case if the situation continues, but it will not be the defining characteristic.<\/p><p> I will briefly address the issue of idling vehicles raised by Deputy Matthews.  Many of those measures, and some of the regulations, are sometimes best done at European level where, for example, new cars could have mechanisms whereby they are switched off.  Certain cars already do that.  However, the wider reality is, and I expect it will come up at the European Council meeting next week, Europe is moving towards a stage where there will be no new combustion engine vehicles by 2035.  There has to be recognition that we are going towards better electric vehicles.  It would be terrible for us if we just replaced a fossil fuel vehicle fleet with a heavy vehicle fleet that used up a lot of other resources, be those rare earths, lithium or other batteries.  What the Deputy said about the need to make sure we are very efficient in our transport system is true.  It is not just about replacing all of one type of car with another type of car.  As the Deputy said, the characteristics of our current fleet, where almost half the private cars last year were heavy vehicles by any definition, will not work.<\/p><p> This Bill cannot solve all those problems.  This specific amendment No. 61 relates to the EV charging infrastructure I mentioned, as well as the creation of an EV office.  Those wider concerns are best addressed elsewhere.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022062200002#Q02000","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":657,"content":"<p>Does this EV office include zero emission vehicles such as bikes, e-bikes and e-cargo bikes?

I think the debate has been very useful and very good.  This amendment is more on the technical nature.  Amendment No. 76 is designed to address an irregularity in the enabling provisions for certain road traffic regulations with regard to the construction and use of vehicles, that is, the maximum weights and dimensions permitted for vehicles driven on our roads.  Based on advice from the Attorney General's office and my Department&rsquo;s legal advisers, I am proposing to insert new text to state that the construction and use of vehicles regulations made between 2003 and 2007, and those made in 2015 and 2018, do not have statutory effect and were validly made under the Road Traffic Acts, including section 2 of the Road Traffic Act 2006.  This change confers the appropriate <i>vires <\/i>to give effect to European legislation and allows us to make further amendments to those regulations from time to time as needed.<\/p><p>As I said, it is a purely technical amendment and so does not itself imply any change to broader policy in the area.  Our next steps, once this has come into effect, will be to transpose European regulations to allow an increase in permitted weights for zero-emission vehicles as part of our ongoing efforts to support the switch away from fossil fuels.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 78 follows this with a consequential change to the Long Title of the Bill.  A gap has been seen in the implementation of EU directives and this is an opportunity to clean it up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022062200002#S04300","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1655852400,"counter":709,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1655852400,"counter":710,"content":"<p>TITLE<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":711,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 77:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 7, line 5, after &ldquo;Act&rdquo; to insert the following:  \t&ldquo;to confer functions on the Minister for Transport in relation to zero to low emission vehicles and recharging and refuelling infrastructure relating to such vehicles;&rdquo;.  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022062200002#S04600","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1655852400,"counter":712,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":713,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 78:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 7, line 7, after &ldquo;2008;&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;to provide for the effect and validity of certain regulations;&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022062200002#S04800","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1655852400,"counter":714,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1655852400,"counter":715,"content":"<p>Title, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":716,"content":"<p>Pursuant to Standing Order 187(3), the clerk will report specifically to the D&aacute;il that the committee has amended the Title.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022062200002#S05200","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1655852400,"counter":717,"content":"<p>Bill reported with amendments.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":718,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and his officials for their engagement with the committee today, for their hard work and for the briefing they provided earlier in the week.
