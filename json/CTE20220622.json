The purpose of today's meeting is, in the first session, to resume our examination of fixed-milk price contracts and, in the second session, to examine the issue of ash dieback disease and its impact on the private forestry sector.  In the second session, the committee will hear from representatives of Limerick and Tipperary Woodland Owners Limited.<\/p> <p>  Since 28 February, the legal requirement to wear a mask in all settings has been removed.  However, it is still good practice to continue to use face masks or coverings, particularly in crowded areas.  The service encourages all members of the parliamentary community to wear face masks when moving around the campus and when in close proximity to others.<\/p> <p>  Before we begin, I bring to the attention of those present that witnesses giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to a committee.  This means that witnesses have full defence in any defamation action for anything said at a committee meeting.  However, witnesses are expected not to abuse this privilege and may be directed by the Chair to cease giving evidence on an issue.  Witnesses should follow the direction of the Chair in this regard and are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that, as is reasonable, no adverse commentary should be made against an identifiable third person or entity.  Witnesses who are to give evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note that they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts and may consider it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.  Privilege against defamation does not apply to the publication by witnesses outside the proceedings held by the committee of any matters arising from those proceedings.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Parliamentary privilege is considered to apply to the utterances of members participating online in the committee meeting when they participate from within the parliamentary precincts.  There can be no assurances in relation to participation online from outside the parliamentary precincts and members should be mindful of this when contributing.<\/p> <p>  The first session will run from 5.30 p.m. until 7 p.m.  Today, we will hear from the following representative of Ornua: Mr. John Jordan, CEO; Mr. Colin Kelly, managing director of trading and member relations; and Ms Anne Randles, director of corporate affairs.

I will take this opportunity to thank the committee for the flexibility it has shown to Ornua in scheduling this meeting.  I personally wanted to be here but, due to diary conflicts, it was not possible for me to attend any earlier than today.<\/p> <p>  Ornua is a dairy co-operative, Ireland&rsquo;s largest dairy exporter and owner of the Kerrygold brand.  We are a second-tier co-op in that we are owned by almost all of the dairy co-ops across Ireland, including eight of the nine processing co-ops.  Our members are, in turn, owned by 14,000 dairy farmers.  There is no mandatory obligation on our members to trade or collaborate with us but they do so because we create significant value for them. <\/p> <p>  Ornua&rsquo;s purpose is to create value for Irish family farms.  We export to 110 countries worldwide and have annualised sales of in excess of &euro;2.5 billion and a global team of 2,900 employees.  We have been in existence for more than 60 years.  We operate from ten business units worldwide, including 16 production facilities and nine innovation centres.  We have sales and marketing teams working in-market right across the globe.  <\/p> <p>  As a co-operative of co-operatives, we operate collaboratively with our key stakeholders, that is, our farmers, our member processing companies and our own employees.  Our key role is to build long-term, sustainable and value-adding routes to market internationally for Irish dairy products.  Complementing this, we have a number of businesses that leverage our core competencies to generate additional profits.  This combination of value-adding routes to market and profitable businesses enables us to pay to our members strong purchase prices for their products, as evidenced by the Ornua purchase price index.  We now pay out at an index of 178.5, which equates to a milk price equivalent of 55.2 cent per litre, excluding a processor margin.  We also pay to our members the Ornua value payment, which is a combination of product premia over and above the base purchase price and a performance-based cash bonus.  The Ornua value payment to members was &euro;78 million in 2021. <\/p> <p>  Over and above being a key customer for all our members, our value to our shareholders lies in: our co-operative structure; the strength of our market return in terms of purchase prices; the strength of our brands, in particular Kerrygold, our long-term customer relationships and our overall business performance in terms of our Ornua value payment; our funding of members&rsquo; working capital; market volatility management; product innovation; and market intelligence and insights.  <\/p> <p>  Kerrygold is Ireland&rsquo;s only food brand with a retail value in excess of &euro;1 billion and 2021 marked another record year for the brand, with volume growth up 12%.  Kerrygold continues to be the fastest selling brand on supermarket shelves in Germany and is the number two butter brand in the United States.  We now sell more than 11 million packets of Kerrygold butter and cheese around the globe every week. <\/p> <p>  Importantly for today&rsquo;s discussion, as a co-operative whose purpose is to create value for 14,000 Irish farming families, we successfully captured and returned significant value to our member co-ops last year.  As I have mentioned, the Ornua value payment for 2021 was &euro;78 million.  This is a record payout, up 13.5% year-on-year, and amounts to a compound annual growth rate of 26.5% over the past five years.  It is an important contribution to our member co-ops which, in turn, support farmers&rsquo; incomes.<\/p><p>It is an important contribution to our member co-ops which, in turn, supports farmers&rsquo; incomes.  In addition, we purchased &euro;1.2 billion or 389,000 MT of premium Irish dairy products and we paid strong prices as reflected in the Ornua purchase price index, PPI.  We are confident that this purchase price will exceed again this year in both value and volume.  This performance delivers on our commitment to maximise returns to our member co-operatives and the 14,000 farmers who supply them.<br\/><br\/>Market volatility is very much a feature of today&rsquo;s dairy commodity market, and this market risk has to be managed.  In 2015, Ornua presented to this committee on the risks to dairy farm incomes of greater market volatility and the need for resilience and adaptability.  For farmers, the best insulator against volatility is a combination of market return, fixed milk price schemes and margin protection schemes, and efficient and shrewd financial planning.<br\/><br\/>Ornua itself has invested significantly in volatility management resources, skills and mechanisms to ensure our own product prices trade in a narrower, less volatile range than the commodity markets and to ensure we can provide an option &ndash; I would stress it is only an option - for our co-op members to hedge or de-risk a portion of their business.  We know that our fixed product price schemes have brought welcome stability to our co-op members over the past number of years.<br\/><br\/>Ornua is not involved in the operation of any fixed milk price schemes for farmers or in setting the structure or parameters of these schemes.  Our involvement is to provide a bridge to manage volatility and hedge uncertainty for our customers, our business and our suppliers, that is, our member co-ops.  Those co-ops in turn may or may not offer fixed milk price contracts to their farmers.  We have, of course, become aware of a certain number of farmers and farm families under financial pressure and, indeed, mental strain due to the fixed milk price arrangements they have in place with their co-ops, given the unprecedented and unexpected rise in input costs in 2022.  While we are not involved in managing these schemes, we strongly believe it is incumbent on everybody to step up and support these hardship cases.  To this end, Ornua has offered a flexible programme to our members to enable them to target such cases among their own farmer supply-base in whatever way they see fit.  Ornua&rsquo;s fixed price contracts with its members are for an agreed volume of product - butter, cheese or powder - purchased at an agreed fixed price.  We have offered to increase the contractual purchase price on 10% of this volume, subject to the member supplying the same volume in 2023 at this increased price.  This is intended as an option for member co-ops and a potential contribution to addressing the difficulties that have arisen.  It is not and was never intended to be a full solution to bridge the price between fixed and prevailing milk prices for all of the Irish dairy sector.<br\/><br\/>The Ornua offer is based on an assumption that 10% of the volume of Ornua purchases on a fixed price basis is from milk supplied by farmers in hardship.  Therefore, Ornua&rsquo;s offer is a price increase of an average of c. &euro;1,000 per MT on 10% of product purchased from the member co-ops in 2022.  This offer can be managed by the co-op in whatever manner it deems most appropriate for its situation.  It would equate to 10 cent per litre on 10% of the volume, or 1 cent per litre on all of their volume.  There is a link to 2023, in that the volume and price are in turn fixed for 2023 at the same increased return.<br\/><br\/>As Ornua is not involved in the design or management of any of the fixed milk price schemes, we have no data on hardship cases.  This information is held by the individual co-ops and it is only they who can determine whether to take up this discretionary offer and how it should be used.  Ornua is also not the member co-ops&rsquo; sole customer for fixed product price contracts.  The <i>Irish Farmers' Journal <\/i>recently estimated that more than 1 billion litres of Irish milk was in fixed milk price schemes.  If this is accurate, Ornua is a counterparty for less than one third of the milk in fixed milk price contracts.  Ornua&rsquo;s offer of support is being funded by Ornua.  It is entirely separate from the payment supports recently brought in by individual dairy processors and aims to provide equity across all our members, while helping co-ops to target hardship cases.  Some member co-ops have taken up the offer and others have chosen not to.  The principle of equity is important in this context, as not all of our members offer a fixed milk price scheme to their farmer suppliers, while others reportedly have only a small proportion of their farmers in such schemes and an even smaller number of hardship cases.  Not all members will, therefore, avail of this offer - to be fair to them, there appears to be a challenge in supporting just a proportion of farmers and not all others - and yet all farmers will ultimately be implicated.  The cost of Ornua&rsquo;s offer will impact Ornua&rsquo;s annual result and the overall amount of Ornua&rsquo;s 2022 value payment. <br\/><br\/>Despite this, and notwithstanding the fact that Ornua is only one of a number of customers used by the processing co-ops to off-set their fixed milk price schemes, we believe that our offer of support is the right thing to do, is balanced and is in keeping with our values.  While confidence in fixed milk price schemes has been very significantly impacted by the negative experience of some farmers in 2022, we believe, given the volatility of world markets, that hedging and derisking tools will continue to have a place in all our businesses.  Having said that, lessons will need to be learned from recent experience and consideration given to how income margins can be protected under any new schemes if there is an appetite for them.  It will be important also to ensure that farmers are appropriately advised on the use of volatility management mechanisms in their businesses so they strike the right long-term balance between income and market stability when seeking to de-risk their businesses.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022062200002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Jordan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Jordan.

That is a poor.  I accept Ornua has made an effort to help the co-ops and there was a very good bonus payout for 2021 but we find ourselves in a unique situation here.  Many farmers who signed up to this were under a lot of pressure from financial institutions to do so.  Especially for those with a high level of borrowing, financial institutions put individual farmers under pressure to sign up to these fixed price contracts.  In earlier times, fixed price contracts had the cost of inputs factored into them but these contracts were a simplistic contract just stating price with no protections whatsoever.  We have a number of farmers with 80% or 85% of their milk in these.  It varies downwards depending on what part of the county you are in.  Some co-ops did not offer more than 15% to any individual suppliers.  I know of one, a fairly small co-op in overall terms, where a significant number of its suppliers have 85% of their milk on these contracts.  Unless those farmers get significant help, they are going to be in serious trouble.  I refer to giving them help with conditions attached - that is, that they have to sign up to a contract going forward at whatever the price is.  These farmers have it up to their necks with fixed price contracts at the moment and they will not want to know about signing up.  Whatever help is being given to them, and some of the co-ops have come up with their own schemes to help suppliers, this is a supply chain issue.  There is the primary producer and the processor.  Mr. Jordan said he thought Ornua has only 33% to 40% of the fixed price contracts.  I accept that and I am not saying Ornua has them all, but unless everyone along the supply chain shares the pain here, the primary producer is going to go out of business.  For whatever reason fellows signed up to it, they are caught now in a unique situation.  No one expected the price of the raw material to go as high as it is, or the price of the inputs.  They are caught in a bind and they are going to need help.<\/p> <p>  I have reports from Glanbia council meeting the other day where men broke down and cried.  These men are facing financial ruin.  A man with 500,000 or 600,000 l tied into a scheme like this, unless he gets significant help, he just cannot stay in business.  It is in everyone in the dairy industry's interest to try to keep these men afloat.  Hindsight is great.  They signed up to this thinking they were giving their business stability.  It has had the exact opposite effect.  It has put them into dire financial circumstance.<\/p> <p>  I accept Ornua made a big payout to the co-ops last year and it made a great profit.  While I accept it will have an impact on the performance of Ornua in 2022, I would urge it to come up with a package for the co-ops that deal with it that will allow an extra payment to these farmers.  Give or take some of the figures, most of the co-ops have come up with something between 5 cent and 8 cent.  We will not put a figure on it here but if Ornua, as a huge player in the industry and a major purchaser of dairy products, could bring another package to the table, this would enable another payout to these suppliers to bridge the gap from the price they are on to where the marketplace is.<\/p><p>There is a huge difference at the moment.  You are talking about more than 20 cent per litre between the price they are receiving and where the marketplace is.  If we take an average of 6 cent, which some of the co-operatives have gone with, there could be another top-up on that.  We had the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society, ICOS, before the committee a number of weeks ago and we made the same points.  It is in everyone's interest to try to keep these farmers in business.  They are top-class producers of dairy products.  Their advisers, whoever was advising them, could have not foreseen a situation like this coming into play where there has been such a rise in the raw material price and in input costs.  I plead with Ornua, as a major player in the industry and a hugely respected cornerstone of an industry that has served farmers very well over a long period of time, to come up with a better package than what is on the table at the moment which would allow another payout to these affected producers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022062200002#B00600","speaker":"1611","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655852400,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.  I absolutely recognise that there are families - men and women - farming who are in serious financial and personal stress or hardship because of the situation they find themselves in.  The Ornua view is that the flexibility it has shown on the fixed product contracts will allow co-ops to create a pot of money which they can target at those specific hardship cases.  Absolutely nobody wants to see someone go out of business because of decisions they made on fixed price contracts.  Overall, and to reiterate what the Chairman said, we are creating value by paying product price in terms of producer price index, PPI, and indeed the Ornua value payment.  The flexibility shown on the fixed product price gives pot of money or fund availability potentially to co-ops.  How they then allocate it and apportion that among their farmers is a decision they have to make.

It has been a great success story.  However, young farmers specifically are facing some very difficult years ahead.  The Chairman is correct.  I have spoken to a number of young farmers in my constituency in Wexford and beyond.  The banks give them an ultimatum.  If they want the money to expand, they have to sign a fixed-price contract for some years' duration.<\/p> <p>  It states very clearly in Ornua's mission statement that its aim is to create value for Irish dairy farming families.  Ornua has had success over the years.  When we read the mission statement and see what is happening today, it is very hard for Ornua or anybody to defend that sentence.  I know Ornua has been in negotiation with co-ops and only two of them have signed up.<\/p> <p>  I am a little bit disappointed with the opening responses.  When the Chairman asked if the witnesses were aware of some of the cases of hardship farmers are going through at this time, while I am not sure of the exact language used, but the response was that it was not Ornua's responsibility, it is the responsibility of the co-ops.  I do not agree.  I had one farmer with me last Thursday night who was in tears.  He said that only for his wife&rsquo;s income he would not be able to keep his farm afloat.  He is milking up to 300 cows.<\/p><p>I would have said he is one of the wealthiest farmers in the parish and that he has done very well, expanded operations, came home from college and educated himself.  He told me he could name 20 or 30 other farmers in Waterford, Wexford and south Kilkenny, of whom I would be aware and who might be involved in my political party, each of whom would express similar sentiments.  They have borrowed heavily and educated themselves, they are top-quality dairy farmers and milk suppliers and this is what they are going through.  They are depending on their wives' incomes.  The cost of fertiliser has gone up 300%, with the price of concentrates, oil and electricity almost doubling.  It is very difficult for me.  There is very little I can do for these people.  I am not sure what the Government can do.  Somebody is making hefty profits on the back of these farmers.<\/p><p> What were the conditions attaching to the financial package Ornua put on the table for the co-ops?  Were there different conditions for each co-op or were they the same across the board?  I urge Ornua to speak to some of those to whom I refer.  There will be no problem whatsoever with one of the farmers.  However, some are afraid to come out publicly.  They are afraid of their co-ops and what they might do to them.

Simply put, why is there not a recognition we are in wartime?  At the moment, the Government has made a decision on roads contracts, and if we consider electricity for businesses, companies have left this country and contracts have gone out the window.  Why is there not a recognition that we do not put in other clauses for 2023?  Let other years stand for themselves.  It is my understanding it costs 39 cent or 40 cent to produce milk at the moment with current costs.  It is recognised farmers are losing money.  Why is this clause being put in?  I would like an answer to that question.<\/p> <p>  If the price of fertiliser and diesel remained the same and everything stood as it was, we would not be here talking about this because Ornua would have no case to answer.  However, we are in wartime.  I am no expert in milk but I have spoken to farmers in Kerry today who have 50 cows, and those farmers are on their knees.  A farm with 50 cows is a family farm.  Another farmer has 230 or 240 cows and he also is on his knees.  In certain areas some farmers might have taken up more than others.  Is Ornua as a company not prepared to recognise it has been stated by the Government that 70% of extra realised costs on roads and public buildings are going to be paid?  Contracts are being walked away from.  I have seen road contracts for tarmacadam and so forth abandoned.  In terms of electricity, businesses entered contracts with Spanish companies in February that are now gone, and nothing can be done about it.  Yet here is the farmer, the old reliable, being left in the lurch.  This is not a good sentiment.  The vibe I am getting is that if these farmers are left in the lurch, they will never be got back into a fixed-price contract again.  Is Ornua as a company prepared to say to the co-ops, who, as Mr. Jordan said, deal with the farmers, that we are in wartime and in totally different circumstances, and that because of the wartime situation, those contracts can be made null and void if they so wish?

This is not a topic in which I am as well versed as some of my colleagues, and that is why I sat back with interest to see how the thing evolved and developed.  To be honest, I am little wiser and in no way reassured.  I would hate to be in the shoes of the farmers mentioned by Deputies Fitzmaurice and Kehoe if they are watching the proceedings today.  I accept the matter has been raised but there is no point raising an issue if we cannot come to some kind of a solution or a &ldquo;get out of jail&rdquo; for these people, who, as noted, are serious hardship cases at this stage.<\/p> <p>  I get Mr. Jordan&rsquo;s point that Ornua does not deal directly with the farmers; it is dealing with the co-ops, which deal with the farmers.  Farmers are price takers and have been in every sector, not just milk, unfortunately.  If this was any other product or any other industry that we were talking about today, the person who was at the base of the system, where the farmer is in this situation, would know his cost price, would name his price, would include his margin and could not sell for any less, and then everybody who handled that product or processed it, or retailers along the way, would be adding on what they thought they needed to be their margin.  Unfortunately, as I said, farmers across all sectors are price takers, not price makers.<\/p> <p>  Where is the price fixed?  In this model, from what I have heard today, it seems that Ornua is working back down along.  If it is doing a fixed-price contract with the co-op, the co-op is then going back to the farmer and cannot give him or her any more than the margin the co-op needs on what Ornua has fixed with it.  Mr. Jordan said that Ornua is in a fixed-price contract with one of its biggest customers, so it is starting from there.  Who is the price maker in this whole cycle, from the 50-cow farmer in Kerry who was mentioned, to the customer that Mr. Jordan is talking about and which Ornua is in a fixed-price contract with for its powder or product, which is going to the retail shelf?  Somebody somewhere along that line determines the price and then everybody else is a cut below that.<\/p> <p>  Unfortunately, as I said, because it is farming, it is going in reverse.  If it was any other product, the farmer would decide his price and then everyone else could put what they liked on it up along.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022062200002#G00900","speaker":"1651"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655852400,"counter":128,"content":"<p>What we would say is that, ultimately, the market decides the price, and that is not to get away from answering the question.  What we have now is futures markets which, ultimately, dictate where buyers and sellers view the market.  To take the fixed-price schemes we are talking about, when they were set, that was an indication of where buyers and sellers were happy to trade, and that is invariably what drives the market.  The big buyers in dairy products around the world are buying derivatives in the same way that they are buying physical product.  If we look at the futures over the next 12 months, that gives us an indication of where the market is going to go.  That is the best read and we would say that, ultimately, it is the market that dictates where the fixed price is.<\/p> <p>  In answer to Deputy Fitzmaurice's point, if we were doing a fixed-price scheme later on in the year, obviously, we know from our discussions with our customers where they see markets, we know with discussions from member co-operatives and with farmers where they see global milk flows going, and we look at supply and demand and see where that will take pricing versus where it is at today.

Those in Ornua are business people, and very successful business people.  Ornua has a fantastic model and while all of us here today are trying to be critical to an extent, we cannot be so without acknowledging the success story that Ornua is, and its profits are there for everybody to see.  Naturally, I presume that when it is doing a fixed-price contract with the co-ops, its job is to hammer them down and to get that as low is it can.  Ornua has to be thinking of its margin.  Is that not leaving the co-ops in a position where they have to get as much milk at a fixed price below that again to leave them a margin?  Therefore, while Ornua is not directly dealing with the farmers, for one third of the 1 billion litres, it is determining the price of that milk.  Once Ornua does a fixed-price deal with a co-op, that co-op manager or purchasing manager who is negotiating the fixed milk price with the farmer has his hands already tied by Ornua.  He cannot go a cent more than X or he will not have his margin on his product before it gets to Ornua.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022062200002#G01100","speaker":"1651"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655852400,"counter":130,"content":"<p>One of the very important points made by the Senator suggested that Ornua's motivation was to hammer the co-op and get as low a price as possible.  It is fundamentally not and, in the co-op structure, it is actually the reverse.  We are incentivised to pay the best product price we can.  That is why we publish the purchase price index in terms of what we pay for product.  We are incentivised as a business under the co-op model to maximise our cost of goods and pay the best price we can for product.  On top of that, through all of our other activities, whether it is branding or subsidiary businesses that do not use Irish product, it is to generate as much profit as we can there to pay up the Ornua value payment, which, as I said, for last year was &euro;78 million.  We are not trying to squeeze the co-op.  We are trying to find a balance.  As Mr. Kelly said, the futures market in commodities products is a good indicator of where anonymous buyers and sellers align.<\/p><p>The co-ops have an option all the time to opt in or opt out of the product we offer.  They do that depending on any given year.  Under our scheme, some apply for more, some apply for less and some do not take part.  It is only if it makes sense for them and, in turn, if it makes sense for the farmers when each of those co-ops take those product prices and convert them into cent per litre, and that is different across each of the co-ops because their own cost base is different and their collection prices are different.  Then farmers have the option to opt in or opt out.  That is the model and the way it should work.<\/p><p> Deputies Kehoe and Fitzmaurice made points earlier about problems where individual farmers have very high levels of fixed milk in their portfolio, which has created a significant problem for them.

I have nothing against profit.  One must have profit.  People who are running companies and co-ops and farmers must have profit.  However, this is a different time.  The Government has stepped in and it needs to step in further with regard to fuel and other issues, but farmers who are producing milk now are not getting a fair price for their commodity.  Everybody knows that the milk is being produced and everybody knows there is a problem.  Somebody needs to do something about it.  We saw this with regard to Ukraine when its own product could not be let into Europe and what that is going to do to with the food supply in Europe and the rest of the world.<\/p> <p>  The greedy people always want to screw everybody every chance they get.  Farmers are in trouble.  Only a small few are tied into the fixed prices.  Why can the witnesses not do something for them and help them out on this occasion?  I know they are in a fixed-price contract and we know it is legally binding, but this is not about legality.  It is about fairness and about farmers having very serious difficulties.  This is about farmers who will go to the wall.  That is not good for the co-ops, it is not good for the country and it is not good for the consumer.  Somebody is winning from this, and whoever is winning needs to put his hand up and do something now for these farmers.  I am asking that something be done now.  Let us not talk about it.  Let us not have farmers having to leave and their sons and daughters not wanting to take up this industry in the future.  We will be depending on them for good food and good milk.  We will be depending on farmers in the future.  If we do not have our own people doing it and our own commodity, we cannot depend on what is coming in from Europe or from outside Europe because there is such difficulty all over the world now.<\/p> <p>  Let us be fair.  I know they entered into a fixed price.  When they did, nobody foresaw what was coming down the line.  We need to do something for them now, not when they have gone out of business and we are saying we are sorry we let them go out of business.  We saw this in Tuam with the sugar factory.  We saw what happened when farmers were not getting a fair price for their commodity.  Eventually sugar was being brought in from Brazil.  Now we do not know if we will ever have enough sugar.  We will be depending on another country to provide a product that we could have provided in this country.  We have good milk farmers.  They work hard and give it everything.

Farmers find themselves in a very exceptional situation.  When they signed these contracts, none of them thought that costs would go where they went.  There are farmers suffering severe financial hardship.  We accept Ornua has put a package on the table.  I also accept the witnesses' figure that only a third of the fixed milk price contracts come through Ornua.  I was actually surprised at that, but I am not doubting their figure.  I am surprised because no other entity has stuck up its hand to say it has significant fixed-price contracts.  Obviously, there are almost 700 million litres with other co-ops, so that is an issue that needs to be investigated further.<\/p> <p>  Numerous farmers who are in this situation have been in contact with me.  Since before we had representatives of the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society, ICOS, before the committee a number of weeks ago, I have had numerous farmers in contact with me who are in severe financial hardship with this.  Many of the farmers who are in fixed-price contracts are also the ones who are heavily borrowed.  Interest rates are rising now as well, which will put greater hardship on these farmers.  When the witnesses go to their next board meeting, I ask them to have a look at the package they have offered to the co-ops and see if it could be improved.  There could be an extra couple of cent per litre paid to those farmers who are under severe pressure.  I ask that genuinely as a Member of the Oireachtas.<\/p><p>Obviously, we have no leverage over Ornua as a company.  Its board will make this decision.  However, I earnestly ask the witnesses to see whether more can be done.  I fully accept that doing so will have an impact on the overall performance for 2022 but farmers are under great pressure and, if the shoulder is not put to the wheel for these farmers, some of them will go out of business or will suffer severe financial hardship for many years.  That is in no one's interest.  Co-ops are extending merchant credit for them and different things are being done but, while it can be deferred, all of that money still has to be paid back at the end of day.  Farmers are producing milk and receiving significantly less than the cost of production for it.  That will put them in a very bad situation for a great number of years, if they are able to survive.  I plead with the witnesses to go back to the board.  As they have said, Ornua is a farmer-owned organisation.  Sometimes the farmers on the ground do not appreciate that because they do not have much individual contact with Ornua.  However, it is owned by the dairy farmers.  I ask the witnesses to go back, examine their figures and see whether more could be put into the pot.

I submitted my opening statement beforehand.  I was not quite aware that people would not be here so I have got to be very careful about what I say.  I quite respect that.  I will not be overcritical and will be as fair as I can to everybody.<br\/><br\/>I thank the committee for its invitation to present an update on ash dieback.  Mr. O'Connell and I have appeared before the committee previously.  I will briefly outline the history of how we got to where we are today.  I will then update the committee on our perspective on what has happened recently.  Last year, we attempted to explain what we felt needed to happen and how we felt the committee could assist in achieving something that will make a real difference to a very sorry situation.<br\/><br\/>Turning to the history of this matter, we presented to the committee regarding problems growers were facing with ash dieback disease and detailed the appropriate measures needed to deal with the problem, which had not been forthcoming at that point, in October 2020.  In November 2020, the committee asked the Minister of State with responsibility for forestry, Senator Pippa Hackett, and her officials from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine's forestry service to appear before it to answer questions on what was being done to deal with the problems in the forestry sector, which was in deep crisis, as members know.<br\/><br\/>We are not interested in apportioning blame for how the disease infected this island.  We are primarily interested in getting a fair resolution to the problems this disease has caused for those who were encouraged by State authorities to plant ash trees.  These people had a legitimate expectation of a very profitable return according to the official promotional material.  However, when the Minister of State was asked how the disease came to be in Ireland, she gave a detailed account of how it was imported on plants infected by the disease.  These plants were imported through nurseries by forestry companies and planted in plantations.  The disease was first detected in 2012 by the Forest Service Inspectorate in the new plantations in which these infected plants had been planted.  The Minister of State volunteered information, presumably supplied by her departmental officials, that there was no fault over this on the part of the departmental phytosanitary security system because, under EU regulations, it was not possible for the Irish authorities to prevent the free movement of plants across EU member states' borders.<br\/><br\/>The Minister of State presented this explanation to the committee as the reason the Department is blameless as regards anything to do with the importation of the disease.  The problem with this explanation is that it is not the whole truth.  The first action taken by the then Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine when the disease was first detected in Ireland was to introduce, by way of statutory instrument, a ban on the importation of all ash plants.  This clearly demonstrates that the Department did have the power to prevent this disease being imported.  Did the Department fail to take appropriate action when it was needed?  During the period leading up to this, everyone in forestry in the EU was well aware of the risk this disease posed to our native ash growing in Ireland.  Why did the Department, knowing the threat to trees in Ireland, fail to carry out due diligence?  Surely, it should have advised the Minister to impose measures to prevent the disease being imported.  It is relevant that the phytosanitary security plant import system prior to this was changed and relaxed.  This was against expert tree health advice that certification introduced needed to be coupled with a quarantine period.  The change to the plant certification system, without this extra safety measure, rendered importing plants to pose a significantly greater disease risk.<br\/><br\/>As mentioned, we are not here to apportion blame.  We are here to get a fair resolution to the problem.  for this to happen, however, it would be helpful if the pretence that everyone was powerless to prevent this catastrophe happening was dropped.  The Minister of State and her officials made it clear that they had no intention of changing the reconstitution and underplanting scheme, RUS, introduced in June 2020, which replaced the previous scheme that had failed to help the situation.  Again, this scheme was designed to control the spread of the disease and allow for the identification of possible disease-resistant trees.  However, there are problems with both these aims.  It is not possible to control the spread of ash dieback.  It is unfair and unreasonable for the State to expect growers who have lost so much to manage a dying crop of trees in the hope of finding the odd immune tree for State experimentation without paying them to do so. <br\/><br\/>During our presentation in October 2020, we explained how the RUS was not fit for purpose.  We outlined the specific measures omitted from that scheme that were essential to deal with the ash dieback problem effectively.  Full credit to the committee - and the Chairman - because it published its considered report on this in March 2021.  It supported our call for the changes needed to the scheme that we explained were necessary.  Vital elements that needed to be included in a reform approach were and still are: sufficient financial assistance to clear the affected trees; in the absence of the ability to plant a similarly commercial species of broadleaf to ash, to assist in identifying suitable replacement trees and, where that is not possible, to assist in returning the land to other forms of commercial agriculture production; suitable income supplementation in the form of premiums to provide an income off that land is needed; and the substantial losses that older plantation owners are facing needs to be compensated for.<br\/><br\/>I will now provide an update.  The focus of the forestry service since the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, presented before the committee in November 2020 has been on the forestry policy group and Project Woodland.  The latter came about following a recommendation by a consultant, Ms Jo O'Hara, engaged to review the James Mackinnon report.  It is significant that the subject of ash dieback was excluded from her brief, as it had been excluded from discussions on Project Woodland.  At this point, I will ask why the officials in charge of forestry in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine are now asking that the forestry service be called the department of forestry within the Department.  This rather reminds one of how the power was claimed in George Orwell's <i>Animal Farm<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>Is the service element in the duties of departmental officials to forestry defunct?  Is the focus now on regulation and policing regulations only?  LTWO representatives have had a number of meetings with the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, in the past 18 months.  She made various promises to take another look at the situation but, apart from a couple of very minor cosmetic changes to the RUS, there has been no attempt to address the horrendous mess ash growers face.  We met the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, a year ago.  He listened but was not inclined to get involved, apart from preferring to leave all decisions on this matter to his junior Minister.  This is of concern because, ultimately, the responsibility rests with him.  The upshot of the authorities of the State not taking appropriate action has resulted in two planting seasons being lost to those affected.  On top of the losses caused by valuable trees dying, it costs ash dieback-affected plantation owners to partake in the RUS.<\/p><p>If the plantation is small and young the cost may be weighed up by plantation owners against having to live with this destruction and a belief that they are powerless to gain anything better.  The reality is that they will have to invest to start again with no compensation and no income from their plantation land for the foreseeable future.  Remember any broadleaf trees planted now will take 70 years to grow so that is two generations before there is a return.<\/p><p> There are some plantation owners who have decided to apply for the RUS in order to be paid their premiums that have been halted.  So there is a distinct element of coercion involved in promoting the RUS.  Forestry companies are all in favour of promoting the scheme because they are the only ones guaranteed to make money from the scheme.  Landowners who signed up to the RUS expect that they will never be treated equitably.  Larger plantation owners, who are the most affected group, are in an age group where their energy to fight for their rights is compromised.  There are very few of them for whom signing up to the RUS makes any sense.  We are here to fight for them, their children and their grandchildren.  These people now feel as if the forest service has its name on their title deeds.  They wonder if there will be anything in their holdings for their grandchildren as they observe how they have been treated.<\/p><p> Once the time of year comes when leaves fall from the trees there is about a five-month period over the winter where the progression of the disease across the country is hard to identify.  Apart from the odd wind that snaps dead trees and branches the general public could be forgiven for thinking that affected trees are just winter dormant.  Come mid-May, like this year, it has shocked people to clearly see that ash trees are dying from ash dieback at an incredible rate.  With this comes a lot of other problems related to the dangers involved in falling trees that are being ignored.<\/p><p> Never in the history of the State would it appear that farmers who have incurred such significant losses caused by a disease have been given no income support and no compensation for such loss.  After ten years and more of inadequate action by the authorities in charge it is no wonder that the people affected are turning really angry.  They are now investigating all legal routes to gain redress for what they have suffered.  This type of action should be completely unnecessary if what this committee recommended 15 months ago had been implemented but it is not.  Frustration mounts and the relationship between landowners and the Department over forestry and woodland in the private sector is getting to a point where the relationship will not be possible to salvage.  It is a sorry fact that the forest service has compounded the loss and suffering caused by ash dieback by delays in issuing licences, which has prevented people from harvesting ash trees for hardwood manufacture.  Those who had healthy trees and could have harvested them have watched helplessly as their trees went from having a significantly high value to being virtually worthless.  <\/p><p> Why are we here and what are we asking for?  We want the Government to pressurise the Department to address this problem in a genuinely fair and efficient manner.  The sectors in the Civil Service with responsibility to sort each of the issues involved need to be questioned as to why they have not taken appropriate action.  Pressure needs to be applied to make the necessary funding available so the Government must come up with resources.<\/p><p> The RUS is a failed and badly designed initiative.  It needs to be replaced by a scheme that assists people rather than costs them.  The most important element in any scheme that will have a beneficial effect is to provide an income from the land for the future.  To set aside the resources needed to do so it is vital to gather facts as to how many landowners are affected, how much land is affected and what amount of planted land affected is at each different stage of growth, etc.  This information should be at hand in the Department.  I am afraid that we, as a group, cannot access the information because it has been deemed information that we are not allowed to access under data protection legislation.  Teagasc is an advisory service and it must be tasked with finding alternative ways to make similar land income promised in growing ash.  Good decision-making depends on decision-makers having decent and factual information but no meaningful effort has been put into gathering this information, which is unbelievable.<\/p><p> We would like the Chairman of this committee to invite the forestry representation in Teagasc to attend to outline what Teagasc has done to investigate the way forward for people who have lost every potential benefit they legitimately expected from growing ash and what Teagasc proposes to do.  I am not talking about research into propagating ash trees that might be immune to ash dieback.  That is a long-term project that has merit but it will be of little or no use to people who face this immediate crisis now.  Teagasc needs to carry out vital research into the best ways forward for private forestry.  It is shocking to be told by the director of Teagasc, whom we met very recently, that his organisation has not been requested to conduct research into ash alternatives or costings.<\/p><p> Privately-owned forestry in Ireland has now reached a stalemate situation.  The way private landowners have been treated has turned them away from the idea of planting trees.  Given the climate change situation and our national commitment, it is incredible that the decisions made by the forestry service, and Ministers, with responsibility for the growing of trees are killing off private tree growing in this country.  While this is never going to be stated policy, it is the logical outcome of everything that is being promoted.<\/p><p> We need the support of committee members to reintroduce a level of logic and reason into decision-making on what the national policy should be for national tree growing.  Every week we read the latest harebrained proposals, which makes one wonder if the proposer lives on the same planet as us let alone is in charge of national policy.  We plead with members not to sit back and wait for what the committee recommended to happen.  It will not happen of its own accord.  The committee needs to exert significant pressure.  I urge members to please keep questioning what is being done and continue to apply pressure in order to get meaningful answers.  Do not be fobbed off.  We can feed the members many searching questions, the answer to which will be very informative.  Please join our call for action now to sort people out who have dead trees and trees dying from ash dieback.  Think about the mental health effects on elderly people and young people who feel utterly rejected by the State on this matter.<\/p><p> Apologies for the rushed presentation but time is short.  We hope to make up for this in answering questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022062200002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Simon White","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":176,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. White.

The one thing they have confirmed is that nothing has changed since the last time they were here and nothing has improved.  We, the witnesses and the Department were aware at the time that RUS was just a sticking plaster.  When the witnesses were here before, while we all saw the seriousness and importance of the issue for them, we were delved into the issue of licensing.  I think ash dieback was just a tag-along at the time and perhaps we did not give it as much consideration as we did to trying to find a solution to the problem with licensing.  For that reason, I am glad the witnesses are back before us for a stand-alone meeting.  It is important that we take this specific issue further.<\/p> <p>  With that in mind, I seek some more information.  Mr. White answered it to an extent in his response to Deputy Fitzmaurice's question.  Basically what you get through RUS is &euro;1,000 per hectare to remove the trees.  Do you then get the scheme restarted?  I mean, do you then get the forestry grant to replant for 20 years or are you disqualified for whatever number of years or portion of the forestry grant you already have received?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022062200002#N03500","speaker":"1651"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655852400,"counter":213,"content":"<p>It means that if you were in premium and had 15 years of premium, and you had been paid 12 premiums, you could claim three premiums.

There is no income on that, which means that your land is virtually worthless.  In fact, not only is it worthless, but if you wanted to sell it, nobody would buy it because they would have to invest to get rid of the trees and to plant again.  It has to be compulsorily planted in trees, which means that nobody has any options.  That is terribly unfair.  That has not been challenged yet.  That has never been challenged.  The law is supposed to be equitable.  That is quite blatantly inequitable.  A judicial review is needed to see whether that is fair, especially under an exceptional circumstance such as a disease of this nature.<\/p> <p>  I will mention miscanthus as another example.  The promotion of miscanthus in this country was a ghastly mistake.  Why did it happen?  It happened because due diligence was not done to work out that we needed to put an infrastructure in place so that we could burn miscanthus within a certain radius of where it was grown.  It became completely uneconomic to grow it, to transport it and to burn it.  Those people who have miscanthus have losses.  It would be interesting to know what that costs the State and what it costs the farmers who grew it.  There is nothing in the legislation to say that those people who grew miscanthus have to go back to produce alternative energy off the land that they got.  They are not told to put down solar panels.  They are not told to grow some other crop.  They are told that they can go back to any production that they want off that land.  Why is different for people with ash dieback?  You cannot replace ash with ash.  There is no other commercial broad-leaf crop.  We went into this as a business.  All of our members went into this as a business, not only for them but for the future generations.  Those future generations have memories, too.  They will see what was done to their parents.  Their grandchildren will see it.  We are looking at a whole thing into the future over the way this has been dealt with.

The plantations are dying and are then getting invested with fungus.  Fungus is getting into the soil.  Therefore, if you replant with other trees, those trees will pick up that infection and it will kill them.  We are in a situation that if somebody replants, they do a contract with another company to replant, and those people get the payments.  If, when the inspector comes to inspect the plants after five years, they are dying of the fungus, like honey fungus, they will not be signed off.  The growers are then stuck with a double whammy.

The licensing system has been in favour of Coillte, which made a very healthy profit last year in a time of crisis.  Private forestry has meanwhile been ground out, with nobody supporting it.  It seems as if the policy is to kill it off because we do not want private forestry in this country.  That is mind-boggling when we think of climate change commitments we have made.<\/p> <p>  We have a policy in this country, according to everyone, of going from 11% forestry cover to 18% by 2030.  That may now be pushed to 2050.  Does anybody understand that this equates to 445,000 ha of land being planted with trees?  Where is that land?  Who owns that land?   It is owned by private landowners and farmers.  It is not owned by Coillte or the State.  We must incentivise those people to plant.  There is talk about a policy that involves planting 8,000 ha per year, but we are not even planting 2,000 ha.  To achieve the stated goal, we would have to plant something like 20,000 ha per year.  Are we doing anything like that?  If we do not do it, what will it cost the State when we have to pay these fines for not doing what we said we would in our commitments in respect of climate change?  Every day we read about policies to do a little thing here or there, but we must do massive things in the context of the planting of trees in this country.<\/p> <p>  The latest statement from the Minister of State is that \"we cannot afford to lose any more high nature value farmland to trees\".  That is incredible.  That statement demonstrates a lack of logic in decision-making and political direction.  It is quite extraordinary.  Trees are the only thing that can sequester carbon, apart from the seas.  All the emphasis is on sequestering carbon in bogs and rewetting bogs, but does anybody understand that recolonising a bog with sphagnum moss, the organism to sequester carbon, takes years?  Does anybody understand that the bogs we had took 6,000 to 11,000 years to grow?  We have trees that would sequester 13 times as much carbon as a bog for every acre, but all the emphasis is on these crazy ideas.  The answer is staring us in the face; it is about growing trees.<\/p> <p>  Young people want to grow trees and care for the environment.  We need incentives to do that.  The schemes are out of date.  Who is doing research?  That is why we want Teagasc brought in.  We want to find out what research is being done to design schemes that are meaningful and that will encourage people to plant on land.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022062200002#P01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Simon White"},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":245,"content":"<p>Mr. White is recommending that the committee bring in Teagasc to find out what is going on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022062200002#P01100","speaker":"1508"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655852400,"counter":246,"content":"<p>Absolutely.

All over this country, there are roadsides owned by farmers with these trees that are going to die.  They are dying at the moment.  One can see them dead.  They are dangerous.<\/p> <p>  There is another problem there which is that, as they fall, they can kill people.  If a farmer has trees along the road and if he or she knows they are dead or knows they are affected, it is the farmer's responsibility as a landowner to deal with them, but how does one deal with them?  There are people being put to the pin of their collar because they have to deal with these trees.  They can cut them down, but how is one to deal with traffic?  I had a dangerous tree recently that I had to cut down and I arranged management on the road - I got permission from the Garda to do it.  I did it, but I was up in a cherry-picker, the drivers ignored the orders of the people stopping them in high-vis jackets, etc., and they were driving underneath me lopping branches down.  One cannot do that anymore.  What we have to do is have very expensive traffic-management plans and get the Garda or companies in to do that.  It will be a significant cost.<\/p> <p>  I have a lot of older established woodland.  If I have somebody who comes shooting through my forest and if a branch falls on top of his or her head in a storm, I am liable.  I cannot fell that tree unless I have got a licence.  There is one loophole in that.  It is that if one is within 30 metres of the road, one does not need a licence to cut a tree if one identifies that it is dangerous, but if it is on one's land, one cannot identify that and one has to get an authority, such as the local authority, to determine that the tree is dangerous.  The Senator should try and get local authority people to come out and go through the forests and the land of this country to identify what trees are dangerous.  They will not do it.  However, if something happens, one is liable.  How is one to get insurance for that because if it is determined that one knew the tree was dangerous, it is one's responsibility and they will not cover one with the insurance?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022062200002#Q01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Simon White"},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":263,"content":"<p>Is Senator Daly finished?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022062200002#Q01400","speaker":"1508"},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":264,"content":"<p>I am.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022062200002#Q01500","speaker":"1651"},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":265,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Ring.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022062200002#Q01600","speaker":"1508"},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":266,"content":"<p>I am very disappointed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022062200002#Q01700","speaker":"1500"},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":267,"content":"<p>Deputy Ring, you have frozen.

I am a research scientist so I know it takes an awfully long time to do this.  To come up with an alternative to ash is not going to happen for many years to come.  To deal with the situation at the moment, we must look at it logically.  It is something that is causing people to look at this.  Anybody involved in forestry is looking at how the pioneers have been treated as regards whether they will go into it themselves.  It is massively important to deal with the issue if we want to be serious about going forward with forestry planting in this country.<\/p> <p>  In a week in which we have seen large amounts of money go towards compensating people in agriculture and those with mica and such, it is very hard on the members we represent.

If the price of pigs goes down, there is something done for people.  People with forestry are just left out in the dark.  We are ignored.  There is a huge amount of frustration.

That needs to be researched and looked into and a proper phytosanitary security system put in place because, for instance, if we identify different species that we can plant, where are they?  They are not being grown in this country at the moment.  If we are going to have to import them, do we want to import another disease?  We must be very careful about what we do.  We made the massive mistake in this country of importing ash.  It was ridiculous when we should have been propagating those trees in this country from our own native ash.

Our forestry service fails at every juncture to honour its obligation to provide licensing within the established four-month deadline, be it completion works or any approval that is forthcoming from the forestry service that is strictly time-bound.<\/p> <p>  All we have heard at previous committee meetings and again today is about an industry that is going to face serious problems down the road.  We are all being told, even with planting now when we are talking about 20 or 25 years down the road, that if we do not get confidence back in the sector as we go forward year by year, we will have some massive problems.<\/p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for answering the questions.

However, the committees are encouraged to take a gradual approach to this change.  Members and witnesses have the option to attend meetings in the relevant committee room or online through Microsoft Teams.  All those attending in the committee room and environs should continue to sanitise, wash hands properly and often and avail of sanitiser outside and inside committee rooms, be respectful of others' physical space and practise good respiratory etiquette.  If they have any Covid-19 symptoms, no matter how mild, they should not attend in the meeting room.

European Works Councils are bodies that facilitate information and consultation with European employees on transnational issues.  EWCs are subject to the law of the member state in which they are located.  They allow workers to be informed and consulted by management on the progress of the business and any significant decisions at European level that could affect their employment or working conditions.  The impact of Brexit on EWCs based in the UK and Irish legislation regarding ECWs and related issues are what will be discussed here today.<\/p> <p>  I am pleased that the committee has the opportunity to considered these matters further with the following representatives.  I welcome from the Brussels European Employee Relations Group, Mr. Tom Hayes, executive director; Ms Lisa McKeon, Europe, Middle East and Africa employee relations senior manager with Oracle Corporation; and from SIPTU, Mr. Gerry McCormack, deputy general secretary and Mr. Denis Sheridan, European Works Council expert.<\/p> <p>  Before we start, I want to explain to our witnesses some of the limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards reference that may be made to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  Witnesses are again reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.<\/p> <p>  The opening statements have already been circulated to members.  To commence our consideration of this matter, I now invite Mr. Tom Hayes to make his opening remarks on behalf of the Brussels European Employee Relations Group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022062200002#A00100","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655852400,"counter":295,"content":"<p>Good morning.  I thank the committee for the invitation to be here today.  I will start by saying that BERG, the Brussels European Employee Relations Group, is not a representative body.  We are more like a think-tank - an information sharing network of major multinational companies.  We are not a secret society, although do not publish our membership list.<\/p><p>It is well known from publications like <i>Industrial Relations News <\/i>that members include companies like Oracle, Google, Amazon and IBM.  We had a meeting near Barcelona last week and among our guests were representatives from SIPTU; Mr. Kevin Duffy, the former chair of the Labour Court; Fabien Zuleeg, the chief executive of the European Policy Centre in Brussels; and Wilma Liebman, the former chair of the National Labour Relations Board in the United States, who was appointed to that position by President Obama.  We are a group of companies that is open-minded and will talk to anybody.  We involve people in our meetings who are interested in developing and progressing good industrial relations.<br\/><br\/>As is obvious from my accent, I am Irish, originally from the northside of Dublin, although I have lost a bit of that.  I have been living in France for the last 20 years and have been involved in industrial relations all my life since I left college in 1972.  I joined the old Workers Union of Ireland and worked there before becoming a personnel director.  Effectively, I have been a consultant since the early 1980s.  In full and open disclosure, I have to say that my younger brother, Brendan Hayes, was the deputy general secretary of SIPTU for many years and then he was vice-chair of the Labour Court.  I come from very much a labour background even if I work on the other side of the street these days.<br\/><br\/>I am not going to read our opening statement in full because I always find those things a bit boring and the members have read it themselves, but I will make some remarks around it.  European works councils have been in existence since the early 1990s.  The first legislation was adopted in 1994 and became law at national level in 1996.  I have been involved with European works councils ever since that time.  I have participated in negotiations and renegotiations of probably more than 100 agreements and continue to do so to this day.  For instance, just in the last couple of months, I had a small background role in helping Amazon negotiate its first ever European works council agreement, which is based on Irish law, and I am currently working with Google and with several other companies to do the same.  All of this information is in the public domain.<br\/><br\/>European works councils have, by law, to be based in the country in which the company is headquartered.  For example, the European works council of Volkswagen is based in Germany, the European works council of Danone is based in France, and so on.  The exception to this is where a company is headquartered outside the European Union or the European Economic Area.  We are primarily talking here about American companies, but also about Japanese and Canadian companies and one or two others.  For the most part, however, we are talking about American companies.  In recent years, most American companies would have based their European works council in the UK.  The primary reason for this is not because of the generality of labour laws in the UK but simply because of English.  Most companies want to work in their own language.  This has practical implications as well.  I will give an example.  There was a recent case before the central arbitration committee in the UK, which involved something like 1,100 pages of submission.  The Americans read English badly, I would say, and speak it worse, but imagine if you had to study that in German, Swedish or Polish and have it translated.  Then when the proceedings are taking place, you are sitting there wondering what is being said.  You want to be able to work in the English language.  When it became impossible to continue to base European works councils in the UK because of Brexit - and the European Commission has made it clear in a note of April 2020 that European works councils could not be based in the UK after Brexit - they began then to look at other options.  The option of choice for many companies was Ireland.  This was for the same reasons.  We work in English and many of them have a significant footprint here.  The multinational sector employs something like 275,000 people in Ireland, which is around 11% of the workforce.  If we take it that for everyone directly employed, at least one other person is indirectly employed, we can see the size of the footprint they have here.  They have moved here.  There is no official list, and they are not required to register, but we estimate from our own information that there is probably somewhere between 100 and 150 European works councils now based in Ireland.  As I mentioned, that includes companies such as Amazon, Google, or it will shortly, Oracle, Hewlett Packard, Hewlett Packard Enterprises and so on.  The Brussels European Employee Relations Group and I have been very prominent in encouraging companies to come to Ireland.  <br\/><br\/>We are aware, however, of the fact that there is a significant gap in the law.  The procedures that are necessary and should be in place to allow disputes between the employee side and the management side of a works council to be resolved when they cannot be in direct talks are deficient.  When the original Act was written in 1996, it was anticipated that a series of statutory instruments would be made to flesh it out.  They never were made.  Only a handful of Irish companies have European works councils, that is, companies that are headquartered in Ireland such as the Kerry Group, Smurfit, Glen Dimplex and one or two others.  There was never any pressure because there were never any disputes.  Life being what it is, we tend to only deal with problems when we absolutely have to.  Statutory instruments were never made.<br\/><br\/>We now face the situation where, with more than 150 European works councils in Ireland, we are looking at the real possibility of disputes.  As we sit here, I am aware of one such dispute before the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, this morning.  That is the first one.  I am also aware of another company that has written to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Leo Varadkar, to appoint an arbitrator to deal with a dispute.  An arbitrator has not been appointed because the statutory instrument is not in place to allow it.<br\/><br\/>When we became aware of this gap, we asked Mr. Kevin Duffy, the former chair of the Labour Court, to have a look at the matter for us to see if we were right in thinking that the legislation was deficient.  Mr. Duffy wrote a paper, which I have given to the committee, confirming that the legislation was deficient.  This was largely because of fact that statutory instruments had not been made.  Rather than go back through legislation that was written in the 1990s to try to flesh that out, the better approach is to take the WRC and the Labour Court, which we have today, and devise a procedure which allow disputes to go to the WRC for mediation before they go to the Labour Court.  We noticed, and Mr. Duffy confirmed, that such a procedure is already to be found in the Employees (Provision of Information and Consultation) Act 2006, which allows for a reference to the WRC, then to the Labour Court for a recommendation and then to the Labour Court for a binding decision if the parties have not been able to find a solution between them based on the first two steps.  We think this is the way forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022062200002#A00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Hayes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":297,"content":"<p>Mr. Hayes's time is up.

I am here to discuss the implications of how the Transnational Information and Consultation of Employees Act 1996 and the recast legislation of 2011 were transposed into Irish law.  The Acts are derived from the EU Directive 1994\/45\/EC and the recast Directive 2009\/38\/EC on the establishment of European works councils, EWCs.  The purposes of the directive and Acts were to set in place procedures for multinational companies based in the EU to inform and consult with their employees.  Each EWC that is established is subject to the law of a member state where central management is based, but in cases where the central management is based outside the EU, it can nominate a legal base or member state of its choice.<\/p><p>Prior to Brexit, the UK was a popular destination but since then, more and more companies are using Ireland as their legal base.  In 2019, in the pursuance of a complaint against a multinational entity, SIPTU discovered anomalies within the legislation and in particular the redress pertained in the Act.  SIPTU contacted the then Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and was requested to highlight the issues, which SIPTU did but received no further response from the Department.  This was concerning as SIPTU could see that Ireland was the most likely destination for EWCs after Brexit.  SIPTU engaged with a number of politicians on the matter and it was raised in private questions where the Government stated it believed the legislation was fit for purpose.  SIPTU then wrote to the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, whose response was that the legislation would be reviewed but again nothing was forthcoming.  SIPTU was left with a scenario where it had to write to the Minister requesting that he proceed with the investigation of a multinational company for breaches of the EWC legislation, rather than the employees' representatives concerned utilising Ireland&rsquo;s industrial relations resolution mechanisms.  Further to this, and on behalf of workers in Ireland, SIPTU had no alternative but to make an official complaint to the European Commission on 8 March 2021 about how the Government transposed the EU directive.  The European Commission informed SIPTU that it had sent a letter of formal notice to the Irish Government on 19 May 2022 stating it had initiated an infringement procedure against Ireland on the matter.  <\/p><p> As more multinational companies move their European works council legal bases from the UK to Ireland, it has become clear that the legislation is simply not adequate to deal with the disputes arising from it.  Issues include a dispute resolved within the legal framework and penalties and punishments for breaches.  As the normal State industrial relations resolution mechanisms do not apply here, as with all other worker legislation in Ireland, by submitting a complaint to the relevant Minister under this legislation, it will be heard under criminal law before the District Court.  Herein lies a number of problems.  First, on receipt of application from employee representatives in two member states, the company has six months to begin the process of setting up a EWC and to provide all relevant information concerning the company.  Application of complaint for breaches in the first instance must be made to the Minister, who in practice will send it to the Workplace Relations Commission, which will then appoint the labour inspectorate to investigate the complaint and to decide if a criminal case must be taken.  To date, no cases have been taken to court.  This is the pattern of all complaints made under the legislation,  leading to major delays in the resolution of complaints.  <\/p><p> Second, after an application for an EWC is received, after three years have elapsed since the original application, the company has six months to apply the requirements of the second subsidiary requirements of the legislation for the formation of a EWC.  It may take a further two years for a criminal case to be heard at the District Court so in theory, we are looking at the possibility of no action being taken against the company for failing to provide workers with their rights for up to six years after the original application.  There have been instances recently where requests of the State industrial relations resolution mechanisms and the Workplace Relations Commission to engage with companies for the purposes of resolving and setting up a EWC have been ignored.  <\/p><p> Third, we also understand there is also a particular issue in respect of regulations not being made under section 7 of the Act.  These regulations are required to enable the Minister to appoint arbitrators under sections 20 and 21 of the Act in the not-uncommon event of disputes over confidentiality and application of agreement.  This feeds into what we have learned recently, namely, that the punishments for such breaches are not sufficient to act as a deterrent for potential breaches.  On discussion with several relevant bodies, SIPTU has established that at the District Court, cases currently heard carry a maximum fine of &euro;1,500.  The reality is the company does not have to attend but only to send a representative and there is genuine fear that judges, who have no previous precedent to rely on, will penalise companies in the first instance, with fines ranging from as little as &euro;100 upwards.  This goes against what the European directive states in Recital 35 which states \"The Member States must take appropriate measures in the event of failure to comply with the obligations laid down in this Directive\" and in Recital 36, which states \"In accordance with the general principles of Community law, administrative or judicial procedures, as well as sanctions that are effective, dissuasive and proportionate in relation to the seriousness of the offence, should be applicable in cases of infringement of the obligations arising from this Directive.&rdquo;  Where is the deterrent and pressure to afford workers their legal rights if fines are as little as a &euro;100?  When this is measured against the fines imposed in other EU member states for breaches of the legislation, it is not adequate, as fines imposed in the courts of other EU states range from &euro;15,000 to &euro;50,000.  This makes Ireland an attractive proposition when companies wish to move their EWC legal base.  Irish law speaks about fines not exceeding &euro;1,500 on summary conviction or a maximum of &euro;10,000 on conviction on indictment.  How could the Irish maximum fine be regarded as effective, proportionate, and dissuasive? <\/p><p>In conclusion, these issues not only affect workers in Ireland but all workers in Europe whose company has a EWC with a legal base in Ireland.  SIPTU has at all times requested the legislation be brought in line with the industrial relations resolution mechanisms of Ireland, like all other worker legislation.  For collective disputes, conciliation or mediation should be used in the first instance and when required, sent on to the Labour Court for a binding decision.  We also request that the penalties for breaches are reviewed as SIPTU does not believe the current punishments are fit for purpose. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022062200002#B00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Denis Sheridan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":304,"content":"<p>I thank both our witnesses.

Are these catering to the domestic market or has the UK been chosen as a base for companies operating in other European countries?

It is estimated there are probably around 2,200 companies within the overall scope of the European works council directive.  Of that, about 14,000 already have a European works council.  The reason the others do not is that they have not been asked by their employees to set one up.  The numbers vary.  We estimate there is 200 to 250 American companies that are within scope because of the number of employees they have in Europe.  We think there is approximately 160 UK companies that have a European works council.  The other big numbers can be found in three countries, namely, France, Germany and the Netherlands.  There is a handful of EWCs in Spain, Italy and so on.<\/p> <p>  European works councils have a European focus.  They are not domestically focused.  They are about transnational issues,affecting the whole of the European workforce and not simply the workforce in an individual county.   As I said in my opening remarks, a company is supposed to set up its European works council based on its domestic law - Volkswagen in Germany, and so on.  So in the UK for instance, a company like HSBC or Rolls-Royce would have used UK law.<\/p><p>Such a company cannot use that law any more.  I do not know if, for instance, HSBC, the big bank, has brought any money with it, but it has moved to Ireland.  It is a European rather than a domestic focus.

The directive defines a transnational issue as one that affects two or more countries.  What we see more and more is that, for example, Germany will make a decision as to what happens in Ireland.  That will be a transnational issue because it affects two or more countries.  It is therefore not really a domestic thing; it is about the whole business.

The US multinationals expressed a lot of concern that that was a source of great inflexibility in decision making.  I would be interested to hear the witnesses' views on that.  It sounds like a lot of those big multinationals from the US have changed their attitude to this.  What has been the experience of companies that remained inside and those that remained outside the European works councils in managing issues, in the witnesses' experience?  We know that in these sectors there can be disruptive changes that happen very quickly and that companies feel that if they do not respond, someone else will take over their marketplace very quickly.

European works councils were transposed into Irish law in 1996, when we were coming off the back of a major recession and there was an onus on Ireland to attract multinationals, as the Deputy stated.  However, one of the big things the Government did at that time - and this is why we believe the transposition was done in the way it was done - was go to great lengths to ensure that collective bargaining rights were not given through that legislation.  One of the fears of multinationals coming into Ireland was that this was a means for collective bargaining.  The Government at the time transposed the directive into Irish law, as difficult as it was, to alleviate those fears.  The EWCs are not an industrial relations forum.  Multinationals have seen that.  They are a very good forum for the exchange of views on the business needs of companies.  No industrial relations problems are discussed.  Such discussions are not allowed within the EWC forum.  The directive deals with that and states that EWCs are solely for the purposes of informing and consulting.  A lot of multinationals have seen the benefits of this because a lot of good has come from having central management from around Europe sitting in the room with worker representatives from around Europe discussing business needs and what is happening within businesses.  A lot of good has been done in that regard.  Even though the EWC is not an industrial relations forum, I have witnessed industrial relations problems being solved by EWCs because central management comes into a room with worker representatives and sits down and discusses issues it will have.  Industrial relations problems may arise from that but they are cut off at the pass.  Multinationals that have good EWCs therefore see the benefit of sitting with and talking to their workers, and the workers in turn see the benefits of sitting with and talking to central management and seeing clear pictures.  That is why the whole spectrum has changed.  It is because we can see what is happening and we get a clearer understanding.  Generally, if a decision is going to be made within Europe involving redundancies and closures, the European works council is informed first.  Its representatives get an opportunity to look at the information given to them and to provide an informed response which assists the process such that when each country goes back to its locality, the workers can tell their members what has happened in order that there is a clear understanding.  It is of great benefit to both sides.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022062200002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Denis Sheridan"},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":314,"content":"<p>Do Mr. Hayes or Ms McKeon wish to respond?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022062200002#D00550","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655852400,"counter":315,"content":"<p>I will ask Ms McKeon to respond in a moment.  Very strangely, I agree with Mr. Sheridan.  Deputy Bruton is quite right that I was involved in the drafting of the legislation back in the 1990s and that there was a great deal of apprehension on the part of the American multinational community about it.  People are always frightened of the new and the unknown, but the EWC has turned out to be a considerable communication channel between central management and employee representatives from across Europe.  Both parties have learned how to work with the process, and the type of fear and apprehension that existed 20-odd years ago does not exist any more.  The very fact that I am here today speaking not on behalf of these companies but with a knowledge of the way a lot of them think about these things is proof of that.  If we were still fearful of the legislation, we would not be here asking for change.  We are here asking for change to make the legislation more effective, not less, in order to make sure that the forum for dialogue between employees and their representatives, as put well by Mr. Sheridan, works effectively and that if there are problems - and there always will be problems because that's life - we have an effective way of resolving them.<\/p> <p>  I will anticipate a question about the penalties.  Mr. Sheridan is right that the maximum penalty under Irish law is something like &euro;12,000.  It was &pound;10,000.  Would the business community be overly concerned if that were looked at in light of today's values?  Provided it was a somewhat reasonable figure, I do not see that it would cause a great deal of concern.

We need to step back and ask what the EWC represents.  It represents the employees.

There can be disputes over that and there have been ones over that which have gone to the Central Arbitration Committee, CAC, in the UK.

Take France, for example.  A dispute there between a works council and management could in the first instance go to a <i>conseil de prud'hommes<\/i>, meaning a committee of wise men, which is a sort of tribunal.  If it is not resolved at that level it can then go into a superior court.  To give a concrete example, some years back there was a proposed merger between Gaz de France and Suez, which was another big company.  It was blocked for over four years because of disputes.  In Germany, a dispute will go straight from discussions between the <i>Betriebsrat<\/i>, the works council, and management into a local labour court.  That is more or less the common procedure in many European countries.

We are talking about some of the biggest corporations in the world, with practically limitless resources in terms of legal advice and so on, up against workers who would not be able to avail of similar resources.

In most of the agreements that myself and Mr. Sheridan have been involved with we make provision for expert assistance to an EWC.  As I mentioned earlier, we are particularly concerned that the experts should be real experts who can genuinely assist an EWC in fulfilling its mandate.  Central management provide financial resources to the EWCs to allow for the use of experts.  Most of the companies I work with here in Ireland would have no difficulty whatever were some body such as SIPTU providing those resources and acting as experts to EWCs, helping them to take issues to the Labour Court or to the WRC should those disputes arise.

It was due an upgrade.  On putting models in place, each country can only deal with its own model.  We have to deal with Ireland.  What we do may influence elsewhere but that is all it will do.  We can only deal with Ireland and that is what we will do.<\/p> <p>  On legal expertise, etc., Mr. Hayes is correct.  The Deputy will know, having been in Brussels, everything is legalistic, it is about courts and things like that, whereas the Irish model is very different.  What we are trying to say here today is that while there would be a discrepancy between what the worker representatives could afford because the company was paying for it and what the company might go out and get for itself.  That would be difficult and that is why both sides want to go under the industrial relations mechanisms so you hear directly from the workers what the issues are.  You do not hear legal arguments from barristers and solicitors.  That is the same from the employers side.  This is something new to them that they like.

Many languages are spoken and European work council members are entitled to have the proceedings translated instantaneously into their own languages.  For every language, two interpreters are needed.  Another 15 or 16 people could be involved in interpretation.  European work council meetings bring people in from all over Europe, so they have to be held either in an office building with an adjoining hotel or in a hotel.  People fly in to spend two or three nights in a hotel, so that involves hotel stays, dinners, lunches, and a social event is often built in too.  For example, if people come to Dublin, the Guinness Storehouse is popular, for some reason.  When everything is considered, a European work council meeting might involve 30 people, with 20 interpreters, and a couple of technical support people, so there could easily be 60 people.

They actually get assistance which is provided by the WRC.  It is a cheap method, which is another point that people like.  Deputy Paul Murphy referred to expenses and so on.  The process would be assisted because expenses would be lower in the WRC, since workers could go in with an expert to express their fears and issues.

As I previously stated, not all relationships are good.  There are companies out there that are moving their bases.  They are seeing the legislation in Ireland as a mechanism not to implement.  One of the major factors, as Mr. Hayes said, is that it could cost up to &euro;100,000 a year for a meeting to take place.  Companies come to Ireland and put in the subsidiary requirements.  That means the minimum becomes the maximum whereas previously there were agreements and so on.  They can frustrate the process.  As I said, negotiations with another multinational have been ongoing for five years.  That company has not had to pay out expenses for an EWC for five years.  It has not had to pay for hotels and things like that for five years.  If we follow Mr. Hayes's analogy, that company has saved &euro;500,000 straight off the bat by refusing to enforce workers' rights.  Those companies see it as a benefit that they can do that.<\/p> <p>  As I said earlier, there was a situation whereby a company, on the first day of Brexit, automatically changed its legal base from the UK to Ireland, implemented the subsidiary requirements and refused to engage with the workers because that was all it had to do.

That affected every worker within that company throughout Europe.  Companies are willing to take that risk.  That is not true of all companies.  We have seen some great results and we have great relationships with some companies.  However, that is one of the things that companies look at when considering whether to come to Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Collective bargaining is another aspect of the matter.  Companies also know there are no collective bargaining rights in Ireland.  They know they do not have to engage with the workers.  They are solely coming for the purposes of EWC business, which they can frustrate.  They are not covered by collective bargaining laws in Ireland and so on because we do not have any.

Obviously, I made the observation that he is here not as a representative, as he has said, but in some, way, shape or form representing people who could very easily sustain that figure.  In terms of where the penalty should be set, could we agree for the information of the committee that it has to be sufficient to be persuasive and to act as a deterrent?  We do not have to put a number on it, although there would have to be a maximum or a minimum number set in law.  If we come at it from the point of view of trying to devise that number so that it acts as a deterrent, should that not be the guiding principle, or would the witnesses favour just a flat-out money amount?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022062200002#L02800","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655852400,"counter":433,"content":"<p>I will just clarify in relation to the fines that are currently in place in Ireland.

Mr. Hayes has discussed how the fines range.  Currently, there is another company within the CAC that was fined &euro;45,000.  The minute Brexit happened, it came straight to Ireland and refused to put workers&rsquo; rights in place.  That is what we say in regard to fines, and the directive states there has to be a deterrent.  We need to start on this.

I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.<\/p> <p>  Today, we will engage with the Department of Finance, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to consider tax expenditures.  After some debate and consideration, the committee has agreed to examine three specific tax expenditures almost as a kind of model for how we might look at them in general.  Those expenditures are related to research and development, the knowledge development box and the film credit.  The committee has written to a number of stakeholders inviting written submissions regarding the review of these tax expenditures and, next week, will hear evidence from some of these groups.  Today, the committee will hear from evidence from the main officials and bodies with the remit of these three tax expenditures.<\/p> <p>  On behalf of the committee, I welcome Ms Deirdre Donaghy, head of business tax; Ms Aisling Greene, assistant principal officer, R&amp;D tax credit and KDB tax credit; Ms Ian Kavanagh, assistant principal officer, film tax credit; Mr. Matthew McGann, principal officer; and Mr. Paul Cotter, principal officer, Department of Finance; Mr. Alan Carey, principal officer; and Ms Jacqueline O&rsquo;Callaghan, principal officer, Office of the Revenue Commissioners; and Mr. Dermot Coates, principal officer; and Mr. Felix O&rsquo;Kane, assistant principal officer, Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  I thank each of the witnesses for attending today and for providing information regarding the three tax expenditures in advance to the committee.<\/p> <p>  I call Ms Donaghy to make her opening statement.<\/p><p>On behalf of the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners, I thank the committee for their invitation to come here today to discuss expenditure reviews of the research and development tax credit, the knowledge development box and the section 481 film tax credit.  The Chair has gone through the names but I will mention that Mr. Matthew McGann and Mr. Paul Cotter are from our economics division and they have oversight of the tax expenditure guidelines and also provide the economic analysis elements of tax expenditure reviews.<br\/><br\/>My colleagues from Revenue will be speaking on the detail of the three tax credits in their statement, so I am going to focus on the expenditure review process.  Subsequently, colleagues from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment will provide an opening statement.<br\/><br\/>Tax expenditures represent a reduction in tax revenues which would otherwise accrue to the State, so it is appropriate that they should come under scrutiny to ensure they are fit for purpose.  This scrutiny takes a number of forms, ranging from annual consideration as part of the budget process, to consideration in tax strategy group papers, to full econometric reviews.  The work of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight has also contributed to the process of tax expenditure reviews, and I recall engaging with a number of the current members in this committee's formation under the 32nd D&aacute;il in January 2019.<br\/><br\/>In 2014, the Department developed and published tax expenditure guidelines to set out a best practice approach to the review of tax expenditures.  The guidelines indicate that tax expenditures should be used in limited circumstances of demonstrable market failure and where a tax-based incentive is more efficient than a direct expenditure intervention, and that expenditures should be reviewed regularly.  A proportionate approach to the scope and frequency of <i>ex post<\/i>evaluations is recommended to be guided by the expenditure cost.  For example, it is recommended that a level 1 expenditure, which would be one with an annual cost between &euro;1 million and &euro;10 million, should have a criteria-based review every five years.  Level 2 expenditures with a cost between &euro;10 million and &euro;50 million, which would include the knowledge development box, should be reviewed every five years with an interim review after three years if annual costs exceed &euro;25 million.  Level 3 expenditures costing more than &euro;50 million per annum, which would include the research and development and film tax credits, should be reviewed every three years.  The briefing paper provided to committee members provides an overview of the expenditure review process and the questions to be considered in <i>ex ante<\/i>and <i>ex post<\/i>reviews, and also contains a link to the full tax expenditure guidelines document if further detail is required.<br\/><br\/>Stakeholder engagement is a key element of the review process for all formats of review.  As the body with responsibility for the administration of the tax system, and therefore also having the most comprehensive taxpayer data, the Revenue Commissioners are essential contributors to the review process.  The data, where available and suitably anonymised, can be used to analyse existing expenditures or to model potential new measures.  However, of equal importance are Revenue&rsquo;s operational insights into the tax system, which can inform the design of new measures to ensure they are operable in practice.  In the case of existing reliefs, Revenue may also identify and bring to our attention issues of concern, or unintended consequences arising from legislation, which may require further review.<br\/><br\/>We also engage regularly with other relevant Departments - for example, with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science in respect of the research and development tax credit and the knowledge development box, and with the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media in respect of the film tax credit.  Tax expenditure reviews often also incorporate a public consultation in order to seek views of taxpayers, representative bodies and other interested persons.  Department officials may meet with respondents to discuss their submissions, particularly where detailed technical matters are the subject of consultation.<br\/><br\/>More broadly, the Department is also committed to the regular publication of information on tax expenditures, for the purposes of transparency and to inform contributors who wish to engage with the policymaking process.  For example, each year the Department prepares and publishes a series of papers for the tax strategy group, a group chaired by the Department of Finance with membership comprising senior officials and political advisers from a number of Civil Service Departments and offices.  The papers contain analysis of a range of issues, often including reviews requested by Members of the Oireachtas during finance Bill debates.  A significant volume of analysis is also published each year on budget day, containing analysis of the budget and expenditure measures and economic forecasts.  This includes an annual tax expenditures report, containing an analysis of tax expenditure data, the outcomes of reviews completed since the previous report, and tables of tax expenditure costs across all tax heads.<br\/><br\/>I hope this overview and the briefing paper provided to committee members is of assistance in framing discussion at this meeting.  I am happy to engage with any questions from members, following the remaining opening statements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022062200002#A00200","speaker":"1559","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":460,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Donaghy.

I am joined by my colleague, Ms Jacqueline O&rsquo;Callaghan, who is also a principal officer in the business, taxes, policy and legislation division of the Revenue Commissioners.  I understand from the invitation letter that the committee wishes to discuss matters relating to the following tax expenditures: research and development tax credits, knowledge development box, KDB, and film relief.  I am sure the committee will appreciate Revenue&rsquo;s role in relation to the review and evaluation of tax policy measures.  As the tax administration in the State, Revenue collects taxes and duties.  Through this, Revenue has access to, and is able to provide, statistical information and analysis of tax returns and receipts as well as insights from our compliance activities.  To assist the development and evaluation of tax policy, Revenue publishes information in relation to tax statistics, tax receipts and costings on a dedicated section of the Revenue website.  While it is Revenue&rsquo;s role to provide facts and advice to inform the policymaking process, it would not be appropriate for us to make any comment on policy matters.<\/p> <p>  I will give a brief overview of the three tax reliefs under consideration by the committee, including some high-level statistics in relation to them.  We will be happy to address any questions the committee might have in relation to these topics.  While we will provide whatever assistance we can, the committee will appreciate that Revenue is constrained by law, and specifically by section 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, from discussing the tax affairs of any taxpayer on confidentiality grounds.  This includes providing any information that might lead to the identification of any taxpayer.  <\/p> <p>  The research and development tax credit allows a company to claim a 25% tax credit in respect of expenditure incurred on qualifying research and development activities.  The credit is available in respect of expenses incurred in the carrying on of research and development, as well as on amounts spent on plant and machinery used and on buildings used to house research and development.  The research and development credit is available for offset against a company&rsquo;s corporation tax liability in both the current and preceding accounting periods.  Where there is an excess research and development credit remaining, a company may claim the excess as a payable credit, with 33% of the payable credit available in the first year, and the balance payable over the next two years.  There is a limit on the amount of the payable credit a company can claim, with the limit being determined by reference to the amount of corporation tax paid by the company in the previous ten years or by the amount of payroll taxes paid by the company.  <\/p> <p>  The latest year for which claims and cost figures for the research and development tax credit are available is 2020, when the total cost of the credit was &euro;658 million in respect of 1,616 claims.  In that year, small and medium-sized enterprises accounted for approximately 88%, or 1,420, of the total research and development tax credit claims.  Larger companies dealt with by Revenue&rsquo;s large corporates division, LCD, accounted for 73% of the total value of research and development claims made in 2020.  Companies which claimed these tax credits in 2020 paid &euro;5.6 billion of net corporation tax receipts in that year - that is, net of the research and development credit.  <\/p> <p>  Table 1 sets out the total cost of the research and development credit for each of the years from 2004 to 2020 and the total number of claimant companies in each year.  Table 2 provides a breakdown of the cost and number of research and development tax credit claims between large companies dealt with by LCD and small and medium enterprises which are not dealt with by LCD.  Table 3 provides an overview of the total value of expenditure, in respect of which the research and development credit is claimed, for each of the years from 2012 to 2020, broken down between small and medium enterprises and large enterprises.  In 2020, of the &euro;3.1 billion total value of expenditure on research and development, &euro;2.6 billion was by foreign-owned multinational companies.  Research and development credit expenditure by Irish-owned multinationals was &euro;215 million and non-multinationals accounted for the remaining &euro;293 million. <\/p> <p>  The knowledge development box, KDB, was introduced in Finance Act 2015 and applies for accounting periods commencing between 1 January 2016 and 31 December 2022.<\/p><p>The KDB provides for relief from corporation tax on income arising from qualifying assets such as computer programmes and inventions protected by a qualifying patent or, in respect of smaller companies, other intellectual property that is similar to an invention which could be patented.  A company qualifying for the KDB may claim a deduction equal to 50% of its qualifying profits.  This means that the company&rsquo;s qualifying profits may be taxed at an effective rate of 6.25%.  A company has 24 months to submit a claim for the KDB.  Table 4 provides a breakdown of the overall cost of the KDB for each of the years 2016 to 2020.  Statistics for 2020 are provisional due to the 24-month timeline for making a claim.<\/p><p> Regarding the film tax credit, a tax relief relating to the film industry was first introduced by section 35 of the Finance Act 1987.  Prior to 2015 the scheme operated by giving tax relief to individuals investing in the film industry.  Since 2015 the scheme provides direct support to film producer companies in the form of a corporation tax credit.  Producer companies that meet certain requirements may claim a credit at a rate of 32% in respect of the production costs of a qualifying film.  The credit is available on the lower of: eligible expenditure, 80% of total qualifying film production costs or &euro;70 million.  The maximum value of relief that may be claimed is &euro;22.4 million.  A total of 186 producer companies have received &euro;600 million in respect of film tax credits relating to the making of 592 films.  Table 5 provides a breakdown of the value of claims and the number of projects for each of the years 2015 to 2021.<\/p><p> When the corporation tax credit scheme was first introduced, the Revenue Commissioners administered both the certification and the payment of the credit.  Following amendments in Finance Act 2018, the producer company must apply to the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media for a cultural certificate in advance of commencing the film.  A cultural certificate is a confirmation that the film is a qualifying film for the purposes of the film tax credit.  The credit was moved onto a self-assessment footing from March 2019 to bring applications under section 481 within the normal penalty and prosecution regime where an incorrect claim is made.  Producer companies are required to calculate the value of credit due and make their claims through their corporation tax returns.<\/p><p> In summary, the role of the Revenue Commissioners in the review of tax expenditures is primarily to support the process through the provision of statistical information and insights gathered as part of our administration of taxes.<\/p><p> We will answer any questions from members of the committee on these issues, subject to the constraints I noted in my opening comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022062200002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alan Carey","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655852400,"counter":463,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to participate in this meeting of the committee.  I am chief economist in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and I am accompanied by my colleague, Mr. Felix O&rsquo;Kane, professional accountant in our economic and tax policy unit.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the matters under consideration today, it is important to note that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is not involved in determining which tax expenditures will be selected for review in a given year.  My understanding is that the Department of Finance generally follows guidelines as laid out in the guidelines for tax expenditure evaluation which were published in 2014.  While the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has an interest in the tax expenditures on which we are concentrating today, in addition to a number of other similar tax incentives, it does not have a role in deciding which expenditures should be reviewed or when those reviews should take place.<\/p> <p>  Officials from the tax policy unit in our Department tend to engage regularly with officials from the various taxation areas within the Department of Finance.  Each year our Department prepares a pre-budget submission which proposes options for adjustments to aspects of the tax system, including tax expenditures, often in the form of proposals for amendments to existing legislation aimed at enhancing the taxation landscape for enterprises.  This document is the Department&rsquo;s primary means of communicating enterprise tax proposals to the Department and Minister for Finance.  In the event that a tax expenditure review has been decided on by the Minister for Finance, officials may discuss aspects of the review, for example, timelines would frequently come up for discussion, but these discussions tend not to guide the focus of the review.<\/p> <p>  With regard to tax expenditures more generally, it is useful to point out that many such expenditures can also be considered as tax incentives.  There is little doubt that from an enterprise perspective, tax incentives can bring about many positives.  Indeed, the OECD states that the tax regime is a key policy instrument that may negatively or positively influence investment and the achievement of wider policy goals.  While our Department is supportive of ongoing and timely reviews of tax incentives, it is important that the members of the committee appreciate that measurement of the revenue forgone relating to a specific incentive is unlikely to provide a complete picture of the impacts of that incentive.  Benefits resulting from the changes in behaviour which incentives drive are extremely challenging to assess and cost-benefit analyses should be used where possible, but even these will have limitations.  It is often the case, therefore, that evidence must be generated from a wider variety of sources than would ideally be the case.<\/p> <p>  Looking at the research and development tax credit, for example, establishing the counterfactual position around innovation investment in the absence of the incentive would be very challenging, so we must seek other evidence.  In the case of this tax credit, it is instructive to see that similar innovation incentives are offered by 25 of our fellow EU member states.  Recent contributions to the ongoing review of the research and development tax credit also reinforced the importance of the credit in incentivising activity in Ireland.  For example, a KPMG survey found that 74% of respondents would markedly decrease activity in Ireland in the absence of the incentive.  Similarly, the American Chamber of Commerce reported member feedback indicating that in the absence of the credit, there would be a significant reduction in the proportion of research and development activities taking place in Ireland.  These contributions back up findings from the 2016 review of the credit by the Department of Finance which found that 60% of research and development activity conducted by firms since 2009 was additional research and development activity which would not have occurred in the absence of the tax credit.<\/p> <p>  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment believes that to best support enterprise to achieve its potential, a mix of direct expenditures and tax incentives will work best.  There are instances where each method of support is more appropriate.  Some of the advantages of tax-based supports are that they tend to require a lower degree of administration, they are more generally accessible and they are more flexible than direct supports in that they allow the taxpayer to largely determine the nature of the expenditure within defined legislative parameters.  These benefits lend themselves to innovative activities, in particular where the prescriptive nature of direct subsidies can inhibit progress in fast-moving sectors of the economy.<\/p> <p>  In conclusion, while the Department has no role in the selection of tax expenditures for review, it does feed into the review process on an ongoing basis via our interactions with Department of Finance officials and our engagement in the budgetary process.  The Department is supportive of regular review of these expenditures and acknowledges the presence of the expenditure review guidelines and adherence to them as being an important advance which provides protection for the Exchequer and ultimately the taxpayer.  Regular reviews present opportunities to examine the effectiveness of incentives and make changes if they are not achieving their desired policy objective.<\/p> <p>  We look forward to participating in the discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022062200002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Dermot Coates"},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":464,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for appearing before an coiste and for the three presentations.  I will start with the research and development tax credit, the larger of the three being discussed.

The figures for 2020 show that 84% of the &euro;3.1 billion in expenditure in respect of which the tax credit was claimed was by foreign-owned multinationals.  Committee members will know that since 2018 and over the following years I have been calling for an increased rate of 30% to be made available to small and micro companies under the research and development tax credit.  In fairness, the Minister took up this proposal in the Finance Act 2019, but it has not been implemented due to the communications his Department has received from the European Commission with regard to state aid.<\/p> <p>  Can the witnesses clarify the specific issues which resulted in this measure, the increase of the research and development tax credit rate from 25% to 30% for small and micro companies, not being progressed and being dropped?

We did a review in that year specifically looking at aspects of small companies and how we could try to incentivise that.  A number of measures were introduced.  It was intended they would operate by having the existing research and development tax credit which is available to everybody and gives a rate of 25%.  Micro- or small-enterprises would be able to top that up by an extra 5% in order to get an overall rate of 30%.  As that element would be targeted it would have to get state aid approval because it would be a targeted aid.  When we began discussions with the Commission on that we looked at the various ways in which it could be introduced under the various approvals processes that exist.  Essentially in order to approve it we would have to make slight changes to the definitions, for example, the definition of what qualifies as research and development or to the reporting procedures that would apply and to how it is declared and reported as an aid.  The difficulty created there was that, for example, if you were doing &euro;100 worth of research and development in order to get a credit of &euro;25, you would have one sets of rules applying to it, and to get the next &euro;5 credit there would be slightly different rules.  That would mean that some of the &euro;100 might not qualify and then again something else that did not qualify for the main &euro;25 credit could potentially have qualified for the &euro;5.  They did not match up.  We were talking about small and micro companies and some of the biggest issues they consistently raise with claiming the credit in the first place is that there is an administrative burden to it and they have a difficulty in understanding and following the criteria and having the right documentation to prove it and meet the science tests.  If we then brought in a system where one set of rules applies to the first 25% of the credit and slightly different rules for the next 5% that would have been overly complicated and we did not think it would be practical to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022062200002#D00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Deirdre Donaghy"},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":466,"content":"<p>The principle of having an enhanced tax credit for small and micro businesses was not an issue for the Commission.

To be honest, the main difficulty and why it has not progressed is that Covid-19 intervened.  There was then a significant diversion of resources by both ourselves and Revenue to Covid-19 measures.  We are hopefully coming out of that now and can come back to this.  We are doing the review again this year and while there are other policy objectives we have to address this year as well, we are coming back to the idea of looking at what can we possibly do.  We have one potential difficulty in the avenue suggested by the Deputy which was to separate it out.  We then need to look at what happens with the main tax credit.  If you separate it out and just have it for the uplift it becomes a 5% credit.  That is probably too much of an administrative burden for just 5%.

Many SMEs do not have access to the large accountancy firms.  It is acknowledged that the process in Britain and in the North is much simpler and less risky for SMEs.  The Department commissioned the OECD in 2019 to do a report on SMEs and entrepreneurship policy in Ireland.  Part of that stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe cost of preparing, filing and defending a claim is too high.  The criteria for making claims, recording and justifying claims and so on as laid down by Revenue are onerous for SMEs &ndash; the rules appear to have been designed with large established R&amp;amp;D intensive (e.g. pharmaceutical) companies in mind, where development processes are very detailed and structured.  In contrast, the rules are not a good fit with, for example, new, agile software development companies, where processes are fluid and fast and documentation is less necessary. <\/blockquote> <p>Helpfully, it went on to make three proposals, namely, to simplify the approval procedure for research and development tax credits to facilitate the participation of SMEs in this initiative; to introduce a pre-approval procedure of research and development tax credits to help reduce uncertainty for SMEs - in Norway, for example, there is list of things that are likely to get approval; and to maintain the research and development tax credits while trying to increase their update by smaller enterprise by design change and awareness raising.  <\/p><p>That was commissioned in 2019 from the OECD.

On simplifying the approval, pre-approval and design changes, the thing to consider with that is that if you do things like pre-approval and design changes, they will help to a certain extent.

When it comes to trying to raise awareness or to assist, in particular smaller firms to claim credits, both ourselves and the Revenue Commissioners work on that to try to engage.  There are industry representative bodies which represent all research and development active firms.  It is not just the big four but specifically research and development bodies.  They will have annual conferences at which ourselves and Revenue give presentations and give the context in order to try to build the awareness of it and where to find further information about it.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the administration of it, my colleague, Ms O'Callaghan, from Revenue might have more information on it.

When the numbers come down so low, they are prevented from going into details that would identify.  The numbers are low but not unexpectedly low on the knowledge development box because it is quite a restricted relief.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the future changes, R&amp;D and the knowledge development box are both potentially being affected, particularly by pillar 2, which is the minimum effective tax rate.  The changes to GILTI are obviously tied in with that as well.  Under pillar 2, a country has to calculate a minimum effective rate of 15% based on the global anti-base erosion, or GloBE, base.  The question is that if someone has a tax credit, is that something that reduces their effective rate or is it not?  All of the countries involved recognise the value of R&amp;D and recognise it is something they want to be supported.  Provided it meets the definition of what they called a qualifying refundable tax credit, it is not treated as reducing someone&rsquo;s effective tax rate.  The idea is that if someone has something that is not a qualified credit, the credit is treated as basically reducing the tax they have paid, which reduces their effective rate, which makes it more likely they have to pay a top-up, whereas if they have a qualifying tax credit, it is treated instead as income.  It effectively comes in almost above the line, in a way.  Instead of saying that someone has &euro;100 in income and they paid &euro;12 in tax and got &euro;5 in tax credit, it means they only paid &euro;7 in tax.  That would be the non-qualifying version.  The qualifying version would be that they had their &euro;100 in income, they paid their &euro;12 in tax and, with the &euro;5 offset of the tax credit, the way it is treated is that they still paid &euro;12 in tax but they had &euro;105 in income.  Therefore, it increases their income and, effectively, they will have to pay the 15% on that, but it preserves the majority of the value of it.<\/p> <p>  There is a definition in those rules of what a qualifying refundable tax credit is.  Our R&amp;D tax credit is very close to that.  It is possible there may need to be some small changes to it but that is something we are looking at this year in the context of the review.<\/p> <p>  For the knowledge development box, it is a different element of pillar 2 that might affect that.  Outside of the GloBE rules, there is a separate element called the subject to tax rule.  This is where a jurisdiction has any element of its tax system that provides an effective tax rate of less than 9%.  Because the knowledge development box effectively allows a tax rate of 6.25%, because what it does is halve the income and it then taxes that-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022062200002#E01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Deirdre Donaghy"},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":493,"content":"<p>It halves it, yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022062200002#F00100","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655852400,"counter":494,"content":"<p>Yes, and then it taxes you, so effectively it gives you 6.25%.

There are two separate parts of who is engaging.  If you have the smaller companies there is certainly more of a financial pressure on them to try to do research and development because with research and development, in order to meet the definitions that are there, you have to be trying to resolve an uncertainty, so there is no guarantee anything beneficial for your business will come out of it.  It is a much higher risk than investing your business's money in something you know for sure will deliver a return, albeit possibly a smaller return than if your research and development works out for you.<\/p> <p>  When it comes to the larger companies, what the Deputy needs to consider is whether there be a market failure in Ireland without the credit.  What we consistently hear from all the companies that engage with us is some of the biggest competition they face in trying to locate research and development projects here is from other arms of the same firm in other jurisdictions because there will always be a lot of competition to get the research and development located in any jurisdiction.  The reason people want it to be there is it brings a lot more with it.  If you locate your research and development here it is more likely you will have manufacturing processes associated with it, for example, or that you will build other functions around it because whatever the outcome of it is, you need to manage it, develop it and protect in the long run.  The very strong reports we get back when we do consultations on this is that in the absence of the research and development tax credit there would be a significant market failure in Ireland of research and development.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022062200002#F00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Deirdre Donaghy"},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":502,"content":"<p>Okay, but it is primarily going to those big multinational companies.

As part of the review process, we will ask stakeholders to tell us - to essentially defend why we need to have this credit.  When it comes to putting money into the universities, the straightforward thing is if we have &euro;600 million, for example, which is the cost of the credit, then we can spend &euro;600 million as a State to get &euro;600 million worth of work done or we can do &euro;600 million of a tax credit which incentivises &euro;2.4 billion in work to be done because we provide &euro;1 in &euro;4 of that.  We do as much as we can to ensure the research and development credit builds those links with the third level institutions and has the spillover effects.  It is one of the things we are trying to examine and get more information on in this year's review.  From an economics point of view, you can take the numbers and the tax forgone and how much research is done, which are the things that are quantifiable and easy to review.  It is much more difficult to try to determine those kind of spillovers but we are asking and if nothing else we will have reported our outcomes.<\/p> <p>  There are many things happening with the universities in terms of college courses being developed specifically around the types of research and development that are happening here, both in pharma and software, and internships that are sponsored from one to the other.

One of the things the PBO, in looking at all this, is saying, and I am in agreement, is we are not having a proper evaluation on a regular enough basis of these things and hearing from stakeholders as to the arguments and pros and cons of this.  I do not think we are.  Ms Donaghy can put that case and I am sure people will put that case but then I think of the fact that educational counselling and psychology are not funded for people to do doctorates, yet we have a chronic shortage of psychologists to do assessments for children.  I want to hear that discussion on evaluating if this is the best expenditure of public money in the area of encouraging research, advancing research, and so on.  We are not getting that level of scrutiny, oversight and hearing from the different stakeholders so we can make a proper evaluation.  We should find ways to have that discussion with all those stakeholders in a more structured way.<\/p><p>We have discussed the film tax credit many times.  According to the EU, state aid to film must meet two tests, namely, the industry development test and the culture test.  The industry development test is worth reading out.  It states there will be:<\/p> <blockquote> \t... [an] aim to generate the critical mass of activity that is required to create the dynamic for the development and consolidation of the industry through the creation of soundly based production undertakings and the development of a permanent pool of human skills and experience. <\/blockquote> <p>Then there is &quot;... the primary cultural aim of ensuring that the national and regional cultures and creative potential are expressed in the audiovisual media of film and television&quot;.  How are we evaluating that?  I believe we are not doing so at all, to be honest.  Margrethe Vestager, as the Commissioner with responsibility for state aid, wrote to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, in 2019 to express concerns about whether we were meeting the cultural test.  There are very serious question marks.  It is interesting that on foot of that that this year an Irish film won a load of awards at the Irish Film and Television Awards.  I do not think that was a coincidence.<\/p><p>I am sure it was deserved, but it was very interesting because it was the first time it had happened for yonks .  In my view, that was because it was being called out on it.<\/p><p> How are we evaluating this?  I would be interested to know if anyone has ever been refused section 481 support on the grounds of not meeting the culture test.  Has anybody ever been refused on the grounds of not meeting the industry development test?  One of the biggest recipients of section 481 support is producing &ldquo;Vikings: Valhalla&rdquo;, which is being shot in Wicklow at the moment.  It was reported in the newspapers recently that: \"A note attached to the accounts states that the majority of workers employed are contract workers.\"  This raises serious questions about the industry development test.  If the majority of people working on a production for one of the biggest - if not the biggest - recipients of section 481 tax relief year in, year out, are contractors rather than individuals who have an employment relationship with the recipient, that is a big problem.  In the context of any reasonable understanding of the EU rules around this test, that clearly does not meet the industry development test.  It is not creating a permanent pool of skills, and it involves using a load of contractors who have no employment relationship whatsoever with the recipient of the relief.  That relief is given specifically on the grounds of creating quality employment and training, and creating a permanent pool of skills.  How are we checking this?  It appears to me that we are not.  We are listening to the producers who get the relief and they are saying that it is brilliant.  Of course they are saying it is brilliant because they are getting the relief and benefiting from it.<\/p><p> Previously, this criticism was coming from people who were employed on construction crews, stage crews, etc.  I do not know if our witnesses have had a chance to read the Equity submission.  Equity raises some very interesting questions and expresses concerns about section 481.  Equity, the film workers who have expressed deep concerns and I all want to see money going in to create an industry.  However, Equity has asked some serious questions.  It states that the risks regarding the way in which it is done at the moment relate to: excluding new and emerging independent producers and having a large amount of industry power concentrated within a small group of players; the potential abuse of the tax credit through a range of practices, including internal pricing and artificially depressed income strategies; and the flaunting of national and international copyright legislation. This latter concern relates to the question of residuals and royalties.  Nearly all of the major recipients of section 481 relief in this country tell people who want to work in film productions that in order to get jobs, they have to sign up to buy-out contracts where they sign away all of their royalties and residuals.  Their counterparts in Britain are not asked to do that.  This is absolutely outrageous.  Residuals are one of the major ways whereby artists and performers who are in very precarious situations might get a little bit of money back over the years from a film that continues to be shown again and again.  The recipients of section 481 in this country are insisting that most performers and artists must sign away their rights to the particular production in question.<\/p><p> This also raises a very interesting question as to whom those rights are being assigned?  Who then gets the royalties over the years?  Is it the DAC that disappears after 12 months following the end of the production?  This is the mushroom-like nature of the DAC.  Where employees have grievances and go to the WRC and raise issues relating to their employment on a production or in respect of instances where they may have been wrongfully dismissed or badly treated, the film production company, which receives the money on the basis of developing the industry, quality employment and training, goes before the WRC and the Labour Court again and again and states that not only is the relevant person not its employee but also that the structure of section 481 means he or she could never be an employee of the company.  The employer is the DAC and the DAC is gone.  As a result, nobody is accountable for how a person is treated on a particular film production.  I do not even know the answer to the question as to what happens to the royalties and residuals because they are not going to the performers.  Where are they going?  I presume they are going to the production company, which has always existed and which is the recipient of section 481 relief.  This is the company that has managed to disown responsibility for everybody who has worked on the film production and got all of them to sign away their rights to further royalties.  When are we going to start looking seriously at these things?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022062200002#F01200","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":506,"content":"<p>Do I have any takers as to who would like to-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022062200002#G00200","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655852400,"counter":507,"content":"<p>I have a list that I could start with.  I may have probably missed some of the questions along the way.  In that context, I ask the Deputy to feel free to ask me again if I do not answer any of the questions.<\/p> <p>  I could not say if anyone has been refused a culture certificate because that is dealt with the by the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.  The application goes to the Department, which then carries out the assessment.  I know that officials from the Department have appeared before various committees to discuss this matter previously.  The Department will be able to give the committee any data specifically around that.<\/p> <p>  When it comes to the issue of quality employment, it is one which we have discussed with the committee on many occasions over the years and we have been paying attention to the issues.  We do not just listen to Screen Producers Ireland.  In fact, it complains that we do not listen to its members enough.  We have met with employee representative groups also and deal a great deal with Screen Ireland, which is the official body.  There have been many changes over the past three or four years in order to try to ensure that we are substantiating that in the screen development aspect of it.<\/p> <p>  I know that the committee has received a submission from Screen Ireland that gives some of the detail around that but, essentially, back in 2019, the skills development aspect of it was much less well developed.  It went around a system that for every X amount of credit you claimed, you had to have Y amount of interns or trainees.  Queries were raised - and they were fair ones - as to how we ensure that someone will not be an intern or a trainee forever, that there is proper development and that people can make actually make progress through the industry.  From 2019 onward, Screen Ireland has been progressively developing an entirely new process for that and is now focusing on skills development.  It is not just interns or trainees; Screen Ireland is looking at skills development at every level.  It is not just about getting a trainee in; it is also about getting a mid-level unit manager and training him or her up to be a head of unit.  This is happening at all levels to show that the company involved is actually developing somebody&rsquo;s career as it goes along.<\/p> <p>  When we split the credit in 2019, one of the benefits of that was that the application has to go in for the culture test before the application with the financial details goes through to Revenue, which can be further along in the process.  One has to engage upfront on one skills&rsquo; development plan with Screen Ireland and with the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.  That is staggered because the bigger the production, the more you have to engage and the more detail you have to provide.  In the case of a larger production, there is a compliance stage at the end of the production to ensure that this is signed off and that the company has met the criteria.  The Department has sent through details to say that since April 2019, over 140 skills development plans have been submitted to Screen Ireland for approval and more than 1,500 skills participants have been tracked through those productions.<\/p> <p>  On a regional basis, because we also have a focus on trying to move those talent pools out of Dublin and Wicklow and around the country in a more broad way, we have the regional spend uplift.<\/p><p>If you are applying for the regional uplift, there have to be additional skills development participants for that to show that you are developing the talents in those areas.  Since April 2019, Screen Ireland has had over 45 regional skills development plans, over 500 participants have been tracked and it is continuing to move forward.  It has engagement now on higher and further education and training.  There are new Springboard and traineeship programmes at institutions like the Technological University of the Shannon, the Atlantic Technological University and Limerick and Clare Education and Training Board and Screen Ireland is establishing five new talent academies across Ireland, in Wicklow, Limerick and Dublin and two in Galway.  It is moving so far forward in that respect that it is the first to link this type of structured skills training to the film tax credit and other jurisdictions are now coming in to learn from Screen Ireland about what it is doing.  The latest innovation being introduced towards the end of this year is a new digital skills tracking system, so there should be more transparency and accountability about what is there.

If these are policy initiatives, that is a surprising figure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022062200002#K01300","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655852400,"counter":572,"content":"<p>It will be seen that there are sunset clauses in the more recent ones.

They were good and rational policy incentives to begin with and if they had ended five years before they did, we would all have been a lot better off.  Therefore, the lesson learned from that experience, and that came out of that period, was that if we were to bring in something new, that it should have a sunset clause.  That would ensure that a review was triggered to make us look at the measure.  It would also ensure that we were not in a position where such measures could just passively keep going.  If a policy decision were made to continue the measure, that would require a legislative amendment.  It will be seen that there are sunset clauses in the measures that have come in since then, from about 2012 to 2015 onwards.

If, say, they get a certificate in 2022, they have to go back and amend their corporation tax return for a previous year.  I might use an example to clarify this.  To a 31 December year-end, if a company wants to claim relief on a certificate in 2022, the previous tax return, for 2021, can be amended depending on the stage of the year.  This is assuming that the specified return date for the corporation tax return has passed, which for December year end would be September 2022.<\/p><p> If it has not passed, however, and if the company wants to make the claim in June, it would go back to the 2020 return.

I seriously recommend that this is just not allowed.  If people say they are not participating, they are the ones who should be penalised.

The information is deliberately presented in a clear and accessible way to ensure that everyone, not just those with financial expertise, can fully understand how public money is being used.  The public service performance report, therefore, serves as a key tool for Oireachtas committees in their engagement with Departments.  It contains a wealth of information, provided by all Departments, which clearly outlines each Department&rsquo;s goals, key outputs and key impacts, giving a very succinct account of the Department&rsquo;s activity and achievements.  The report builds on the existing elements of the performance-based budgeting initiative and creates a space in the budget process for performance dialogue.<\/p> <p>  While performance information is provided alongside financial information in the Revised Estimates Volume, REV, in December, outturn information for the current year cannot be provided due to the timing of REV publication.  This means that committees may not have the relevant information to allow them to assess performance for the most recent year in a timely fashion.  The performance report addresses this by providing timely, quantitative information on what was delivered with public funds in the previous year.  This creates an opportunity for meaningful dialogue between Ministers or Departments and the relevant sectoral committees on Government performance.  The information provided in the report will assist the relevant sectoral committees in tracking progress in relation to the outputs and outcomes of key governmental strategies.<\/p> <p>  The Committee on Budgetary Oversight&rsquo;s final report on the framework for parliamentary engagement proposes that sectoral committees meet to consider the chapters of the performance report relevant to their areas of oversight.<\/p><p>The performance report is designed to support such an enhanced focus on performance and delivery by committees.  This approach also seeks to enable sectoral committees to make best use of the time available for reviewing performance and achievement by Departments and agencies.  The performance report is just one element of a suite of measures to increase evidence-based decision-making, such as the spending review process, the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, IGEES, network and the public spending code.  Updates on equality and green budgeting, which are both integrated into the performance budgeting framework, are also included in the report.  The equality budgeting pilot was implemented in 2018 and it brings a new focus to performance budgeting while looking at equality dimensions such as gender, socioeconomic inequality, disability and minority groups.  Following a Government decision in 2021 to accelerate the implementation of performance budgeting, all Departments now participate in equality budgeting and report equality metrics in both Revised Estimates Volume, REV, and the performance report.  In 2019, Ireland joined the OECD Paris Collaborative on Green Budgeting and committed to the progressive implementation of reforms to the budgetary process to better embed climate and environmental goals within it.  With the advent of the ambitious climate targets in the programme for Government commitments and their incorporation into legislation via the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021, this need grows ever more pressing.  An update on this work is also included.  <\/p><p> An ambitious work plan for performance budgeting policy is in place for the coming year, which aims to continue the momentum achieved to date and further advance this work.  Work is currently under way to improve the tagging and expenditure to equality, green, well-being and sustainable development goals, SDG, dimensions.  The performance budgeting framework is kept under constant review to ensure it best serves the purpose of increasing transparency and accountability.  Feedback from stakeholders is an essential part of this and the Department would particularly value feedback from this committee.<\/p><p> It is clear from the Committee on Budgetary Oversight's final report that the performance report is a source of information that can be further utilised by the sectoral committees in their engagement with Ministers and their Departments.  Such engagement would, in principle, allow the sectoral committees to consider, with the relevant line Departments, any issues regarding performance against target, with the specific indicators selected for inclusion in the report.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for including this document on its agenda and look forward to hearing the members' feedback.  Engagement with committees in relation to the overall format of the report, and its positioning within the budgetary cycle, is very important to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform as we continue our work in enhancing the overall performance budgeting framework and the performance report in particular.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022062200002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Caroline O'Loughlin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":670,"content":"<p>I thank Ms O'Loughlin and compliment her on the production of the report.

The whole report was a very important initiative in its own right in improving how we match spending inputs to performance outputs.  It has certainly helped to narrow a gap in oversight, which is welcome.  I note from today, and also from the previous committee, that the Department is always looking to improve.  The Committee on Budgetary Oversight was mentioned as were reforms made which were based on improvements recommended by members.<\/p> <p>  I want to raise a couple of areas which could potentially be improved and to get Ms O'Loughlin's thoughts, if possible.  These generally relate to procurement.  As we know, we are big spenders on procurement - approximately &euro;17 billion annually - and we have new initiatives like green public procurement and promoting social considerations in public procurement.  What I have noticed since being elected is that we do not have as much information on this big area of spend as I believe is needed and it would be good to analyse it.  The Office of Government Procurement publishes its spend and tendering analysis report, although the report published last year related to 2018, so there is a lag there.  If we had annual up-to-date information on procurement spending of the kind reported in spend and tendering analysis report, could that be incorporated into the public service performance report?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022062200002#B00300","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655852400,"counter":672,"content":"<p>It is certainly something I will look into.  The Deputy should be aware the Department is currently conducting a project funded by the EU under the state register of statistical units, SRSU, project.  What it aims to do is to enhance our performance budgetary framework as a whole.  That encapsulates performance budgeting and all of the dimensions underneath that which include green budgeting, well-being budgeting, socioeconomic group, SEG, and equality budgeting.  We are at the pilot stage of that project.  Three Departments are doing pilot exercises on how they can tag their expenditure against those dimensions.  That is something we would hope to see being fully implemented in the next 12 to 18 months as that project is finalised.  That would certainly give an enhanced tagging ability for expenditure.  Mr. Hearne may be able to expand on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022062200002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Caroline O'Loughlin"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655852400,"counter":673,"content":"<p>The Deputy's point is well made.  One of the strengths we have in this regard is that so much of our procurement is now done digitally and through eTenders and the wider European portals for major tender awards.  That tells us that there is information available and there could well be more real time information.  There is probably some limitation in relation to the publication of contracts pre-things like the expiration of the standstill periods and so forth, but they should not really pose a barrier to how we would be able to report in a more timely fashion.  It will be complemented by the project my colleague talked about in relation to the tagging but we will take it away and speak to our colleagues in the Office of Public Procurement about how we can make a richer source of information available and one that is more up-to-date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022062200002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ed Hearne"},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":674,"content":"<p>That is very interesting.  Another thing that caught my attention was in the slides received earlier.  One of the core principles at the heart of performance budgeting is that it can provide greater transparency and accountability and improvements in these areas and can help to bring better management of public funds, essentially greater value for money.  The revised national development plan, NDP, outlines spending on capital projects to the tune of &euro;165 billion.  Due to the rise in costs of inflation and increasing costs of construction materials, we have seen the launch of the new inflation co-operation framework so the State will bear up to 70% of additional costs arising from such inflation.  In terms of a more medium-term measure, this will mean that the &euro;165 billion might not go as far as planned.  I am not sure if it was this committee or the other committee but concerns were raised in relation to that.  Given that information on cost overruns and capital projects is not collected centrally or published in reports like this one, is this something that could be incorporated if such data was collected?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022062200002#B00600","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655852400,"counter":675,"content":"<p>In principle, better information about the performance of capital programmes and projects can certainly be incorporated here.  One of the differences is that we have much greater scrutiny of capital projects and a more established system of appraisal before projects are committed to.  There is a wealth of information about the requirements for appraisal, the public spending code and arrangements for scrutiny of major projects.  We can probably do more to incorporate that.  Something we have looked at as part of green budgeting is to do more<i>ex ante<\/i>appraisals of projects and in the climate area, much of the expenditure is capital so we will automatically be bringing in more of a crossover with the reporting under the national development plan.  That is something that can be looked at.<br\/><br\/>I make the point that the actual performance on overruns - the average level of overruns - is often overstated.  We have seen a couple of high profile examples of major complex bespoke projects that have gone over but, on average, we have gotten much better at this in this country and typically major programmes in a number of sectors come in on time and on budget.  In particular, there was some very good analysis done by Transport Infrastructure Ireland some years ago to show the level of success in major roads infrastructure.  Similarly, as we have developed the level of commercial capacity, and professionalism in other agencies - for example, Irish Water - we have seen, on average, a much greater level of performance there as well.<\/p><p>As we roll out the tagging project, which Ms O'Loughlin has mentioned, and as we see more of an overlap between what is in the national development plan and what is counted as green budgeting, that will definitely provide more insight.  Certainly we can provide more granular reporting on that at a major project level as part of this report. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022062200002#B00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ed Hearne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":677,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Hearne.

I might come back in later as I am going through the hard copy of the full report.  I have produced legislation and engaged with officials in the Department on quality public procurement.  The use of price quality approaches means that rather than going with the lowest price that meets the technical specifications, emphasis is placed on a price quality ratio.  This is done successfully in other countries.  One of the key issues that has arisen is how quality is measured.  That almost comes to the same issue that is being examined in the budget.  As we move towards a well-being budget and other indicators, there is a need to find appropriate measures to indicate quality.<\/p> <p>  I wish to note that project overruns have been mentioned.  When a decision was being made on awarding the tender for the national children's hospital, which is a high-profile project, a 25% weighting was given to quality whereas a 75% weighting was given to price.  I have pushed for major projects to have a weighting of 50%, at least, for quality.  I am interested in hearing more about how that procurement issue is being examined.  Specifically, I want to hear about how some of the performance report indicators that have been created as part of the performance report could be useful in developing quality indicators in contracts for public services.<\/p> <p>  My query on green budgeting also ties into green procurement.  I am interested in the witnesses' views on how we can do more to ensure we have shadow budgeting on carbon budgeting within projects, particularly concerning scope 1, scope 2 and scope 3 emissions.  We need to include emissions that are in the supply chain as well as those that are in the ground.  I want to learn how that should and could be better factored into budgeting and procurement.  This is really relevant, particularly for the next couple of years, because the front-loading of action is key.  As well as looking to environmental projects, I am interested in the hearing from the witnesses on how we can do better to proof other projects around their impacts.  For example, are there things that we cannot afford to do in a particular year because our emissions are too high and they would add too much to our national targets?<\/p> <p>  I am extremely interested in equality budgeting.  I am glad to see it has featured properly in the performance report.  I feel like it had momentum before it seemed to get a little sidetracked into piloting.  What is the next stage for equality budgeting?  Is it happening across all Departments?  I have read the examples that were tagged in the report.  A few of them are specific, positive measures that promote equality.  In the performance review, how can we improve the equality proofing of general decisions?  I am not simply referring to specific measures to promote equality for specific groups?  If we have a new taxation policy, for example, will we examine its impact on equality?  Is a new area of public service, such as a new area of transport expenditure, gender-proofed and gender-analysed?  I am asking about the actual proofing of general budgetary decisions, separate from specific projects.<\/p> <p>  I ask the witnesses to explain more about two aspects of the section on equality budgeting.  How quickly will the well-being budget framework be established?  Will we begin to see that in budget 2024 or has it begun to trickle through?<\/p> <p>  Lastly, on the sustainable development goals, I noticed a little bit of tagging in the report.  Again, that seemed to be in the equality section.  Perhaps the witnesses will comment on how the sustainable development goals might be integrated into the budgetary cycle and how that might fit with the well-being framework.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022062200002#C00300","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655852400,"counter":679,"content":"<p>I will respond to the Senator's questions on procurement, environmental impacts and so forth, and Ms O'Loughlin will comment on equality.  I will not go too much into procurement policy because it is not what we are here to report on.  I take the points made by the Senator about the scope within procurement to take account of factors that go beyond cost.  There is plenty of scope in the European procurement directives, to which we are obviously bound.<\/p> <p>  The Senator mentioned green procurement.  My colleagues in the Office of Government Procurement have worked on that.  They have seen how we can bring in broader considerations about the sustainability of procurement within things like overall award criteria and so forth.  It is obviously a very tricky environment in which to work because it is so characterised by legal challenge and bound up in European directives, but there is scope there.  I know that my colleagues on that side of the house are actively working on this matter.<\/p> <p>  Senator Higgins asked a number of questions and made a number of comments on how to better account for the climate impact of individual spending decisions.  That is particularly relevant in capital.  We are doing a number of things.  In the run-up to the national development plan, which the Government published last year, a climate assessment of every spending measure was set out.  That was a big step forward and was not something that we had done before.  To the best of our knowledge, it is not something that had been done on such a comprehensive whole-of-government basis elsewhere, certainly not across the EU.  As part of that analysis, we looked at the likely climate impact of each measure across seven dimensions: climate mitigation; climate adaption; air quality; water quality; nature and biodiversity; waste and the circular economy; and the impact of the programme on just transition.  It was a step forward for us to have that assessment, at least, and to have information to enable us to rank programmes alongside each other as a base point from which to build on into the future.  That is at the programme level.<\/p> <p>  At the overall project level, work is advancing within the Department that will capture some of the points the Senator made about measuring the climate impact of a project throughout the supply chain.  Members will probably have heard about the public spending code, which is the process by which we appraise and evaluate projects, and then manage and implement projects throughout the life cycle.  We are engaging with the OECD to embed climate action considerations within the public spending code.  We will finish that work just after Christmas or early in 2023.  The initiative will do two things; first, it will measure how we capture the embedded carbon emissions within a project.  For instance, when concrete is used for a project like a cycle lane, that has associated emissions which we need to evaluate.  The initiative captures that aspect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022062200002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ed Hearne"},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":680,"content":"<p>Is demolition included?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022062200002#C00500","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655852400,"counter":681,"content":"<p>Demolition probably has not explicitly been included.

If there is a cycle lane that engenders a modal switch from cars, for example, then there is obviously a climate impact.  That will be a big step forward in how we look more holistically at projects.<\/p><p> There is one other element, which is very technical.  In essence, we put prices on carbon emissions.  For every tonne of carbon that is emitted because of a project, we evaluate that as part of the cost-benefit framework.  We will be substantially increasing the value per tonne of emissions, which will mean projects that have a more favourable emissions impact will be more favourably treated in the cost-benefit analysis.  That is a very technical piece of work that has to be done.  The evaluation has changed because our national climate action targets have changed, which means the price will be more expensive.  This will make a big difference at the marginal level for various projects.<\/p><p> Finally, as Ms O'Loughlin mentioned, the tagging will give us a lot more information on the whole generality of green investment and what the likely impacts might be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022062200002#C00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ed Hearne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":683,"content":"<p>Before Ms O'Loughlin responds on the equality issue, I have a quick follow-up question on the cost-benefit aspect.  In the climate committee's report on transport, one of the issues we identified was the concern that the cost-benefit approach used on major transport and other projects did not really give a weighting to the idea of induced impact.  It was very much based on a demand-centred approach to pubic transport provision.  On projects like the western rail corridor, for instance, the cost-benefit analysis gave a very low weighting to certain matters and a very high rating to others.  That is something we in the climate committee identified as a real problem.  Given that Mr. Hearne says the cost-benefit issue is being looked at again, it might be worth looking at that report from the climate committee.  Will he indicate whether there is a general re-analysis of the cost-benefit approach to major projects?  He mentioned a different pricing being given to carbon emissions.  I am wondering whether there is also a different approach to some of the other performance indicators that are used.<\/p> <p>  On leasing, in terms of cost-benefit analysis or even risk assessment, things can tend to get narrowed into a year-on-year focus.  I am interested in the role of leasing.  Previously, we were operating in a situation where we had considerable constraints as a State in what we could do under the EU budgetary rules.  Those rules have changed, with a suspension of the fiscal rules for a two- to three-year period.  There is a debate around what form the new EU semester process will take when it comes back.  As Mr. Hearne will be aware, it seems different kinds of indicators are likely to be part of the semester process.  There has been a discussion about the idea of certain green projects and, indeed, certain social and public projects being excluded from some of the rules relating to balance sheets.  I am adding these questions in for whomever can answer them.  Has there been an examination in terms of a cost-benefit analysis of leasing versus capital expenditure versus long-term ownership?  I would also like to hear about the EU semester process and the kinds of indicators on performance we might be integrating into that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022062200002#D00200","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655852400,"counter":684,"content":"<p>I am not involved at present with our input to the debates the Senator mentioned and cannot really speak with authority in that regard.  In general on her point about leasing, for any given intervention, all of the feasible options should be considered, particularly at the long list of options stage when we move from the strategic assessment of why we need a project to how we are going to develop it.  In certain sectors, I expect that is very much front and centre.  The way we tend to operate these things is we set the overall parameters at the central level and then people in the individual sectors, whether that be transport, water, housing or whatever, go away and develop their own individual, sector-specific methodology.  I expect there is probably more consideration being given now to those types of questions within the sectors.<\/p> <p>  On the Senator's question on cost-benefit analysis, we have sometimes struggled with the question of induced demand and trying to understand whether our demand forecasts at the outset will be borne out.  We saw in the past with road projects, for example, that there was a higher level of demand than initially envisaged because there was an induced element involved.  What we need to do generally, and what the project with the OECD tries to do, is move to complement cost-benefit analysis with other approaches.  Cost-benefit analysis definitely will still form a fundamental part of the decision-making process but it probably needs to be rounded out with wider considerations.  A good innovation in the transport sector has been the use of modal hierarchies and intervention hierarchies to say that, as a rule of thumb, we prefer maintenance to new build and we prefer improvement before going to the creation of new assets.  Building in those kinds of rules of thumb across the various sectors will be really important.  It certainly is something we would aim to build out as part of the OECD work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022062200002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ed Hearne"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655852400,"counter":685,"content":"<p>The Senator asked about equality budgeting.  I assure her that the momentum in this regard has not weakened at all.  It may appear that way because a lot of the work at the moment is behind the scenes, so to speak.  When we launched the pilot, we really tried to articulate what it was about and sell it to the Departments.  What we are doing now is trying to embed that within the overall performance budgeting framework and build up Departments' capacity.  There is a focus on training to ensure Departments are using equality budgeting to refine their policymaking process in order that policies are targeted at the specific cohorts they should be and to ensure public expenditure is reaching the maximum target it can.  We have shifted over the past number of years towards impact budgeting to make sure policy is hitting the people for whom it is intended.<\/p> <p>  There has been some important progress in the past two to three years.  As of now, all Departments are participating in equality budgeting.  This means they are, at a minimum, reporting on equality metrics in the performance report and the Revised Estimates Volume, REV.  However, as we have always said, equality budgeting is not about clocking up equality metrics.  We do not say, okay, we have 50 equality metrics and we are done.  We always wanted to make sure it was not going to turn into a tick-the-box exercise.  We wanted to embed it into the performance budgeting framework and ensure it sharpened up how policymaking is done within Departments.  As we have increased the number of equality budgeting metrics, we can see the impact of equality budgeting policy being embedded in the performance metrics as they are reported in the REV and the performance report.<\/p> <p>  We have also done a number of other things recently.  After the OECD did its scan of equality budgeting on Ireland, it gave us 12 recommendations for how to improve and embed the implementation of equality budgeting.  A key part of that has been the improvement of the availability of disaggregated data, the lack of which was one of the barriers to how we could identify the metrics to measure these things.  We have done a huge amount of work in this area.  It began with an equality budgeting data audit.  The Central Statistics Office, CSO, appointed a statistician to us for six months and she conducted a data audit of equality budgeting information in Ireland.  That information is now housed on the CSO website.  It is a central point to which everybody can go to see what disaggregated data are available.  That information will inform identification of equality budgeting metrics.  The data audit showed us what we had, including the fact there was duplication in some efforts, where the gaps were and what we were not picking up.<\/p><p>We are conducting a data audit strategy to identify how we can plug those gaps and identify what measures can be taken within general data protection regulation, GDPR, rules, etc. and how we can capture that data.  That is a huge body of work that is being done at the moment.<br\/><br\/>I mentioned capacity building in Departments.  We engage greatly with Departments as a whole and sections within the Departments to raise their awareness of equality budgeting and see how they can embed that in their general policymaking frameworks.  The structural reform support programme that is under way at the moment to tag expenditure, will be a huge momentum for this work as well.  The ability to be able to tag all expenditure against the nine grounds of equality will also be of great help as the work continues over the next 12 months.<br\/><br\/>We have also established an interdepartmental group.  The Government made a decision in March 2021 to the effect that it wanted to accelerate the implementation of equality budgeting.  On the back of that, an interdepartmental group was created.  That group was represented by every Department and, as I said, the purpose of the group is to build capacity within Departments and make sure everybody in the Department is aware of equality budgeting and, <i>vice versa<\/i>, to share information with us on what work is going on around all the different Departments to help accelerate this work.<br\/><br\/>A huge amount of work is going on at the moment.  On equality budgeting, certainly, we have been very careful to make sure that momentum has not been lost and has been maintained.  We are also working on something with our colleagues in the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  Our colleagues in that Department are doing work on gender mainstreaming.  Obviously, we work very closely with them because gender is an element of equality budgeting but all of the work there is also very transferable to other areas of equality.  We are looking at things in our own Department like introducing a module under OneLearning for equality budgeting.  Again, as I said, this is all really to raise capacity building within the Departments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022062200002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Caroline O'Loughlin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":687,"content":"<p>I have a quick follow-up to that.  I should mention that I am also a member of the Joint Committee on Gender Equality.  I know that we will be talking about gender mainstreaming and equality.  We might look at the very good individual projects that are listed on pages 115 to 117, many of which specifically relate to supporting equality in the context of certain targeted groups Ms O'Loughlin mentioned.  That general point around almost screening for inequality, something that is a bugbear of mine, relates to our committee in terms of, for example, tax reliefs and private pension tax reliefs, and the fact that the marginal rate for pension tax reliefs we have at the moment very largely benefits higher earners and men.  This debate has happened in Scotland, where they have had equality budgeting for a period.  As the Scottish Government has taken on more areas of independent policymaking from within the UK, however, there is that question of how equality budgeting and screening gets integrated into things like the financier.

The fact of the matter is that all are not attributable.  We cannot identify where they are all coming from.  For instance in the tourism sector, there has been a massive rise in hotel bed-night costs.  The cost of hiring a car is appalling on the basis that cars are scarce.  I can think of a number of places where as far as the eye can see there are cars parked.  They are here already.  With regard to the economic benefit of the use of cars and meeting the green economy requirements, which we have to, there are plenty of electric cars coming into the business now.  I suggest that we need to be very careful about the damage we can do to ourselves with a glib remark about a war that does not affect that particular product at all.  It is not attributable.

We will not be in the marketplace and we will not be able to compete.<\/p> <p>  I was a member of a committee in 2008 that was brought over to Brussels to be advised and told by every sector, every commission and every commissioner&rsquo;s office how we had gone wrong and the damage we had done to Europe, our own economy, the European economy, the precedents we had set and so on and so forth.

It was, in fact, very much driven by extreme inflation in asset classes and almost a lack of Government regulation rather than others.<\/p> <p>  A concern I have had in the period since 2008 is that there is a shift towards short-term framing, and this has been slightly acknowledged, where we have seen in the period since a move towards almost quarterly or annual reporting.  That is why I have mentioned the semester process a number of times.  If the Department officials perhaps do not have thoughts on it for now and nobody is really engaged, perhaps they could follow in up writing.  The semester process became very much about the annual indicators and the long-term timeframe was lost.  As a result, I believe Europe lost a decade when it should have been investing heavily in the green transition and, indeed, areas like the digital transition.  That is one of the reasons we have so much catching up to do now.  We lost a decade of long-term benefit because the pressure was so much on the fiscal targets in each quarter or each year.<\/p> <p>  In that context, are the Department officials confident that, in the way they are approaching this kind of performance assessment now on public services, they are capturing and leaving space for the long-term benefits, impacts and outcomes rather than just the annual figures?

I ask the officials about monitoring performance in the short-term versus the long-term.  Do they feel that has improved?  Do they feel it is an ongoing process?<\/p> <p>  I have specific questions on some of those areas where we are giving financial grants to the private sector.

Therefore, every Department will have a good degree of certainty concerning its medium-term investment.  We are an outlier in that regard across Europe.  We do not see this level of certainty provided across sectors of the public service in other countries and this is certainly a plus.  Most important of all, these aspects are linked.

In the tight time slot allocated, I would like to explain how Belgium under my tenure as Minister of Social Affairs and Public Health can serve as an example of good practice.<\/p> <p>  First, I will explain the pharmaceutical pact although I will not enter into detail.  I will highlight the most important aspects to demonstrate our case.  Next, I will explain in a nutshell the BeNeLuxA initiative.  We felt efforts to increase international co-operation is to the benefit of patients with rare diseases.  Ireland was the fifth country to enter into the agreement, for which I am very grateful.  I will emphasise budgetary aspects and procedural characteristics and how to influence the time of access to a reimbursed product for the patient.<\/p> <p>  In light of the elections of 2013, I thought it was important to consider a tailored pharmaceutical policy and there were several good reasons to do so.  Together with representatives of the board and the generic and brand name drug companies, we decided on a multiannual agreement that emphasised four main topics for the benefit of the patient.  The first was to guarantee better access and lower the out-of-pocket cost for the patient.  Next, the pharmaceutical industry in Belgium is an undeniable asset of our national economy.  Often, public opinion is very critical regarding the pharmaceutical industry and thus regulating the transparency and ethical aspects was the third pillar of the pact.  Finally, we had to agree on a budgetary pathway that would allow growth and access to innovation but at the same time keep the budget under control.  This meant that structural savings were necessary for some aspects and an agreement at an early stage would increase mutual understanding.  One of the spillovers of this policy was the reduction of the time to access, although the pharma pact did not include structural reforms of the procedures that lead to the reimbursement itself.<\/p> <p>  Several factors influence the time delay in which a therapy will be accessible under reimbursement for the patient.  One aspect depends on the strategy of the company itself, for instance, preferences for bigger markets.  It is hard for national governments to influence these strategical choices.  The second aspect that contributes to the time lapse in which a reimbursed drug is available is public investment and creating a favourable ecosystem.  The last aspect is the administrative procedure to apply for reimbursement and how long this procedure takes, at which milestone a company can file for reimbursement, how much room there is for negotiation, what the conditions are regarding data and the evidence to obtain reimbursement for a certain medicine.<\/p> <p>  An important aspect that steered the time to access to reimbursed drugs was the budgetary framework.  As we can see from the budgetary evolution, the pact scheduled structural budget cuts but at the same time left a margin for controlled growth.<\/p><p>On an annual basis, 0.5% growth was foreseen.  There was negative growth in the previous years.  In reality, the average growth was 1.4%.  One of the reasons for this was an underestimation of the amount in the pipeline that would enter the market.  For some medication, like immunological medication, we thought that the train was still far away but it was in front of our noses.  For some pathologies, only poor national epidemiologic data was available and it was difficult to estimate the price. Approximately &euro;1.4 billion of new measures and reimbursements in pharmacy were allowed.<\/p><p> Nevertheless, all the savings and expenditure cuts foreseen in the pact were implemented.  Among others were the patent cliff, the clawbacks and encouragement to prescribe the lowest priced drugs.  In 2018, the pharmaceutical industry paid a total product tax within the public healthcare insurance budget of more than &euro;729 million.  The budgetary framework had the perspective of four years because the elections were in 2018, so the pact was in place from 2015 to the end of 2018.  As of 2019, the budgetary measures were taken without a multiannual perspective and, as can be seen, this resulted in an immediate rise in the budget.<\/p><p> In my opinion, to accelerate access and reduce waiting time, a sound budgetary perspective is equally as important as the administrative procedure itself.  This brings us to timelines of procedures and reimbursement of other pharmaceutical products.  Once the European Commission has endorsed the European Medicines Agency, EMA, market authorisation, pharmaceutical companies can apply for reimbursement in the Commission for reimbursement for medicines.  That is stated in the administration of the ministry.  A classic procedure takes a minimum of 180 days and due to possibilities to stop the clock for the pharmaceutical firms - for instance, to prepare answers to questions for the committee, the time-lapse might increase.  If no solution is found in this Commission, a managed entry agreement can then be negotiated by law, covered by the confidential clause in a contract that defines the rights and the obligations of both of the parties.  The operationalisation of the decision to reimburse a medicine sometimes took up to two months after notification.  We used technical intervention to shorten this timeline.<\/p><p> Taking market authorisation as a starting point, the minimum procedure time is 180 days plus 120 days so that results in 300 days.  However, when we look at the statistics on the average delay to availability, it is much longer at 440 days.  If we wanted to further reduce this time-lapse, structural reforms of the procedures would be necessary.  The fast track is an example of such a reform.  We created a fast track for new drugs with new indications.  The old procedure still remains.  However, if some drugs prove their quality and robustness of outcome, in terms of quality of life or other indications, then the procedure is shortened for the new indications.  This procedure of EMA is then one plus one month.  Learned conditions in data to support the demand are directly linked to the new indications.<\/p><p> This was mostly done for immunotherapy which was very new in the treatment of cancer, for example.  Since the introduction of the fast track in 2017, 20 indications for immunotherapy have been reimbursed and the impact of these procedures in terms of an adjusted quality of life and years gained is enormous.  This was a big achievement and great progress has been made in treating patients for diseases for which nothing was on the market previously.<\/p><p> This system needs to answer so-called \"compassionate use\" for unmet medical needs and applications can be submitted even before market authorisations are licensed.  The procedure can lead to early access for the patient two years earlier than in the regular procedure.  Most of the innovative drugs are reimbursed under a managed entry agreement.  Specifically with regard to orphan drugs, in the period between 2016 and 2019, 29 new products became available in Belgium.  In Ireland, it was only 12.  Between 2014 and 2020, we signed 33 new orphan drug products for 36 indications for reimbursement.  Previously, it was only a few a year.<\/p><p> With regard to expenditure for managed entry agreements, if a company does not comply to contractual objectives, then refund levies are charged.  Managed entry agreements, MEAs, now have a share of 11% in the total refunds for medicines budget exceed levies.  That is compared to 1% in 2014.  We can see that the share has been growing.  <\/p><p> We will now come to the BeNeLuXA initiative.  It was first Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg.  Austria and Ireland then joined but BeNeLuXair sounds more like an airline so we decided to keep the name because it was so well-known, but we were very glad that Ireland joined us.  The BeNeLuXA initiative involved international co-operation.  We started on horizon scanning, health technology assessment and shared policy expertise and practices.  Towards the end, we also added in price negotiations which were not simple because all countries had different administrations and different systems of reimbursement.  You might ask why we did it?  I mentioned earlier that bigger markets are more interesting to the pharmaceutical companies, and possibly lead to lower prices for the patients.  This was one of the main motives for considering co-operation between smaller countries because it resulted in added value for the patients.  It is clear it is not only about reimbursement.  The horizon scanning taught us much and helped us understand what could be expected to enter the market in coming years.  Through mutual recognition of each other's health technology assessments, reimbursement procedures run more efficiently and effectively.  Information sharing is always good to improve the market position as are joint negotiations for pricing.  For rare diseases, the prices are very high.  We also wanted more transparency on pricing between the collaborating countries.  The first practice case was Spinrasa.  Last year, with the BeNeLuXA countries, Ireland also reached an agreement for the reimbursement of Zolgensma.<\/p><p> To conclude I will outline, in my opinion, the most important lessons learned from the pharma pact and BeNeLuxA.  The multi-annual framework for the budget allowed for the budget allowed for better guidance of the pharmaceutical policies.  Having several procedures to come to reimbursed medicines increases access.  Within these procedures there is also room to deploy several instruments.  For example, it is possible to have fees and taxes and to establish different entry moments to apply for reimbursement, reducing delays in the decision process.  A sustainable reimbursement ecosystem creates spillover effects that promote accelerated accessibility for the patient.  In the mid term, BeNeLuxA should ideally evolve to enhanced co-operation.<\/p><p> I thank Senators and Deputies for their attention.  Of course, I am willing to answer questions and members may also contact me via the address given to the committee.  I will also share everything I said today with the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022062200002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Maggie De Block","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":723,"content":"<p>We will not have the usual block of speakers so Deputy Colm Burke will lead off the questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022062200002#C00200","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":724,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. De Block for giving her time this morning because I know she is very busy.

Will she expand on what she means by that?  In Ireland, as speakers have said, our waiting times are quite lengthy.  We have had answers to parliamentary questions indicating waiting times ranging from 800 to 1,200 days, depending on criteria.  Is that reflective of a sustainable reimbursement system?<\/p> <p>  In Ireland we do not have a specific pathway to assess orphan drugs and it is part of the mainstream assessment.  In Belgium is there a specific assessment pathway for orphan drugs, or is it like the Irish system, where every drug is assessed under the same threshold?<\/p> <p>  I have a question on the number of drugs in Belgium approved over the past few years.  Will Dr. De Block give a breakdown of the past two or three years?

First, the Deputy asked if there is a different procedure for reimbursement for orphan drugs or other drugs.  We have the same but the issue is having enough data.  That is why we need the contracts because, sometimes, the orphan drug does not have enough patients treated before it enters reimbursement.  Of course, it is difficult to decide based on small patient numbers.  These are rare diseases and there might only be five patients in a country and, as Belgium is a small country, we might only have two patients.  That is why we are working together with other countries.<\/p> <p>  On the numbers that we tried to find for the committee, we found them for the orphan drugs but not for all drugs.  Because of coronavirus, our administrations have been overwhelmed with work, in particular the health department, and there has been a delay in giving statistics.  When we have them, we can send them to the committee.  The administration did everything to continue other care because there were not just patients with coronavirus but also those with other needs.<\/p> <p>  Concerning the patient organisations for orphan drugs, they are well organised in Belgium.  They are not around the table when the negotiations take place, as they would like to be, but there is transparency and they have the information.  There are so many organisations and they cannot all be around the table.  Everyone will ask for himself and because everything in health is important, whether it is one disease or another, the moment people are involved on behalf of their family or themselves, it becomes very emotional.  That is why we choose transparency but not to put them around the table of the commission which decides.  Of course, it would be good if we could harmonise the criteria in the Benelux countries, which would also give more transparency to the organisations.  It would also allow the data and information to be valid in the five countries, which would give them more information.<\/p> <p>  The faster we can achieve our commitments, the more favourable the reimbursement agreements and the better they will be.  We know the prices of medicines are rising, certainly for orphan drugs.  It is a big concern for our administration that the budget is always higher every year.  We can save lives and we can have better quality of life for certain patients, but we know that, at the end, everyone has to pay the bill, which is a big concern.

The bigger countries do not need us and they do not want to join us, even though this is still within the European Union and it is a problem that bigger countries have other prices.  Of course, if this is due to their economic situation, for countries such as Hungary and Romania for example, I would understand this because there are other problems there with regard to getting access to medication such as antibiotics.  I understand that this is because of economic reasons.  For Germany and France, however, one cannot say that.  This is how it has always been.  I do not agree with it.  I believe that a German patient is a patient who needs treatment but an Irish patient is the same patient who has the same needs.  For me this is the key.  There should be much more co-operation for patient care in the European Union.  As the committee is aware, it is not for nothing that in the EU member states, there is no agreement to take care of the patient care together.  This was also one of the problems when we had the Covid situation.  The Commission had to negotiate for the first time for the price of the vaccines.  We can see that it was not a success at first.  It took them all so much time to negotiate with the firms.<\/p> <p>  Yes, one could also do a shared risk, if one begins to negotiate in the earlier phase such as phase 3 or phase 4.  Then one could to do risk sharing also with the pharmaceutical firms.  However, in the negotiations for the BeNeLuXA initiative we have always said it must be safety first.  We must be sure that we are helping the patients and not giving medication that could have secondary effects or which may make their condition worse.  It is safety first, but if it is safe and they can give us the safety ticket, then we should do more efforts with countries together.<\/p> <p>  It is always the same, however, that the big countries say \"We do not need you\".  I believe that it could benefit their patients too, and certainly when it comes to rare diseases.  This is why we also created the rare diseases network.  It is a network of co-operation of our academics and researchers.  It did not get us too far but we did create a big network concerning rare diseases.

Then all the patients will have access at the same time.  Currently, it takes perhaps two years longer in one country than in another, which is the worst case, and other countries are not able to pay for it.  There are patients who have to move from their country to another, which is of course almost impossible for sick patients.

With the support of the Department of Health, patients and their families, the national rare diseases office, NRDO, was established by the HSE in 2015.  This was a key recommendation of the first National Rare Disease Plan for Ireland 2014-2018.  The HSE and Department of Health each have a role in this plan for patients with rare diseases.<\/p> <p>  Since establishment of the NRDO, information scientists have provided a free information helpline service for members of the public, patients and healthcare staff.  Information provided includes current and reliable evidence-based information about rare diseases and informs patients where in Ireland the centres of expertise are located.  It also gives information about support groups for people living with rare diseases.  The NRDO maintains and updates a database on rare diseases called Orphanet Ireland.  The work of the NRDO, in collaboration with multi-disciplinary clinical staff and rare disease patient representatives, in relation to care pathway development, reduces waiting times to see a rare disease specialist and shortens the time to a diagnosis, which we know can be prolonged for people living with rare diseases.<\/p> <p>  The European Commission cross-border directive supports strengthening co-operation between highly specialised healthcare providers across the European Union by the establishment of a system of European reference networks, ERN.  The NRDO is the co-ordination hub for Ireland's ERNs.  A total of 18 collaborative groups from more than 40 centres of expertise in Ireland, led by five major academic teaching hospitals, have received full ERN membership to date.  ERN membership facilitates sharing of information and access to expertise across Europe. It provides Irish patients and healthcare professionals access to the latest research and education opportunities.  ERNs are predicted to greatly improve the access to and quality of care for Irish rare diseases patients, including access to participation in clinical trials, where Ireland may have limited capacity due to our small population.  Funding will be sought in the Estimates process to support these five hospital sites to set up their rare disease registries and to support clinicians to participate in research.<\/p> <p>  The NRDO is currently in the process of designing care pathways, including paths to diagnosis and genetic testing, across the 18 ERNs.  These pathways set out a multidisciplinary approach to care for the more common rare diseases which would address current service gaps, particularly in psychological and social care support and timely access to genetic testing and counselling.<\/p> <p>  The NRDO has led on and ensured that Ireland is a participant in a number of key EU grants related to rare diseases.  There is now an opportunity to participate in an upcoming European Commission ERN 2023 integration grant, with further grant opportunities thereafter.<\/p> <p>  The HSE intends to work closely with the Department of Health on developing an updated plan for rare diseases.  As with the National Rare Diseases Plan for Ireland 2014-2018, the involvement of patients and their families living with rare diseases will be fundamental to the new plan.  With regard to the issue of genetic testing of newborn babies for rare diseases, the purpose of population screening is to reduce death and illness and improve quality of life through early detection and treatment of disease.  In Ireland, the national newborn bloodspot screening programme is responsible for the heel prick test for babies when they are three to five days old.  The test identifies treatable metabolic disorders and other inherited or congenital disorders in infants and allows for timely intervention and treatment.  The programme currently screens for nine disorders.  In 2019, a national screening advisory committee, NSAC, was established.  This is an independent advisory committee which advises the Minister and Department of Health on all new proposals for population-based screening programmes and revisions to existing programmes.  The committee plays a significant strategic role in the development and consideration of population-based screening programmes in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  In November 2021, the NSAC had a public call for submissions which was open to patients, public and health professionals and open to proposals for a new screening programme or changes to one of the existing programmes.  All areas of national screening were considered, including newborn screening.<\/p> <p>  In addition, in recent weeks, the HSE has established an expert steering group, including patient and patient advocacy representation, to develop a national genetics and genomics strategy for Ireland.  This group will develop an agreed strategy and implementation plan for genomics in Ireland.  This work will improve access for patients to genetic expertise, which can impact timely diagnosis and treatment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022062200002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Woods"},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":761,"content":"<p>I am conscious that some members did not get to speak in the first session and that we have limited time.

Last year was the first time there was a successful medicine taken from the start of the assessment process through to reimbursement.  The medicine in question is Zolgensma, for spinal muscular atrophy.  In that assessment, Ireland took the lead on the health technology assessment side.  The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics, led by Michael Barry, did the assessment for the three countries.  Arising from that assessment, the three countries agreed to go into a joint negotiation process.  That process went reasonably well.  Within it, there were several matters that had to be ironed out.  When one gets into these things, it is amazing how different systems can be.  For example, the Irish negotiators had to deal with the fact that the HSE would have to pay 23% VAT on Zolgensma.  It can be matters as simple as that.  One of the other countries does not pay VAT on medicines.  Within the negotiations, that had an impact on how the deal had to be configured so that it worked for everybody.  One of the great learnings from the process was that when one is in those joint negotiations, one has the assurance that at least two other countries are getting the same deal as the country one is representing.  One's country is doing no worse and no better than those three countries.  As the Deputy stated, there is the additional population benefit of negotiating for well in excess of 20 million people - probably 30 million people - across the three countries, rather than just 5 million people, or the small number of people within the population of 5 million who will benefit.<\/p> <p>  From the perspective of the HSE, we are committed to the BeNeLuxA process.  This week, several of the team are engaged in meetings with BeNeLuxA colleagues to try to make progress on that.  As part of the BeNeLuxA process, we are very close to the first major output from it in the area of horizon scanning.  A new horizon scanning process will be in place that will enable all the countries involved to benefit from shared information in respect of what is coming down the road in terms of the medicines and health technology assessments for which we have to plan and the expertise we have to get in place to be able to do those health technology assessments.  Obviously, there is the benefit now that where there is agreement, we can rely on the expertise within three countries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022062200002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Shaun Flanagan"},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":767,"content":"<p>To go back to the core issue, the population of the European Union is in the region of 500 million people.

I am under a time constraint because I have to speak in the D&aacute;il Chamber so I have only one question.  My question intends to get to the heart of the issue around orphan drugs and access to them.  There is a perception, and I think there is a lot of truth in it, that big pharma companies have governments and patients over a barrel in respect of the price they charge for drugs.  Some of the prices are jaw-dropping.  People who are in need of these drugs, which can be hugely beneficial, and their families have a right to get them but those companies, some of which are based in Ireland, have whole states over a barrel when it comes to the prices they charge.<\/p> <p>  Another perception is that the assessment of these drugs is quite arbitrary.  It can be very cumbersome and protracted, to say the least.  I could name a number of drugs whose assessment has gone on for years.  That is particularly true in recent years.  It leaves families unable to get those drugs.  It can be extremely stressful and family members have died because they cannot get those drugs because of the price.  That is unethical and immoral.  Is that perception of big pharma companies and their economics correct or incorrect?  Do they have states and patients over a barrel in the context of the prices they charge?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022062200002#J01000","speaker":"1565"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1655852400,"counter":787,"content":"<p>We have processes in place to negotiate price and to assess the clinical effectiveness of drugs for the benefit of patients.

Pharmaceutical companies are private corporations and have responsibilities to their shareholders and so on.  It is important for a state to have robust processes.  We have a health technology assessment which is carried out by the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics, NCPE.  We also have a commercial negotiation process and an independent drugs group, which reviews the outputs of the assessments and the negotiation processes.  Any unmet need is considered.  The clinical evidence, cost effectiveness and budget impact are considered.  The final decision maker in the HSE is the executive management team.  There is now board oversight of that.  It is one of the areas at which the board looks.<\/p> <p>  We would like to get more efficient in getting through drugs quicker but we feel we do address some of the excesses that are tabled in respect of price.  I will give the committee a feel for some of that.  In 2021, the HSE approved 29 new medicines and 21 new uses for existing medicines.  The commercial negotiations and health technology assessment process took away &euro;398 million in costs over the next five years for those medicines.  The difference between what the pharmaceutical companies originally tabled for those 29 new medicines, 21 new uses for existing medicines and two extensions and what was finally agreed was &euro;400 million over five years.  That is one part that may give the committee some assurance in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Our corporate pharmaceutical unit, the part of the HSE that leads on commercial negotiations, has gone back and conducted a review of the 134 drug group recommendations which were received between July 2016 and May 2021.  Of those 134 recommendations, 46 of the drugs involved had orphan designation status at the time of the drugs group review.  The original cost effectiveness estimate, which is driven on the one side by cost and by benefits on the other side, was that 78% of those orphan-designated drugs received a drugs group recommendation.  Of those, 31 were subject to a full health technology assessment.  Of those 31 drugs, 21 had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, ICER, which is a cost per quality-adjusted life year, in excess of 100,000 before the negotiations took place.  In the final assessment after the negotiations were completed, only nine of those drugs had an ICER of more than 100,000.  That shows that even in the space of orphan drugs, the negotiation process makes a significant difference in respect of the price that the State is paying.<\/p> <p>  Under the standard cost-effectiveness measure, something is regarded as cost effective if it satisfies a cost-effectiveness ratio of 45,000 per quality-adjusted life year.  For the orphan drugs, four of the 31 with positive recommendations satisfied those criteria before negotiations and 18 of them could be deemed cost effective after the negotiations.  The process makes a difference and saves the taxpayers a substantial amount of money.  More importantly, that enables the HSE to stretch the money it has as far as possible to provide access to as many medicines as possible.  I hope that gives the Deputy some context.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022062200002#J01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Shaun Flanagan"},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":789,"content":"<p>Most people understand that states have to get value for money on drugs that can be beneficial to their citizens.

Obviously, they will argue that they put all the research and development in and the final product, the drug itself, was produced because of the money they put in.

There have been instances where literally entire states do not get certain drugs because of price.  I know individuals who simply have gone without because they cannot get it because of price.

I understand there were negotiations with the pharmaceutical industry on reducing the cost of drugs that are used on a day-to-day basis.  What were the cost savings as a result of those negotiations?

I understand that, in fact, the time period for a drug being made available in the Netherlands is shorter compared to other countries.  We had the former Minister of Social Affairs and Public Health from Belgium in earlier.  In the Netherlands, it is 213 days whereas in Ireland it is 477 days in relation to a drug being made available.

A differentiation the speaker made was that there are seven or eight insurance funds operating in the Netherlands, which are in kind of a private capacity, whereas in Belgium with the social insurance, there is an administration, as she referred to it.  There are different models, and I think she was pointing to that.  The question on what the model needs and what effect the model has on the timing of the introduction perhaps is slightly different.  On the question of whether we can and do look at the reimbursement process and how could that be speeded up, as Deputy Cullinane referred to, we can of course within our current model of delivery.

One of the things that rang true for me was the sustainable reimbursement model that Dr. De Block talked about and the importance of certainly and surety around the amount of funding that will be available in future years.  At times, because of the economic situation, we have obviously been challenged around the budget for new drugs that has been in place, or not been in place, in particular years.  That can have an impact on the ability of the HSE to fund products.  Again, echoing what the Deputy said, the importance of things such as the 2022 Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association, IPHA, agreement in terms of making headroom is critical.  It is critical to be able to do that.<\/p> <p>  One of the benefits, strangely enough, of the pandemic has been that previously on our negotiations, we were face to face, whereas obviously, with the pandemic, we have had to get negotiations more virtual and had MS Teams-type scenarios.  The negotiating team has continued that model now that we are hopefully &ndash; we thought anyway at least &ndash; exiting Covid-19.  That has given us additional benefits in terms of just being able to schedule.  Again, like many parts of the HSE, there is a view going on at the moment around whether we need additional resources to accelerate our ability to carry on more, if you want to put it that way, negotiations on at the same time because, obviously, at the moment, we have a limit in terms of the team being fairly put to the pin of its collar.

When one looks at what one can test for on those heel pricks, one sees that 35 to 40 conditions can be done with the biochemical test.<\/p> <p>  As part of the process which surrounds that, one has to ensure that each of those tests has good quality assurance.  That is the most important thing in order that we know we are not finding more positives and, on that basis, treating people who do not need to be treated for diseases.  Many criteria go into having a good screening model.  Across Europe, everybody is looking at it to try to increase it as best they can.  It varies greatly.  France checks for one, we check for nine, the UK checks for nine and Italy checks for 40.  Everywhere else is somewhere in the middle.  I read recently that we need to have the breadth of the Italian experience but we also need the rigour which our own process puts these tests through.  This is also the case in the NHS in the UK and in Sweden.  We must ensure that we have a test we can stand over and that we are not testing people and telling them they are positive or negative when they are not.  We must also ensure that we have a good treatment for every single one of those diseases and that we can stand over it.  We are in that process since 2019 with the standing up of the committee.

Then there is the rare diseases TRC, which was in effect a recommendation from the previous report of the Joint Committee on Health for more patient engagement.  One of the challenges around the rare diseases TRC is that because of its special nature, you have to constitute new expert members each time a drug goes to it.  Basically, you need the clinicians who are the experts in that area to populate that committee.  <\/p> <p>  The drugs group is a more general committee.  Usually, it is not possible to make a quorum in August but other than that it meets monthly.  In an effort to try to make the process as efficient as possible, the drugs group looks at a medicine first.  If it is an orphan drug and the drugs group is minded to say \"Yes\", it does not send the drug to the rare diseases TRC because the HSE will have said \"Yes\" already.  If the drugs group has some concerns or is unable to say \"Yes\" on the basis of the assessment in front of it, it then engages with the rare diseases TRC to try to acquire additional information to enable the drug to get over the line.  A judgment has been made that this the most efficient way to utilise the expertise of the rare diseases TRC.  Rather than asking it to look at every orphan drug, we ask it to focus on the orphan drugs that we are having difficulties around.  That is why it seems to meet infrequently.

I used to be the head of the negotiating teams in the HSE.  I have moved from that role and I am now a member of the drugs group.  I see, along with my colleagues on the drug group, that we look at everything.  We look at unmet need, clinical evidence, cost-effectiveness and economic evidence such as the budget impact.  We look at the representations we receive and at the lived experience of the patients as they are submitted in the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics, NCPE, documents.  People have an opportunity to provide information as part of the NCPE process around their experience of what they believe the drug will do for them.

The same can be true in the case of non-orphan drugs.  There can be difficult negotiations in trying to get the budget impact of a drug to a level that the State feels is reasonable.  As I say, there are the industry engagements.  I refer here to the 2022 IPHA agreement.  A significant feature of the deliberations on the latter relates to sharing the information on what would work better on both sides.  One of the issues on which we all agreed was that it would help if we could in some way get to the end of the negotiation quicker.

I believe it is a prevalence rate of less than one in 50,000, but I would have to double-check that.  There are other aspects around the rules in that companies can make commercial decisions to de-designate an orphan drug for whatever commercial reason a company might have.

A rare disease is a very specific disease that affects a very small population and is so rare that it is very difficult, as was said, to get easy diagnosis and support.  It is a difficult disease to get enough people to research.  As I said earlier, if we are talking about doing a trial for which we need 200 people, we may not have 200 people with this disease across the world.  It is something very rare and that is why it needs special recommendations around it.<\/p> <p>  The definition of a rare disease is very broad, but it can feel very isolating for a family or patient with it because they are faced with something they do not have a community or network around.  They do not have a group of people who can meet Deputies or even lobby for what they need.  That is why it takes us, the Department and the rare disease organisations to say to people that while they may have a rare disease, we understand what that means and we will work with the family and anybody who has an interest in this, whether it is in Ireland or another country in Europe, to try to get the best care and advice they need and, if there is any treatment out there that is being proposed, we will work with other communities to get research.

T&aacute; a fhios agam go gcosn&oacute;dh s&eacute; c&uacute;pla pingin, ach n&iacute; hamh&aacute;in go gcabhr&oacute;dh c&oacute;ras ceart l&eacute;irmheast&oacute;ireachta leis na scr&iacute;bhneoir&iacute;, chabhr&oacute;dh s&eacute; le marga&iacute;ocht, le foilsitheoir&iacute; agus le l&eacute;itheoir&iacute; chomh maith.  Spreagann l&eacute;irmheas suimi&uacute;il duine chun leabhar a cheannach.  Is cinnte go spreagann a leith&eacute;id mise ach go h&aacute;irithe.  Ina theannta sin, d&aacute; mbeadh daoine ag scr&iacute;obh l&eacute;irmheasanna go rialta ar leabhair, choth&oacute;dh s&eacute; pobal beag l&eacute;itheoireachta.  M&aacute; bh&iacute;onn daoine ag l&eacute;amh, tosa&iacute;onn siad ag caint agus is an-chabhair i gc&oacute;na&iacute; an chaint.  Chuirfinn fainic leis an moladh sin, &aacute;fach.  N&iacute; m&oacute;r caighde&aacute;n s&aacute;ch ard a &eacute;ileamh sna l&eacute;irmheasanna sin, caighde&aacute;n a d&rsquo;fh&eacute;adfadh na scr&iacute;bhneoir&iacute; agus na foilsitheoir&iacute; araon muin&iacute;n a bheith acu as.

N&iacute; bh&iacute;onn s&eacute; le feiscint sna siopa&iacute;, n&iacute; bh&iacute;onn s&eacute; ar an teilif&iacute;s agus n&iacute; phl&eacute;itear ar an raidi&oacute; &eacute;, ach amh&aacute;in ar Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta.  B&iacute;onn an leabhar ann agus as ag an am c&eacute;anna.  B&iacute;onn saghas eagla ar bhuna&iacute;ocht an chult&uacute;ir agus na n-eala&iacute;on anseo admh&aacute;il go bhfuil daoine f&oacute;s ag scr&iacute;obh as Gaelainn.  D&aacute; bhr&iacute; sin, n&iacute;l a fhios ag daoine go coitianta go bhfuil leabhair Ghaelainne, nach leabhair scoile iad, &aacute; scr&iacute;obh sa Ghaelainn.  T&aacute; s&eacute; an-deacair a bheith ag caint mar gheall ar l&eacute;itheoireacht na Gaelainne a chur chun cinn muna bhfuil a fhios ag daoine go bhfuil leabhair nua &aacute; bhfoilsi&uacute; agus &aacute; scr&iacute;obh an t-am ar fad.  Chuige sin, caithfidh siad na leabhair a fheiscint.<\/p><p> Ceann de na molta&iacute; i m&rsquo;aighneacht n&aacute; go mbeadh aonta&iacute; agus f&eacute;ilte leabhar &aacute; re&aacute;cht&aacute;il ar fud na t&iacute;re ar bhonn rialta.  Rud eile nach gcosn&oacute;dh pingin n&aacute; leas a bhaint as oifig an mh&eacute;ara n&oacute; an t-ard-mh&eacute;ara anseo is ansi&uacute;d chun poibl&iacute;ocht a thabhairt do dhaoine a bhuann duaiseanna san Oireachtas.  Is rud &aacute;iti&uacute;il &eacute; sin agus chuirfeadh s&eacute; daoine os comhair an phobail go h&aacute;iti&uacute;il.  B&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir go bhfuil s&eacute; sin n&iacute;os t&aacute;bhachta&iacute; do scr&iacute;bhneoir&iacute; at&aacute; ag obair lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht.  Chomh maith leis sin, teasta&iacute;onn &aacute;is&iacute;neacht eile chun saothar na scr&iacute;bhneoir&iacute; agus na bhfoilsitheoir&iacute; uile a chur os comhair an phobail, a dh&eacute;anfadh poibl&iacute;ocht ar bhonn an-eagraithe ar fad.  N&iacute;l sna molta&iacute; seo ach ruda&iacute; beaga ach t&aacute;im cinnte go bhf&eacute;adfa&iacute; a theacht suas le neart ruda&iacute; eile mar sin a chabhr&oacute;dh go m&oacute;r le haitheantas agus poibl&iacute;ocht a thabhairt do scr&iacute;bhneoir&iacute;.<\/p><p> P&eacute; rud a dh&eacute;antar n&oacute; a deirtear, t&aacute; rud amh&aacute;in thar a bheith t&aacute;bhachtach maidir le scr&iacute;bhneoireacht, l&eacute;itheoireacht agus foilsitheoireacht na Gaelainne, agus sin na foilsitheoir&iacute;.  T&aacute; siadsan l&aacute;rnach ar fad ar fad.

Nuair a foils&iacute;odh an ch&eacute;ad leabhar uaimse thiar sna 1990id&iacute;, fuaireas &pound;700 as.  Faighim idir &euro;750 agus &euro;900 anois ar leabhar, agus sin 30 bliain n&iacute;os d&eacute;ana&iacute;.

We are already seeing the second and third iterations of electric vehicles.

These amendments give a person, on showing his or her temporary residency certificate or right to it on arriving in the country, the capability of accessing a driving licence.  In circumstances where a person might be in the protection process, and who, thankfully, will now be able to work, this will ensure that if he or she can drive and meets all the other requirements, he or she will be able to access a licence.<\/p><p>There is another series of amendments.  I will not go into all the details but the amendments before us set out how that will be allowed.  The amendments provide for the endorsing of a licence, for a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to retain a licence and forward it to the Minister if it is revoked and for certain provisions under the relevant Act that apply to learner permits to also apply to driving licences.  The key intent of these legislative amendments is to make provision in law for the consequences of the Landsberg case and to provide for people in the international protection process to obtain licences.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022062200002#C01100","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":1004,"content":"<p>I do not oppose the amendments.

To answer Deputy O'Rourke, this database is very important.  It provides knowledge of what is happening, which will benefit us in a whole variety of ways.  One of the issues with regard to the database of the motor insurance register was that it was felt that there was no need for the actual address.  Many of those details are captured because details of the driving licence have to be included and this includes much of this information.  It was felt that it was better to capture the person's name and licence details and that the address is not required.  There is a benefit there with regard to ease of use, management, monitoring and updating the database.  Not having to put in the address in that particular category makes the database simpler and more efficient to use.  It is to simplify the working of the database.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022062200002#D01000","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1655852400,"counter":1028,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":1029,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 12 to 15, inclusive, and 18 are related and may be discussed together by agreement.

Approximately 8% of private cars are fleet vehicles.  In the published Bill, we asked for information relating to &quot;the classes of persons whose liability is proposed to be covered by the policy and the number and classes of vehicles&quot;.  Following further consideration, we now propose to recast this and divide it into two subsections.  The first will require the name of persons covered in the policy and the second will require the class of driver covered.  It is an important distinction because a policy will sometimes name drivers while other times it might cover a class of drivers, for example, heavy goods vehicle, HGV, drivers employed by a firm.  By splitting the named drivers and class of drivers provisions into two subsections, we give ourselves the option to commence them separately.  While I hope not to do that, it would be a useful option if the roll-out of the database was to take place in stages.  We are not talking about the vehicles here.  This is about the classification of the drivers.  Reporting on vehicles held by a fleet is not to the insurer but directly to the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland, MIBI, and therefore to the database under section 56A(2) of the Act.  This amendment is to provide greater flexibility in how companies might provide information on their drivers to the database.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022062200002#D01300","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1655852400,"counter":1031,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":1032,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 13:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 13, to delete lines 1 to 3 and substitute the following:  \t&ldquo;(d) in relation to a policy in respect of a fleet owner or motor trader&mdash; <blockquote> \t(i) the names of any persons mentioned in the policy, and<br \/><br \/>(ii) where applicable, the class of driver whose liability is proposed to be covered by the policy;&rdquo;.&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022062200002#D01500","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1655852400,"counter":1033,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":1034,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 14:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 13, line 11, before &ldquo;applies,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or (d)(i)&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022062200002#D01700","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1655852400,"counter":1035,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":1036,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 15:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 13, line 18, before &ldquo;applies,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or (d)(i)&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022062200002#D01900","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1655852400,"counter":1037,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":1038,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 16 and 17 are related and may be discussed together by agreement.

The first is to drop the reference to the address.  I referred to that earlier.  We changed that in the context of the information provided to the insurer or agent by the client.  The address of the persons on the policy is not required because, as I stated, we get that from the driving licence.  The second change, which may relate to a question asked by Deputy O'Rourke, is to remove the term &quot;insured&quot; as a way of referring to the policy holder.  As the Deputy stated, a policy holder is not necessarily the insured.  In other words, a person may own a car but not drive it.  He or she could take out a policy on the car so that another person can drive it.  That is not common but it is something for which we need to allow.  That is the nature of the amendment.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 38 changes the data to be provided by the insurers to the database in respect of fleet policies.  The published text states that the insurer will provide the classes of persons covered by the policy.  This will now be the names of the persons.  We are also adding reference to policies held by a motor trader as these are similar to fleet policies but would not be captured by the present text, as referred to in a previous amendment.  Finally, we are removing references to the vehicles covered.  This is because that information will be provided directly to the database by the policy holder, rather than by the insurer.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 39 and 40 are small additions of a type we are making in a few places to add reference to intermediaries such as managing general agents, MGAs, after insurers.  They, as well as insurers, will have to notify the database if a policy holder notifies them of changes to the information they have supplied.  They, like insurers, will have to notify the database when a policy is cancelled.  <\/p><p>Amendment No. 41 is more substantial.  It adds an additional reason to the purposes for which the Minister may have access to the data.  This will allow my Department to verify the validity of insurance coverage for vehicles to be authorised on a road transport operator licence.  This is often an issue for the Department.  For example, in the case of supports to the haulage industry recently, certain licensed vehicles were able to access such supports, while others were less able to do so.  The amendment provides a joint capability within the Department in the context of sharing the insurance database details with the road transport operator licensing details.  We currently rely on self-declarations and that would continue to be the case without the amendment.  We do not have evidence that a person is in compliance with his or her insurance obligations.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 42 adds a reference to intermediaries alongside insurers.  This will allow them to see the data they have uploaded to the database in order to verify or correct it.  Under the amendment, MGAs will now be able to do the same.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 43 simply adds definitions of two terms, namely, &quot;National Vehicle and Driver File&quot; and &quot;operator&rsquo;s licence&quot;, used in the insurance-related amendments made by the Bill.  It is largely a technical amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022062200002#E02300","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":1090,"content":"<p>The Minister referred to intermediaries.

The NRA is still referenced in legislation.  Perhaps we should look at changing the term because we think about transport in a much more holistic sense now and primary legislation should reflect this.<\/p> <p>  On the general grouping of amendments, the thrust is to give the TII power to erect variable speed cameras.  We should probably look to give this power to other road authorities as well as the TII so that we move beyond national roads to other roads.  Local authorities should also have this power in the Bill.  Is the intent of the legislation prescriptive with regard to traffic flow or is it broader than this?  There are all kinds of reasons we might have variable speed limits, including safety, noise reduction and air quality emissions.<\/p> <p>  This might be the section of the Bill where we could look at a national kilometre reduction target as other countries have introduced.  We have one in the climate action plan that is specific to fossil fuel vehicles.  Other countries are applying such a target to all vehicles.  If we are to be true to the policy approach of avoid, shift and improve, we should try to reduce the number of kilometres driven throughout the State.  This is being done in other jurisdictions.  It would probably fit into this section of the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022062200002#F02100","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":1137,"content":"<p>I would add the word \"share\" to the avoid, shift and improve approach.  There will be a move towards shared mobility in a range of ways.  This is a slightly pedantic point.<\/p> <p>  It Deputy Leddin were to table an amendment on Report Stage in the interim I would look have to look to the Office of the Attorney General to see whether there is any reason we could not accept an amendment whereby we change the title of the authority.  We would have to be careful that we would not miss anything because the legislative block is unconsolidated.  I am also conscious of time.  I do not know how long such a trawl would take.  I would certainly consider it if the Deputy were to table an amendment on Report Stage.<\/p><p> On the variable speed limits and the management of it, the primary reason is safety.  Near the port tunnel we have a monitoring service on the M50 and other roads approaching the capital.  I happened to be there last year when a car broke down on the outer lane, the fastest lane, as it were, and was stuck there.  It was an incredibly dangerous situation to look at.  You had passing traffic going at 100 km\/h.  Emergency workers, an ambulance, garda&iacute; or a fire truck coming to that incident would have a real challenge with how to manage what is a real safety problem.  Thus, the primary purpose here is for safety management of the road and potentially other roads, as I said, nominated by the Minister of the day.  That could include part of a national road.  We could do it section by section.<\/p><p> There are other potential benefits, such as alleviating traffic congestion problems.  Often the road is not acting optimally when you have a certain speed limit.  You may see you get greater capacity use out of it by regulating for speed but that is a matter for TII to decide on and we are giving it powers to make those judgment calls.<\/p><p> On the wider issue of avoiding, reducing, controlling, and management of emissions, there may well be cases, for example with issues of serious air pollution, and there are such issues.  There is a real issue around the M50 and the surrounding suburbs.  The emission of particulate matters, ozone, benzene and all sorts of chemicals is a very significant issue.  If TII is looking, as I said, and it can be shown there is an optimal way of managing that, I do not believe this legislation would restrict it but the primary purpose is safety.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022062200002#F02200","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":1139,"content":"<p>That is fair enough.

It might make sense that at certain times you could slow the traffic down to reduce the noise, such as at night-time when people are more disturbed by it.

It is to do with amendment Nos. 72 to 74, inclusive, and the setting of special speed limits.  The Bill seems to deal mainly with national roads, TII roads, and not roads managed by local authorities directly within their areas.  I see in the proposed section 55(10E) there is scope for ministerial policy direction on certain speed limits.  Is there scope to be stronger on that?  We have had the RSA in here.  We have had many activist groups and cycling groups that are all keen to see a 30 km\/h speed limit set in urban areas.  That would of course assist us with active travel and also deal with the issues of noise and pollution that were just spoken about and generally make our roads a little safer and more inviting in the urban centres.  Is there scope within this to be stronger in that the Minister just may, from time to time, issue a policy directive?  I believe it lies with the local authorities to implement 30 km\/h speed zones.  We got advice recently, following committee sessions, there is no legal impediment to local authorities implementing those 30 km\/h zones but that would seem to conflict with what is in the guidelines for setting speed limits.

Typically, these are e-scooters or other similar devices.  In the published Bill, certain technical details characterising such vehicles are included in the revised definition for PPTs.  We are amending paragraph (b) of section 16(e) by lowering the maximum unladen weight permitted to 25 kg and paragraph (d) of section 16(e) by increasing the continuous rated power permitted to 0.5 kW.  The maximum speed of 25 km\/h set out in paragraph (c) of section 16(e) will remain unchanged.  These specifications are proposed as standard for vehicles falling under this category.  Following expert advice, I am also amending paragraph (d) of section 16(e) by clarifying that for vehicles where there is more than one motor, a combined rated power of 0.5 kW is the maximum limit.  Making these changes to the specifications for this class of vehicle will ensure that PPTs remain outside the scope of the EU motor insurance directive, which applies to mechanically propelled vehicles, and consequently will not require insurance for use on Irish roads.<\/p><p>Even in the time since work on this Bill commenced, the reality of a maturing e-scooter market has been noted.  The work of the Road Safety Authority informs our thinking.  My solution is therefore to satisfy the recommendations of that organisation and the wider public interest is to insert or such other values &quot;as the Minister prescribes&rdquo; in paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of section 16(e) in order that the weight, speed, and power output in the definition may be revised as needed through regulations.<\/p><p>This will future-proof our road traffic legislation, allowing us to make necessary updates as the sector grows and providng an opportunity for further consultation once the Bill has been enacted.  Those are the key provisions.  It does not apply to e-bikes which are not powered personal devices.  It does provide a standard provision for e-scooters and other powered personal transporters, PPTs, in the market today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022062200002#H03100","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":1211,"content":"<p>The Minister may have just answered it but for clarity, when I looked at this it seemed that it omits the potential for cargo bikes.

We will probably see that in every city and large town in Ireland in time as it becomes easier to travel in our urban areas by smaller vehicles.  We can expect tradespeople to travel by cargo bike as well as families.  There is evidence that families are getting rid of their second cars and getting a cargo bike in lieu.  I would be concerned that this section is restrictive on cargo bikes and especially the line about reducing down from 55 kg to 25 kg.

There is no suitable mechanism to record PPT supply as vehicles falling into that category do not require registration.  Furthermore, it can be expected that many purchases will be private second-hand sales or will take place on websites based outside the EU.

Under &quot;busway&quot;, section 43 provides for an amendment to the definition of a road in section 2 of the Roads Act 1993.  To provide clarity on what constitutes part of the road, it is proposed to make a change to paragraph (b) by substituting &quot;carriageway (whether single or multiple and whether or not designated for a particular class of vehicle)&quot; with &quot;carriageway (whether single or multiple)&quot; and to paragraph (c) in the definition of &quot;road&quot; by inserting of the word &quot;verge&quot; after &quot;margin&quot;.  These changes are included in the existing Bill, but as further changes are being made to the definition of a road, it is proposed to delete section 43 from the Bill and restate the proposed changes set out above.<\/p><p>There is also an amendment proposed to allow for a change to paragraph (d) of the definition of a road in the Roads Act 1993.  It is proposed to insert the words &quot;used, or the use of which is reasonably required, for&quot; in place of &quot;necessary for&quot;.  The reference to &quot;necessary&quot; potentially sets too high a threshold and needs to be altered to make it clear that the definition extends to anything used or reasonably capable of being used in connection with the safety, convenience, benefit and amenity of road users, including the provision of information.  This amendment will reflect the reality of the range of facilities and infrastructure that is now provided as a matter of course as part of a public road and are not strictly speaking &quot;necessary for&quot; the safety, convenience or amenity of road users.<\/p><p>On the second of these amendments, which deals with CCTV, it recently came to the attention of the Department that Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, is using a network of CCTV for cameras to monitor traffic and to assist with enforcement.  Local authorities use similar systems for traffic management and monitoring.  Cameras are used to monitor and manage the movement of general traffic, public transport and various other different transport modes.  These allow TII and local authorities to identify incidents, accidents, congestion, delays and other appropriate actions.  Enforcement cameras can be located at toll plazas or along road gantries, such as those on the M50.<\/p><p>At each enforcement location, the system of enforcement cameras monitors vehicles and captures necessary information, such as number plates, to support the management of the road.  These cameras are generally fixed mounted and generate images that are used for post-image capture processing, such as automatic number plate recognition.<\/p><p> Traffic cameras are also used to monitor and manage other incidents, such as marches, protests and other events, including weather-related events.  TII and road authorities share the data from these cameras with a number of bodies, in particular the emergency services, public transport operators such as Dublin Bus and Luas, and local authorities.  On behalf of TII, several contracted service providers also have access to this information.<\/p><p> These cameras, and particularly the use of data, are being used without a proper legislative basis.  The enforcement use of cameras, by its nature, requires identifying individual vehicles.  While most of the traffic management information is captured from a distance and does not include individually distinctive information, it is possible for the cameras to zoom in, and some images of registration plates and at times faces may be captured.  This amounts to personally identifying data and can raise concerns about the protection of the data in question and of individual rights in light of the general data protection regulation, GDPR.<\/p><p> Legal advice obtained is that this matter can be addressed by regulations in the short term.  However, this solution will have effect only until 6 December 2022 due to section 6(2) of the Data Sharing and Governance Act 2019.  It is, therefore, imperative that proper provision be put in place in an Act of the Oireachtas before that date.<\/p><p> It is proposed to address this situation by an amendment to insert a new section 77A into the Roads Act 1993 to allow for the provision of cameras by both TII and the local authorities, including CCTV cameras, and for the use of data from those cameras.  The proposed additional section 77A will give a basis for the provision of cameras, including setting up and operation of cameras, first, for the safe and efficient management, operation and use of public roads, including traffic management and providing information to the public; second, for charging and collecting tolls and the operation of toll roads; third, for the deterrence, prevention, investigation and detection of criminal offences, including road traffic offences; and, fourth, for any other purpose to be prescribed by the Minister.  The amendment will also address the publishing by TII or each relevant local authority of a schedule of the cameras in question operating on public roads.  Finally, we will provide a legal basis for the sharing and processing or use of data from cameras in operation between a local authority, TII, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the National Transport Authority, the Road Safety Authority and any other person the Minister considers necessary for the purposes outlined above.<\/p><p> We are making sure that appropriate protections are in place for the sharing of data, for data sharing agreements, for the safeguarding of data and for directions, guidelines, standards and regulations.  This is obviously not a position any of us want to be in.  Traffic cameras are an essential tool for managing traffic.  Come December, it will be necessary to have primary legislation in place to enable them to be used in a way which protects data in an appropriate manner.  I hope the committee will appreciate that we reacted promptly to this matter as soon as it came to our attention and that we have developed the necessary proposals here to address it.  In fact, it might have been a Limerick case that prompted this need for legislation before 6 December.  It is a highly sensitive issue.  It is important that we get the regulations right and that we respect the need for privacy as contained within the GDPR but also that we do not have an unenforceable use of cameras, which would be the case if we did not legislate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022062200002#L01500","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":1295,"content":"<p>The Minister might give us an update on the engagement in this regard.

However, as a cyclist, I have experienced close passes and while I do not have a camera on my helmet, many cyclists do.  There is the ability to upload and send those data to the Garda or whoever it might be.  We all frequently witness very poor traffic management and behaviour in our towns and villages, such as illegal parking on footpaths and in disability bays.  Do we have the opportunity here to expand the use of cameras for managing and monitoring traffic to allow citizens who observe traffic offences to upload this to the Garda?  I understand the photograph itself may not be an admissible piece of evidence in order to take a prosecution but it will allow the Garda to build up a pattern, for example, if they are getting 40 photographs a week of illegal parking in a certain area.  While the photograph itself may not be used directly, the accumulation of photographs kept by the Garda would inform it of traffic offences that are happening regularly.

As Deputy Matthews noted, there is value in uploading that kind of evidence to a central system and that value may go as far as taking action against individual motorists and road users.  While it seems to fit in here and is something we should be seriously considering, it is not in the provisions of the Bill.

I think we should be very ambitious in how we move forward in this particular area, as others have mentioned, in replicating the good work of other jurisdictions.  One of those jurisdictions quite close to us, just across the Irish Sea, has successfully put in place a portal for the uploading of dashcam evidence and camera evidence from all road users, not alone cyclists but also motorists and others.<\/p><p>It is also important, as others have mentioned, that cameras are used within buses and bus lanes in general to ensure they are the most efficient way of moving people about, particularly in more heavily trafficked towns and cities.<\/p><p> I recently asked the Minister for Justice a parliamentary question about the creation of a portal for the uploading of dashcam evidence.  The Minister's response was somewhat neutral but reasonably supportive.  It referred to the Department of Transport, stating, \"The Department of Transport has advised that any decision to allow film by members of the public to be used in evidence in road traffic cases would raise questions of reliability of, and possible tampering with, the apparatus used, as well as potential privacy issues.\"  This will hopefully address some of the privacy issues.  The fact of the matter is the Garda has sought and secured numerous successful prosecutions in our courts over the last four to five years using camera evidence submitted by cyclists.  There is already a provision within legislation, due to good work done by the Minister's predecessor Shane Ross, creating a unique offence of dangerous overtaking of a cyclist.  That legislation, combined with camera evidence submitted by cyclists, has already provided for the successful prosecution of a number of motorists with penalty points issued and fines imposed.  There is no question about the reliability of this evidence.  The courts have already decided it is perfectly acceptable to use that evidence in the prosecution of such cases.  I implore the Minister and his colleagues to engage amongst themselves and with the Department of Justice to provide for such a portal under the very significant road safety plan recently published by the Road Safety Authority and the Department, Towards Vision Zero.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022062200002#M00500","speaker":"1483","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":1300,"content":"<p>This is a critical issue for us as policymakers and legislators.  Digital video CCTV cameras are increasingly prevalent and full of potential, as well as risks.  We need to be careful in getting the balance right between the requirement for privacy and the need for good enforcement of road safety and other measures.  There was extensive consultation with the Office of the Attorney General on these provisions regarding CCTV cameras because it had a central role in assessing some of the recent court cases and advising us on the steps we are taking.  We have also referred the matter to the Data Protection Commission and will have to continue to do so very extensively because it has a critical role in making sure whatever regulations are put in place get that balance right between the right to privacy and the protections needed in the sharing of data.  This legislation solely relates to cameras operated by TII and local authorities, for whatever purposes.  It does not relate to personal private cameras and how they might be used in evidence.  That is a matter for the Department of Justice and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There will be evolving legislation in that area and the Minister for Justice is working on that.  This does not relate to Garda cameras or cameras other than the ones operated by TII and local authorities.<\/p> <p>  This is a step in the right direction.  It gives certainty around the use of these cameras but it does not address the wider fundamental issues raised here.  I understand the potential benefits from the use of personal cameras, and prosecutions on the back of that, but I have some concerns about this in a world where AI capabilities and other mechanisms are being used.  Concerns around the erosion of personal privacy are real and we have to get the balance right in how we use this technology.  What we are doing here primarily relates to traffic management.  While faces or numberplates may occasionally be seen, this legislation does not carry those risks of breaching people's privacy.  The regulations we will create in conjunction with the Data Protection Commissioner will give us assurance in that regard and we will not do it without that reassurance.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the wider issue of the use of personal and-or Garda cameras, I would be slightly nervous about adopting what the UK or other countries are doing .

We are inserting a new section 13(7A), which will allow a road authority the power to carry out works to reduce, increase or modify specified items within an existing road or forming part of a road, which may be necessary for the reconfiguration of the road.  This is essential for the BusConnects project, given the need for core bus corridors, which will require the power to reconfigure some roads.<\/p> <p>  Section 13(8) is being amended to clarify the powers of the road authority in relation to works on, in, under, or over a road and provides clarity regarding the position on changes to pipes or other similar infrastructure that may currently be considered to be under the road, rather than forming part of the road.  This section updates section 13(8) to allow for any structure or infrastructure to be provided on, in, under or over a road, including for the charging of electric vehicles and the provision of information to road users.<\/p> <p>  The amendments simply reflect the existing practice in relation to maintenance and improvement of public roads and the installation of infrastructure beneath public roads.  The items listed in this amendment to 13(8) are those required to be undertaken in relation to BusConnects and in respect of which there appears to be a current gap in terms of spelling out these powers of a road authority to undertake these works, which exist as a matter of course for other undertakers.<\/p> <p>  The insertion of a new subsection (11) provides that subsection (10) of section 13 of the Roads Act will not be applicable to the NTA when it is exercising the powers of a road authority in accordance with the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008.  Section 13(10) provides that a road authority can give consent to a person to undertake specific actions in relation to a road, subject to such conditions, restrictions or requirements as the road authority thinks fit.<\/p> <p>  Given that the authority is exercising the powers of a road authority in accordance with subsection (2)(b) or (5)(a) of section 44 of the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008, but is not a road authority, it was considered that section 13(10) should not apply to the NTA, as to apply that section could lead to the authority having to apply to the road authority for consent.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 64 deletes \"mitigating\" and substitutes \"taking any measure whatsoever that may be reasonably required to mitigate, directly or indirectly,\".

Section 56 of this new Part concerns functions of the Minister for Transport in respect of zero-to-low-emission vehicles.  This new section, along with the associated amendments in this group, are related to the establishment of an office of low-emission vehicles, as recommended in the electric vehicles policy pathway report that was published last September and mandated under action No. 274 of the Climate Action Plan.  Preparations are under way in my Department to establish this office, to be known as &quot;Zero Emission Vehicles Ireland&quot;, or &quot;ZEVI&quot;, which will play an important role in our transition to zero-emission vehicles.  ZEVI will have a broad remit in support of the Government's goal of achieving almost 1 million electric vehicles, EVs, on Irish roads by 2030 and will play an important role in Ireland's transition to zero-emission vehicles by co-ordinating measures to support the uptake of EVs and the roll-out of charge point infrastructure.  It will work across the government and society to support this transition.  Its operations will include: supports for EV uptake; infrastructure delivery; strategy; and policy lead, including in respect of taxation and regulation, research and innovation, communications and public and stakeholder engagement.  ZEVI will have an objective voice on EVs, providing advice to the public and private sectors and carrying out significant stakeholder engagement.<\/p><p>Currently, ZEVI's functions are split across four organisations: my Department; the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI; the NTA; and TII.  It is intended that these functions will continue to be delivered by the named organisations but under the umbrella of the new office, which will bring these policy and delivery functions into one hybrid organisation with a single identity and focus to enable delivery of the ambitious EV targets under the Climate Action Plan.<\/p><p>I anticipate that ZEVI will be established in my Department next month.<\/p><p>To facilitate the establishment of the office within my Department, the new sections 56(1) and 56(2) give the Minister for Transport new statutory functions in relation to zero- to low-emission vehicles and the related charging and refuelling infrastructure to enable him or her, as the case may be, to establish ZEVI to operate in the EV and infrastructure space.  ZEVI will be mandated to promote and seek to accelerate the uptake of EVs and to promote, increase and develop public awareness of such vehicles and the availability of the related infrastructure to support this uptake.<\/p><p> In this context, the new section 56(3) sets out a number of actions the Minister for Transport, essentially ZEVI, may take, as required, to achieve these objectives.  The Minister may assist in the provision of recharging and refuelling infrastructure, carry out EV and infrastructure training and research, promote and assist research of new EV technologies, advise on design, standards, accessibility, operation and use of EVs and related infrastructure and, critically, engage with key stakeholders with regard to electricity network development requirements to facilitate EV infrastructure. <\/p><p> In parallel to the foregoing, amendment No. 61 inserts a new section 45, which in turn amends section 19(1) of the Road Traffic Act 1993 concerning the specific functions of the NRA by inserting a new section 19(1)(cc) to confer a new function on the NRA or, more specifically, TII.  This section will enable TII to prepare schemes for the provision of recharging and refuelling infrastructure for zero to low-emission vehicles in relation to national roads or proposed such roads.  TII will be empowered to provide and maintain this network.  The Minister for Transport may prescribe, by regulation, the vehicles in respect of which one or more refuelling or recharging networks will be delivered by TII.  The purpose of this amendment is to enable TII to deliver EV charging infrastructure on the national roads network in the context of its role as a roads authority<\/p><p> Government amendment No. 77 provides for the consequent amendment of the Long Title to the Bill arising from the proposed inclusion in the Bill of matters relating to new functions for the Minister for Transport in respect of zero- to low-emission vehicles and related infrastructure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022062200002#P01900","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":1339,"content":"<p>ZEVI sounds like a brand of clothes.

In encouraging the uptake of electric vehicles, which rolling out the network will do, we have to ensure that we are not encouraging extra-large electric vehicles onto our roads.  These take up an unnecessary amount of space and the extra weight they carry makes them less efficient.  There seems to be a general move among car purchasers in Ireland to go for those larger vehicles.  This is probably more of a policy issue than something to cover within legislation but there are probably legislative changes that could be made to disincentivise the purchase of unnecessarily large EVs and to encourage the purchase of much more suitable EVs for personal use.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022062200002#Q01700","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":1355,"content":"<p>I support Deputy Matthews's comments.

The first is that \"the scheme or proposed road development is of strategic, regional or national importance\".  The second is that \"there are conflicting objectives in the development plan or the objectives are not clearly stated, insofar as the scheme or proposed road development is concerned\".  The third relates to the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008, the regional, spatial and economic strategy for the area and any statutory obligations therein.  The fourth is that \"the scheme or proposed road development should be approved having regard to the pattern of development, and planning permissions granted, in the area since the making of the development plan.\"  It seems that there is very wide scope for this to be misinterpreted or applied in a way that is not intended, especially when one considers the stories around An Bord Plean&aacute;la in recent weeks.  With the way An Bord Plean&aacute;la is set up, a great deal of power is vested in very few people.  It seems that this section might cause some difficulty for Ministers down the line.

I will start with the last one.<\/p><p>As I read it, amendment No. 61 amends that section with regard to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  In section 45(19)(1)(cc), we are saying that we would also \"prepare, or arrange for the preparation of, schemes for the provision of a safe and efficient network of recharging infrastructure and refuelling infrastructure for such zero to low emission vehicles as the Minister may prescribe and provide and maintain, or secure the provision and maintenance of, such a network\".  That amends the same section the Deputy is concerned about, if I am correct on this.<\/p><p> I will go back to the wider point about the BusConnects infrastructure we need to deliver.  People will be aware that the Government will have real difficulty in meeting our climate change targets, particularly in transport, which is probably the most challenging area.  One of the mechanisms the Government is developing is the acceleration of certain key areas, one of which is sustainable mobility.  That will require some of the infrastructure we are looking for to be delivered in a very quick timeframe, especially in towns and cities throughout the country.  For that to work, An Bord Plean&aacute;la will have to have a critical role because if the ordinary timeframes it takes for us to deliver infrastructure apply, for example, the cycleway to Clontarf being built at present has been in the planning system or process for almost ten years, we will have to accelerate those timeframes.<\/p><p> That has been recognised by the Government through a variety of different factors.  We have increased the staffing within the likes of the NTA and our Department to be able to do that work.  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, has also recognised that An Bord Plean&aacute;la needs enhanced staffing and other resources, especially in the public planning realm and ecology, including the transport planning and marine planning side, to be able to deliver quick decisions, particularly on projects that will be central to meeting our climate targets.  We have set up a special acceleration team to look at this.  We are looking for projects within local authorities throughout the country that might be what could be called pathfinder projects, which can be delivered very quickly at low cost.  Obviously, these have to be within our planning system and planning structures but it will require An Bord Plean&aacute;la to play its part in making sure such decisions are given very quick attention and that it has the resources in place to be able to turn around decisions.  This cannot come from the top down and it cannot ignore local and public interests.  It has to come from the local authorities.  It has to be from the councillors themselves looking at what the examples might be in their towns, cities or villages.<\/p><p> That transformative approach to accelerate development will characterise where we are at present.  The historical approach, which was very much based on roads and a sprawled, ever-outwards development model, will not work in a low-carbon environment.  The overriding legislation behind all this is our climate law, as well as European law, which requires us to meet these targets.  If we fail to do so in transport, we will have to introduce policy measures to go quicker and faster.  The historical concern the Deputy has would be the case if the situation continues, but it will not be the defining characteristic.<\/p><p> I will briefly address the issue of idling vehicles raised by Deputy Matthews.  Many of those measures, and some of the regulations, are sometimes best done at European level where, for example, new cars could have mechanisms whereby they are switched off.  Certain cars already do that.  However, the wider reality is, and I expect it will come up at the European Council meeting next week, Europe is moving towards a stage where there will be no new combustion engine vehicles by 2035.  There has to be recognition that we are going towards better electric vehicles.  It would be terrible for us if we just replaced a fossil fuel vehicle fleet with a heavy vehicle fleet that used up a lot of other resources, be those rare earths, lithium or other batteries.  What the Deputy said about the need to make sure we are very efficient in our transport system is true.  It is not just about replacing all of one type of car with another type of car.  As the Deputy said, the characteristics of our current fleet, where almost half the private cars last year were heavy vehicles by any definition, will not work.<\/p><p> This Bill cannot solve all those problems.  This specific amendment No. 61 relates to the EV charging infrastructure I mentioned, as well as the creation of an EV office.  Those wider concerns are best addressed elsewhere.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022062200002#Q02000","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":1359,"content":"<p>Does this EV office include zero emission vehicles such as bikes, e-bikes and e-cargo bikes?

I would have thought it highly unlikely a local authority would put a proposal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la that contravenes its own development plan.  This is something that will probably come from TII or the Department of Transport.  The section goes on to set out that these conditions are that: \"the scheme or proposed road development is of strategic, regional or national importance; (b) there are conflicting objectives in the development plan or the objectives are not clearly stated, insofar as the scheme or proposed road development is concerned; (c) the scheme or proposed road development should be approved having regard to the transport strategy...; (d) the scheme or proposed road development should be approved having regard to the pattern of development, and planning permissions granted, in the area since the making of the development plan.\"  What is the purpose behind this section?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022062200002#R00600","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":1364,"content":"<p>The main purpose is to support the NTA rather than TII.

As I said, that will be a critical role of the NTA and the local authorities, which are key.  We will not force it from the top down.  The funding will be made available to those local authorities that want to be proactive.  There may be specific examples, however, although only in very limited circumstances, where An Bord Plean&aacute;la may decide.  The section could be read in different ways, but the way it is drafted reflects the need to give An Bord Plean&aacute;la such powers where \"the scheme or proposed road ... is of strategic, regional or national importance\".

I think the debate has been very useful and very good.  This amendment is more on the technical nature.  Amendment No. 76 is designed to address an irregularity in the enabling provisions for certain road traffic regulations with regard to the construction and use of vehicles, that is, the maximum weights and dimensions permitted for vehicles driven on our roads.  Based on advice from the Attorney General's office and my Department&rsquo;s legal advisers, I am proposing to insert new text to state that the construction and use of vehicles regulations made between 2003 and 2007, and those made in 2015 and 2018, do not have statutory effect and were validly made under the Road Traffic Acts, including section 2 of the Road Traffic Act 2006.  This change confers the appropriate <i>vires <\/i>to give effect to European legislation and allows us to make further amendments to those regulations from time to time as needed.<\/p><p>As I said, it is a purely technical amendment and so does not itself imply any change to broader policy in the area.  Our next steps, once this has come into effect, will be to transpose European regulations to allow an increase in permitted weights for zero-emission vehicles as part of our ongoing efforts to support the switch away from fossil fuels.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 78 follows this with a consequential change to the Long Title of the Bill.  A gap has been seen in the implementation of EU directives and this is an opportunity to clean it up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022062200002#S04300","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1655852400,"counter":1411,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1655852400,"counter":1412,"content":"<p>TITLE<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":1413,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 77:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 7, line 5, after &ldquo;Act&rdquo; to insert the following:  \t&ldquo;to confer functions on the Minister for Transport in relation to zero to low emission vehicles and recharging and refuelling infrastructure relating to such vehicles;&rdquo;.  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022062200002#S04600","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1655852400,"counter":1414,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":1415,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 78:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 7, line 7, after &ldquo;2008;&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;to provide for the effect and validity of certain regulations;&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022062200002#S04800","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1655852400,"counter":1416,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1655852400,"counter":1417,"content":"<p>Title, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":1418,"content":"<p>Pursuant to Standing Order 187(3), the clerk will report specifically to the D&aacute;il that the committee has amended the Title.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022062200002#S05200","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1655852400,"counter":1419,"content":"<p>Bill reported with amendments.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1655852400,"counter":1420,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and his officials for their engagement with the committee today, for their hard work and for the briefing they provided earlier in the week.
