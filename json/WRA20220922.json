I also attended and spoke at the IRHA Annual Conference earlier this month.<\/p>  <p>  I will not pre-empt the Budget, however the Government is fully aware of the increased costs that the haulage sector, like many others, has been facing over recent months. <\/p>  <p>  The Government has already taken a number of steps to support the sector.<\/p>  <p>  In March, the Government approved specific financial support for the sector via the Licensed Haulage Emergency Support Scheme. The Scheme provided a temporary financial support of &euro;100 per week, for eight weeks, for each eligible heavy goods vehicle authorised on the licence of a road haulage operator as of 11 March 2022. It was administered by the Department of Transport, and it is now closed. There was good uptake of the Scheme, with over &euro;15.6 million paid out to c.3,100 operators.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Diesel Rebate Scheme remains available to licensed haulage operators in respect of vehicles over 7.5 tonnes. At diesel prices over &euro;1.43 (including VAT), the maximum rebate of 7.5 cent per litre is provided. It has always been the case that some operators that are eligible for the DRS do not take it up. The Department strongly encourages all such operators to make the most of the supports that are available. <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, tax debt &ldquo;warehoused&rdquo; during the COVID crisis remains at an interest rate of 0% for the remainder of this year.<\/p>  <p>  More generally, the Government also acted to offset the rising cost of fuel through a reduction in Excise on fuels - a reduction of 20 cent on petrol and 15 cent on diesel fuel. While this measure was originally proposed to last until 31 August 2022 the Government has extended it out to Budget Day 2022. This measure provides assistance to all citizens and businesses to help mitigate the impact of recent fuel price increases.<\/p>  <p>  Since early March with the benefit of the excise reduction, support under the Licensed Haulage Support Scheme and the ongoing Diesel Rebate relief, haulage businesses will have had the opportunity to revise and renegotiate contracts with their clients in order to reflect increased prices, as is an unfortunate reality in all sectors across the economy.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has limited resources but through the Excise measure, as well as the Licensed Haulage Emergency Support Scheme, it has responded to help to ease the impact of these price increases. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200055#WRA05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bus Services","counter":58,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200055#WRA05700"},{"type":"question","counter":59,"qnumday":30,"qnumall":"[45984\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200055#WRA05800","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"whether the difficulty by bus companies in recruiting and retaining staff will delay or hinder plans to improve public transport and to reach climate targets; if his Department plans to deal with staffing levels specifically on public service obligation services; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1565","askee":"1465"},{"type":"question","counter":60,"qnumday":43,"qnumall":"[45694\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200055#WRA05900","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he will detail the shortfall in bus driver numbers in all public service obligation service providers including Bus &Eacute;ireann, Dublin Bus and Go Ahead; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1486","askee":"1465"},{"type":"question","counter":61,"qnumday":89,"qnumall":"[45696\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200055#WRA06000","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the current difficulties in Bus &Eacute;ireann in relation to the retention of drivers and its impact on services across Ireland; if he has any plans to raise these shortages with the National Transport Authority or company management; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1486","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":62,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30, 43 and 89 together.<\/p>  <p>  As with many industries, bus operators are experiencing significant challenges in recruiting qualified staff following the return to economic activity in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic.

This is a Joint initiative between public transport providers Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann\/Transdev (LUAS)\/Dublin Bus\/Bus &Eacute;ireann and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Community Engagement Units at Kevin Street, Store Street and Cabra. <\/p>  <p>  -  Transdev\/ LUAS employ 50 security staff.

The work of their School and Community Co-ordinators has also proven highly successful in encouraging young people to respect their bus and has assisted greatly in the reduction of incidents of anti-social behaviour.<\/p>  <p>  -  Beyond this Dublin Bus has a strong and close working relationship with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have set up a number of community forums in different areas across the city. These forums are made up of Dublin Bus representatives, the Garda&iacute;, local area representatives, community groups and Trade Union Representatives.<\/p>  <p>  -  Bus &Eacute;ireann has similarly also invested in extensive CCTV coverage throughout its fleet for the protection of passengers and staff. Emergency support for drivers is provided through 24-hour control centres and any incidents of anti-social behaviour are fully investigated and followed up with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as required.<\/p>  <p>  -  All Bus &Eacute;ireann city and town buses are fitted with driver security screens. Security personnel are employed in our larger bus stations and extensive CCTV is also in operation throughout all stations to ensure the security of our staff, customers and property.  Furthermore, customer research shows that 93% of Bus &Eacute;ireann customers feel safe and secure during their journeys.<\/p>  <p>  Further, the Third National Strategy for Domestic, Sexual and Gender-Based Violence references the implementation of specific Domestic, Sexual and Gender-Based Violence actions in the annual public transport passenger safety and personal security report (action 1.6.3 in the Implementation Plan). The NTA have advised that they are in the process of designing the report contents, with the detailed work due to be undertaken next year, which will supplement the Authority&rsquo;s annual customer survey on satisfaction with their personal safety on board public transport as well as at the stop\/station. The first Annual public transport passenger safety and personal security report will be delivered next year.<\/p>  <p>  The combined interventions implemented to date across our public transport services have substantially helped to tackle anti-social behaviour; however, this is an issue which will require on-going monitoring. As such, I am committed to continuing to work collectively with all stakeholders to ensure the safest possible travel environment for members of the public, and the safest possible working environment for the employees providing our valuable public transport services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200056#WRB05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":117,"content":"<p>Question No. 48 answered with Question No. 26.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bus &Eacute;ireann","counter":118,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200056#WRB05600"},{"type":"question","counter":119,"qnumday":49,"qnumall":"[45985\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200056#WRB05700","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"his concerns that the working conditions and pay of drivers in Bus &Eacute;ireann may be affecting the staffing levels needed at the company; if he will meet with the National Transport Authority to examine whether their contracting and tendering model is fit for purpose; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1565","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":120,"content":"<p>As Minister for Transport, I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport.

While the establishment of air services is a commercial matter between airports, airlines and other market actors, the Regional Airports Programme provides for a PSO air services scheme in compliance with Regulation (EC) No. 1008\/2008. Under this scheme financial support is provided to airlines that operate essential air services to isolated areas &ndash; those not adequately served by alternative transport services to administrative, business, education and medical centres.  <\/p>  <p>  With regard to expanding current PSO services, over the past 10 years Ireland has significantly rationalised PSO air services, with only one such route now supported under this scheme between Donegal\/Dublin.   It would be a significant shift to expand Government policy for the support of PSO services beyond that of support on domestic routes. It would also be important to consider the potential impact of such a policy, not only on the Exchequer, but also on similar routes operating on a commercial basis from other regional airports.  <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, it is Government policy that State-owned airports operate on a fully commercial basis without recourse to Exchequer funding.  However, in light of the devastating impacts of COVID-19 and in recognition of the importance of Shannon Airport and Cork Airport to their respective regional and local economies, government provided on an exceptional basis funding to both Shannon and Cork airports.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the horizontal COVID-19 supports provided to all businesses, over &euro;22 million in Exchequer supports were allocated to Shannon Airport in 2021.  This year, in light of its suppressed passenger numbers, Shannon Airport can also avail of supports under the Regional Airports Programme.  I allocated &euro;4.3m in capital funding to Shannon Airport in April which will support the completion of a broad range of safety, security and sustainability focused projects.  Shannon Airport is also eligible for operational grant-aid under the Programme which I will allocate to eligible airports later this year from an overall budget of &euro;22 million.

These include; <\/p>  <p>  -  On the 29th of July, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, Transdev &amp;amp; An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na carried out a joint awareness day (operation twintrack) to prevent anti-social behaviour on our services and to raise awareness of staying safe on public transport.<\/p>  <p>  -  Joint Garda &amp;amp; Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann high visibility public safety operations took place across the network over the Easter period with a number of fines issued.

Additionally, there is the deployment of public facing Security Teams in identified Anti-social behaviour hot spots across the DART and Rail Network.<\/p>  <p>  -  There are nine Rapid Response Hubs in operation across the I&Eacute; Intercity Network with the latest, Mullingar, having come into operation on 9th May 2022 (The 9 locations: Mallow, Limerick Junction, Thurles, Portlaoise, Athlone, Kildare, Longford, Castlerea and Mullingar). These hubs are now fully operational with all onboard staff having dedicated phone numbers for each of the hub locations in the event they require assistance.  These hubs provide reassurance for both staff and customers.  The Kilkenny hub is also due to come into operation today, which will complete the first phase of this initiative, bringing the total number of Rapid Response Hubs in operation to ten.  This means should on-board staff request assistance by calling ahead to the next Garda Rapid Response Hub, they will receive priority service to deal with any issue.  Since coming into operation, this level of response from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has had a very positive impact in reducing the potential for such passenger issues escalating.<\/p>  <p>  -  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann have recruited a Security Enforcement &amp;amp; Compliance Manager and a Crime Prevention &amp;amp; Antisocial Behaviour Officer to design out crime.<\/p>  <p>  -  CCTV is available on most trains and has successfully been used on numerous occasions in securing prosecutions. They are also in place in stations.<\/p>  <p>  -  A DART text alert line has been established for discrete reporting of Anti-Social incidents.<\/p>  <p>  -  In respect of Dublin Services, Public Transport Hubs have been established for Heuston Plaza and Connolly Plaza.  A third one at Broombridge, Cabra, will come into operation shortly.  This is a Joint initiative between public transport providers Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann\/Transdev (LUAS)\/Dublin Bus\/Bus &Eacute;ireann and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Community Engagement Units at Kevin Street, Store Street and Cabra. <\/p>  <p>  -  Transdev\/ LUAS employ 50 security staff. These staff are involved in maintaining safety and security on the Luas, along with enforcing the Luas bye-laws. They liaise with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na regularly as part of their work.<\/p>  <p>  -  In relation to security on our public bus services, the entire Dublin Bus fleet is fully fitted with CCTV cameras, with up to 11 internal cameras and three external cameras fitted on the more modern vehicles in the fleet. Each vehicle is equipped with a radio, which facilitates immediate contact to the Central Control Centre.<\/p>  <p>  -  Dublin Bus has also re-introduced their Schools Education Programme (previously suspended due to Covid-19) which involves educating young people about the importance of the bus in their lives and in their local community. The work of their School and Community Co-ordinators has also proven highly successful in encouraging young people to respect their bus and has assisted greatly in the reduction of incidents of anti-social behaviour.<\/p>  <p>  -  Beyond this Dublin Bus has a strong and close working relationship with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have set up a number of community forums in different areas across the city. These forums are made up of Dublin Bus representatives, the Garda&iacute;, local area representatives, community groups and Trade Union Representatives.<\/p>  <p>  -  Bus &Eacute;ireann has similarly also invested in extensive CCTV coverage throughout its fleet for the protection of passengers and staff. Emergency support for drivers is provided through 24-hour control centres and any incidents of anti-social behaviour are fully investigated and followed up with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as required.<\/p>  <p>  -  All Bus &Eacute;ireann city and town buses are fitted with driver security screens. Security personnel are employed in our larger bus stations and extensive CCTV is also in operation throughout all stations to ensure the security of our staff, customers and property.  Furthermore, customer research shows that 93% of Bus &Eacute;ireann customers feel safe and secure during their journeys.<\/p>  <p>  Further, the Third National Strategy for Domestic, Sexual and Gender-Based Violence references the implementation of specific Domestic, Sexual and Gender-Based Violence actions in the annual public transport passenger safety and personal security report (action 1.6.3 in the Implementation Plan). The NTA have advised that they are in the process of designing the report contents, with the detailed work due to be undertaken next year, which will supplement the Authority&rsquo;s annual customer survey on satisfaction with their personal safety on board public transport as well as at the stop\/station. The first Annual public transport passenger safety and personal security report will be delivered next year.<\/p>  <p>  The combined interventions implemented to date across our public transport services have substantially helped to tackle anti-social behaviour; however, this is an issue which will require on-going monitoring. As such, I am committed to continuing to work collectively with all stakeholders to ensure the safest possible travel environment for members of the public, and the safest possible working environment for the employees providing our valuable public transport services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200058#WRD04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"question","counter":223,"qnumday":88,"qnumall":"[45982\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200058#WRD04600","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if his Department will review train schedules and timetables between Cork and Limerick; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1456","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":224,"content":"<p>As the Minister for Transport, I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport; however, I am not involved in the day-to-day provision and operation of public transport. <\/p><p>The issue raised by the Deputy regarding train schedules and timetables between Cork and Limerick is an operational matter for the National Transport Authority (NTA) in conjunction with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and I have therefore forwarded the Deputy's question to the NTA for direct reply. <\/p><p>Please advise my private office if you do not receive a response within ten working days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200058#WRD04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":225,"content":"<p>Question No. 89 answered with Question No. 30.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bus Services","counter":226,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200058#WRD04900"},{"type":"question","counter":227,"qnumday":90,"qnumall":"[46274\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200058#WRD05000","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the progress that has been made with the roll-out of Connecting Ireland bus services; the amount allocated to the project in 2022; the estimated expenditure in 2023; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1575","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":228,"content":"<p>As Minister for Transport, I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport.<\/p>  <p>  The National Transport Authority (NTA) has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public passenger transport services nationally.

Until the changes I brought in as part of the Finance Act 2019, Ireland&rsquo;s vehicle benefit-in-kind regime was unusual in that there was no overall CO2 rationale in the regime. This is despite a CO2 based vehicle BIK regime being legislated for as far back as 2008 (but never having been commenced). In Finance Act 2019, I legislated for a CO2-based BIK regime for company cars from 1 January 2023. From that date the amount taxable as BIK remains determined by the car&rsquo;s original market value (OMV) and the annual business kilometres driven, while new CO2 emissions-based bands will determine whether a standard, discounted, or surcharged rate is taxable. The number of mileage bands is reduced from five to four. EVs will benefit from a preferential rate of BIK, ranging from 9 &ndash; 22.5% depending on mileage. Fossil-fuel vehicles will be subject to higher BIK rates, up to 37.5%. This new structure with CO2-based discounts and surcharges will incentivise employers to provide employees with low-emission cars. <\/p>  <p>  I am aware, there have been arguments surrounding the mileage bands in the new BIK structure as they can be perceived as incentivising higher mileage to avail of lower rates, leading to higher levels of emissions. The rationale behind the mileage bands is that the greater the business mileage, the more the car is a benefit to the company rather than its employee (on average); and the more the car depreciates in value, the less of a benefit it is to the employee (in years 2 and 3) as the asset from which the benefit is derived is depreciating faster. Mileage bands also ensure that cars more integral to the conduct of business receive preferential tax treatment.<\/p>  <p>  I believe that better value for money for the taxpayer is achieved by curtailing the amount of subsidies available and building an environmental rationale directly into the BIK regime. It was determined in this context that reforming the BIK system to include emissions bands provides for a more sustainable environmental rationale than the continuation of the current system with exemptions for electric vehicles (EVs).  This will bring the taxation system around company cars into step with other CO2-based motor taxes as well as the long-established CO2-based vehicle BIK regimes in other member states.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the above and  in light of government commitments on climate change, Budget 2022 extended the preferential BIK treatment for EVs to end 2025 with a tapering mechanism on the vehicle value threshold. This BIK exemption forms part of a broader series of very generous measures to support the uptake of EVs, including a reduced rate of 7% VRT, a VRT relief of up to &euro;5,000, low motor tax of &euro;120 per annum, SEAI grants, discounted tolls fees, and 0% BIK on electric charging.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, it should be noted that this new BIK charging mechanism was legislated for in 2019 and was announced as part of Budget 2020. I am satisfied that this has provided a sufficient lead in time to adapt to this new system before its implementation in 2023. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200059#WRE01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":242,"qnumday":107,"qnumall":"[46250\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200059#WRE01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on the latest recommendations from the Commission on Taxation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1473","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":243,"qnumday":117,"qnumall":"[46048\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200059#WRE01300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on the taxation commission report; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1596","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":244,"qnumday":158,"qnumall":"[46197\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200059#WRE01400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the aspects of the recommendations of the recent Report on the Commission on Taxation which he supports; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1522","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":245,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 107, 117 and 158 together.<\/p>  <p>  The Commission on Taxation and Welfare was an independent group that was established in April 2021 as a result of a commitment in the Programme for Government. It was asked to independently consider how best the taxation and welfare systems can support economic activity, and promote increased employment and prosperity while ensuring that there are sufficient resources available to meet the costs of the public services and supports in the medium and longer term.<\/p>  <p>  &lsquo;Foundations for the Future&rsquo;, the Report of the Commission on Taxation and Welfare, was published on 14 September. It is a wide ranging report that contains over 500 pages and 116 recommendations relating to the future of our taxation and welfare systems.<\/p>  <p>  The report poses serious questions that we as a society must carefully consider. The recommendations will foster real debate around how we reform our tax and welfare systems over the longer term in order to safeguard their sustainability and adapt to a rapidly changing environment.

Just this month my Department published analysis highlighting the fiscal vulnerabilities stemming from the upward shift in corporate tax receipts in recent years in a paper titled <i>De-risking the Public Finances - Assessing Corporation Tax Receipts<\/i>. <\/p><p>Analysis contained in this publication shows the share of overall tax revenue accounted for by corporation tax receipts is now at historically high levels.

As a result, there is a strong argument to treat a portion of corporation tax receipts as volatile, and hence, potentially non-stable, in nature. In doing so, we can address a key risk to the public finances and thereby help ensure our country&rsquo;s fiscal sustainability. The paper goes on to suggest that ring-fencing such windfall revenues in a forward-looking fund, such as a Resilience Fund or a re-launched version of the National Pension Reserve Fund, is one option to safeguard the future sustainability of the public finances.<\/p><p>In addition, in order to highlight this ongoing volatility risk, my Department will publish an estimate of the budgetary position excluding identified windfall receipts.

Aspects of the confidential information in question were provided to all bidders in the Siteserv sale process, as was always the intention.<\/p>  <p>  The disclosure of confidential information by the Davy adviser to an individual which the Commission states he trusted, and which was subsequently transmitted without his knowledge, does not form part of the findings outlined by the Commission in Chapter 22 regarding the commercial soundness of the Siteserv transaction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200060#WRF02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":314,"content":"<p>Question No. 131 answered with Question No. 119.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Economic Policy","counter":315,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200060#WRF02700"},{"type":"question","counter":316,"qnumday":132,"qnumall":"[46364\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200060#WRF02800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which the necessary economic fundamentals continue to be met and will so do in the coming year in the aftermath of Budget 2023 or otherwise; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":317,"content":"<p>Prior to the pandemic, the economic fundamentals of the Irish economy were in a strong position, with robust growth, a labour market close to full employment and public finances broadly balanced. From this position of strength, and with the aid of government policies, the Irish economy proved to be remarkably resilient during successive lockdowns and emerged from the pandemic, at the start of this year, with little evidence of permanent scarring to the economy.   <\/p>  <p>  Our economy is now faced with new challenge and significant headwinds as a result of the war in Ukraine, the most pressing of which has been the rising cost of living. Consumer price (HICP) inflation rose to 9 per cent in August. Rising prices are eroding real incomes of Irish households and inhibiting businesses investment. The Government is acutely aware of these challenges and is committed to tackling them head-on. As part of Budget 2023 next week, the Government will set out a series of targeted once-off measures to be introduced over the course of the winter to help alleviate the cost of living pressures on both businesses and households.   <\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding these challenges, the economic fundamentals of the Irish economy remain strong. The labour market has remained resilient, with a record number of people now in employment and the unemployment rate falling to just 4.3 per cent in August. The external side of the economy also continues to perform very strongly with particularly strong export growth in the ICT and Pharmaceutical sectors.   <\/p>  <p>  Whilst our economy has faced a successive wave of shocks over the last number of years, our resilience and strength ultimately comes from being a dynamic economy open to investment and trade across our borders. This has long proven to be the fundamental strength of the Irish economy, and that remains the case today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200060#WRF02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":318,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200060#WRF03000"},{"type":"question","counter":319,"qnumday":133,"qnumall":"[46192\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200060#WRF03100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the duty that was removed from petrol and diesel will apply for another year; and if he will freeze the carbon tax in light of the current energy crisis.","asker":"1508","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":320,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, it is a long-standing practice of the Minister for Finance not to comment, in advance of the Budget, on any tax matters that might be the subject of Budget decisions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200060#WRF03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insurance Industry","counter":321,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200060#WRF03300"},{"type":"question","counter":322,"qnumday":134,"qnumall":"[45714\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200060#WRF03400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the status of the work of the Office for the Promotion of Competition in the Insurance Market; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1498","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":323,"content":"<p>Insurance reform is a key priority for this Government as evidenced by the fact that implementation of the <i>Action Plan on Insurance Reform<\/i>is overseen by the Cabinet Sub-Group on insurance reform. <\/p><p>The establishment of the Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market, which I chair, is a <i>Programme for Government<\/i>commitment.

The ECB is independent in the formulation and implementation of monetary policy.  <\/p>  <p>  The price lenders charge for their loans is a commercial matter for individual lenders. As Minister for Finance I cannot determine the lending policies of individual banks or other lenders, including the interest rates they charge for mortgages and other loans.  <\/p>  <p>  While the general level of new lending interest rates in Ireland are currently higher than in many other European countries, recent trends indicate that the interest rates charged by lenders on new mortgages have been falling in Ireland. For example, in July 2022 &ndash; based on the latest available data from the Central Bank - the weighted average interest rate was 2.63%, which is down from 2.69% at the end of 2021 and 2.73% in July 2021. <\/p>  <p>  Most new mortgages in Ireland are now fixed rate mortgages and the average interest rates on these mortgages, 2.50% at the end of July, is even a little bit lower.  At the end of 2021 this was 2.59%. <\/p>  <p>  Over the same period, the average Eurozone new mortgage interest rate has increased and, therefore, the differential between the Irish and the Eurozone mortgage interest rate has narrowed from 1.40% at end 2021 to 0.55% at end July 2022.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that the structure of the Irish mortgage market has changed over time.  For example, there has been an increase in the take up of fixed rate mortgages - in July 2022 for example, over 88% of new mortgages were at a fixed interest rate - and this will protect borrowers for an adjustment in the interest rate for the period that the interest rate is fixed.      <\/p>  <p>  Deputies may also wish to note that, as regulator, the Central Bank has introduced a number of increased protections for variable rate mortgage holders in recent years which help mortgage holders identify lower cost mortgage options.  <\/p>  <p>  Firstly it made changes to the Consumer Protection Code which required lenders to explain to borrowers how their non tracker variable interest rates have been set and to clearly identify the factors which may result in changes to variable interest rates.  <\/p>  <p>  Secondly, it also increases the level of information lenders are required to provide their customers including where there is a possibility for the borrower to move to a lower &lsquo;loan to value&rsquo; interest rate band and signpost the borrower to the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission's mortgage switching tool.<\/p>  <p>  Also, by considering and availing of the options available on the market, some borrowers may be able to reduce their mortgage costs. A 2020 Central Bank study estimated that three in every five &lsquo;eligible&rsquo; mortgages for principal dwelling homes stand to save over &euro;1,000 within the first year if they switch and &euro;10,000 over the remaining mortgage term.<\/p>  <p>  The change in the Irish mortgage market to a greater proportion of fixed rate mortgages along with changes to the Consumer Protection Code outlined above will help mortgage holders manage the impact of rising ECB interest rates.  <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA), the CCMA was introduced to ensure that regulated entities have fair and transparent processes in place for dealing with borrowers in or facing mortgage arrears and is part of the national policy framework of supports and protections available to assist borrowers in financial difficulties. <\/p>  <p>  The CCMA sets out the process that entities must follow when a borrower is in or facing difficulties with their mortgage payments. Due regard must be given to the fact that each case is unique and needs to be considered on its own merits. All cases must be handled sympathetically and positively by the regulated entity, with the objective at all times of assisting the borrower to meet his or her mortgage obligations. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Central Bank has made its expectations to lenders clear on how firms should engage with borrowers who are in long-term mortgage arrears. Lenders should seek to offer appropriate and sustainable solutions to borrowers. Nevertheless, borrowers who have not engaged with the processes laid out under the CCMA, risk loss of ownership. <\/p>  <p>  That being said, there is an obligation on regulated entities to explore all of the options for alternative repayment arrangements (ARAs) offered by that entity, in order to determine which ARA, if any, is appropriate and sustainable for the borrower&rsquo;s individual circumstances. Under the CCMA, a regulated entity may only commence legal proceedings for repossession where it has made every reasonable effort to agree an ARA with the borrower and other clear requirements are met, or the borrower has been classified as not co-operating.<\/p>  <p>  The CCMA also provides for an appeals mechanism, including where the entity declines to offer an ARA, where the borrower is not willing to enter into an ARA offered, or where the entity classifies the borrower as not co-operating.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200060#WRF03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Exemptions","counter":328,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200060#WRF04000"},{"type":"question","counter":329,"qnumday":136,"qnumall":"[46328\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200060#WRF04100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to extend the bike-to-work scheme to include more persons (details supplied); his plans to raise the limits of the scheme to enable the purchase of cargo bikes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1594","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":330,"content":"<p>Section 118(5G) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (TCA 1997) provides for the Cycle to Work scheme.

Safety equipment includes helmets, lights, bells, mirrors and locks but does not include child seats or trailers.<\/p><p>From 1 August 2020, this exemption was increased from &euro;1,000 to &euro;1,250 for expenditure incurred by an employer in connection with the provision of a bicycle and\/or bicycle safety equipment in respect of any one employee. A higher exemption limit of &euro;1,500 applies in the case of the provision of an electric bike (which may also include bicycle safety equipment).

In effect, this has resulted in a transfer of domestic incomes from net energy importing countries to net energy exporting countries, leading to a deterioration in the current account balance in a number of Member States. <\/p>  <p>  The latest euro area current account data are for the first quarter of the year, so only capture the initial impact of rising energy prices on foot of the onset of the war in Ukraine. The ECB data show the euro area current account surplus at &euro;217 billion (1.7 per cent of euro area GDP) in the first quarter, down from &euro;301 billion (2.6 per cent of euro area GDP) a year earlier. <\/p>  <p>  The latest ECB macroeconomic projections point to a continued deterioration in the euro area terms of trade and trade balance due to rising energy prices. For the euro area, the ECB forecast a current account deficit 0.3 per cent of GDP in 2022 and 0.5 per cent of GDP in 2023. The balance becomes positive in 2024 with a current account surplus of 0.1 per cent of GDP. In contrast, while Ireland&rsquo;s surplus is expected to moderate over the coming years, it is still expected to remain in surplus over the medium-term.<\/p>  <p>  Close monitoring and coordination of the broad range of fiscal and financial policies in the euro area is essential. Implementing effective, sustainable policies in a concerted manner to mitigate the impact of the war on the euro area economy and support the recovery requires intense policy dialogue and coordination. As such, the Finance Ministers of the euro area are intervening to support vulnerable households and businesses in facing this unprecedented price shock. <\/p>  <p>  We have two priorities in our collective response. Firstly, policy interventions should focus on income transfers that are exceptional and, where possible, temporary and targeted. We will aim to avoid competitive tax reductions within the euro area. Secondly, we commit to avoiding a wage-price &lsquo;spiral&rsquo;. Similarly, super levels of profitability should not be enjoyed by some while many are suffering the economic consequences of war. We stand ready to coordinate closely and look forward to the Commission proposals in this regard. <\/p>  <p>  In this context, the Eurogroup is committed to regular discussions on macro-economic developments and policy prospects, including rising inflation and energy prices. Overall, the Eurogroup will aim to maintain sufficient flexibility in order to ensure swift reactions to future and unexpected developments, and will include any unforeseen issues on Eurogroup agendas, as they arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200061#WRG02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":370,"content":"<p>Question No. 151 answered with Question No. 106.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":371,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200061#WRG02200"},{"type":"question","counter":372,"qnumday":152,"qnumall":"[46204\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200061#WRG02300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on the recent Tax and Welfare Commission Report&rsquo;s findings that wealth and capital taxes should increase materially as a proportion of tax revenues; his plans, if any, to increase such taxes in order to put the public finances on a sustainable footing as outlined in the Programme for Government; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1599","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":373,"content":"<p>The Commission on Taxation and Welfare was an independent group that was established in April 2021 as a result of a commitment in the Programme for Government.

Work is underway to complete the delivery of the remaining actions, with some 80 per cent of delivered at the time of the last implementation report in March.<\/p><p>It is the Government&rsquo;s expectation that all savings from this reform agenda are passed onto customers, including any reduction in claims costs resulting from the new <i>Personal Injuries Guidelines<\/i>. The Guidelines represent a milestone in the insurance reform agenda, and have significantly lowered award levels for many common injuries, with recent data from the Personal Injuries Assessment Board indicating that the overall average award has fallen by 42 per cent compared to awards made in 2020 under the Book of Quantum. <\/p><p>The Guidelines are therefore expected to lead to a reduction in the overall cost of claims, including legal fees. It is necessary for the insurance industry to pass on any benefits from this initiative, and the many other reform already introduced, to its hard-pressed customers, especially in the context of current inflationary pressures. <\/p><p>Both Minister Donohoe and I have been clear on these points and remain committed to holding the insurance sector to account, in so far as it is permissible, on commitments made. In this regard, I will be meeting with the CEOs of the eight main insurers in the Irish market again in the coming weeks in order to further assess their response to the Action Plan reforms, and to stress the importance of reflecting lower claims costs through reduced premiums. I will also continue to press insurers on the need to expand their risk appetite, especially into &lsquo;pinch-point&rsquo; sectors that are experiencing issues with availability and affordability of cover.<\/p><p>In addition, the National Claims Information Database (NCID), managed by the Central Bank of Ireland, contains official data on premiums and claims costs, and provides further evidence on the Irish insurance market. <\/p><p>Over time, this allows policymakers and stakeholders to assess the cumulative impact of this multi-action reform package. Following the implementation of the <i>Personal Injuries Guidelines<\/i>, the Central Bank has amended the NCID data specification and will collect further claim settlement data. The fourth NCID Private Motor Report, which will provide data up to the end of 2021, should show some initial insight into the impact of the Guidelines, and I look forward to the publication of this report in the coming weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200061#WRG02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":379,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200061#WRG03000"},{"type":"question","counter":380,"qnumday":156,"qnumall":"[46297\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200061#WRG03100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on undertaking a regular benchmarking exercise in respect of all working-age income supports, as recommended in the Report of the Commission on Taxation and Welfare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1617","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":381,"content":"<p>In its recently published report, the Commission on Taxation and Welfare makes a number of serious and wide-ranging recommendations regarding the future of the tax and welfare systems in Ireland.

Almost every advanced economy in the world is in the same position, with inflation rates of 8.3 and 9.1 per cent recorded in the US and euro area respectively in August.<\/p><p>The key driver of the elevated level of inflation at present is the sharp rise in wholesale energy, food and other commodity prices since the onset of the war in Ukraine. However, as highlighted in the correspondence, pass-through price effects from higher energy prices are increasingly being felt in other sectors. Indeed, non-energy or &lsquo;core&rsquo; inflation has picked up sharply in recent months and stood at 6.2 per cent in August, suggesting inflationary pressures are increasingly broad based.<\/p><p>The Government recognises the impact rising prices have had on households and businesses across the country and has taken significant action.

The rate was introduced by Financial Resolution on 19 May 2021 and is provided for by section 31E of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999. It applies where a person buys 10 or more residential properties, excluding apartments, in any 12-month period. The background to the introduction of the measure was the purchase by institutional investors of all, or a significant proportion of, residential housing estates, thus denying first-time and other buyers an opportunity to purchase a home. The 10% rate is intended to provide a significant disincentive to this practice.<\/p>  <p>  To ensure that the higher rate of duty does not have an adverse impact on the delivery of social and affordable housing in the State, section 31E contains a specific exemption from the 10% rate of duty for residential units that are leased to a local authority for onward leasing to a household that qualifies for social housing support. The relief is intended to apply in respect of residential units acquired under the &lsquo;mortgage-to-rent&rsquo; scheme. I have also introduced two specific repayment schemes in relation to section 31E, which are provided for by sections 83E and section 83F of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999.<\/p>  <p>  Section 83E, which was introduced by the Finance (Covid-19 and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2021, provides for a partial repayment of stamp duty paid at the higher 10% rate where, within 2 years of acquisition, a property is leased to a local authority or an approved housing body for the purpose of social housing. Section 83F, which was introduced by the Finance (Covid-19 and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2022, provides for a partial repayment where, within 6 months of acquisition, a property is designated as a &ldquo;cost rental dwelling&rdquo;.

This is why my Department conducts the SME Credit Demand Survey and has been doing so biannually since 2011. The SME Credit Demand survey is an independent and statistically significant report that provides insights into the availability of, demand for credit and related issues amongst SMEs. In addition, the report is an important resource used for research by my Department in conjunction with the Central Bank, ESRI and others.  <\/p><p>As the Deputy is aware, the latest SME Credit Demand Survey was published on the 5 September 2022 and the full report is available on www.gov.ie. <\/p><p>The results show that demand for bank credit has fallen steadily since the series commenced, with requests in the period falling from 39% of those surveyed in September 2012 to 16% in the most recent result (6 months to March 2022).  The recent growth in non-bank finance activity as a source of credit for SMEs is an important contributing factor which is why a new question was introduced in the recent survey specifically in relation to demand for non-bank finance in its own right. <\/p><p>The 5% of SMEs who stated they applied for non-bank finance in the 6 months to March 2022 is notable and reflects a growing market share for this source of finance. <\/p><p>Of those SMEs who did not apply for bank finance the main stated reason was a lack of credit requirements due to sufficient internal funds, a reason cited by 76% of businesses not seeking credit (up from 72% in March 2021). Of those companies that have requested bank credit, expansion needs (42%) was the main reason for finance requests up from 32% in March 2021. Notably, expected future demand remains stable with 12% of SMEs expecting to apply for finance in the following six months, down from 13% during the corresponding period in 2021.<\/p><p>Despite ongoing uncertainty, SMEs have remained resilient with all sectors reporting an improvement in turnover performance compared to March 2021. With 45% of all businesses reported increased turnover in the six months up to March 2022 and 18% reporting a decrease. This is a significant improvement from the low levels recorded in March 2021. <\/p><p>Notably the biggest improvement seen was in the Hotel and Restaurant Sector with 66% reporting improved turnover. In addition, 61% of SMEs reported an increase in profit during 2022, compared to 53% in 2021. These positive financial results indicate SMEs are bouncing back to pre-pandemic profit levels.

The trials, which reproduced real-world test conditions along modified urban bus routes in Dublin and Cork, found that battery-electric buses are the most efficient technology for Ireland&rsquo;s urban bus routes.

The paper also noted that in the context of a whole of Government policy to facilitate and support remote working, it may be considered appropriate to enhance or amend the current tax arrangements in order to underline and reinforce public policy decisions in this area.<\/p>  <p>  Taking these factors into consideration, as announced in Budget 2022, the tax arrangements for remote working were enhanced and formalised in line with Government policy to facilitate and support remote working.  Accordingly, for the tax year 2022, an income tax deduction amounting to 30% of the cost of vouched expenses for electricity, heat and broadband in respect of those days spent working from home can be claimed by taxpayers.<\/p>  <p>  The amount of the relief will depend on the particular circumstances of the remote worker in terms of the level of costs incurred and their marginal tax rate. However, this measure provides some relief for those with additional expenses arising from working from home, and at the same time it ensures that the traditional burden of employer related costs are not transferred from the employer to the State and the wider body of taxpayers.  In addition, I would point out that, as the current deduction relates to a proportion of the cost of the relevant expenses, the amount that may be claimed will increase as those expenses increase. <\/p>  <p>  There are no immediate plans to further increase the tax relief for working from home.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the cost of living increases, the Government is acutely aware of the cost pressures currently facing households and businesses and has responded to help alleviate some of this burden. On a cumulative basis to-date, the Government has announced approximately &euro;2.4 billion in cost of living measures since last October.  These measures include changes in tax and social welfare, the provision of an energy credit for households and a temporary reduction in the rate of VAT on the supply of certain energy products.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200063#WRJ04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cost of Living Issues","counter":511,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200063#WRJ04100"},{"type":"question","counter":512,"qnumday":204,"qnumall":"[45098\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200063#WRJ04200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the steps that might be taken to alleviate price increases with consequent inflation affecting consumers throughout the country at large; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":513,"content":"<p>Consumer price (HICP) inflation picked up sharply over the course of last year and stood at 9 per cent in August.

As highlighted in the correspondence, pass-through price effects from higher energy prices are increasingly being felt in other sectors including food (via higher energy inputs).

The war in Ukraine has led to volatility in energy markets and exacerbated supply constraints in the electricity market. I am well aware of the difficulties Irish households and businesses are going through arising from substantial increases in energy bills.<\/p>  <p>  It is clear the increase in energy prices is leading to windfall gains for some energy companies across Europe, particularly those involved in the production of fossil fuels and those producing energy using technologies that are not dependent on gas. Where such producers sell at the current market price, they benefit from the market price inflation but without suffering any significant increase in their production costs. My officials have been working with the Department of the Environment, Climate, and Communications to attempt to quantify such gains, and to explore the potential of collecting a portion of these windfall gains to provide support to energy consumers during these difficult times.<\/p>  <p>  Work in this regard is now focusing on a proposed European Commission Regulation which is under rapid negotiation. Gains to electricity producers are driven by the market structure, which determines the marginal price paid for each unit of electricity sold. For this reason, the EU Regulation proposes to include an infra-marginal price cap in the electricity market, designed to limit windfall revenues for producers that are not experiencing input cost inflation. The Regulation also includes a proposed solidarity contribution from fossil fuel producers. The proposal will be negotiated throughout the remainder of this month with a view to being approved at a meeting of the Council of Energy Ministers on 30 September. I fully support the objectives of this proposal.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy has referenced discussions at Eurogroup and I can confirm that, since last October, the Eurogroup has regularly discussed energy prices and inflation.

Determinations of the Tax Appeals Commission in differing appellant circumstances confirm that there is no discretion in the application of the four-year rule for claiming repayments.<\/p>  <p>  Section 865 was introduced in 2003 and provides a statutory general right to repayment of tax as well as payment of interest, subject to the four-year time limit.  It provides that no repayment may be made based on claims submitted more than four years after the end of the chargeable period to which they relate.  Prior to its introduction there was no statutory right to repayment, though a taxpayer could sue for repayment under common law.  The Minister for Finance at that time indicated that, in introducing the new arrangements, he was satisfied that they achieved the necessary balance between establishing a fair and uniform system for taxpayers while providing necessary protection for the Exchequer. I am satisfied that that continues to be the position.<\/p>  <p>  When section 865 was introduced, Revenue&rsquo;s general right to raise assessments or make enquiries in relation to taxpayer returns was also reduced to four years, although in certain circumstances, for example where fraud or neglect is suspected or in the context of the application of general anti-avoidance rules, Revenue's right to raise assessments or make enquiries is not time limited.  Previously, the general time limit on the raising of assessments by Revenue had been ten years. The provision of a four-year time limit for Revenue raising assessments and making enquiries and for taxpayers to claim a repayment of tax creates parity between both positions.  An increase in one limit would have to be considered in the context of corresponding increases in other time limits in order to preserve that parity.<\/p>  <p>  I have no plans at this time to amend the four-year limit in section 865.<\/p>  <p>  Further information in relation to the ICTC can be found on Revenue&rsquo;s website or in Tax and Duty Manual Part 15-01-05, both of which may be found at the links below:<\/p>  <p>- Revenue website: www.revenue.ie\/en\/personal-tax-credits-reliefs-and-exemptions\/children\/incapacitated-child-credit\/index.aspx  <\/p>  <p>  - Tax and Duty Manual Part 15-01-05: www.revenue.ie\/en\/tax-professionals\/tdm\/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax\/part-15\/15-01-05.pdf.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200064#WRK02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":548,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200064#WRK02300"},{"type":"question","counter":549,"qnumday":216,"qnumall":"[46504\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200064#WRK02400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will give urgent consideration to the requests of national organisations (details supplied) in relation to the need to reduce costs for this sector through reduction in taxation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1556","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":550,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, it is a long-standing practice that the Minister for Finance does not comment, in advance of the Budget, on any tax matters that might be the subject of a Budget decision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200064#WRK02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Direct Investment","counter":551,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200064#WRK02600"},{"type":"question","counter":552,"qnumday":217,"qnumall":"[46530\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200064#WRK02700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which Ireland continues to be an attractive location for foreign direct investment; the regions from which most competition occur in this area; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":553,"content":"<p>Ireland has long established itself as a market of choice for foreign direct investment and FDI makes a highly significant contribution to the domestic economy. Ireland&rsquo;s ability to attract and retain FDI reflects our strong legal and regulatory landscape, our track record as a stable and pro-enterprise jurisdiction, and our talented and flexible workforce. These unique features continue to support our competitive advantages, which are recognised and valued by the multinational sector.<\/p>  <p>  While large parts of the domestic economy were shut down during the Covid-19 pandemic, the resilience of the multinational sector proved remarkable, with the sector supporting the economy during the worst of the crisis and helped to bolster Ireland&rsquo;s transition from the pandemic. Whilst the outlook in the domestic economy improved somewhat as restrictions were lifted at the beginning of this year, the onset of the war in Ukraine fundamentally altered the economic outlook, representing a large supply-side shock to the global economy. <\/p>  <p>  The primary channel through which the conflict has impacted the Irish economy is via elevated energy and other commodity prices. Higher prices have undermined the profitability of business, with costs rising in both the Irish manufacturing and services sectors. However, higher inflation is not only affecting the competitiveness of businesses in Ireland, but is also impacting on the competitiveness of businesses in most advanced economies, with the euro area, the US, and the UK all recording inflation levels of at least 9 per cent in August.<\/p>  <p>  Fortunately, Ireland has entered this period of uncertainty in a position of strength. The Irish modified current account, which strips out the distorting effects of globalisation, is in a strong position and is expected to remain in surplus over the medium term.

However, we cannot become complacent and I am very aware of the importance of maintaining our competitive position on the international stage.<\/p>  <p>  Domestically, there is a real risk that a wage-price spiral emerges as a result of persistently-high inflation.

As Minister for Finance I cannot determine the lending policies of individual banks including the interest rates they charge for loans including mortgages.   <\/p>  <p>  I am aware that the general level of new lending interest rates in Ireland are higher than is the case in many other European countries. However, it should also be noted that recent trends indicate that certain mortgage rates have been falling in Ireland. For example, the interest rates on new mortgages have fallen from 4.05% in December 2014 to 2.63% in July 2022.  It should also be noted that the average Eurozone new mortgage interest rate has increased in recent months and the differential between the Irish and the Eurozone mortgage interest rate has narrowed from 1.4% at end 2021 to 0.55% at end July 2022. Most new mortgages in Ireland are now fixed rate mortgages and the weighted average interest rate on new fixed rate mortgage agreements stood at 2.50% in July 2022, down from 4.11% in December 2014. There has also been a reduction in the interest rates charged on loans to SMEs and consumers over the same period.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, Irish mortgages have different characteristics from those offered in other countries. For example, many Irish banks include incentives such as cash back offers, which reduce the effective Irish mortgage interest rate. Also Irish mortgages are generally not subject to upfront fees which are typically charged by banks in some other EU jurisdictions.<\/p>  <p>  Separately the Central Bank introduced a number of increased protections for variable rate mortgage holders which came into effect in 2017. The enhanced measures, which are provided for in an Addendum to the Consumer Protection Code 2012, require lenders to explain to borrowers how their variable interest rates have been set, including in the event of an increase.<\/p>  <p>  The measures also improve the level of information required to be provided to borrowers on variable rates about other mortgage products which could provide savings for the borrower and signpost the borrower to the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission's mortgage switching tool.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank also introduced additional changes to the Consumer Protection Code in 2019 to help consumers make savings on their mortgage repayments, provide additional protections to consumers who are eligible to switch, and facilitate mortgage switching through enhancing the transparency of the mortgage framework. <\/p>  <p>  Consumers may reduce average pricing in the mortgage market by availing of switching options to ensure that recent and potential future price reductions through increased competition pass through to the greatest number of customers possible. Indeed a Central Bank study in 2020 estimated that three in every five &lsquo;eligible&rsquo; mortgages for principal dwelling homes stand to save over &euro;1,000 within the first year if they switch and &euro;10,000 over the remaining term.<\/p>  <p>  I appreciate that greater sustainable competition in the credit market will be of benefit to consumers and other borrowers.  Accordingly, the review of the retail banking market which is now underway in my Department will consider how the banking system can best support economic activity, assess competition and consumer choice in the market for banking services and consider options to further develop the mortgage market.  I expect that the review will be published before the end of the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200064#WRK03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fiscal Policy","counter":558,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200064#WRK03300"},{"type":"question","counter":559,"qnumday":219,"qnumall":"[46532\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200064#WRK03400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the degree to which borrowing for capital or non-capital works here continues in line with the policy of the European Central Bank; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":560,"content":"<p>I understand the Deputy is interested in Ireland&rsquo;s borrowing and the monetary policy of the European Central Bank (ECB). <\/p>  <p>  The National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) borrows to meet the Exchequer&rsquo;s Borrowing Requirement regardless of whether the ultimate expenditure is capital or non-capital in nature. It should be noted that current and capital expenditure in Ireland is funded through a combination of borrowing and taxation receipts. The NTMA has informed me that so far this year, it has issued &euro;7bn of Government bonds. It issued a new 10-year benchmark bond via a syndicated transaction in January and held three dual bond auctions, the most recent of which was on 1 September. <\/p>  <p>  At &euro;7bn year-to-date, issuance is well below the levels seen in recent years as the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on the public finances unwinds and the Exchequer returns to a position of surplus on foot of strong tax revenues. The issuance was completed at a weighted average yield of just under 1.1% and a weighted average maturity of close to 15 years. <\/p>  <p>  In terms of the factual position, the ECB has no role in determining the use of Exchequer expenditure (whether sourced from borrowing or taxation receipts). The Deputy will be aware that at the most recent meeting of the Governing Council, on 8 September 2022, the ECB decided to raise the three key ECB interest rates by 75 basis points. <\/p>  <p>  The ECB has publicly indicated that, based on its current assessment, over the next several meetings the Governing Council expects to raise interest rates further to dampen demand and guard against the risk of a persistent upward shift in inflation expectations. <\/p>  <p>  At the 8 September meeting the ECB also publicly announced that it intends to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the Asset Purchase Programme (APP) for an extended period of time past the date when it started raising the key ECB interest rates and, in any case, for as long as necessary to maintain ample liquidity conditions and an appropriate monetary policy stance. As concerns the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP), the Governing Council intends to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the programme until at least the end of 2024. In any case, the future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio will be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance. Redemptions coming due in the PEPP portfolio are being reinvested flexibly, with a view to countering risks to the monetary policy transmission mechanism related to the pandemic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200064#WRK03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":562,"qnumday":220,"qnumall":"[46533\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200064#WRK03700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the degree to which borrowing for capital or non-capital works here continues in line with the policy of the International Monetary Fund given Ireland&rsquo;s indebtedness to the fund; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":563,"content":"<p>I would like to clarify that Ireland has no outstanding loans to the IMF.

Similarly, Ireland&rsquo;s quick rebound in economic growth following the pandemic, accompanied by strong tax revenue performance, will allow the Government to respond appropriately in the year ahead to the current energy crisis.<\/p>  <p>  A key determinant of fiscal sustainability is, of course, the State&rsquo;s ability to make repayments on the debt that it has borrowed.  An environment of increasing interest rates has now commenced following a sustained period of low and even negative interest rates, and the European Central Bank has signalled that this will continue as long as inflation rates remain elevated. This means that interest rates will undoubtedly increase on any national debt issued in the coming years and on current national debt on variable interest rates.<\/p>  <p>  However, Ireland&rsquo;s starting position with regards to current financing costs is relatively favourable. The effective interest rate on the national debt is very low, with nearly three quarters of Ireland&rsquo;s debt at an interest rate of 2 per cent or lower, the bulk of which is, importantly, at fixed rates. Additionally, the vast bulk of Irish debt is in the form of Government bonds, which tend to have a relatively long maturity profile, and around half of outstanding debt instruments are owned by domestic residents, providing additional insulation against adverse shocks. <\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this favourable financing position, excessive borrowing at a time of increasing rates will erode the progress made in recent years with regards to fiscal sustainability.

The agreement achieved at the OECD is a fine balance that provides the certainty and stability required for economic growth while at the same time protecting the interests of small countries such as ours.

As a result, the full impact of Brexit will not be evident for some time, however this will not lessen the impact on the Irish economy.<\/p>  <p>  Building on its early and extensive contingency planning and analysis work which started even before the 2016 referendum, the Government has dedicated substantial resources to preparing for Brexit and the systems in place are working well. We have invested significantly in new infrastructure, systems and staff, and continue to engage intensively with stakeholders and to provide a range of financial, upskilling and advisory supports for impacted sectors and businesses. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland will be the largest beneficiary from the Brexit Adjustment Reserve (BAR), receiving &euro;1.165 billion, the aim of which is to provide financial support to the most affected Member States, regions and sectors to deal with the adverse consequences of Brexit. Funding will be directed at areas such as enterprise supports; supports for the agri-food and fisheries sectors, reskilling and retraining; and checks and controls at our ports and airports. Work is continuing across Government, with all Departments examining measures that need to be taken to counteract the negative consequences of Brexit. Further allocations from the BAR will be made as the impacts of Brexit are worked through.<\/p>  <p>  It remains important that we continue to prepare for any unforeseen consequences over the coming period, including as discussions continue on the implementation of the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland. The Government is committed and remains focused on protecting our economic and financial interests, and will continue to work to minimise the disruption that Brexit will have on the economy and peoples&rsquo; livelihoods to the greatest extent possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200064#WRK05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Economic Growth","counter":581,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200064#WRK05500"},{"type":"question","counter":582,"qnumday":228,"qnumall":"[46542\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200064#WRK05600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which he is satisfied that Ireland&rsquo;s economic progress will continue unimpeded notwithstanding the challenges in the aftermath of Covid-19 and Brexit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":583,"content":"<p>Earlier this year, Ireland make a significant step forward by removing all remaining Covid-19 restrictions.

The inflationary shock has been mainly driven by energy price rises, but spillover effects to core (non-energy) inflation are now evident. The government is committed supporting individuals and businesses to face these inflationary challenges. As part of Budget 2023 next week, the Government will set out a series of targeted once-off measures to be introduced over the course of the winter to help alleviate cost of living pressures. While there will be a significant support package included in the budget, it must be stressed that the government cannot absorb the full impact of inflation and we must ensure that we do not inadvertently add further to inflationary pressures.<\/p>  <p>  Despite the challenging nature of this economic cycle, Ireland&rsquo;s economic fundamentals remain strong, especially in the labour market with 2 &frac12; million people currently in employment, and the unemployment rate falling to just 4.3 per cent in August.

I have committed to seeking funding for further increases in the capitation in future budgets.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has also ensured that centrally negotiated rates are available to schools for electricity and bulk heating fuels. These rates are available through existing frameworks sourced by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) which run until 2024. OGP has run competitions specifically for Schools at a national level and the Schools Procurement Unit and the Department has communicated with schools and school management bodies informing them of the options available to them through these national arrangements. It is planned to run future competitions to ensure that bulk rates continue to be available from 2024 onwards. Information on how to avail of these arrangements is available via the Schools Procurement Unit website, www.spu.ie<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, my Department is at the forefront of design with respect to sustainable energy in school buildings and this performance has been recognised at both National and International level with sustainable energy awards for excellence in Design and Specification and is advancing a number of programmes to further develop this.<\/p>  <p>  The Energy in Education website portal and advice programme (Joint programme between SEAI and Dept. of Education) also assists schools reduce their energy consumption and empowers participating schools and pupils to learn the benefits of sustainability www.energyineducation.ie. Typically savings of between 5 to 10% are identified through low and no cost measures, while some schools participating have identified potential savings of up to 15% or more.<\/p>  <p>  I am very conscious of the cost of living pressures facing families and schools. In advance of this year's Budget I will engage with my Cabinet colleagues to continue to deliver on my priorities to support the students, staff, and families within the education sector and to address these pressures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200066#WRM05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Staff","counter":716,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200066#WRM05900"},{"type":"question","counter":717,"qnumday":274,"qnumall":"[46546\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200066#WRM06000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the reason that a person (details supplied) was not considered for redeployment; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1493","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":718,"content":"<p>The core function of the redeployment arrangements is to facilitate the redeployment of surplus permanent teachers to other schools where vacancies exist.

Additional Needs Payment is an overarching term used to refer to Exceptional and Urgent Needs Payments, and certain supplements to assist with ongoing or recurring costs that cannot be met from the person&rsquo;s own resources and are deemed to be necessary.  Decisions on Exceptional Needs Payments and SWA supplements are made at the discretion of the Community Welfare Officers (CWO) administering the scheme taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case.  The CWO&rsquo;s discretionary powers are a major strength of the SWA scheme as it confers upon these officers the capacity to provide an immediate flexible response to identified needs. <\/p>  <p>  The Additional Needs Payment is not a new scheme, and it comes within the remit of the general SWA scheme operational guidelines.  An information note in relation to Additional Needs Payments issued to all staff in the Department in June this year and this set out the role of CWOs in assisting customers with cost-of-living expenses.  This note, which has been augmented with a virtual training webinar and a number of training bulletins, directs CWOs to use their discretionary powers in considering applications for Additional Needs Payments and it places significant emphasis on assisting customers with cost-of-living expenses.  While there are household income guidelines, it has been emphasised to the CWS team in the Department that these are guidelines only and the customers need for assistance arising from difficulties in meeting increased costs for food, fuel, electricity, and heating is the primary consideration.  <\/p>  <p>  These Additional Needs Payments are demand-led and are funded accordingly.  This support is available to anybody on a low income who is experiencing financial hardship regardless of the number of hours they work per week or if they have applied for an Additional Needs Payment previously. Anyone who needs support should contact the Department either through their local Intreo Centre or Branch Office or by phoning 0818 60 70 80.  Further details on the Additional Needs Payment are available online at: www.gov.ie\/en\/service\/4eb45-additional-needs-payment\/ <\/p>  <p>  The Community Welfare Service (CWS) is committed to providing a quality service to all its customers, ensuring that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are made as quickly as possible.  Based on the available data, it is estimated that 59% of applications for Additional Needs Payments are finalised within 0-4 weeks and 90% are finalised within 0-8 weeks.  Where an application is not finalised within this timeframe, this is generally due to additional information or documentation being requested from the customer to support their application.  Where it is evident that a customer is experiencing particular hardship and their application is complete and accompanied by the required documentation, their application is prioritised. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has introduced innovations this year to increase efficiency in processing applications for SWA payments.  One of these is the establishment of a back-office team to undertake the preparatory work on applications - for example, the gathering of supporting documentation that is necessary to assess and finalise a claim.  This method of processing applications supports a number of CWS areas across the country and it has been found to be very effective in releasing Community Welfare Officers (CWOs) from the requirement to undertake administrative tasks and to focus on delivery of services.  It allows for increased capacity for CWOs to meet with customers as required and to process claims.  This model will be extended to cover all CWS areas across the country in the coming months. <\/p>  <p>  The delivery of crucial Community Welfare Services to meet the challenges and the needs of vulnerable customers across the country remains a priority for my Department.  The continued availability of locally based CWO is a cornerstone of the service.  CWOs can facilitate emergency and in-person meetings in 51 Intreo Centres across business hours, five days per week.  Some CWOs are based in Social Welfare Branch Offices and provide appointments at those offices.  In addition to meeting citizens in Intreo Centres, Branch Offices and DSP offices, CWOs can facilitate an appointment within a short time of a person requiring such a meeting, at a mutually agreed location, including at the person's home.   <\/p>  <p>  It is vital that the CWS is an easily accessible, flexible, and responsive service to meet the varied needs of vulnerable people, particularly in a time of crisis or emergency.  While changes to modernise and improve the service for customers are a feature of the service, continued in-person customer engagement remains a pivotal feature within the community welfare service. <\/p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200067#WRN00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"question","counter":724,"qnumday":276,"qnumall":"[46406\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200067#WRN00600","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if she will clarify a matter in relation to the fuel allowance (details supplied).","asker":"1605","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":725,"content":"<p>The Fuel Allowance is a payment of &euro;33 per week for 28 weeks (a total of &euro;924 each year) from late September to April, which is supporting over 370,000 households in 2022, at an estimated cost of &euro;366 million.

It can be paid to a recipient who suffers a loss of physical or mental faculty because of an accident at work, an accident travelling directly to or from work, or a prescribed disease contracted at work.  The contribution requirements for the scheme are minimal when compared to other Departmental benefit schemes. <\/p>  <p>  People in receipt of Disablement Benefit (without another social welfare payment) can work full or part time and continue to receive the Benefit Payment &ndash; in other words, they are not prevented from generating additional income. <\/p>  <p>  Disablement Benefit is paid at the same time as most social welfare payments including Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit, Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance, Disability Allowance, Invalidity Pension, State Pension and One-Parent Family Payment.

The estimated expenditure on free travel in 2022 is &euro;95 million.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that, in general, access to a free travel pass for those aged under 66 is linked to a person being in receipt of certain primary Social Protection payments such as Disability Allowance, Invalidity Pension, Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Blind Pension and Partial Capacity Benefit.  Importantly, as many illnesses or physical conditions have an impact across a spectrum from mild to severe, entitlement to these social welfare schemes is not provided on the basis of a diagnosis but on the basis of the impact of that diagnosis on the individual concerned.  In this way, resources can be targeted to people in most need.<\/p>  <p>  Therefore, while a diagnosis of a particular medical condition will be required to establish if a person may be eligible for certain social welfare schemes, evidence of impact is also required before entitlement to the scheme or the related free travel scheme is established.

I am currently working on proposals to support smaller and voluntary nursing homes in relation to the specific challenges they are experiencing.<\/p>  <p>  I engage consistently on an ongoing basis with Nursing Homes Ireland (NHI), the representative organisation for private and voluntary nursing homes. I have met directly with NHI and updated them in detail on progress being made in relation to this matter.  I have also met with the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to request that they consider the matter alongside departmental officials. I have visited a number of nursing homes to discuss this issue with management of both public and private\/voluntary nursing units. It is imperative that nursing homes manage potential cost pressures in line with their regulatory and contractual responsibilities, maintaining their quality of care so that residents&rsquo; lived experience and comfort is not affected.  <\/p>  <p>  Funding to support people to access services in the sector continues to be provided in line with the long-established statutory mechanisms under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009. This is the mechanism established by the Oireachtas to provide for the processes relating to funding under the NHSS and the negotiation of prices for services for private and voluntary providers with the designated State agency, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF). Maximum prices for individual nursing homes are agreed with the NTPF following negotiations and based on the NTPF&rsquo;s cost criteria. These criteria include:<\/p>  <p>  - Costs reasonably incurred by the nursing home- Local market prices- Historic prices- Overall budgetary capacity<\/p>  <p>  The NTPF carry out this role independently under the NHSS Act 2009 and there is no role for Ministers or the Department in these negotiations.  The Department continues to work with the NTPF to take forward the recommended actions that emerged from the NTPF pricing review, as well as taking forward the nine recommendations of the Value for Money Review on Nursing Home Costs published last December.<\/p>  <p>  I would also like to highlight the other supports provided to the private and voluntary nursing home sector over the course of the pandemic. As you are aware, the COVID-19 Temporary Assistance Payment Scheme, also known as TAPS, has been in place since the start of the pandemic. Over &euro;144 million has been made available to date under the scheme. The outbreak assistance element of the scheme is still in payment, having been extended up to September 2022. In addition to TAPS, direct support has been provided by the HSE to private nursing homes in many areas, including the provision of PPE, serial testing and support with staffing.  In response to the strategic workforce challenges in the nursing home and home care sector, a Cross-Departmental Strategic Workforce Advisory Group has been established. The Group is working to a tight timeline and is committed to providing a set of recommendations by September 2022.  <\/p>  <p>  Given the importance of nursing homes and the NHSS to the wider health and social care system - with a budget of over &euro;1 billion, and over 22,000 residents supported - it is essential that policy measures are examined with due care in order to ensure the government's objectives are delivered and avoid unintended consequences. I hope to be in a position to update sector representatives as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200070#WRQ00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":874,"content":"<p>Question No. 325 answered with Question No. 324.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":875,"content":"<p>Question No. 326 answered with Question No. 324.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":876,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200070#WRQ00900"},{"type":"question","counter":877,"qnumday":327,"qnumall":"[46484\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200070#WRQ01000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when an appointment will issue to a person (details supplied) in County Donegal for Sligo University Hospital;

Healthy Ireland is based on evidence and experience from around the world, which clearly shows that creating positive changes in health and well-being benefits from the involvement of the whole of Government and all of society, working together.<\/p><p>Supporting the wider &ldquo;health in all policies&rdquo; approach of Healthy Ireland, investment across multiple sectors, through Government Departments, their agencies and through wider society, contributes to broad health and well-being improvements and supports, in line with the Healthy Ireland Framework and Healthy Ireland Strategic Action Plan. A central aim of Healthy Ireland is to &quot;<i>create an environment where every individual and sector of society can play their part in achieving a healthy Ireland<\/i>&rdquo;. <\/p><p>The &euro;15.39 million Healthy Ireland Fund budget for 2022 covers actions supporting local communities, through both the Healthy Ireland Fund and the new Sl&aacute;intecare Healthy Communities Programme. The Healthy Ireland Fund provides supports at local level, through Local Community Development Committees LCDCs) and Children and Young People's Service Committees (CYPSCs) at local authority level. <\/p><p>The Local Strand of the Healthy Ireland Fund and the Sl&aacute;intecare Healthy Communities Programme variously provide supports for projects and programmes that support health and well-being, including physical activity, diet and nutrition, positive mental health, supports for parenting, to quit smoking, and to reduce alcohol consumption with additional focus on families and young people, and supporting people and communities living with disadvantage.<\/p><p>The Healthy Ireland Fund also supports programmes at national level, including Age Friendly Ireland, Sport Ireland, co-funding for the Department of Education's Active School Flag programme and the Healthy Ireland at Your Library programme. <\/p><p>The Healthy Ireland allocation to Sport Ireland includes supports for programmes for people living with a disability, including the Special Olympics Young Athletes programme, supports for research and the Get Ireland Walking, Get Ireland Swimming, Get Ireland Running and Get Ireland Cycling programmes. <\/p><p>Healthy Ireland is also supporting the development and piloting of a Physical Activity Pathways in Healthcare Model in 2022, in collaboration with the HSE and Sport Ireland. These supports are funding development and co-ordination of programmes to increase access to physical activity for people who are older, frailer, living with a disability or disadvantage, and who otherwise experience more barriers to accessing physical activity, and will include elements of physical activity prescription. <\/p><p>Healthy Ireland also participates in the DTCAGSM Sports Leadership Group, led by the Minister of State for Sport and the Gaeltacht, Jack Chambers, T.D., which guides the implementation of the National Sports Policy. <\/p><p>A review of the National Physical Activity Plan (NPAP) was published this year, and is available on the Healthy Ireland website.  The Review contains recommendations regarding the future direction of the Plan. The provision of additional physical activity opportunities and supports to people living with a disability, chronic conditions (including mental illness), frailty and\/or living with disadvantage were considered as part of the review. The NPAP Implementation Group will be considering renewing the NPAP in the coming months, bearing in mind the recommendations included in the Review, and the need to support the National Sports Policy without unnecessary overlap.<\/p><p>The Healthy Ireland Fund is also used to empower citizens to adopt healthier behaviours, through various citizen engagement campaigns.  The Healthy Ireland campaigns have been running since 2018, initially with a focus on three themes; Eat Well, Think Well and Be Well, representing healthy eating, positive mental health and being active. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the <i>In This Together <\/i>and <i>Be Well<\/i>campaigns were re-purposed to provide supports for resilience, health and well-being while necessary Covid-19 restrictions were in place. The promotion of physical activity across society, in partnership with DTCAGSM and Sport Ireland, continues to be a core element of this work.<\/p><p>Healthy Ireland sponsored Operation Transformation in 2021 and in 2022, which featured a wide range of relevant themes, including healthy eating, physical activity and sport participation, quitting smoking, losing weight, mental health and men's and women's health. The programme reached approximately 450,000 viewers in 2021. Several settings-based initiatives are also supported, including Healthy Campuses, Workplaces and Clubs.  <\/p><p>There is overwhelming evidence that investment in prevention is cost-effective in both the short and longer term. In addition to pre-existing evidence that tobacco and excessive alcohol consumption, obesity and inactivity are key risk factors for chronic disease, there is increasing evidence that healthy behaviours provide protection against infectious disease also.<\/p><p>Public health advice from the Health Information Quality Authority (HIQA) to the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), following a wide review of published studies, concluded that &ldquo;  <i>&hellip;in general those who are overweight or obese, who smoke, who have inadequate levels of Vitamin D, are physically inactive and consume excessive amounts of alcohol are more likely to contract COVID-19 or have poorer outcomes.&rdquo;<\/i><\/p><p>Needless to say, it is unlikely that Covid-19 is the only infectious disease where adherence to public health guidelines regarding activity levels, weight and tobacco and alcohol misuse is protective. This is borne out by the scientific literature; for example:<\/p><p>- Regular physical activity can reduce the risk from upper respiratory tract infections;<\/p><p>- High levels of regular physical activity has been shown to result in 31% decreased risk of contracting infectious disease in the community;<\/p><p>- Active individuals show a 37% decrease in risk of infectious disease mortality as compared with inactive individuals;<\/p><p>- Regular physical activity has been shown to increase antibody levels post-vaccination, with these effects more marked in older adults. <\/p><p>It is clear, therefore, that national policies, such as the National Physical Activity Plan and the National Sports Policy, that seek to tackle one or more of these risk factors and to improve public health, may be even more vital in terms of protecting public health and well-being than previously realised.<\/p><p>In summary, investing in public health generates cost-effective health outcomes and can contribute to wider sustainability, with economic, social and environmental benefits.  Healthy Ireland is a core framework for the implementation of the Sl&aacute;intecare Healthy Living Pillar and provides the central platform to address the social determinants of health that impact how people live their lives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200070#WRQ03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1608"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","counter":904,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200070#WRQ03700"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":903,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200070#WRQ03600"},{"type":"question","counter":904,"qnumday":336,"qnumall":"[46449\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200070#WRQ03700","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the estimated current and capital funding which he intends to be allocated from his Department's budget in respect of development of the use of anaerobic digestion; the purpose of any funding allocations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1451","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":905,"content":"<p>The recent Government agreement on Sectoral Emissions Ceilings has increased the ambition for the production of biomethane.<\/p>  <p>  As committed to as part of the Sectoral Emissions Ceilings agreement an obligation on the heat sector to include renewable heat will be introduced by 2024.

The scheme delivers on a recommendation of the Seafood Taskforce and offers grant rates of between 30% and 50% for capital investment in SME seafood processing enterprises, varying depending on the degree of value added in the project. <\/p>  <p>  The scheme is designed to counter the adverse consequences of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.  It seeks to support the processing sector to engage in transformational change, mitigating the effects of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement and Brexit. It also seeks to build more environmentally friendly, sustainable and competitive enterprises which serve the EU and wider global markets, create higher levels of employment more locally, and make better and more sustainable use of Irish landed or imported raw material. The scheme is aimed at supporting industry-led transformative capital investments that enable the sector to focus on 'creating more from less' in the wake of reduced supply of raw material. It is also aimed at moving enterprises in the sector further up the supply chain to produce higher value products and shift the industry to a focus on secondary processing and beyond to products targeting end-user markets. The scheme is proposed for funding under the EU Brexit Adjustment Reserve.<\/p>  <p>  The scheme received State Aid clearance on the basis that it provides supports to SMEs only. This is in line with the European Commission&rsquo;s State Aid Guidelines which require consistency with the provisions of the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Regulation (508\/2014), which in turn restricts grant aid to the processing sector to SMEs only.  Both article 69 of the EMFF Regulation for the 2014-20 period and article 28 of the new European Maritime Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund Regulation (2021\/1139) for the 2021-27 period restrict grant supports for capital investment in seafood processing to SMEs. Under the EU funds available for seafood development, supports to non-SMEs is permitted only through financial instruments.  <\/p>  <p>  The schemes, referenced by the Deputy, provided for the beef and dairy processing sector were operated by Enterprise Ireland an agency of the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment.
