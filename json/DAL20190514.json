An article by Justine McCarthy in <i>The Sunday Times <\/i>at the weekend was particularly revealing in respect of many of these matters.  Speaking on Clare FM at the weekend, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, was unaware of any of the constraints that beset the other Ministers.  He stated Granahan McCourt was &quot;putting in, I think, in the region of something shy of &euro;200 million&quot;.  There is still a lot of breadth there.  The Minister was speaking the day after the Cabinet had decided to award preferred bidder status so he did not pluck that figure from the air.  He obviously knew what he was talking about.  We have now learned that the Minister, Deputy Bruton, will today tell the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment that the figure is &euro;220 million, between equity and working capital.  Will the Taoiseach break down that figure for us today as between equity and working capital?<\/p><p>The context of this is very clear.  Why were we looking for the figure and why was the Government refusing to give it?  It is because the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform stated there were &quot;unprecedented risks&quot; to the Exchequer posed by this particular project.  He referenced in a memo to the Government that the private sector was only risking so much - the figure was redacted at the time - of its own funds.  The general public and taxpayers are entitled to know that figure given the unprecedented risk to them in respect of everything to do with this project.<\/p><p><i>The Sunday Times<\/i>article revealed another important matter.  It stated that the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment had confirmed that Granahan McCourt relied on the financial performance of a US company owned by Frank McCourt, a brother of David McCourt, to meet the qualifying criteria of the procurement process.  In other words, Granahan McCourt did not have enough resources itself and relied entirely on a separate entity to underpin its financial security.  Was the Taoiseach aware of that?  Was the Government aware of it?  This is significant in the context of the meeting in July last year between the former Minister, Deputy Naughten, and David McCourt.  Frank McCourt was also at that meeting at which four items were discussed in relation to this project.<\/p><p>I always felt those meetings were wrong and inappropriate in the middle of a tendering process.  They cast a stain over the entire process.<\/p> <p> I do not know whether Peter Smyth interviewed Frank McCourt in the context of his review, but we need clarification in that regard.  At issue also is the role of KPMG, which advised the Department on the gap-funding contract.  KPMG advised the Department that Granahan McCourt had the capacity to undertake the project but we have also learned that the Department has paid KPMG &euro;11.6 million for its advisory services since 2015.  Is it appropriate that KPMG would be the auditor for Granahan McCourt while acting for the Department to reassure it on that company's financial capability?  Will the Taoiseach break down the &euro;220 million figure?  Does he agree with the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that this is an unprecedented risk to the taxpayer and that the value-for-money analysis is not credible?  Can the Taoiseach explain the role of Frank McCourt and the global company underpinning the entire project?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400003#A00200","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557839100,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  While I am happy to answer his questions, we should not lose sight of the objective here.  The national broadband plan is the largest ever investment in rural Ireland and probably the most significant investment to take place since rural electrification.  It is about connecting 1.1 million people, 450,000 homes, 50,000 farms and 50,000 businesses to high-speed broadband.  The project is ambitious.  Ireland will be one of the first - if not the first - countries in the world to do this.  We have chosen fibre as the technology because nothing is faster than the speed of light and nothing ever will be.  It is good for the economy through the encouragement of home working and for the environment through the reduction of commuting and emissions.  It will help us to enable modern educational techniques and pursue ehealth in particular.<\/p>  <p>  The contract has not yet been signed.  It will be September or October before we are in a position to sign it.  There will be hearings.  The Minister is attending one today at the joint committee.  There will be debates in the House.  I ask the following sincerely not only of the main Opposition party but of others too.  I appeal to them not to rule out supporting the national broadband plan just yet.  I ask them to spend some time listening to the arguments and considering the plan because if we fail to sign this contract in a few months&rsquo; time, we will be back to square one.  The digital divide between urban and rural Ireland will remain and deepen and it will take many years before we can put together another plan.  I appeal to Members not to rule out supporting the plan until they have had a chance to consider all the facts and scrutinise the alternatives.  I came to support this decision in October after Deputy Naughten resigned as Minister and I asked Deputy Bruton to take on this job.  I asked him to look at the whole matter afresh, see if it was the right thing to do, consider the alternatives and see if there was an easier, cheaper, better or quicker way to do this.  He considered all of the options and came to the same conclusion the Government reached last week, namely, that there is no better option.  Any alternative will involve delays, will be slower, will cost as much if not more and might not even meet the objective of connecting all homes, farms and businesses.<\/p>  <p>  As to the financial model, this is a &euro;5 billion project and it is important to bear that in mind.  It is &euro;6 billion if one includes VAT and contingencies over 25 years.  Of that &euro;5 billion, the company must come up with &euro;2.4 billion in equity, working capital, borrowings and user charges.  The State will only pay the subsidy after the work is done.  The company must roll out the fibre and only after it has passed the home, farm and business threshold will it be paid.  It will be paid more when those premises are connected.  The company must come up with the full &euro;2.4 billion.  What Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin has zeroed in on is one aspect of the funding, namely, the initial equity and working capital totalling &euro;220 million.  This is made up of &euro;175 million in equity and &euro;45 million in working capital.  That is only the initial, upfront investment by the company.  The total amount it has to find is &euro;2.4 billion for what is a &euro;5 billion project.  If the project is successful, the company will get its equity back and a return on that.  However, if roll-out is delayed, as some predict, and if take-up is not as fast as we project, the company will have to put in more equity.  That is the crux of the matter.  National Broadband Ireland, a private company, is taking the risk here.  Its risk is not capped, whereas the risk to the State is capped.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400004#B00200","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1557839100,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I asked the Taoiseach four questions.

It is crucial that we deliver high-speed broadband to rural Ireland because people want, need and deserve it.  That means actual delivery, not delivering an announcement or a pipe dream.  There are very serious concerns surrounding the national broadband plan as currently constituted.  This very costly plan could still leave homes, farms and businesses across rural Ireland without access.<\/p>  <p>  If we think back, this whole process began in 2012, seven years ago, with a commitment that high-speed broadband would be delivered to every home and business in the State by 2020.  That promise has been broken spectacularly.  Seven years later, not a yard of cabling has been laid or a single pole erected.<\/p><p>Under the new plan, homes, farms and businesses in rural Ireland are being asked to wait again.  That is not good enough.  The Taoiseach has described the plan as a personal crusade, but there are significant flaws that no one in the Government, including the Taoiseach, has yet addressed.  In the documents published last week, the capacity of the bidder to deliver the project was cast in serious doubt, while the capacity of the Department to oversee it has been similarly questioned.  Why have those issues not been addressed?  The bidding process utterly failed to deliver a competitive tender.  In addition, it has been highlighted that the bidder does not have adequate skin in the game and could walk away from the project after it has recouped its investment.  What does the Taoiseach say to that?  The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, has confirmed that the firm in question will invest &euro;220 million, yet the State will invest &euro;3 billion in initial capital.  The Taoiseach has stated that this is the largest ever State investment in rural Ireland.  In reality, it represents a massive State subsidy to a private firm in respect of infrastructure the State will not own.  That is unbelievable.<\/p> <p> We all agree rural Ireland needs high-speed broadband but the unfortunate reality is that more than 500,000 homes and businesses are still without it and will be for years to come.  Will the Taoiseach express absolute confidence in the deal?  Is he prepared to stand over it and guarantee delivery of rural broadband?  Will he publish the full details of the contract between the State and Granahan McCourt?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400005#C01200","speaker":"1239","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557840300,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I am confident that National Broadband Ireland has the capacity to deliver.  If it does not, there are protections in the contract.  If the company does not deliver, if it seeks an increased subsidy or if it fails to meet certain milestones, the State can terminate the contract and take over the network.  I am confident, therefore, that it has the capacity to deliver but I also understand that if it does not, the contract will protect the State in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy's assertion that the State is investing &euro;3 billion upfront as capital is not correct.  The State is investing nothing upfront and will make its contribution only after the work has been done.  The company must raise the money, lay the fibre and then pass and connect the homes.  It will be paid for the work that is done as homes are passed and connected, which is why the way the Deputy has presented the matter does not tell the full story.  The project is worth between &euro;5 billion and &euro;6 billion, with approximately half being invested in the form of a State subsidy and the remainder being delivered and provided by the company.  It must carry out the work before it is paid and collect the user charges from Sky, Vodafone and all the other operators that will sell on services to the public.  The Deputy has zeroed in on the initial investment, that is, the equity or working capital investment of &euro;220 million.  If the company does not deliver, it will have to invest more equity.  If it does deliver, it will get its investment back and also a return on that investment.  The risk to the State is capped; the risk to the company is not.  It is important to understand that.

The Labour Party is fully committed to a comprehensive delivery of broadband to every home and business in the country as, I believe, is every other party.  That goes without needing to be said.  I assure the Taoiseach that our plans would deliver much better value to the taxpayers of this country.<\/p>  <p>  The Government proposes to give &euro;3 billion of public money to a private monopoly without securing ownership of the network.  In almost all public private partnerships, and I was directly involved in many, the State owns the asset at the end of the contract.<\/p><p>It would be simply unthinkable for the public to pay &euro;1.7 billion for the national children's hospital and not own it at the end.  It would be bizarre for the Government to give ownership of the new hospital to a for-profit venture capitalist.  Why does the Government believe that it is any less unthinkable to give away the national broadband network?  The venture capital firm will, we are now told, provide &euro;220 million in actual cash and rely on operating revenue to make up the rest of the cost of delivering the network.  A State-owned national broadband company could just as easily generate the same operating revenue but it would pay a dividend to the people and, ultimately, reduce the net cost to the taxpayer of providing the network and it would have the income in perpetuity.  Granahan McCourt intends to borrow against future income but to put up little of its own money in cash investment.  In maintaining ownership of the broadband network, the State would be better placed to guarantee the affordability of rural broadband into the future.<\/p> <p> Regardless of whether Internet access is necessary now, it will be absolutely essential in 25 years' time.  However, there is no guarantee that the Government will be able to control the prices charged by the private monopoly in 25 years' time.  We do not even know who will own the network at that stage because the Government's proposals, which we read last week, would allow the shares of the company to be sold again after only nine years.  Vulture funds would buy the network, just like they bought Eircom, and milk it for its assets and cash again and again.  The Labour Party solution is for a State-owned company to own the broadband network.  It would provide access to the network on a wholesale basis, thereby creating a market for a multiple of retailers to sell Internet access to whomever they want and allowing other services to access the network to provide services directly to homes and businesses.  This company would be profitable and it should repay some of the costs of providing the network in the first instance.  A State-led approach is clearly objectively better.  What is the justification for or the logic of the Taoiseach's argument for a private monopoly to own the rural broadband network in perpetuity?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400007#E01000","speaker":"1353","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557841500,"counter":43,"content":"<p>ComReg is the price regulator for telecoms in the State and has a role in capping prices.

The Taoiseach is right that we had to test the market in the way that we agreed in government because that was what the EU required us to do but now we have proven market failure.  From my reading of Article 345 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union there is no impediment for a public company in this area.  In terms of the model, I invite the Taoiseach to read the judgment in the Croatia case in regard to its provision of broadband, which is analogous to what we are doing here.  The European Commission found that Croatia's next generation network broadband plan is in line with state aid rules.  We can create a State monopoly where the market has failed.  The management of that scheme is attributed to a public undertaking offering long-term leasing agreements on the infrastructure to all interested parties.  No operator has shown any interest in commercially doing it.  Therefore, it is perfectly legitimate - this was endorsed by Commissioner Vestager in 2017 - for the State to set up its own company to do that.

Ireland became only the second country in the world to declare a climate and biodiversity emergency last Thursday.  That declaration was made on foot of amendments tabled by all Opposition parties in the D&aacute;il further to the publication of the report from the Joint Committee on Climate Action.  That committee was set up on foot of a recommendation contained in the Citizens' Assembly report which outlined other urgent recommendations on how the State can make Ireland a leader in tackling climate change.  It has taken the visual imagery, however, of children protesting on our streets and streets throughout the world to force the D&aacute;il to take action, along with the numerous reports, both national and international, from UN bodies, the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and the Climate Advisory Council.  These all clearly show that our trajectory of development is not just unsustainable, but catastrophic.<\/p>  <p>  Last week the UN-commissioned report was published, and it highlighted in the most acute way the gravity of the biodiversity crisis.  A few months before that we had the intergovernmental climate report, which cautioned that we had a window of 12 years in which to take action, without which there will be drought, floods, extreme heat and poverty for hundreds of millions of people.  We are talking about the most innocent people, who made very little contribution to climate change.  While we have taken the first step, which is to be welcomed, it has to have meaning.  I have some difficulty with the cognitive dissonance - the Taoiseach is familiar with the concept - that the Government displays.  On the very day we declared an emergency, that morning Ireland was conspicuously absent from a list of EU states demanding that 25% of the budget be set aside for climate change.  It was conspicuously absent from the list of countries demanding more action on climate change.  Indeed, our advisory council has told us that we will miss our targets in 2020 and 2030.  <\/p>  <p>  In that context, following on from a specific recommendation on page 97 of the report published last week, I am asking the Government to choose Galway and its regional hinterlands as a blueprint for other cities in relation to the roll-out of climate mitigation measures.  As the Taoiseach knows, is cathair &aacute;lainn dh&aacute;theangach ar thairseach na Gaeltachta is m&oacute; sa t&iacute;r &iacute; an Ghaillimh.  It is a city that is destined for 50% growth.  It has been picked out in the national planning framework as one of the five cities.  However, in contrast to the other four cities, it has a major traffic problem and a housing crisis.  The traffic crisis is actually strangling development in the city.  I have asked, and am asking again, that a city be picked.  The report asks for the same.  I ask the Taoiseach to please pick Galway.  It has 80,000 people, and is destined to grow by another 50%.  Let us roll out a masterplan that is sustainable and allows for the development within the footprint of the city.  In particular, we should carry out a feasibility study for light rail.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400010#H00500","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1557842400,"counter":85,"content":"<p>I welcome the fact D&aacute;&iacute;l &Eacute;ireann last week declared a climate action and biodiversity emergency in Ireland.

We are asking this State company to deliver much of what we need to do with renewables and almost all of what we need to do with electrical vehicle charging points.  Asking one company with a limited balance sheet to do another large project must be borne in mind if people really want to pursue that alternative.<\/p> <p> In agriculture, we want to focus on a new Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, which encourages diversification and rewards farmers for engaging in sustainable and green food production.  This will be a significant change but one which is necessary if we are going to do what we want to do concerning climate action in the period ahead.<\/p> <p> I have not seen any detailed proposal on a special designation around Galway.

It will have to be done in every town, village, rural area and parish.

A declaration of an emergency was forced upon us by any number of reports and the actions of our children whose futures we are compromising.<\/p>  <p>  I specifically asked in Irish for an action plan, following on from that emergency declaration, to be brought before us as a matter of urgency.  It has national implications.

We are seeking to introduce a new type of order that anybody can apply for, whether that is a victim of ongoing domestic violence or perhaps somebody who has just started to experience harassment and would, therefore, be excluded from applying for a barring or protection order.  This legislation would allow an applicant to seek to have a judge award an order mandating that there be no contact whatever from a named person.  These orders exist in other countries, for example, Scotland.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the Bill is to respond to the epidemic levels of violence against women that we are experiencing.  Last year, thousands of people marched last year to support #IBelieveHer or #WeStandWithHer protests in response to victim blaming in rape trials.  We have also seen the \"This is not consent\", #MeToo and #TimesUp movements as global phenomena but we have seen very little concrete change in this D&aacute;il in response to such demands.<\/p>  <p>   The Sexual Assault and Violence in Ireland, SAVI, report was conceded on foot of protests and this is another concrete step we can take.  It follows requests from women who have experienced domestic violence.  Jessica Bowes approached me about this issue in recent months.  People may know that Ms Bowes spoke on \"The Late Late Show\" and \"Prime Time\" about the horrific assault she experienced.  She explained that in the days leading up to the attack she had received increased contact from her ex-partner, some of which had the appearance of being of a romantic and harmless nature.  She could not bring it to the Garda as evidence that the barring order was being breached.  Those declarations of undying love then turned much more menacing and mutated into emotional abuse and psychological manipulation.  We are speaking about someone who did have a barring order.  Ms Bowes is extremely anxious that we adopt something like this legislation and she has helped me initiate this Bill.<\/p>  <p>  An order of this type could also be accessed by somebody who has not gone especially far in an emotionally or physically abusive relationship.  We all know that young women can experience sexual harassment and we are trying to allow people to act on early warning signs and red flags.  What power are we giving people to challenge such behaviour from an early stage?  People should be able to stop contact from someone who is causing upset, distress or fear.<\/p><p>There is no entitlement, or there should not be, for someone to contact anyone one likes regardless of the impact.  What we are trying to do here is prevent, not mourn, and to empower women, or a male, an LGBT person or whoever.  However, we are also talking about women who have been the victims of this ongoing harassment.  \"No contact\" orders, which are called \"non-harassment orders\" in Scotland, would under this Bill allow applicants to have to cite only two occasions or episodes where they have felt such harassment, alarm or distress.  In other words, it would not be open to a judge to rely on his or her subjective impression.  There would be a baseline in place, which is very important as we have seen sometimes a lack of education on the part of some judges.  The legislation is clear and simple.  It is in place in Scotland which is a similar jurisdiction and culture to ours.  Such orders were introduced there some years ago and they are now used by people in relationships.  We ask that the Minister adopts this proposal and agrees to amend the Domestic Violence Act himself.  It would mean not having to wait for Private Members' time but would be taken on board quickly.<\/p> <p> This is a pernicious form of control.  Don Hennessy, who has studied this area, discusses how someone in a relationship can be manipulated by phone or social media messages as well as through physical contact.  This Bill is by no means going to solve the problem.  We need massive resources to be provided in this area.  We need to stop the cuts to the Rape Crisis Network and Women's Aid and to introduce an RSE programme in schools in which the issues of coercive control and violence, including gender-based violence, are central and taught in all schools.

At the request of the UK Government and in light of the fact that the UK had not ratified the withdrawal agreement, we agreed to a further extension of Article 50, to last only as long as necessary and no longer than 31 October 2019.  If the withdrawal agreement is ratified by both parties before that date, the UK will leave on the first day of the following month.  In agreeing this extension, the European Council reiterated that the withdrawal agreement, including the backstop, cannot be renegotiated and that any unilateral commitments made by the UK must be compatible with its letter and spirit.  Prime Minister May has acknowledged this fully.  We made it clear that the period of extension cannot be used to start negotiations on the future relationship between the EU and the UK.  However, we said also that if the UK's position evolves, we are prepared to reconsider the political declaration on the future relationship.  As it is still a member state, the UK has committed to participating in the European Parliament elections later this month.  If it fails to live up to this obligation, withdrawal will take place on 1 June.  The UK has also committed to act in a responsible and constructive way during the extension period.  This is important in order to safeguard the effective functioning of the EU.  Given the ongoing uncertainty, a no-deal outcome is still a possibility and the Government therefore is continuing to prepare for all outcomes.<\/p><p>While I did not have any formal bilateral meetings on 10 April, I had extensive engagement with several of my EU counterparts, including at a meeting of the European People's Party leaders.

He said this is not about personalities, but about facts and the complexities of Brexit.  Unfortunately, we have seen the complete disregard for facts by some of the key figures throughout the Brexit saga and indeed from the initial referendum.  Events are now moving at a fast and unpredictable pace, not to find a solution to Brexit issues but in terms of the political realities of Westminster.  We have no idea what Prime Minister will be in office when we approach the new Brexit deadline to which the Taoiseach referred.  For instance, we know the newly formed Brexit party, led by Nigel Farage, who has described the withdrawal agreement negotiated and endorsed by this House, as a surrender document, is leading the European election polls in Britain.<\/p><p>I watched \"Newsnight\" on BBC last night.  I saw a Tory backbencher call for a formal alliance between the Tory Party and the Brexit Party to form a Government in Britain and I saw a British Labour Party member describe the current British Parliament as being like the end of days where everybody is sitting around and nobody knows what is happening or how matters are progressing.  In that context, I will ask the Taoiseach a difficult question.  What is his assessment of how this additional period between now and October is being used?  The fear is that it is simply an endless recycling of the same issues to no avail or purpose and that the chances are that by the end of October we will be in the same set of circumstances in which would found ourselves at the previous deadline.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400018#Q03000","speaker":"1353","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557847200,"counter":187,"content":"<p>With the stalemate in Britain and the likely radicalisation of the situation after the European elections, no one really has an idea where matters are going to go from here.  That issue of the radicalisation of the political situation post the European elections is significant in that, on the one hand, it could potentially radicalise and harden people's attitudes, perhaps making no deal more possible, and, on the other hand, it is entirely possible that the withdrawal agreement could be ratified because that would require only a very few MPs to change their minds.  If the agreement were to be accepted, we would immediately enter a period of negotiations.  Can the Taoiseach explain how these negotiations are to be handled?  What preparations are under way for our technical submissions, for example?  It has been established that the European Union side is legally obliged to act in good faith in these negotiations, which requires making proposals about future relations, particularly the operation of trade and regulation on this island.  If the withdrawal treaty is accepted, the next phase of negotiations would be different from the discussions that took place over the past two and a half years.  How will those discussions be handled?<\/p>  <p>  At last week's informal summit, there was a discussion about choosing the new heads of the European Council, the Commission and the European Central Bank.  To date, the only comment the Taoiseach has made on this is to back the European People's Party, EPP, candidate for President of the Commission.  Given the importance of these positions, can the Taoiseach outline what he stated on Ireland's behalf as opposed to on behalf of Fine Gael?  What was Ireland's position at the summit?  Fianna F&aacute;il's position is that the priorities of the new presidents are more important than where they come from.  Can the Taoiseach assure us that under no circumstances will Ireland support the replacement of Mario Draghi with someone who will try to reverse the latter's highly successful policies, which saved Europe from deflation and prevented the break up of the euro.  This is a crucial appointment for Ireland and it is important that we have a clear policy framework for appointing and supporting Mario Draghi's successor.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400019#R00200","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1557847200,"counter":188,"content":"<p>I also want to ask about Ireland and RT&Eacute;'s participation in the Eurovision Song Contest, particularly in light of the horrific treatment by Israel of the Palestinians, the fact of an apartheid state in Israel and the systematic, regular and relentless flouting of international law and the human rights and civil rights of the Palestinians by Israel.  I put it to the Taoiseach in simple terms - were people right to boycott apartheid South Africa?  Most people around the world think we were.  They are of the view that the boycott had a significant impact on bringing down apartheid in South Africa and Nelson Mandela testified to that.  Can the Taoiseach provide any reason for the arguments which justified the boycott against apartheid South Africa not applying to Israel?  To my mind, they do in spades?  To a major extent, what Israel is doing to the Palestinians is even worse than what was done to black people in South Africa.  Is the call for a boycott, sanctions and divestment and also the boycott of the Eurovision Song Contest in Israel not justified?<\/p>  <p>  If we are to deal with the rise of the far right, we first need to understand that what is happening is not a peculiarly British phenomenon.  It is happening all across Europe and we need to pull the rug from under these people.  The way to do so is to deal with issues such as deprivation, alienation from the political system, homelessness and so on.  All of these things are on the increase right across the Continent.  At the informal meeting where the strategic goals for the European Union were being set out, was there any acknowledgement that there is a real problem with poverty, deprivation and homelessness, not just in this country but right across Europe, and that unless we address those issues as a matter of urgency, the growth of the far right will continue?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400019#R00300","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1557847200,"counter":189,"content":"<p>As the Taoiseach knows, there have been a number of developments since the European Council meeting last month.  We have had the signing of the memorandum of understanding on the common travel area by the Irish and British Governments.  As he also knows, this affirms the commitment of both Governments to maintaining the rights, reciprocal arrangements and social benefits associated with the common travel area.  However, it is not a legal document and it could be changed in the future.  Has the Government given any consideration to making the common travel area an internationally-binding treaty?  I throw that out there because of the uncertainty in British politics and in all aspects of Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  Last month, we debated the national statement on the future of Europe.

Many of the people attending from the United Kingdom, whether Conservative or Labour Party members, are deeply concerned.  In the context of European policy, while the Barnier withdrawal agreement is available, I doubt if the United Kingdom will sign up to it as is.  I presume that the diplomats are doing what they normally do, namely, working to express the ideas in a form of language which will win the approval of the different parties in the UK.  However, these European elections are important because of the growth of extreme populist forces, most on the right but some on the left.  I wonder if the European Council had an opportunity to discuss what in many ways is possibly the worst threat to democracy in Europe for a long period.  I know the Council did not discuss Brexit, but the EU should reflect on what is going to happen in the context of maintaining - whatever the outcome - a strong friendship with Britain and its people.  I say this because, inevitably, there is going to be a significant change in the relationship between Britain and the EU.  Whatever the precise outcome, Ireland's interests must be protected.

The Good Friday Agreement is explicit that people in Northern Ireland are entitled to be British, or Irish, or both, and are accepted as such.  I think the British Government has got it wrong in this case and the matter has been raised in our bilateral conversations.  I have raised it with the Prime Minister, and the T&aacute;naiste has raised it too.  While we respect that the British have their own courts system, the Good Friday Agreement is clear in both letter and spirit and I think the UK Government has got it wrong in that case.<\/p>  <p>  The British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, BIIGC, met last week.  Our delegation was led by the T&aacute;naiste, while the British delegation was led by Mr. David Lidington.  At the meeting, the bilateral agreement between Britain and Ireland to continue the common travel area was signed, which will protect and strengthen it by giving it a stronger political and legal underpinning.  It was an important achievement and a significant outcome for Irish and British people alike, as it gives us a guarantee that no matter what else may happen as a consequence of Brexit, we will still be able to live, travel, work and access healthcare, education, housing and the welfare system in each other's country as though we are citizens of both.  That is being protected and retained and I am pleased we were able to bring that to a conclusion last week, notwithstanding the great uncertainty of other matters.<\/p>  <p>  The BIIGC can also be an institution through which we maintain the strong friendship to which Deputy Burton referred.  Irrespective of what happens as a consequence of Brexit, we will naturally want to continue to have a close economic and political relationship with the United Kingdom, our nearest neighbour and one of our largest trading partners, which is particularly important for the agrifood sector, some small exporters and others.  We will try to do that with two methods.  Through the European Union, we will negotiate a new free trade agreement and a close relationship with the UK, while we will also enhance our bilateral relations, for which extra work will have to be done because the UK will not be in the EU any more.  We can use the institutional framework of the BIIGC as part of that but we will also take other steps, such as reopening our consulate in Wales and examining the opening of a consulate in the midlands or the north of England, perhaps in Manchester or Birmingham, to deepen our diplomatic and agency presence in Britain.  We will have to undertake many more ministerial visits to the UK because until now, we have had the opportunity to meet our UK counterparts three or four times a year, at Council of Europe meetings in Brussels, but that will no longer be the case.  We will have to make a special effort, therefore, to maintain the bilateral relationship, for which organisations such as the BIIGC can play a useful part.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Howlin asked about my assessment but it is difficult to know.  Nobody can predict the future with any certainty in respect of Brexit and we must continue to prepare for the various potential outcomes.  Currently, we must await developments in Westminster.  European elections will be held next week here, in Britain and in Northern Ireland, the last of which could be especially interesting as the third seat is very much up for grabs.  We will have to assess the outcome of those elections in the following week.  Talks are ongoing between the Conservative Party and the British Labour Party.  We do not know whether they will be able to come to a conclusion, although I hope they can in such a way that allows the UK to leave the EU in an orderly fashion, if it must leave at all.  I am told by the Prime Minister that if those talks fail, Westminster will move to a further set of indicative parliamentary votes, which may help to guide the outcome.  The European elections and their outcome could harden attitudes in the UK but we should bear in mind that many parties are in favour of a second referendum or are pro-Remain but their vote is divided.  That is less the case with those forces that support a no-deal Brexit or hard Brexit, which must be taken into account.<\/p>  <p>  The next phase of negotiations will arise only if the withdrawal agreement is ratified.  We anticipate that those talks will be led by the European Commission, which would be logical, and they may involve the establishment of a task force, or something similar to what currently exists under the leadership of Mr. Michel Barnier, although that has not yet been worked out in detail.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400020#S00300","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Strategic Communications Unit","time":1557847800,"counter":194,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400020#S00500"},{"type":"question","time":1557847800,"counter":195,"qnumday":12,"qnumall":"[15463\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400020#S00600","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the status of the research survey his Department was to commission in 2018 as part of the strategic communications unit; if it was proceeded with; and if so, the outcomes.","asker":"1353","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1557847800,"counter":196,"content":"<p>Given competing demands, it has been decided not to undertake the research survey at this time.

He assured the House that all parties would be consulted before it went ahead and apologised for his office seeking to poll only general election voters, thereby excluding younger people and those without Irish or UK citizenship.  There was no consultation, however.  In early 2018, the Taoiseach informed the House that the tender had been awarded to a company and that he would ensure that other parties were consulted on the survey contents.  Again, there was no consultation.  When he eventually agreed to close the marketing unit, he told the House that because the contract had been awarded, the survey would proceed in any event and there would be consultations on revised survey content.  Once again, there was no consultation.  The reason the question keeps arising is there is no clarity on what happened to the contract, whether the money was retained by the Department of the Taoiseach or whether it has been entirely abandoned.<\/p><p>Who paid for the glossy broadband brochures issued last week?  How much did they cost?  I was amazed those brochures were put together in the absence of any contract being signed.  Today, the Taoiseach said it would be September or October before a contract on broadband would be signed yet glossy brochures have been sent to every Deputy and probably to every public representative by the Government telling us how much will be done this year and next year, notwithstanding the fact nothing was done for seven years with regard to this contract.  How do brochures get financed and published by the Government in advance of contracts being signed?  It reduces the Government's leverage when negotiating contracts.

It was a genuine project but it got caught up in the party political back and forth we have had in the Chamber.  Everyone thought there was no point in going ahead in that context.

For example, the results from the Labour Force Survey show there was a 2.3% increase in employment in the year to quarter 4 2018, bringing total employment to 2,281,300, the highest number on record.  In quarter 4 2018, there were 128,800 people unemployed, a decrease of 10.5% compared to the previous year.  However, this strong competitiveness position cannot be taken for granted.  There is no room for complacency.  Improving Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness position is a key priority for this Government and my Department.<\/p>  <p>  The National Competitiveness Council report, Cost of Doing Business in Ireland 2019, found that while Ireland is a high cost economy - the fifth most expensive in the EU - the cost base for enterprise is internationally competitive across a range of metrics, including, for example, the cost of starting a business, communications costs and average income taxes.  However, the council noted that cost pressures are evident in some areas, including the labour market, credit, business services and residential property.<\/p>  <p>  Future Jobs Ireland 2019, launched in March, is a whole of Government framework designed to improve our economy&rsquo;s resilience in the face of emerging and future challenges.  It sets out 26 ambitions to 2025 across five pillars in the areas of innovation, productivity, skills and talent, participation and transitioning to a low carbon economy.  Along with Project Ireland 2040, Global Ireland 2025 and the Government&rsquo;s forthcoming All of Government Climate Plan, Future Jobs Ireland 2019 represents an integrated approach to prepare for the opportunities and challenge of the future economy.<\/p>  <p>  A range of specific deliverables in Future Jobs Ireland 2019 aim to enhance the business environment and improve competitiveness, as well as other factors, that contribute to specific sectoral cost challenges.  For example, on credit and financial costs, the future growth loan scheme will provide long-term debt financing for strategic investments at competitive rates in\u00a0a post-Brexit environment; on legal services, new business models for legal services will be introduced, including new legal partnerships and limited liability partnerships; and on construction, an implementation plan for actions to stimulate construction sector productivity will be delivered, including greater deployment of building information modelling.  As a small open economy, we must never underestimate the importance of maintaining competitiveness and ensuring that the cost of doing business does not impede it.\u00a0 In this regard, Future Jobs Ireland 2019 is an integral component of the Government&rsquo;s overarching plan for the future of the Irish economy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400023#V00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"speech","time":1557849600,"counter":239,"content":"<p>The cost of doing business is a major issue for Irish competitiveness.

The work of the cost of insurance working group is complemented by the work of the Personal Injuries Commission.  The first report of the Personal Injuries Commission was published in December 2017 and made four recommendations, of which two are ongoing.  One recommendation is partially complete and the final recommendation, relating to the book of quantum, has been superseded by the Personal Injuries Commission's recommendation that a judicial council, when established, be requested by the Minister for Justice and Equality to compile judicial guidelines for appropriate general damages for various types of personal injury. <\/p>  <p>  The second and final report made a further ten recommendations.

Progress on implementing the recommendations is reported on through the cost of insurance working group progress reports.  Four of the recommendations relate directly to recommendations in the two cost of insurance working group reports.

Only where specific skills prove difficult to source within the State and wider EEA may an employment permit be sought by an employer to hire a non-EEA national.

The &euro;300 million Brexit loan scheme provides relatively short-term working capital of between one and three years to eligible businesses with up to 499 employees to help them innovate, change or adapt to mitigate their Brexit challenges.

Businesses can confirm their eligibility with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, and if deemed eligible can apply to one of the participating finance providers for a loan under the scheme.  The scheme was launched in March 2018 and as at close of business on 3 May, there were 608 eligibility applications received, of which 550 had been approved, with 124 loans progressed to sanction at bank level to a value of &euro;27.76 million.

I am pleased to say that implementation has commenced in all regions.  Shaped from the bottom up by regional stakeholders and overseen by my Department, the new regional enterprise plans complement national level policies and programmes emanating from the top down, and there is strong alignment with Ireland's national enterprise policy, Enterprise 2025 Renewed and Future Jobs Ireland 2019.<\/p>  <p>  The principle behind the regional enterprise plans is collaboration between regional stakeholders on initiatives that can help to realise the region's enterprise development potential and add value to the core work of the enterprise agencies.  These stakeholders include local authorities, the local enterprise offices, the enterprise agencies, the regional skills forum, tourism boards, private sector enterprise champions, higher and further education institutions, business representative bodies and others.  County Carlow is part of the new regional enterprise plan for the south-east region, which also includes counties Kilkenny, Wexford, Tipperary and Waterford.  The regional steering committee for the plan, chaired by Frank O'Regan, formerly of Bausch &amp;amp; Lomb, Waterford, has already met to commence the plan's implementation.<\/p>  <p>  There are five strategic objectives in the south-east plan, with a focus on County Carlow as part of the south-east region.  These include building enterprise resilience; marketing the region; a regional engagement strategy on key infrastructure priorities; ensuring the south east is a learning region; and tourism growth.  Actions in the plan that are of significance to Carlow in particular include industry led enterprise clustering; building on collaboration between industry, higher education institutes, including IT Carlow, and others to solve enterprise challenges; and supporting skills development and greater adoption of science, technology, engineering, arts and maths, STEAM, subjects, through making the south east a learning region.<\/p>  <p>  The unemployment rate in the south-east region has decreased from 11.7% in quarter 1 of 2015 to 7.7% in quarter 4 of 2018.

Families depend on them.  Most families are providing a 24\/7 service themselves for 12 months a year.  Respite care, day services and residential care are very important, including for adults with disabilities.  It was most unfortunate to see last week how far staff and management were pushed in having to write to families to tell them services were on the verge of collapse.  I hope the Minister of State has come to the Chamber today with positive news from which families can take some comfort.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400032#EE00700","speaker":"1271"},{"type":"speech","time":1557855000,"counter":358,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies Murphy O'Mahony and Smyth for raising this important issue.  I know they care passionately and genuinely about disabilities.  They have campaigned for and supported developments for the last number of years.  I thank them for giving me the opportunity to outline the position in relation to RehabCare.  The Government is committed to providing services and supports to people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.  This commitment is outlined in A Programme for a Partnership Government and it is guided by two principles, namely equality of opportunity and improving the quality of life for all people with disabilities.  Significant resources have been invested by the health sector in disability services over the past number of years.  This year alone, the Health Service Executive has allocated &euro;1.9 billion to its disability services programme, which represents an increase of &euro;346 million since 2016.  This is the highest ever level of funding in the history of the State.  I thank my colleagues opposite for their support in that regard.  I recognise that support.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge the important services and the commitment to people with disabilities and their families provided by the staff of the Rehab Group.  The Rehab Group provides short-term and long-term services to young people and adults with physical, sensory and intellectual disabilities, mental health difficulties, autism and acquired brain injury.  Services are co-ordinated through Rehab's three service delivery divisions, RehabCare, the National Learning Network and Rehab Enterprises.  RehabCare provides health and social care supports to about 3,000 adults and children each year, enabling them to become active members of their own communities, achieve life goals and experience new opportunities.  The National Learning Network provides a range of flexible training courses and support services for some 5,000 students, including jobseekers and people with an illness or disability, from age 16 upwards who need specialist support in 50 centres around the country.  The National Learning Network provides a wide range of vocational training and education programmes which are funded by SOLAS, as well as rehabilitative training, funded by the HSE.  Rehab Enterprises does not receive funding from the HSE.  The Rehab Group is funded by the HSE under section 39 of the Health Act and operates in all nine HSE CHO areas.  Services are provided through a service arrangement which is signed on an annual basis and reviewed continually.  The 2019 budget allocation for the Rehab Group is &euro;56.1 million, which is &euro;1 million more than in the previous year.<\/p>  <p>  Last Tuesday, the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, and I held a joint meeting with Rehab and the HSE.  I have met representatives from the Rehab Group and many families of service users personally over the last three years also.  Arising from reported financial challenges, Rehab and the HSE have committed to work intensively with a view to understanding the group's financial position and cost base.  My primary concern is to ensure continuity of disability services for service users and their families, delivered in line with strong governance mechanisms in a cost-effective and equitable manner which is consistent with care and support needs.<\/p><p>RehabCare has agreed not to issue a notice of termination, pending the outcome of this intensive work with the HSE.  The Minister and I have committed to meeting RehabCare and the HSE tomorrow, Wednesday, 15 May, at 5 p.m.  The answer is that I am pushing this agenda very strongly and I thank the Minister for his support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400032#EE00800","speaker":"1359","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557855600,"counter":360,"content":"<p>I am glad the Minister of State acknowledges the fantastic work done by RehabCare but he is still not answering my question.

We have nothing tangible to take back to our families or to the management of RehabCare across Cavan-Monaghan.  I appreciate that it may be difficult for the Minister of State to provide anything concrete ahead of that meeting tomorrow.  However, I would ask that everything be done to ensure that these services continue and that there will be no break in the day service or the residential service.  In recent times, people with disabilities and service users in places such as Steadfast House in Carrickmacross have been hit with ongoing charges in respect of their daily services, whether it be to get their bus or their lunch.  There seems to be all these sneaky ways of introducing charges that take away from the little bit of social protection these people enjoy.

Of course we need tangible results and I am hoping to get them tomorrow.<\/p>  <p>  I mentioned the HSE's 2019 budget earlier.  This year, &euro;1.9 billion has been allocated to the HSE's disability service programme.  That is an increase of &euro;346 million during the lifetime of this Government.  This will fund the provision of a wide and complex range of services and supports to people with disabilities.  Additional funding this year is being focused on a number of priority areas as a result of ongoing demographic changes and the fact that population is increasing.  These areas include: the expansion of community disability services to meet the needs of school leavers; the 100 new therapy posts to address the assessment of need waiting lists for children with disabilities; personal assistance and home support service hours; and residential and respite places.  At our meeting last Tuesday, which was difficult and direct, both RehabCare and the HSE remained committed to working together intensively with a view to making substantive progress in arriving at a solution in respect of this issue.  The Minister and I are working closely together on this issue.  I have also raised it at Government level.  A further meeting is scheduled to take place tomorrow and I hope major progress will be made in respect of the genuine concerns the Deputies have raised.

I mean no disrespect to the Minister of State but I was hoping that the Minister for Health would be present because it is relevant to his brief.  The first thing I want to do is obtain a commitment from the Minister of State that he will bring this matter to the Minister's attention.<\/p>  <p>  This issue relates to pembrolizumab, a drug that is available for the treatment of patients with certain cancers in this country.  Patients with a particular type of cancer are not able to access the drug, making this another example of the two-tier health system with which, unfortunately, we are all too familiar.  Deputy McGuinness and I want to refer specifically to John Holmes, a Kilkenny man who has had to resort to having friends and family establish a fundraising committee in order that he can access the drug pembrolizumab.  There are regular fundraisers throughout Kilkenny to try to fund his treatment.  It is not nice for anyone to be diagnosed with any type of illness, not to mention having then to go out and fundraise in order to pay for one's medication.  Ironically, pembrolizumab is manufactured in Carlow, one of the counties bordering Kilkenny.  The drug is not available to Mr. Holmes but it is available to certain other patients.  We are seeking a firm commitment from the Minister that he will meet Mr. Holmes and his fundraising committee to discuss the matter, that he will examine the position and that he will not offer some sort of watery reply whereby he states that he will come back to the matter and then kicks the can down the road.<\/p>  <p>  Time is of the essence.  We need a definite commitment that he will meet the fundraising committee and that he will consider the matter and come up with a solution in order that John Holmes can get access to this vital drug because it is working and, thankfully, he has seen results from it.

The local community and John have been out begging for funds to fund the 30 infusions of pembrolizumab he needs at a cost of &euro;5,111 each.  Nobody can afford this.

The Deputies described in great detail the sad case of John Holmes.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to inform the Deputies that pembrolizumab is available to public cancer patients in Ireland for a number of licensed indications and is included on the HSE reimbursement list for some of those indications.  Furthermore, pembrolizumab is currently being assessed by the HSE, using the criteria as set out in the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, for a number of other indications for which it has received marketing authorisation.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputies will be aware that the Oireachtas has put in place a robust legal framework in the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.  This Act gives full statutory powers to the HSE to assess and make decisions on the reimbursement of medicines, taking account of a range of objective factors and expert opinion as appropriate.  The Act specifies the criteria to be applied in the making of reimbursement decisions which include the clinical and cost effectiveness of the product, the opportunity cost and the impact on resources available to the HSE.<\/p><p>In line with the 2013 Act and the national framework agreed with industry, if a company would like a medicine to be reimbursed by the HSE, it must first submit an application to have the new medicine added to the reimbursement list.  Reimbursement is for licensed indications which have been granted market authorisation by the European Medicines Agency or the Health Products Regulatory Authority.<br\/><br\/>HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics, NCPE.  The NCPE conducts health technology assessments, HTAs, for the HSE and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist decisions.  It uses a decision framework to assess systematically whether a drug is cost effective as a health intervention.  Clinical trials for various immunotherapies, including pembrolizumab, are ongoing globally for a range of other possible indications which may receive marketing authorisation in the EU over the next number of years.  Each of those indications will be considered for reimbursement as market authorisations are granted and applications received by the HSE.<br\/><br\/>The Deputies will be aware that as an exceptional measure, the Government made a decision in May 2018 to put in place a package of support measures for women and families affected by issues related to CervicalCheck.  These measures included medicines which might not be approved for reimbursement, including pembrolizumab, once they are prescribed by the treating clinician.  The establishment of such a comprehensive support package reflected the impact of the lack of disclosure of the result of clinical audit and the ensuing controversy on individual women and their families.  In January 2019, after careful consideration of the situation which had arisen in respect of patients with cervical cancer who were not encompassed by the terms of the support package agreed by the Government for those affected by the CervicalCheck clinical audit non-disclosure issue, it was agreed the HSE would put in place arrangements to facilitate access to pembrolizumab for cervical cancer patients on a case-by-case basis in public hospitals when a treating clinician determined this to be in the patient&rsquo;s best interests.  The Minister for Health has no role in how doctors manage or the care of individual patients.  All prescribing decisions are entirely a mailer for the treating clinician, in line with patient safety protocols and the Medical Council guide to professional conduct and ethics.<br\/><br\/><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><br\/><br\/>The Deputies may also be aware that on 29 March 2019, the VHI sent a circular to oncologists advising them that it was extending cover to a number of new cancer medicines, including pembrolizumab.  This decision by the VHI applies only to private care for VHI private patients in private hospitals and will have no impact on the provision of care in public hospitals.  The effect of the VHI decision will be that VHI private patients in private hospitals may have access to a medicine not yet available in the public hospital system.  A number of the medicines or indications which the VHI has now decided to cover are at various stages of the HSE assessment and reimbursement process in accordance with the provisions laid down in the 2013 Act.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400033#FF00800","speaker":"1359","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557856200,"counter":368,"content":"<p>It was not worth including in the record the additional information not given on the floor of the House.

The deficits have a serious impact on the quality of choices people make, if they are able to make any, about how they receive the care they need.  The people who need the care are among the most vulnerable in society and it is the moral responsibility of the State to care for its most vulnerable citizens in their time of need.<\/p>  <p>  Deficits and challenges facing the health system are complex.  From my direct work with older people and their families in counties Sligo and Leitrim, south County Donegal and north County Roscommon, however, I know that older people do not receive the quality of home care support services they need to maintain their health and well-being, to allow them to continue to live independently within their homes and communities and to avoid or delay hospital residential care stays.  Home supports are critical for older people but it is clear that families do not receive affordable home care supports of an adequate quality.<\/p>  <p>  The Citizens' Assembly dealt with the issue and the findings were clear.  A total of 99% of members wanted the Government to expedite the current commitment to place home care on a statutory footing.  Life expectancy is rising and people aged above 65 can expect to live into their 80s, with two thirds of these years lived disability free.<\/p><p>The number of people aged over 85 is projected to double in the next 20 years.  The number of people aged over 65 will increase by 59%.  This will create capacity challenges and has been well signalled.  The ESRI report on health care projections noted the demand for home care packages will increase by between 44% and 66% by 2030 and the demand for home help hours will increase between 38% and 54%.  The health service capacity review also flagged this.<\/p> <p> Older people can sustain an independent lifestyle at home if they receive appropriate and timely quality physical and psychological supports.  The absence of available supports impacts fundamentally on the range of choices available to older people.  Without access to home care supports some older people are forced to move to residential care settings, which are often not their first choice.  This undermines their human right to live with dignity and independence.  We know we need a large injection of funding in home supports to enable the service to meet its yearly growth in service users.<\/p> <p> The HSE national service plan for 2019 provides for a target of almost 17.9 million home support hours to be provided to 53,000 people.  Despite the significance level of service provision, demand continues and the waiting list will persist and rise.  At the end of March, 519 elderly people were on waiting lists for home care in community healthcare organisation area 1.  The average time spent on waiting lists for home care supports for non-priority cases is at least 3.3 months.  The average home care package is now six hours a week and not, as we all thought previously, ten hours.  Fewer hours are now being spread more thinly per client every week, with an increase in the provision of short 30 minute slots.  There is not much one can achieve in 30 minutes.<\/p> <p> There is an absence of legislative entitlement to home support and a lack of transparency and accountability.  There is limited access to packages due to chronic underfunding and the eligibility criteria for supports remain unclear.  The overall lack of the provision of supports is the key issue.  My office is contacted by families and people needing to remain in hospital or who need to go to a nursing home because there are no supports at home, to where they want to return.  This is a serious deficit.  I know of one case where a man has been between hospitals for more than a year.  His home, which was not appropriate for him, has since been converted and now has a downstairs en suite bedroom, for which the HSE provided a hospital bed and a wheelchair.  The man cannot be sent home as there are no carer hours in the area.  It is far more expensive to keep him in a nursing home or hospital rather than provide a few hours to the family so this 93 year old man can come home.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400034#GG02100","speaker":"1344","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557856800,"counter":389,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Scanlon for raising this important issue.  I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague Deputy Jim Daly, the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health and older people.  The Government's core objective is to promote care in the community so that people can continue to live with confidence, security and dignity in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  A wide range of services are provided, including home supports, day care and residential care, through direct service provision and through voluntary and private providers.<\/p>  <p>  Improving access to home support is a priority for the Government.  Over the past four years we have seen a considerable increase of nearly &euro;140 million in the budget, which has grown from &euro;306 million in 2015 to almost &euro;446 million in 2019.  More than 53,000 people will receive more than 18 million home support hours this year, including intensive home care packages to 235 people.  Despite this significant level of service provision, the demand for home support continues to grow.  The allocation of funding for home supports throughout the system, though significant, is finite and services must be delivered within the funding available.<\/p>  <p>  Preliminary data indicates that during the first quarter of the year 4.2 million hours were delivered nationally, 4,411 new clients commenced the service and 6,238 people have been assessed and are waiting for either new or additional home support services.  I acknowledge that in some cases access to the service may take longer than we would like.  However, the HSE has assured the Department that people on a waiting list are reviewed as funding becomes available to ensure that individual cases continue to be dealt with on a priority basis within the available resources and as determined by the local front-line staff, who know and understand the clients' needs and who undertake regular reviews of those care needs to ensure the services being provided remain appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  The allocated home support budget for community healthcare organisation area 1, which covers Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Monaghan and Sligo in 2019 is &euro;44.3 million.  This is an increase of approximately &euro;4.5 million on last year&rsquo;s allocated budget.  While the overall aim is to be as responsive as possible to all applications, delays can occur.  According to the HSE, currently the home support budget for the Sligo, Leitrim and west Cavan region is experiencing demand in excess of the funding available.  Preliminary data shows 205 people are waiting for new or additional hours.  In this context, those clients who are assessed and who are not provided immediately with a service are prioritised based on the clinical assessment and are placed on a waiting list for a resource as it becomes available.  The number of people waiting for funding for home support services reflects a point in time.  While the existing home support service is delivering crucial support to many people throughout the country, it is acknowledged that the service and access to the service need to be improved to better meet the changing needs of our citizens.  This is why we intend to establish a statutory scheme for home support services that will improve access to the service on an affordable and sustainable basis while also introducing a system of regulation that will ensure public confidence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400035#HH00200","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1557856800,"counter":390,"content":"<p>There is a specific commitment in the programme for Government to introduce uniform home care services so all recipients can receive quality support seven days a week.  The Minister of State is right that every year the funding has increased but it is still not sufficient to meet the demand that exists.  The Minister of State spoke about 205 people waiting.  That is actually 205 families waiting for some help and support so they can bring their loved ones home, where they want to keep them and where they want to be themselves, and where they can be looked after.  We all know the cost of nursing home care.  It is &euro;1,000 or &euro;1,200 a week.  The sum of &euro;100 a week would keep people in their homes with the support and help of their families.  Quite honestly, it is economic madness not to provide the funding.  I agree the funding has increased but not sufficiently to look after these people.  It is small money when we compare it to the cost of the children's hospital, which I agree has to be built and is badly needed.  When we consider we are over budget on the children's hospital by &euro;450 million or &euro;500 million, I believe &euro;5 million would solve the home help problem nationally.  It would allow people to have enough home help and home care to look after their loved ones at home.  The Government owes it to these people who have worked all their lives, paid their taxes and reared their families.  Now they are being left without support or help.  It is wrong.  Some people wait for three and a half months.  It is disgraceful and the Government should do something.  We are not speaking about millions or billions of euro.  We are speaking about small money of &euro;4 million or &euro;5 million to sort out the problem for the people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400035#HH00300","speaker":"1344"},{"type":"speech","time":1557856800,"counter":391,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Scanlon and I take his point on the economic argument.  There are strong indicators that it is the sensible thing to do.  We also have a situation where people now live longer than they have ever done in the history of the State.  Success in improved health and extended life expectancy has been achieved in recent decades and every year there is an increase of 20,000 in the over-65 population.  There is an obvious need to provide high quality and flexible services that not only best meet the needs of individual clients, but also reduce pressures elsewhere on the health system.  This is another argument.  Social care services, including home care, day care and respite, are an important component in enabling people to remain living at home and participating in their own communities.  They also provide valuable supports to carers.<\/p>  <p>  We are aiming to improve home support services so people can remain living with confidence, dignity and security in their own homes.  While the existing service is delivering crucial support throughout the country, I recognise that home support services need to be augmented to better meet the changing needs of our citizens.  The Department is engaged in a detailed process to develop a new stand-alone statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home support services.  This is a point on which the Deputy spoke strongly.  This scheme is a key action under the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy, along with improving and developing supports in the community.

Today in the D&aacute;il, the Taoiseach said the State could have acted, but did not.  It was a very welcome comment.  He also said the abuse compensation scheme was not working, which was also a very welcome and significant comment.<\/p><p>This is a topic in which I have a deep personal interest, having worked closely for a number of years with the lads from VOCADS and Creagh Lane in Limerick.  To be honest, I am absolutely disgusted at how survivors of historical child sexual abuse have been treated by Fine Gael and by previous Governments.  These men are currently barred from accessing compensation for the horrific abuse they suffered and the Government has steadfastly stood in their way of justice.  Last July, the Government was defeated by 84 votes to 44 on a D&aacute;il motion which sought to allow victims of primary school sexual abuse to seek redress on the same basis as victims of residential institutional abuse.  The D&aacute;il instructed this Government, by a large majority, to change how this scheme operates, but in the arrogant approach that is the trademark of this Fine Gael Government, it ignored it.  This, of course, is because Fine Gael knows better than everybody else.<\/p><p>This D&aacute;il motion outlined how the State&rsquo;s <i>ex gratia<\/i>redress scheme, set up after Louise O&rsquo;Keeffe won her European Court of Human Rights case in 2014, could be amended to include victims in cases who cannot prove a prior complaint.  It would only cost about &euro;15 million, which is not that much in the grand scheme of things.  The prior complaint interpretation of the Louise O&rsquo;Keeffe judgment is total nonsense and the Minister knows that, as did previous Ministers.  It was designed by officials and lawyers to lock survivors out and keep the compensation bill down for the State, hoping that many of them would die and would not be able to access the compensation.  It is a despicable approach to take with survivors of child sexual abuse.<\/p><p>The fight against the State which the men from Creagh Lane have had to put up has been shocking.  They were subjected to the most horrendous sexual abuse as children in Creagh Lane national school in Limerick but denied redress due to barriers put in place by Fine Gael.  Some of these men have shared their stories publicly.  One, who was abused at the age of eight, said &quot;School was about survival, I&rsquo;d be looking at the teacher thinking &quot;just stay away&quot;&quot;.  Another, who was abused at the age of six said &quot;I was screaming and had to be tied into a buggy with a rope to be brought to school.  The children never spoke about it, we just kept our heads down and our mouths shut&quot;.  I know most of these lads personally, and many had never spoken about their abuse for years, with families and friends unaware what they went through.  This Government has forced these men to protest outside the D&aacute;il gates, to try to get their story highlighted in the media, to travel to Brussels to highlight their injustice in the European Parliament and to have a D&aacute;il debate which the Government has ignored.<\/p><p>Louise O&rsquo;Keeffe was dragged through the courts before she got justice and compensation, and it seems this Government is content to do the same to the remaining survivors who were locked out of the redress scheme.  The Government&rsquo;s handling of this situation has been shameful.  It is clear it does not understand the hurt and stress it is causing to survivors.  The abuse these men suffered as children ruined their childhoods and left a terrible scar on their lives.  The Government needs to show compassion to these people.  Can it please stop fighting these survivors of child sexual abuse in court, and provide them with the compensation that will allow them to get justice and move on with their lives?<\/p><p>On 7 July 2016, the then Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, told my colleague, Deputy Mary Lou McDonald, that payments had been made and that they would continue to be made under an <i>ex gratia<\/i>scheme.  That is clearly not the case.  The Minister told &quot;RT&Eacute; News&quot; at the weekend that no one had been paid.  Can he clarify this?  It cannot be both and either payments have been made or they have not.  Which is it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400036#JJ00200","speaker":"1327"},{"type":"speech","time":1557857400,"counter":394,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue and I acknowledge the Deputy's intervention with the Taoiseach today.  The legacy of sexual abuse against children, whether in residential institutions, in day schools or in any other setting, is appalling.  The Government calls on those who have evidence of prior complaint of abuse to bring that evidence forward in an open and transparent way to the appropriate authorities.  There is an onus on all those who have information or knowledge in relation to child abuse that may bring closure to a survivor to come forward with that information.<\/p><p>Prior to the Louise O&rsquo;Keeffe case to the European Court of Human Rights, ECHR, the domestic courts, up to and including the Supreme Court, had found that the State had no liability for day school abuse as it was not the owner or manager of the schools and, while it paid school teachers, it did not employ them.  The European Court of Human Rights found on the facts of the O&rsquo;Keeffe case that the responsibility of the State was engaged in certain circumstances.  A central facet of this case was that there had been a prior complaint of abuse in respect of the teacher who abused Ms O&rsquo;Keeffe.  In 2015, the State responded to the ECHR judgment by setting up an <i>ex gratia<\/i>scheme to specifically address the position of persons who had discontinued their proceedings against the State the wake of a number of High Court judgments and the Supreme Court judgment in the O&rsquo;Keeffe case.  In 2017, an independent assessor, retired High Court judge, Mr. Justice Iarfhlaith O&rsquo;Neill, was appointed to assess applications declined under the scheme.  As of today's date, 50 applications have been submitted to the scheme, 45 have been declined and the remaining five cases have not yet been determined.  A total of 20 applicants have sought an independent assessment.  The assessor&rsquo;s decisions are awaited in respect of these cases.  I look forward to receiving the assessor&rsquo;s decisions on the cases and his findings will be abided by.<\/p><p>It is important to recognise that the scheme is addressed to a specific cohort of historic, discontinued day school sexual abuse cases which were impacted on by the ECHR judgment in the O&rsquo;Keeffe case.  I am aware that survivors of day school abuse are pursuing cases through the civil courts and are receiving settlements, either through the courts or on an out-of-court basis.  The judgments have been secured against the actual abuser and-or the school management or patron.  In the latter case these have generally been religious congregations.  The Department is also continuing to receive notices of discontinuance, reflective of the fact that the domestic courts will not find the State liable where there is no evidence to support that liability.  In addition, the State Claims Agency has, to date, made settlements in 22 cases many of which also involve authorities responsible for schools.  In these cases, more than half the compensation paid has come from non-State parties.  This is reflective of the shared liability in these cases.<\/p><p>We have learned from our dark history of child abuse and put in place a set of measures to enhance child protection and make sure abuses of the past cannot recur.  We are constantly reviewing these measures and strengthening them, wherever possible.  As part of this ongoing process of reviewing child protection measures, significant developments include the following: the creation in 2012 of a criminal offence where a person fails to disclose to the police information in relation to certain serious offences, including sexual offences against children and vulnerable persons; the introduction of statutory vetting arrangements for people involved in working with children and vulnerable adults, including those working in schools; and the enactment of the Children First Act 2015.<\/p><p>As part of my Departments ongoing work to improve child protection measures across the education sector, the Department&rsquo;s inspectorate introduced child protection and safeguarding inspections in February 2019 as a new form of specialised child protection inspection.  These child protection and safeguarding inspections are designed to check that school boards and staff members are implementing the 2017 child protection and safeguarding procedures and will provide a further level of inspection in primary and post-primary schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400036#JJ00300","speaker":"1290"},{"type":"speech","time":1557857400,"counter":395,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response.

The Minister is new in this Department and I hoped he would take a different approach from that taken by his predecessors.  I wrote to him on 23 October to congratulate him on his appointment as Minister and to ask him to meet survivors of abuse which occurred at Creagh Lane national school in Limerick, as a priority.  It should be one of his top priorities but neither he nor anyone from his Department bothered to reply to my letter.

It is a great relief to see it come through tonight.  As a small, new party we are very proud to have made this modest difference to the lives of working mothers and fathers and their children.<\/p>  <p>  If it is in order, I would like to thank a number of people.  I thank Paul Cassidy, policy director of the Social Democrats, who has been centrally involved in drafting this Bill and dealing expertly with the many technical issues that arose during the passage of the Bill through the Oireachtas.  I also thank the Office of the Parliamentary Legal Advisers, OPLA.  There is much discussion about new politics and the importance of the Opposition parties being able to table and progress Private Members' Bills.  That can only happen if we have the support of the resources within the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is particularly the case in regard to smaller parties that may not have an array of legal advisers, unlike some of the bigger parties.  We were very grateful for the support we got from OPLA.  There is an issue around resources.  If we are genuinely to engage in new politics it is really important that that office, which is a key office, is adequately resourced and in a position to provide the kind of support throughout the drafting and redrafting periods and the passage of Bills.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill went through very smoothly in terms of its passage through the D&aacute;il.  Unfortunately, Government time was not allowed for it and so the Social Democrats had to use its limited Private Members' time over an extended period.  The Bill then went to the Seanad where, because we do not yet have Members, we were very much dependent on other parties allowing time for the taking of it.  Again, it was unfortunate that Government did not allow that time.  I pay special thanks to the Fianna F&aacute;il group in the Seanad, in particular to Senator Catherine Ardagh, who was very active in facilitating and promoting the taking of this legislation in the first instance.  I acknowledge the support of the Labour Party, in particular Senator Bacik, in facilitating the taking of Report Stage in its Private Members' time.  When it came to the later Stage, the Minister and the Government came on board.  I very much appreciate the taking of the Final Stage in Government time in the Seanad and again in this House today. <\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge the support of the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, and the officials in the Department of Justice and Equality for this legislation and for working in a collaborative way to bring it to its final conclusion tonight.  There was important, positive and progressive engagement between the Department, the Minister of State and my own party in this regard.  I very much appreciate that engagement and support.  <\/p>  <p>  It is important to also acknowledge the key role that parents played in regard to the successful passage of this legislation.  It was clear from a very early stage that there was a huge need to provide this kind of flexibility to parents who are trying desperately to strike a balance between their work and family lives.  Throughout the process, I got a real insight into where so many parents are at this point.  They are struggling to pay mortgages and rent and to keep their heads above water.  Parents of young children are put to the pin of their collar to get by and keep the show on the road.<\/p><p>Many people find the pressures excessive and that is why there was such a level of interest in this legislation.  It provides the extra flexibility that parents so desperately need.  Parents have told stories of having to get up at 4 a.m. and the unsustainability of doing that.  Parents are coping with children with special needs.  Others, because they are working long hours, rarely get to spend quality time or quantities of time with their children.  They want that little bit of breathing space to allow them to collect their kids from school or to do different activities at different times.  Those things are so important because the early years go so quickly.  It is really important that we have agreed this legislation.  It will make a major difference to the lives of so many families and children.<\/p> <p> I thank everyone involved in bringing this legislation to a conclusion.  It is very important that, while we have agreed on the extension of unpaid parental leave, we continue with the expansion of paid parental leave, particularly in fulfilling the commitment contained in the programme for Government to ensure that parents are in a position to provide care for their children in their own homes for the first critical 12 months.  Slow progress has been made on that.  I acknowledge the two weeks of additional paid leave provided for in this years budget, which will come into effect in November.  It is really important, but we really have to progress that and ramp up the progress of that commitment.  It is really important.<\/p> <p> This should be seen as the start of a new approach to enabling parents to strike that balance between family life and work life.  Ireland is very much at the lower end of the league in European and, indeed, international terms when it comes to providing supports for parents in rearing their children.  These should really be seen as parents' rights and children's rights.  We have a lot more to do in terms of providing paid leave and unpaid leave.  In the context of paid leave, we must get to the point where the replacement rate for parents taking that leave gets closer to the actual costs of foregoing pay on a weekly basis.  Nordic countries in particular, and many other European countries, provide payments that equal 80% or even 100% of pay when parents take paid parental leave.  We have a long way to go.<\/p> <p> I hope that, through considering and passing this legislation, we might now start a serious public debate on how to ensure that work does not dominate people's lives to the extent it does now.  It results in major stress and pressure for people.  Many other countries, and indeed individual companies, are looking at the idea of a four day week and a three day weekend.  It brings huge benefits to individuals in terms of relieving stress and mental health difficulties and reduces sick pay and sick leave.  It also provides time for people to do those other things that allow them to live a full and balanced life.  We are a bit behind the curve in this country,.  I would like to see us move to a point where we have a much greater appreciation of the need to strike a balance in our lives.  The State has a particular role to play in taking the initiative in this regard.  We should also encourage private companies, especially bigger companies, and also the State and semi-State sector, to begin to trial some of these initiatives.  They have proven very successful in other places.  It has not been completely plain sailing, but the measures have mainly proven successful in other countries.  We should start that debate.<\/p> <p> This is a very important night for parents and children.  I hope that it is the start of an even better, more compassionate and more balanced approach to the world of work, particularly as it concerns the parents of young children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400037#KK03400","speaker":"1222","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557858600,"counter":428,"content":"<p>I welcome the passing of this important Bill and I commend the Social Democrats on bringing it forward two years ago.  I acknowledge, as Deputy Shortall has fairly done, the role played by Senator Ardagh of Fianna F&aacute;&iacute;l, along with other Senators, in pushing it through the Seanad.  I also commend the Government, and the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, on the work that has been done.  The Minister of State has facilitated the Bill's smooth passage through this House and the Seanad.  Much is said about new politics and how it has its limitations, which are unquestionable - I will not go into that now - but it also has its advantages and strengths.  For example, in a situation where the Government does not have a majority, Members from different political parties, Government and Opposition, are obliged to engage with each other in order to try to ensure that legislation of public benefit can be enacted.  That is what has happened in this instance.  There was no desire on the part of the Government to block legislation coming from a source other than itself.  There was no desire on the part of Fianna F&aacute;il to be proprietorial or to claim that it should not be supported because it was a Social Democrats policy.  The same applies to all other parties in this House.  It was recognised that this was a very important piece of legislation which would have significant consequences for parents in Ireland.  When it is enacted and its effects are felt, parents will certainly feel the benefit.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State and the Government, and indeed all parties in the House, were concerned about the impact it may have had upon employers if there was to be an immediate significant alternation of the provisions.  It is important that employers are brought along with this legislation.  We do not want to be in a situation where employers do not recognise that this can be of benefit to them as well.  As Deputy Shortall stated, work is an essential part of people's lives.  However, there comes a time when it may become too dominant.  There is no more precious or privileged opportunity a person can have than to bring a child into the world.  It is important that we avail of that time, that we enjoy it, and that parents are given the chance to spend time with their children in their early years.  Anyone with a child will know that the childhood years pass very quickly.  They are precious times, and we should ensure that both parents can spend time with the child in what is an incredibly important formative time.<\/p>  <p>  I commend everyone in the House on the work done in respect of this Bill.  That work illustrates the fact that we can work on new politics and that it has its benefits when we work together on issues.  I hope there is a recognition in years to come that work is not everything, that there are more precious things in life.  Spending time with one's children is one of the more precious and privileged things we can all do.  Deputy Michael McGrath, who has more children than many of us, will be able to speak in full detail about how he will be able to enjoy his time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400038#LL00200","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1557858600,"counter":429,"content":"<p>He will be entitled to a lot of leave.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400038#LL00300","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1557858600,"counter":430,"content":"<p>I warmly congratulate Deputy Shortall and her colleagues in the Social Democrats for bringing forward this legislation, and indeed for persevering with it.  Even though we have a minority Government, for an opposition Member to get a Bill through is incredibly difficult, and it requires some buy-in from the relevant line Minister and the support of the Civil Service, as well as some technical advice from the Office of the Parliamentary Legal Counsel.  I congratulate the Deputy for sticking with it and getting this through.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Shortall said that it will make a modest difference.  As she knows from the correspondence she receives, it will make a significant difference for many parents and families.  The reality is that, at a very simple level, school holidays can be a nightmare for parents who are working full time.  They end up paying out a great deal of money to put children into summer camps, which have a lot of value in their own right, in order to get through that period.<\/p><p>For those parents and co-operative employers, and many of them are, this is of real value.  There will be challenges for some employers.  I know issues were raised within the public sector.  Those challenges can be worked out, however, as enacting this legislation will be for the greater good of society.<\/p> <p> On the back of this, I hope a comprehensive information guide will be given out.  From the interaction I have had with parents about this Bill and parental leave generally, I know many of them are not aware of how the system operates.  For example, it is not widely known by parents who might be affected that the qualifying age for children with certain disabilities or long-term illnesses is already 16.  I have seen questions asked online as to whether parental leave applies to both parents or if there is a separate individual entitlement for both parents to the full amount of leave.  Again, we should not assume that everybody knows all these facts.  Similarly, it is not widely known that one&rsquo;s PRSI record will not be impacted adversely because PRSI credits are accrued when one is on parental leave.  I hope that, through the Workplace Relations Commission, the Department and the Citizens Information website, proper information is provided regarding these changes, along with the overall operation of the parental leave regime.  People who have not used their full entitlement for a child who is currently aged nine have inquired if they have to wait until September for the phasing in of the extra leave to claim the already unused period of leave.  These are simple and straightforward questions which could make a real difference to the lives of many parents.<\/p> <p> I again congratulate Deputy Shortall, her colleagues and all those who have played a role in ensuring this Bill will become law.  It will make an important difference in the day-to-day lives of many families across the country.  It is a sign that when politicians work together that we can achieve for the betterment of the people we serve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400038#LL00400","speaker":"1223","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557859200,"counter":432,"content":"<p>I commend Deputy Shortall and her party, as well as the Minister of State and other Oireachtas Members who supported this legislation.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Shortall has described this Bill as making a modest difference.  However, it will make a real and significant difference for many parents and families.  Raising a child is one of the most important things anyone will ever do.  It is an ambition for many and a treasured part of people&rsquo;s lives.  However, it is challenging in the context of a society increasingly focused on work.  It is hard to raise a child when one is in full-time work or trying to get back into work.  Schemes such as this are vitally important to support parents in raising a child.  There is a need for much more, however.  This legislation gives much increased flexibility which is required.  We need to do more, however.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Michael McGrath alluded to summer camps.  On Sunday in Cork there was a summer camps expo.  While I am sure summer camps are valuable, it is an insight into people&rsquo;s anxiousness and the difficulties of balancing and minding children during the summer holidays while working.<\/p>  <p>  There are also many other challenges compared to other European jurisdictions.  We have much more to do, not just with early years education but also wraparound childcare to facilitate people.  It is a challenge for people when school finishes at 2.30 p.m. and there is no afterschool provision.  That needs to be addressed.  Valuable as this legislation is, many will not be able to avail of its provisions because they cannot afford to do so.  That is not a criticism of Deputy Shortall&rsquo;s Bill.  Obviously, she could not bring forward legislation to increase parental benefit because it would be a charge on the Exchequer.  However, it urgently needs to be addressed.  Many who can afford to take parental leave will do so.  However, many other parents will not be in a position to do so.<\/p>  <p>  I agree there needs to be greater information.  Many parents are not aware of the full benefits which exist.  When mothers are returning to work after pregnancy, are we confident that every employer is treating them fairly?  That is an issue which needs to be tackled, along with the need for wraparound childcare and increased investment in parental benefit.<\/p>  <p>  As has been acknowledged, it is difficult to bring Private Members&rsquo; legislation through all Stages in the D&aacute;il and Seanad.

He envisaged that, as technology advanced, all of us would have an easier and better time and would not work as hard.  Unfortunately, we are all taking work home in our pockets, namely, with our smartphones.  We have all heard stories about people answering emails at 2 o'clock in the morning.  Work never stops.  Politicians may do that a lot.  I know I do a fair bit of it.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Shortall spoke about work-life balance, which is important, and there is an EU directive on this.  This Bill is an example of new politics working.  Any legislation which comes before the House needs to be analysed and improved where possible.  We did this with this legislation.  I congratulate Deputy Shortall for her work on and tenacity with this Bill, as well as making the case for it strongly, respectfully and conscientiously.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has always been anxious to support families, parents and children.  Members referred to paid parental leave.  That is currently with the committee and we are waiting for the pre-legislative scrutiny to be completed.  When that is finished, we will publish the legislation.  I would like to get at it before the summer recess to ensure parents can get paid to take parental leave for two weeks from November.<\/p>  <p>  The Government also has a responsibility to ensure legislation is constitutional and must take advice from the Attorney General's office on that.  I am happy we improved the Bill as it went through.  There were several technical issues which we spotted and which we worked out with the co-operation of Deputy Shortall and her colleagues.<\/p>  <p>  This has been one of the fastest Bills through this Stage, with no debate on any of the amendments.  That in itself shows how much work has been done in this House and in the Seanad.  I commend all Senators and Deputies involved.<\/p>  <p>  We have to be cognisant of the impact of this legislation on business, particularly small businesses with three or four employees, to ensure they can carry on.  If employees are happy and can take a day off a week, it cuts down on childcare costs and ensures they will stay in their jobs rather than giving them up.  I am anxious to encourage women to stay in work.  The Gender Pay Gap Information Bill will be dealt with later and we have the better balance initiative to ensure more women are on State and company boards.  It is important we have women involved in decision-making at the highest level and that we tackle the gender pay gap.<\/p>  <p>  We will not delay the Bill&rsquo;s commencement.  My officials and the Office of the Attorney General are preparing a commencement order for signature after enactment.  The Minister for Justice and Equality will sign the order on 19 July to allow the legislation to come into effect six weeks before the date which the entitlement to leave comes into force.  It is intended that the commencement order will enable the entitlement to additional leave to come into effect from 1 September 2019.  Otherwise, there is a risk that it could be three months after that.  That is why we amended this.<\/p>  <p>  I thank all Members for their co-operation and their work on this legislation.

The purpose of the Bill is to provide for a requirement that employers with 50 or more employees publish certain information on the differences in pay between female and male employees.<\/p><p>The gender pay gap is a well-known phenomenon which is receiving more and more attention in Ireland and internationally.  Most commentators on the gender pay gap are keen to find ways to reduce it and legislation providing for the publication of information concerning the pay gap at the level of the firm is seen as important in improving understanding of the pay gap and incentivising employers to use whatever means they can to reduce it.<\/p><p>The gender pay gap has long been an issue of concern at EU level.  In 2014, the European Commission issued a recommendation on pay transparency and this Bill can be seen as a response to it.  In 2017, the Commission adopted an action plan on the gender pay gap.  In addition to addressing the many aspects and causes of the pay gap, this plan raises the possibility that aspects of the 2014 recommendation might be the subject of a draft directive which would make them binding.<\/p><p>In Ireland, A Programme for a Partnership Government includes a commitment to promote wage transparency by requiring companies of 50 and more to complete a wage survey.  The National Strategy for Women and Girls 2017-2020 has a number of actions to address directly or indirectly the gender pay gap.  The action relevant to this debate is No. 1.23 to &ldquo;promote wage transparency by requiring companies of 50 or more employees to complete a wage survey periodically and report the results.&rdquo;  <\/p><p>In light of all of this, we have conducted extensive consultations on the gender pay gap.  In August to November 2017, we held a written consultation, which was followed by a well-attended seminar in January 2018.  The outcome of both of these lends ample support to this Bill.  I myself have spoken on many occasions and to a wide variety of groups on the issue.  The culmination is this Bill, which is an important measure to address the gender pay gap though, of course, it is not the complete solution.<\/p><p>Senator Ivana Bacik and her Labour colleagues in the Seanad have also done very good work.  They introduced the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (Gender Pay Gap Information) Bill, which has been passed by the Seanad and has gone through Second Stage here.  As I have said a number of times in both Houses, the Government shares the objective of this Bill but we do not agree with the mechanism it proposes for gender pay gap reporting.<\/p><p>On 7 February, the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality issued its report on pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme of the Bill which is before us.  This is a very informative and interesting report even if I disagree with some of its conclusions.<\/p><p>I turn now to the main provisions of the Bill.  Section 2 provides for the insertion of a new section 20A in the Employment Equality Act 1998.  This provides that the Minister for Justice and Equality shall, as soon as is reasonably practicable after commencement, make regulations requiring the publication of gender pay gap information.  The regulations must include certain items of information and there is a discretion to include additional items.  The items that must be included are the mean and median gap in hourly pay between men and women, in bonus pay and in hourly pay of part-time male and female employees; and the percentage of men and of women who received bonus pay and benefits in kind.<\/p><p>Section 20A(1)(c) requires the publication of the reasons, in the employer&rsquo;s opinion, for any gaps and of the measures, if any, that the employer is taking or proposes to take to eliminate or reduce gaps.  This reflects a recommendation in the pre-legislative scrutiny report of the Joint Committee and came from other interests as well.<\/p><p>In addition to the required information which I have outlined, the regulations may provide for the publication of the following information: the mean and median pay gap between men and women on temporary contracts, the percentage of each pay quartile who are men and who are women and the publication of pay gap information by reference to job classifications.<\/p><p>Section 20A(2) provides that, in making regulations, the Minister shall have regard to the estimated costs of complying with and enforcing the regulations.<\/p><p>Section 20A(3) provides for the threshold of employees above which the employer will be required to publish gender pay gap information.  The key point is that employers with fewer than 50 employees will not be covered.  It also provides for the phased introduction of the requirements on certain employers to report, namely, that the regulations shall not apply to employers with fewer than 250 employees before the second anniversary of the making of the first regulations, nor to employers with fewer than 150 employees before the third anniversary.  I will return to the thresholds and the phasing later.<\/p><p>Section 20A(4) provides that the regulations may prescribe, among other things, the classes of employer to which the regulations apply, subject to the thresholds I have just mentioned, the classes of employee and the classes of remuneration to be reported.<\/p><p>Section 20A(5) provides that the regulations may prescribe the form and manner in which and the frequency with which information is to be published in order to bring the information to the attention of the employees and the public.  For example, the regulations might require the employer to send the information to the employees in addition to publishing it on the employer&rsquo;s website and uploading it on a central Government website.  Publication will not be required more often than once a year.<\/p><p>Section 20A(6) provides for publication of gender pay gap information by each Government Department, scheduled offices, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces.  Essentially, the intention is that this legislation applies to the public as well as the private sector where the body in question is within the employment threshold.<\/p><p>Section 20A(7) provides for the situation in which the employer does not have access to pay information on employees.  In that case, the regulations may require the person who has such access to give the information, or access to the information, to the employer so that the latter can comply with the regulations.  This arises in the education sector where teachers are employed by a school board but are paid by the Department of Education and Skills.<\/p><p>Section 20A(8) provides that the regulations may prescribe measures to ensure that personal data have undergone pseudonymisation before or when they are released.  This means the processing of personal data in such a manner that the data can no longer be attributed to a specific person.<\/p><p>Section 3 is concerned with enforcement and inserts three new sections in the Employment Equality Act 1998.  These are sections 85B, 85C and 85D.  Section 85B provides for the appointment by the Minister of designated officers to investigate how employers prepare the information required to be published to ensure its accuracy.  Provisions already in the Employment Equality Act on powers to enter premises, obtain information and require persons to provide information and associated sanctions are applied to this situation.<\/p><p>Section 85C enables the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, to apply to the Circuit Court for an order requiring a person to comply with the regulations.  A person who fails to comply with a Circuit Court order is in contempt of that court.  Section 85D allows for an employee to make a complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, of non-compliance with reporting regulations by their employer.  The Director General of the WRC or an adjudication officer, to whom one would expect this function will be delegated, will investigate the complaint if satisfied that there is a <i>prima facie<\/i>case.  If, on investigation, the officer finds in favour of the complainant, he or she may make an order requiring the employer to take a specified course of action in order to comply.  This is the only remedy that may be ordered.  For example, compensation may not be awarded, as it is not an appropriate remedy in this situation.  Enforcement of WRC orders is through the District Court.<\/p><p>Sections 85C and 85D adopt the approach of requiring a person to comply with the regulations rather than penalising the person for failure.  If they fail to comply they are in contempt of court.  I prefer this approach to one of creating a criminal offence.  In contrast, the Labour Party Bill creates a summary offence with a maximum fine of &euro;5,000.  It is doubtful whether this would be an adequate sanction.  I would not be content to see perhaps substantial employers accepting a fine and failing to comply with the regulations.<\/p><p>Section 5 inserts a provision in the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014 to allow the Minister to request IHREC to consider exercising its powers under section 32 of that Act.  This section concerns the carrying out of equality reviews and the drawing up of equality action plans.  It will be for IHREC to decide whether to exercise its section 32 powers following the Minister&rsquo;s request.  For instance, the situation could arise that it becomes apparent to the Minister following publication of an employer&rsquo;s gender pay gap information on a central government website that the pay gap is abnormally large having regard to all relevant considerations.<\/p><p>It would then be appropriate to draw it to IHREC's attention and ask it to consider using the powers I have mentioned.<br\/><br\/>Section 6 provides that the Minister shall review the Act before the fifth anniversary of commencement.<br\/><br\/>I will return now to the question of the threshold at which the reporting requirement should apply.  In accordance with A Programme for a Partnership Government and the national strategy for women and girls, this is set at 50 employees.  There have, however, been calls for lower limits.  In its scrutiny report, the Oireachtas joint committee notes that the vast majority of companies in Ireland have fewer than ten employees.  The committee then recommended that the Bill reduce the threshold for public and private organisations to between ten and 15 employees.  Other interests have also argued that the proportion of employers that employ 50 or more people is very small, at 1.4% of employers, and that the vast majority of businesses will not have to report gender pay gap information.  Focusing on the percentage of employers that will be affected is only marginally relevant, if that.  What we need to consider is the proportion of employees that will come within the legislation.  According to the CSO's Business Demography 2016, almost 57% of employees are in firms with 50 or more employees.  However, when we look at the public service, which is also covered by the legislation, we find that organisations with fewer than 50 employees are rare.  According to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's databank, more than 99% of employees are in bodies which employ 50 or more.  These are figures from quarter 4 2018.  Taking the private and public sectors together, there are grounds for believing that approximately two thirds of employees are covered by the Bill.<br\/><br\/>The CSO uses a classification whereby firms with fewer than ten employees are regarded as micro, firms with between ten and 49 employees are small, firms with between 50 and 249 employees are medium and those with 250 or more are classified as large.  The committee's recommendation would take in all small firms and is, therefore, unacceptable.  At the same time, the committee recognises that extending the coverage of the scheme in this manner would cause problems because it goes on to state:<\/p><blockquote>With lower thresholds, consideration should be given to the capacity of smaller businesses to meet reporting requirements.  One option would be to establish a unit in the Department of Justice and Equality, or potentially the Revenue Commissioners, to provide necessary supports.<\/blockquote><p>My priority will be to get the resources needed to implement the overall reporting system.  Deputies generally and, in particular, those who have served as Ministers or Ministers of State, will recognise that setting up new units, etc., is far from easy and I would be totally against imposing the regulatory burden that this would entail for small business.<br\/><br\/>On phasing, the Oireachtas joint committee recommends extending the requirement for reporting within one year to all companies with 50 or more employees.  I believe, however, that it is better to phase in the introduction of gender pay gap reporting in the more measured way set out in the Bill, namely, by applying it to firms with 250 or more employees for the first two years, to those with 150 or more employees in the following year and to those with 50 or more employees the year after that.  This gives firms and those charged with administering the new system an adequate lead-in time and presents an opportunity to modify the regulations, if necessary.  We have an opportunity to learn.  Large companies have the resources, manpower and wherewithal to do this and they are willing to do it.

In recent decades, interventions aimed at addressing the gender pay gap, including equal pay legislation, a focus on educational outcomes for women and girls and anti-discrimination measures, have impacted upon gender equality.  However, the gender pay gap remains stubbornly persistent.  According to figures published by EUROSTAT in 2016, across the EU women's gross hourly earnings were 16.2% below those of men and the Irish gender pay gap was 13.9%.  The gender pay gap is experienced differently by different groups of women.  The gap is worse for older women, women from ethnic minorities and higher earners.  According to PwC, the potential long-term economic gains across the OECD from an increase in women in work would boost GDP by almost $6 trillion.<\/p>  <p>  Although equal pay legislation has been on the Statute Book and tackling pay discrimination for more than 40 years, we still have a significant problem regarding the gender pay gap.  The Gender Pay Gap Information Bill 2019 will require the phased introduction of pay gap reporting for any employer with more than 50 employees, as the Minister of State outlined.  Employers will be required to report the percentage mean and median pay gap for men and women in terms of hourly pay for both full-time and part-time employees, as well as any bonus pay.  Employers will also report on the proportion of male and female employees who receive bonuses or benefit-in-kind.<\/p>  <p>  While it is in some way understandable that the pay gap is widest for older employees, worryingly statistics suggest that the gap is now widening for younger women too.  In an age where significant strides are being made in other areas of gender equality, it is depressing that this remains the case.  It is clear from the lack of progress in this area that the only way the gender pay gap can be addressed is through Government intervention.  If companies over a certain size are required to publish information in respect of the gender pay gap, it focuses attention on the issue.  Although this is a positive step forward, we also recognise the limitations of this legislation.  This type of legislation will not be enough on its own.  We must also have measures to increase the number of women in better paid roles and occupations and to improve childcare provision.  We must also deal with gender stereotypes and ensure more women are involved in decision making.  Fianna F&aacute;il is committed to tackling the gender pay gap through its own measures of establishing an affordable childcare scheme and improving shared parental leave.<\/p>  <p>  If this Bill comes into force, we must ensure that businesses are supported in meeting the increased burden of complying with this requirement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400041#OO00200","speaker":"1271"},{"type":"speech","time":1557860400,"counter":443,"content":"<p>Fianna F&aacute;il will support this important legislation.  I agree with Deputy Niamh Smyth who noted that we introduced equal pay legislation 40 years ago.  That seminal legislation had an impact.  Unfortunately, however, we still do not have gender pay equality.  It is wholly unacceptable that a woman would not be paid the same as a man for doing the same job simply because she is a woman.  It is important that we recognise the need to produce innovative legislative proposals that will force companies to ensure they do not have gender pay inequality.  This legislation will start the process of achieving that outcome.<\/p>  <p>  We will never be able to eradicate inequality but we should be able to eradicate discrimination.  At the heart of this debate is the discriminatory act of women not being paid an equal amount as men for doing the same job.  That is against the law and we need to ensure we bring in legislation that will reveal where this practice is happening more easily than is the case at present.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to ponder on the statistics cited by Deputy Niamh Smyth in respect of the ongoing gender pay gap that exists in the European Union.  The Deputy noted that the earnings of women in the EU are 16.2% below those of men, while the Irish gender pay gap appears to be 13.9%.  I hope this legislation will have the desired effect.<\/p>  <p>  It is also important we recognise that gender pay inequality is completely unacceptable.  There is, however, another form of pay inequality that is not defined by gender or sexual orientation.  This is the extraordinary gap that now exists between those at the bottom level of companies and those at the top end.  While this is not a matter for today's debate, a report was published today by the Institute for Fiscal Studies in the United Kingdom.  I can assure the Ceann Comhairle this is not a left-leaning think tank.  In fact, it is criticised for being too pro-market.  However, the report deals with an issue that this House will have to address.  It indicates that there is a growing and dangerous level of inequality in pay in the UK and that the UK is catching up with the United States in this respect.  I have no difficulty with people earning good salaries and lots of money but I have a concern if they are increasing their salary on the back of other people having a declining income or having their income take from them.  It is important that we consider what Professor Sir Angus Deaton stated today when launching this report.  He warned of the dangers of disillusionment if people did not feel fairly rewarded for their work and that extreme wealth seemed to be gained by \"taking rather than making\".  He stated that \"people getting rich is a good thing\" but not if it meant \"enriching the few at the expense of the many\".<\/p><p>That report pointed out the fact that in the UK at present, the average chief executive of a FTSE 100 company now 145 times the average salary.  That is up from 47 times in 1998.  That is a trend that we see with many technology and big companies where people at the top earn vast amounts of money and the salaries of other people working within those companies or elsewhere are declining.  We do not know the reason for that.  It may be because of falling trade union membership, which is one of the reasons put forward by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, but it is having serious consequences in the UK and it is generating greater inequality there.<\/p> <p> Fortunately, in this country, I do not believe we have gone down the route of the UK and United States but we need to be very careful to ensure we do not allow a divergence to develop in incomes between people at the bottom and people at the top such that we have extraordinary inequality in the country in the same way as there is in the UK and the United States.  Obviously, one is never going to have uniformity in respect of people's salaries.  Equality is not about uniformity but we need to ensure that we do not allow a situation to develop here which has been identified and warned of by the Institute of Fiscal Studies.  This is something we need to keep an eye on in the future, that we do not allow a situation to develop where people at the bottom see their earnings dropping and dropping.  Fortunately, in this country, we have minimum wage legislation which we need to protect.  We also need to ensure we convey a message to companies that it is to their benefit to have employees who are well paid.  It is to the benefit of society if everyone is well paid as opposed to just large companies trying to run down wages so that profits can be made for shareholders and the greater salaries paid to the wealthy people at the top of the companies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400041#OO00300","speaker":"1296","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557861000,"counter":445,"content":"<p>T&aacute;im ag tac&uacute; leis an mBille seo.

We will support this Bill, although with reservations and we will introduce a number of amendments on Committee Stage.  The fight to ensure pay equality is another step in the battle to ensure equality between men and women.  I note, and I think it is unfortunate, that the Labour Party Bill, which essentially sought to achieve the same objective, is already at a very advanced stage.  I refer to the debate we had on the last piece of legislation and the fact that Private Members&rsquo; legislation, to which amendments were tabled, passed through all Stages and will now be commenced and will become law.  It is unusual, given that a Bill has passed through all Stages in the Seanad, including Second, Committee and Report Stages, and has proceeded to the D&aacute;il, not to work with that legislation rather than start again.  That is unfortunate.  We are starting with this legislation now and I may be wrong but it is possible this Government may not be in a position to pass it through all Stages.  I do not know what plans the Minister or Fianna F&aacute;il have.  We shall see.  It would have been more efficient and better in terms of procedure to work with a Bill that was already in train.<\/p>  <p>  That being the case, if the Minister intends to stay the course with this legislation, I ask that it be prioritised.  It is a vitally important piece of work.  We have travelled a long way in terms of equality idir fhir agus mhn&aacute; le blianta beaga anuas, &oacute; thaobh an v&oacute;ta c&eacute;ad bliain &oacute; shin agus i gcoinne na mbac a bh&iacute; ann &oacute; thaobh p&oacute;sadh sa St&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;s go dt&iacute; tr&iacute;ocha n&oacute; daicead bliain &oacute; shin.  We recently had the fight to repeal the eighth amendment that caused so much harm and suffering to women over more than 30 years.  We now have this fight for equal pay.  It is an issue right across the world.  It is starker perhaps in other parts of the world than it is here but is quite significant here.  According to the World Economic Forum, it would take 217 years to close the economic agenda gap globally.  It is quite significant in Ireland.  With a gap of 13.9%, it would take 55 years to close the gender pay gap in this jurisdiction, if we were to continue to do things in the same way.  That cannot be the case and we must change.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill is a mechanism that has been introduced in other jurisdictions.  Britain has gender pay gap reporting and similar proposals have been implemented in other EU countries and in the United States.  Measures similar to the ones proposed here are due to be signed off for the North in the coming months.  We welcome these moves.  They are not as a silver bullet, and many other issues need to be addressed.  I would highlight that a gender pay gap does not necessarily tell the whole story about the structural inequalities that exist within an economy.  If one takes the example of a childcare centre, which I think I raised with the Minister previously, where many of the employees are likely to be on low pay, if there are any men employed in it, the pay gap between men and women within that employment is likely to be quite low, if there is any.  That does not reflect the fact that there is a structural inequality between the professions in which women are commonly employed and men are more commonly employed.  This legislation does not necessarily deal with that.  It feeds into the point that Deputy O'Callaghan made, to which I will return because it was quite an interesting one.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill rightly reflects the responsibilities that employers have to tackle inequality within their employments, but there are also structural issues which go beyond any one job or employment.  It is right to shine a light on those businesses that might be fearful of the Bill's provisions &ndash; wrongly, I believe &ndash; and in which there is a significant pay difference, which is in inexplicable in some circumstances.  This is a way to bring pressure to bear and to shine a light on those who are making no effort to ensure equal treatment.<\/p>  <p>  Having regard to that, and the fact businesses with over 50 employees only make up half of the number of businesses in the State, we will be moving amendments on Committee Stage to increase the number of companies required to report under this legislation to include companies with 20 or more employees given that we believe that the more data that exists, the better the actions that can be taken to address the malaise of unequal pay on the basis of gender.  I will not labour the point about why we need the close the gender gap.  It is self-evident and is obviously necessary.  There will be few dissenting voices in Irish society and within these Houses in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  We know equality benefits to the economy and families by increasing the take-home pay of women with some projections in Britain estimating that women's earnings could increase by &pound;85 million on foot of measures such as this, which is a staggering amount of ground that could be made up.  There is not just one aspect to this.  A suite of measures is needed in order to cancel out what has been described as a motherhood penalty, which includes: improving shared parental leave; childcare that is affordable for parents and wraparound childcare, points we dealt with in the previous debate; and carrying out the work to ensure that flexible work practices become the norm.  Maternity benefit as a percentage of pay in this State is still one of the lowest in the EU.  Increases in this payment should be a priority for the Government, in seeing to the welfare of mothers and ensuring they have greater flexibility and options.<\/p>  <p>  The content of the Bill is relatively concise but we believe it needs to be strengthened.  The information specified in section 2 refers the mean and median gap in hourly pay between men and women, the mean and median gap in bonus pay between men and women, the mean and median gap in hourly pay, the percentage of men and women receiving bonus pay, and the percentage of men and women who receive benefits in kind.  While we believe this is reflective of the information required, we will table an amendment to ensure a full gender breakdown of all those employed, both part-time and full-time, in an attempt to achieve a fuller picture of the gaps and disparity that exists within companies more generally.  <\/p>  <p>  There is also a need to ensure that the area of partnerships and forms of employment such as that are dealt with.  This point was discussed at the pre-legislative hearings in committee.  Section 2 provides for a phased or staggered roll-out of the requirement for companies and employers to report with companies with 150 or more benefiting from a delay in their need to report and comply with the legislation.  We believe this is unnecessary and it is something of which employers have been aware for some time.  We will seek to amend this in order to do away with what we believe is a two-tiered approach and have all employers subject to the legislation once it comes to pass.<\/p><p> Our party moved an amendment to the Labour Party Bill to ensure that where a company does not comply with the legislation by refusing to publish data, the company's title would be published by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, and we will again table a similar amendment to this Bill.  At the time the amendment was debated, both Senator Bacik and the Minister of State indicated that any measure to take a \"name and shame\" approach should be complemented by a \"name and fame\" approach, listing companies that actively address the issue of the gender pay gap.  I have no difficulty with that and I am certainly willing to consider it.  I hope the Minister of State will consider that there is a need for both recognition and holding people to account.  Publicity can be as powerful as any fine in this regard and although there is a role for fines, the focus must be on shining a light and putting pressure on companies to comply, particularly those which actively discriminate.<\/p> <p> There are many other issues that must be addressed in tackling the gender pay gap.  As I stated, reporting of this kind will not address the overall gender pay gap.  The points reflected upon by Deputy O'Callaghan are true, and there is increasing inequality in how the global economy functions and major companies pay their staff.  We can look at models of employment such as that pursued by Amazon and the way it treats some of its low-paid employees in some distribution centres is quite worrying.  It is something of which we must be aware.  A factor is falling union density so I urge anybody following this debate to join a union.  It is an insurance policy that a person may never need to use but it is always worth having a union card in one's pocket.  Workers are stronger when they stand together and negotiate with an employer together.  It needs to be emphasised more in Irish society.<\/p> <p> The Government can take action to support union membership by ensuring there is better legislation on union recognition.  The tax deductibility of union contributions is another factor and perhaps incentives could be created for employers who recognise unions.  If we are serious about pay inequality and realise that gender inequality is real and needs to be tackled, we must also recognise that there is inequality in pay generally.  There must be support to ensure workers can organise freely and fairly in a democratic society.  The Government should encourage that as much as possible.  It is a key element of tackling the inequality issue.<\/p> <p> As I mentioned, the legislation we discussed immediately before this debate is relevant and the practice of shared parental leave is a step towards the idea of equality that would primarily benefit certain sections of society.  We need a range of measures to counteract the real effects of austerity and its impact on working class women in particular.  We need a serious conversation about how working class women and families have often shouldered the burden of austerity and cutbacks and how we want to assist them.  There is also the matter of those with unequal or insecure work.<\/p> <p> Ba mhaith liom a r&aacute; ar&iacute;s go dtaca&iacute;m leis an mBille agus go bhfuil s&uacute;il agam a bheith ag obair leis an Aire St&aacute;it ag C&eacute;im an Choiste ionas gur f&eacute;idir linn dul ar aghaidh leis an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht sin chomh luath agus is f&eacute;idir.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400042#PP00200","speaker":"1287","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557861600,"counter":447,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies who contributed to the debate.  I will consider all views, although I may not agree with all of them.<\/p>  <p>  I stated in my opening comments that this Bill is a very important step.  It does not provide a complete solution to the problem of the gender pay gap and Deputy Niamh Smyth is correct in that the gender pay gap arises because of many causes, including women being inadequately represented at the higher levels of organisations and in higher paying occupations, absences from the paid workforce in order to discharge caring roles and gender stereotypes.  Gender stereotyping is a problem on which I am focusing in the National Strategy for Women and Girls 2017-2020.  Such issues are being addressed in that strategy.  In the next few weeks I hope to launch the first report of the Balance for Better Business group of senior business leaders looking at measures and targets to improve gender balance on corporate boards.  In due course they will consider gender balance among senior management as well.<\/p>  <p>  We looked very closely at the Labour Party Bill and I would have liked to have progressed it.  However, the main thesis of the Bill was unamendable in reality and it went on a completely different track to what we wanted.  We are where we are with the current Bill and I thank colleagues for supporting it.  I met representatives of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, IBEC and Chambers Ireland, etc., and the trade unions and employers are agreed on this phased approach that will affect companies with more than 250 personnel first.  We want to get this right and in order to do that we must start with larger employers and get the template right and working correctly.  When this is done, we can learn from the process and move to other businesses.  If we start with smaller businesses, they may struggle and we could end up with all kinds of issues.<\/p>  <p>  In a time of virtually full employment, other matters come into play with respect to other pressures on employers to find workers and so forth.  There are many women out there who want to work and who have much to contribute.  We want to support and encourage them in doing that.

Rents continue to spiral out of control, house prices continue to rise, real social housing need continues to grow and the number of adults and children in emergency accommodation has hit historical highs.  By any meaningful indicator, the Government's housing plan is failing, yet every day the Taoiseach and his Ministers claim Rebuilding Ireland is working.  Yesterday's <i>daft.ie<\/i>rent report is further evidence that the Government has lost control, and the Taoiseach's and Minister's responses to the report yesterday and today show once again how out of touch they are.  How can anyone looking at the evidence say rent pressure zones are working when new rents are up by 7% in Dublin, 13% in Limerick, 16% in Waterford and a staggering 17% in Galway?  The average new rent across the State is now &euro;1,300 per month.  One would need take-home pay of &euro;4,000 for that to be affordable.  Here in Dublin, the average new rent ranges from &euro;1,700 to &euro;2,200 per month.  One would need take-home pay of between &euro;5,500 and &euro;7,000 for that to be affordable.  However, without the slightest tinge of irony, the Minister, Deputy Murphy, told the D&aacute;il today that rent pressure zones are working.  Worse still, he claimed yesterday that the rate of rent increases is the lowest since 2013.  Both these statements are factually incorrect.  Data from the Residential Tenancies Board and <i>daft.ie<\/i>show that they are simply not true but that does not matter to the Minister who could not even grace us with his presence this evening.  He just makes it up as he goes along and carries on regardless.  While tens of thousands of tenants are either strangled with excessive rents or locked out of the rental market without any hope of making a home, the Minister carries on.<\/p><p>The <i>daft.ie<\/i>report yesterday also told us that the number of properties available to rent in the past quarter was the lowest since 2006.  This is no surprise.  Since January 2017, more than 12,000 rental properties have left the market.  Accidental and semi-professional landlords, taking advantage of rising house prices, are selling up and moving on.  What is the Government doing to deal with this disorderly exit of rental properties from the market?  Absolutely nothing.<\/p><p>There is nothing in the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Bill going through the Houses of the Oireachtas that will address either excessive rents being paid today or the loss of rental properties.  The Government knows that Sinn F&eacute;in is supporting that Bill, mainly because it provides for measures we have been calling for since 2016.  Unfortunately, however, it is like so much of this Government's housing policy - too little, too late and already overtaken by events.<\/p><p>Fine Gael's strategy for the private rental sector is simply in tatters.  It is not working and it is making matters worse, as it is with social housing, affordable housing, homelessness, Traveller accommodation and accommodation for people with disabilities and wheelchair users.  The question many people are asking is &quot;Why?&quot;.  The answer is that Rebuilding Ireland is based on the same failed policy consensus that has dominated Government housing policy for decades, a consensus that underinvests in public housing and over-relies on the private sector to meet social and affordable housing need.<\/p><p>Last October, when this Chamber passed the Raise the Roof housing motion, which 40 or so Deputies from the Opposition benches signed, we made four demands.  These were to double capital investment in public housing and public land; introduce emergency measures to stem the flow of families into homelessness; take urgent action to stop the rise in rents; and hold a referendum to enshrine a right to housing in the Constitution.  Eight months on, these demands are more urgent than ever, yet the Government refuses to listen.<\/p><p>The Bill before us deals with one of these Raise the Roof demands.  The Thirty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Right to a Home) Bill is very simple.  It seeks to insert in the Constitution, this State's foundational law, a right to adequate, appropriate, secure, safe and, crucially, affordable housing.  It also seeks to place an obligation on the State to ensure the realisation of that right through its laws and policies in accordance with the principles of social justice.  This proposition was endorsed by 84% of the people involved in the Constitutional Convention in 2014.  It is a right that exists in many jurisdictions, including Belgium, Finland, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Sweden, to name just a few.  If passed, it would not guarantee every person in the State a home but it would provide a basic floor of protection, obliging the State to realise that right progressively.  According to Mercy Law Resource Centre, which has published three separate reports on the issue, a constitutional right to housing would &quot;mean that legislation and policy would have to be proofed to ensure they reasonably protect that right&quot;.  Mercy Law Resource Centre goes on to say that while a legal right to a home is not a silver bullet and would not solve all our housing problems overnight, it is an important tool that would ensure this Government and future Governments introduce policies that promote and protect access to appropriate, secure and affordable homes.<\/p><p>Based on its previous record, I have little doubt but that Fine Gael will oppose this Bill tonight.  No matter the script the good Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, has been given to read out in the absence of the Minister, Deputy Murphy, or either of the two Ministers of State in his Department, the real reason Fine Gael will oppose this Bill, if that is what it does, is that it fears an approach to social policy based on human rights.  More importantly, however, it fears the wrath of those in emergency accommodation, those crippled with excessive rents, those languishing on housing waiting lists and those locked out of buying or renting a home in any possible referendum.<\/p><p>Tonight, however, it is Fianna F&aacute;il that holds the balance of power.  In the past, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin's party has voted down similar Bills from Sinn F&eacute;in and other Opposition parties here, but its housing spokesperson, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, has indicated a willingness to revisit this issue.<\/p><p>I appeal to Fianna F&aacute;il tonight to work with the rest of the Opposition to advance this Bill.  As always, Sinn F&eacute;in is open to considering amendments on Committee Stage, if amendments are necessary.  Our parties worked together on student accommodation and we forced the Government's hand to the benefit of thousands of students.  We worked together on increasing Part V obligations and we again forced the Government's hand to increase the output of much-needed social housing.  We also worked together on the Management Fees (Local Property Tax) Relief Bill 2018 and once again forced the Government's hand to the benefit of thousands of hard-pressed apartment owners.  If Fianna F&aacute;il is willing to support this Bill tonight we can yet again force the Government's hand to the benefit of tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of people in real housing need.  <\/p> <p> This Saturday, Raise the Roof protesters will again be marching on the streets of Dublin.  Thousands of people will be demanding a legal right to a home.  Those people will include the entire trade union movement, the entire student union movement and whole swathes of civil society, homeless organisations, housing associations, grassroots groups, citizens and residents.  All of them will be calling on this House to act.  We have an opportunity tonight to do just that.  We can take an important step towards ending the Fine Gael housing crisis and provide the people with an important tool to vindicate their right to appropriate, secure and affordable homes.  Even if there are Deputies in this Chamber who do not support a constitutional right to housing, surely they believe the people should get to have their say on such an important matter.  <\/p> <p> Let us do the right thing.  Let us pass the Thirty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Right to a Home) Bill 2016.  Let us provide a legal, constitutional right to a home and then let us get out on the streets on Saturday and raise the roof to demand real solutions to the housing emergency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400044#TT00300","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557862800,"counter":457,"content":"<p>I am proud to stand here this evening and support this Bill.

Providing for the constitutional right to a home will oblige the State to make reasonable provision to vindicate that right through its policies and actions.<\/p>  <p>  This is not a novel idea.  More than 80 countries around the world provide for the right to a home in their constitutions and providing for such a right in Ireland is a position supported by the United Nations special rapporteur for adequate housing.  It is the right thing to do.  That is why we in Sinn F&eacute;in are moving this Bill this evening and calling on every Deputy here, including Government Deputies, to support it.  We are in the midst of an unprecedented housing crisis in this State.  It is a crisis that is out of control and which worsens with every passing day.  We all know the statistics, the figures and the numbers.  They make for abhorrent reading.  The reality, however, is there is really no way to quantify the social and human cost of a crisis that now permeates every part of our society.  <\/p>  <p>  Families with good incomes, that would never have faced difficulties in securing a place to live in years gone by, now live in fear that a hike in their rent could push them into homelessness.  Young people, as well as couples in their 20s, 30s and into their 40s, unlike their parents before them, have no prospect of ever being able to afford their own home.  They are caught in a rent trap.  They are paying out-of-control rents and unable to save up for a deposit.  Tens of thousands of low and middle-income families, once able to secure council houses or affordable homes, now languish on waiting lists that will never be cleared.  <\/p>  <p>  Thousands of children go to bed every night in family hubs and bed and breakfasts deprived of a basic right that should not be a luxury in childhood, that is, somewhere to call home.  Behind every outworking of this crisis are real lives and real people.  The Government, in the guise of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, just does not get that.  They persist in peddling a lie that the Government's housing plan is working when it is patently clear it has not, is not and will not.  They do not seem to understand the predicament of tens of thousands of people.  In fact, last year the Taoiseach advised young people who wish to buy a home to ask their parents for the money for a deposit.  <\/p>  <p>  Let me assure the D&aacute;il that those who can do that are few and far between.  This nonsense just goes to show how out of touch with reality the decision makers are.  We have people on the Government benches formulating housing policy who simply do not understand or care about the struggles of ordinary people.  Perhaps that is because those in government will never struggle.  Perhaps it is because those in government believe they represent those who can run to mammy and daddy for a deposit.  They really should know that is not an option for the vast majority of people.  It is not the world in which most people live and it is ludicrous and preposterous to suggest that.  Coupled with that is an ideological opposition on the part those in government to State intervention in the housing market.  That is because it is most unlikely that those in government will ever face the prospect of spending a night in emergency accommodation and perhaps that is the crux of the problem.  <\/p>  <p>  The truth is that we can bring the housing crisis under control.  We can build homes and we can house every citizen in this State.  That will only be possible, however, if there is a will to do so at every level and that has to start at the top.  We need a change of direction and a change of policy.  We need bold and urgent action.  We need to double investment in social and affordable housing to deliver homes.  We need to introduce a temporary tax relief for renters, alongside an emergency rent freeze for three years.  We also need to move now to enshrine the right to housing in the Constitution.  Real courage, real vision and real leadership are called for.  It is time to call a halt to inaction.  That is why I urge all Deputies, from all parties and none, to support the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400045#UU00200","speaker":"1239"},{"type":"speech","time":1557862800,"counter":458,"content":"<p>It is a pity the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, is not here to account for his and the Government's policy failures in respect of the housing crisis.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin has pointed out that the Government is entirely failing to arrest runaway rents.  There are supposed to be rent pressure zones in Cork city but there has been a 10% increase in rental prices, while in the wider county the increase has been 12%.  There has been a 480% increase in child homelessness during Fine Gael's time in government.  It is a scandal and it is clear that Rebuilding Ireland is not working.<\/p>  <p>  I presume the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, is here in the guise of being the Minister of State tasked with responsibility for law reform.  It is a pity, as I said, that the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government is not present but it is apt that the Minister of State is, because this also is a matter of justice and of equality.  Housing is one of the most fundamental rights.  It is a right without which it becomes very difficult to fulfil a life properly and move on to other rights.  We will be dealing for years with the consequences of children and families being in emergency accommodation and the disruption that causes to them.  <\/p>  <p>  Far from the situation improving, anecdotally I see an increase in the number of families with whom I am dealing in emergency accommodation.  Some of them have been in emergency accommodation on an ongoing basis.  I give the recent example of somebody who was on the housing list for 11 years in Cork city.  She was evicted from her house and moved into emergency accommodation.  She was then moved from that emergency accommodation, from that family hub, out of the city to Kinsale and into other emergency accommodation.  She has been failed not once or twice but thrice by the State, which has not prevented her being evicted into homelessness and has not provided her with social housing.  She does not drive but she has been forced out of Cork city to Kinsale.  She now has to try to get her children by bus from Kinsale into school in Cork city.  That story is replicated across the country.  It is a disgrace and a scandal.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, that will stay with those children and countless families for the rest of their lives.  Housing is a fundamental right.  There are no absolute rights in the Constitution and this would not be one either.  However, it would provide a minimum level of protection that is right and appropriate and as exists in other countries.  I hope the Government and Fianna F&aacute;il will support this proposal to ensure people have that very basic right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400045#UU00300","speaker":"1287","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557863400,"counter":460,"content":"<p>This proposed constitutional amendment is not one we ask for lightly.  We are in a housing and homelessness crisis but the Government is not treating it with the urgency it should.  That is a serious charge but, unfortunately, it is true.  I knock on doors in my constituency, speak to people and listen to their concerns.  In a constituency like Dublin North-West, there are many issues, but housing and the homelessness crisis are repeatedly raised with me and Sinn F&eacute;in councillors in the area every day without exception.  I cannot emphasise too greatly how frustrated and disempowered people feel.  We spoke the other night to a woman who has three families living in her small home, all of whom are immediate relatives.  She was right to say she felt people like her were ignored and forgotten.  She was right to say there were no houses for her daughters.  She was right to say her daughters were as much a part of the homelessness problem as rough sleepers.<\/p>  <p>  There is, in effect, no obligation on local authorities to provide housing.  There is no constitutional or statutory right to a home in Ireland.  The Government's policies are creating a lost generation.  There are almost 4,000 homeless children and they have no stability or security in their lives.  The stress of living like this is having a real psychological impact on them.  We must provide hope, security and stability to these children and their families.

The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, is very sorry he cannot be here.  If Members look at the monitors, they will see that he is on his feet in the Seanad to take the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill.  He cannot bilocate but he would have liked to have been here.  I am sure Deputies will acknowledge that he cannot be in two places at once.  The Minister of State in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy English, will attend to respond to the debate shortly.<\/p><p>As the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and the Taoiseach have stated before in this House, they are open-minded about whether to include a right to a home in the Constitution.  While the Government is not set in a direction on this, it is opposing the Bill as brought forward as it has not undergone the level of careful scrutiny required before making what has the potential to be a very significant change to the Constitution.  Whether or not the right is enshrined in the Constitution or in law, it does not prevent or impede us from approaching this as a <i>de facto<\/i>right and responsibility of the Government which we meet through our policies but also through the unprecedented level of investment in housing and homelessness.  That is said notwithstanding the many legal rights that already exist in this area and which I will explain further.  The House will be aware that the eighth report of the Constitutional Convention of March 2014 recommended that the State should progressively realise economic, social and cultural rights, subject to maximum available resources, that this duty should be cognisable by the courts and that specific additional rights should be inserted into the Constitution, including housing rights, social security rights, essential healthcare, rights for people with disabilities and linguistic and cultural rights.  The Government's response pointed out that the Constitutional Convention's recommendations raised substantial questions.  These include the suitability or otherwise of the Constitution as a vehicle for providing for detailed rights in this area and the fact that there is already power to confer rights and determine expenditure via primary and secondary legislation.  There are, of course, already many substantive rights regarding housing arising from legislation, including the right to be assessed for social housing assistance and, if qualified, placed on a waiting list for a social house or to avail of housing assistance payment and be placed on a transfer list.<\/p><p>The absence of a right to housing in the Constitution has never prevented the Government from actively seeking to provide housing for those most in need and the provision of social housing has been taking place since the foundation of the State.  However, this has always been done with appropriate consideration for the other needs of citizens which must be factored into any allocation of scarce resources.  The ultimate responsibility for making that decision lies currently with the Government and the D&aacute;il.  In seeking to make any change to the Constitution, complex issues arise including the question of the necessary revenue to provide for any ensuing expenditure, and concerns about potentially transferring to the Judiciary, which is unelected, the power to make decisions affecting the allocation of resources which are more appropriate for an elected Oireachtas and Government.  There is also the matter that placing additional rights into the Constitution creates the potential for significant diversion of resources into the handling of court cases and the creation of uncertainty about the state of the law while cases are processed, judgments are given and appeals are pursued in higher courts.  It may be noted also that this Bill seeks to put only the right to a home into the Constitution and not any of the other economic, social and cultural rights referred to by the Constitutional Convention.  This would place the right to a home ahead of rights to social security or essential healthcare and it needs to be considered whether this is appropriate.  For these reasons, the Government prefers that the right to a home be considered with the other economic, cultural and social rights, and that the process already agreed is followed.  That process is the referral of the eighth report of the Constitutional Convention to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach for a comprehensive examination of the issues raised.<\/p><p>Not putting a right to housing into the Constitution will not get in the way of the Government building houses.  It will not hinder us from implementing Rebuilding Ireland.  It will not stop us from moving forward with the national development plan and Project Ireland 2040.  It will not stop us fulfilling the commitment that one in five homes built will go to the social housing stock or all the many important things we need to do around affordability that can be delivered now because we have specific funding lines.  We all agree that the core of the solution is an increased supply of housing of all forms.  We need many more houses and apartments.  Last year, 21,000 new homes were made available for use, more than at any other time in this decade.  One quarter was social housing built by local authorities or affordable housing bodies and we need to increase this.  We have set the target of building this year approximately 25,000 new places in which to live, of which approximately one quarter will be social housing.  That is because we need market and non-market solutions to the housing crisis and recognise that while the majority of people will want to buy and own their own home, there will always be people who cannot do so.<\/p><p>I turn to some of the measures taken by the Government as part of Rebuilding Ireland.  These include the comprehensive framework for tackling the range of complex issues needing to be addressed across the housing sector, a framework which is underpinned by over &euro;6 billion in funding to support the delivery of 50,000 new social housing homes and 87,000 other housing supports over the six years from 2016 to 2021.  Very significant progress has been made on delivery through local authorities, approved housing bodies and a range of other delivery partners, with over 72,000 households having their housing needs met during the first three years of Rebuilding Ireland and a further 27,300 households supported by a record investment of &euro;2.4 billion in housing to be supported this year.  That brings to almost 100,000 the total number of households who will have been assisted under Rebuilding Ireland by the end of 2019.  Notwithstanding the continued increases in homelessness, record exits from homelessness into sustainable tenancies have been achieved in recent years.  Rebuilding Ireland is further supported by Project Ireland 2040, the Government's overarching policy initiative to align in a strategic manner our spatial planning and investment programmes to underpin a sustainable approach to planning for a growing population and the associated need for housing.  The new &euro;2 billion urban regeneration and development fund aims to support sustainable growth In Ireland's five cities and other large urban centres with the aim of delivering at least 40% of our future housing needs within our existing built-up areas.<\/p><p>The Land Development Agency, LDA, has been established to ensure more effective co-ordination and management of the development of State-owned lands, in particular publicly-owned lands in our urban centres, supporting the ambition to achieve more compact and sustainable growth.  To enable greater delivery of social and affordable homes on public lands, the Government has, in parallel with the establishment of the Land Development Agency, approved a new public land affordability requirement whereby a minimum of 30% of any housing developed on public land must be reserved for affordable purposes, whether affordable purchase or cost rental, in addition to the 10% statutory social housing requirement under Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, whether such development is being progressed by the LDA or any other market operator.  In order to support local authorities to get their sites ready for affordable housing, funding of &euro;310 million over 2019 to 2021 has been allocated for enabling infrastructure via the serviced sites fund, or SSF, in budget 2019.  Cost rental housing is being brought forward in conjunction with the Housing Agency, the Land Development Agency, local authorities and other stakeholders, with two pilot projects already being progressed.  As to housing generally, overall supply continues to show significant increases, as I said earlier, with over 18,000 new homes built In 2018, which is a 25% increase on the previous year and the highest number of newly built homes any year this decade.  In addition, more than 2,500 homes were brought out of long-term vacancy and almost 800 dwellings in unfinished housing developments were completed.<\/p><p>That means the number of new homes available for use increased by almost 21,500 in 2018, together with more than 3,700 student bed spaces.  There is clear evidence of moderation in the annual rate of growth of house prices, due primarily to increasing supply and the Central Bank macro-prudential rules.  Residential property prices increased by 5.6% nationally in the year to January 2019 compared with 6.4% in the year to December and 11.8% in the year to January 2018.<\/p> <p> While there may not be a right to housing in the Constitution, the State, through its current laws and through the actions in Rebuilding Ireland, is doing everything it can to address our housing issues.  We are opposed to amending the Constitution as proposed, but we are not opposed to considering the issue further in an appropriate manner.  In referring the right to housing, as well as other social and economic rights, to an Oireachtas committee, following on from the recommendations of the Convention on the Constitution, we are following the process that has served the public well in terms of marriage equality and repealing the eighth amendment.  We will continue with that process of Oireachtas committee engagement and coming to a determination regarding possible next steps in this public debate we are having.  In the meantime, the immediate best way to ensure that the State fully meets its obligations to those who need assistance to provide a home for themselves and their families is through continued delivery through Rebuilding Ireland and the development and implementation of further policies and measures as required in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400046#VV00300","speaker":"1277","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557864000,"counter":463,"content":"<p>Ireland is in the midst of an unprecedented housing crisis.  Homelessness levels have soared to in excess of 10,000, including almost 4,000 children.  The number of people homeless and living in emergency accommodation is at record levels.  Latest figures show that in March, 10,305 adults and children were without a home and living in hotels, bed and breakfast accommodation and family hubs, an increase of 41 on the previous month.  The number of children in emergency accommodation stands at 3,821, a rise of 37 in a month.  The social housing waiting list, including housing assistance payment, HAP, recipients, is more than 110,000.<\/p><p>It is incredible that with all of these facts a Fine Gael general election candidate can publicly say that there is no housing crisis outside Dublin.  To say there is no housing crisis outside Dublin is at best to show an appalling ignorance of the crisis being experienced in all commuter belt counties such as Wicklow and Wexford and even beyond the commuter belt.  In Wicklow a one-bedroom apartment will cost in excess of &euro;1,000 to rent while a mortgage will cost only &euro;663 according to yesterday's <i>daft.ie<\/i>rental report.  A two-bedroom house will cost an average of &euro;1,173 in Wicklow, while a mortgage can be reached for &euro;911.<\/p><p>Supply of homes is the issue, not the right to them.  It is the State's inability to build enough homes when there is plenty of available land that is at the heart of the national crisis.  Ireland is experiencing a severe housing crisis like many other countries.  There are growing calls for Ireland to emulate countries such as Germany, the Netherlands and South Africa and enshrine a constitutional right to housing.  Ireland has ratified the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which prescribes for the State to take &quot;all appropriate means&quot; to provide for the right to adequate housing based on the availability of resources.  The Irish Constitution also contains certain explicit property rights, but there is no clear statutory right to adequate housing which can be legally enforced by the courts.<\/p><p>Any amendments to the Constitution or any approach to legislating for a right to housing will have to balance the rights of landowners.  In 1982, the Supreme Court found that the Rent Restrictions Act 1960, which obliged landlords to accept below market rents, was an unjust attack on the property owners' constitutional property rights.  Nonetheless, there have been successful legislative measures to assist with meeting social housing needs, such as Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, which provides that up to 10% of a new housing development must be reserved for social housing.  In March 2014, the Constitutional Convention, as part of its consideration of broader economic, cultural and social rights, found in favour of inserting a right to housing in the Constitution.<\/p><p>Fianna F&aacute;il rejected a similar Bill two years ago on the grounds that the finance committee ought to be tasked with assessing the concept of economic, cultural and social rights in the Constitution.  That work has not been sufficiently progressed to date, however, and the Government must address this as a matter of urgency.  Holding a referendum would cost approximately &euro;15 million, or the same as building 75 social housing units.  It is important that we prioritise building and clear solid measures to address the crisis.  In Wicklow, 75 social housing units would be a significant development in any part of the county.  Last year only 28 units were completed, while the housing list stands at 4,126.  We prefer a legislative approach to the problem initially followed by a deeper discussion on constitutional protections.  Any change to the Constitution that involves handing powers to judges may have unforeseen consequences and must be carefully considered.  That is why Fianna F&aacute;il supports a legislative approach to the right to housing followed by a debate on constitutional changes.  We should have all learned the lessons of playing politics with our Constitution for partisan political gain.  A botched referendum could result in a lengthy and divisive debate on the nature of property rights at a time when we need to encourage housing development in the rental and affordable markets.<\/p><p>It is unclear what impact the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment would have on the Constitution and on subsequent legal cases.  The Constitutional Convention was divided on what specific option to take in terms of the realisation of the right to housing, that is, immediate, gradual or progressive.  This has been a major impact on public policy and should be weighed up carefully.  It is not clear in the wording of the Sinn F&eacute;in insertion what the impact would be.  This needs to be debated further.  While the Government has delayed committee discussions, this does not mean that it should be completely bypassed by a unilateral Private Members' Bill by one party.<\/p><p>With rent levels at such highs, a whole generation cannot save enough to own a home while vulnerable households are at risk of homelessness.  Home ownership is slipping away from an entire generation as house prices rise at 13% per annum while wages are only growing at 2.5%.  The 68% home ownership rate is the lowest since 1971.  Fianna F&aacute;il has shown its commitment to finding meaningful solutions through our role in the confidence and supply arrangement and has not shirked from leading criticism of the Government where it is at fault.<\/p><p>The key test for the Government is delivery.  Since coming into power, Fine Gael has launched Construction 2020, the Social Housing Strategy 2020, Rebuilding Ireland, the 2012 capital programme, the 2015 capital programme and the 2018 capital programme.  These six separate plans, excluding the numerous relaunches involved, amount to more launches than local authority homes built in several counties so far this year.  This needs to change.<\/p><p>It is clear the legal framework around housing needs to be reviewed.  We should do so carefully, however, with full consideration of the consequences, not a knee-jerk party political change.  Fianna F&aacute;il is opposed to this Bill, which is more about optics than addressing the housing crisis.  We need further discussion on what changes we should make to the Constitution.  The Government must address its failure to progress discussion of the Constitutional Convention recommendations on these issues.  While there are quicker and more important ways to address the housing crisis, we need to discuss the legal framework around housing rights.  Fianna F&aacute;il supports initially putting this right on a legislative basis with further exploration of the constitutional protections in the committee system.  Any change to the Constitution must always be weighed up carefully to avoid unforeseen consequences.  It should not be hijacked by any political party seeking a quick headline before election day.<\/p><p>For the record, I have stated before in the House that the right to housing is a constitutional imperative clearly implied in the common good clause of the property rights article.  The common good, the right to housing, the right to a home and the right to shelter need careful and serious discussion before any referendum proposal.  The people as a whole need to be part of that discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400047#WW00200","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speech","time":1557864600,"counter":464,"content":"<p>The people who live in six apartment blocks on the Old Youghal Road, Dillons Cross in Cork city face eviction, having been given a notice to quit date of 19 July.  They have not broken the terms of their leases and have paid their rents.  The stated reason for the eviction is renovation.  The landlord plans to evict, refurbish and, I suspect, massively hike the rents.  Rents in Cork city are at a record high, while the shortage of homes to rent has never been greater.  The residents in question face the threat of eviction into homelessness but they will not take that lying down.  They have seen how the residents of the Leeside Apartments successfully resisted eviction, how people power worked, and are inspired by the example.  Last night, more than 70 people attended an anti-eviction protest organised by Solidarity's Carol Brogan and a second protest has been called for 5 p.m. on Monday, 20 May at Dillons Cross.  A Government that cared for people such as the residents in question would support the legislation but the Government will not do that.  It does not care, it worships the markets, and the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party is stuffed to the gills with landlords.

They are sick of the Government's abysmal failure to change anything or to present anything other than a situation that continues to get worse and worse.  All I can do is echo what Deputies Barry, &Oacute; Broin and others have said, which is to tell people to get onto the streets.  We need to do with the issue of housing what was done with that of water charges.  We need to terrify the Government and to make it fear politically that it will lose badly.  We need to make it shake with fear inside the walls of Leinster House.  Unless there is a movement of that scale to terrify the Government, it is clear it has no intention of changing tack and delivering on scale the public and affordable housing on public land that we need, which is at the heart of the crisis.  The policy of retreating from the provision of council housing and relying on the private rented sector, developers, cuckoo funds, vulture funds and so on has led us to the disastrous position we are in, and it will not change unless the people force it to.  They must punish electorally the Government and the major parties that contributed to the situation but must also use a mass movement of people power that will force the change.<\/p>  <p>  Telling people to get onto the streets at 1 p.m. on Saturday, 18 May is the most important message but there is so much that could be said about so many aspects of the crisis.  There are a few myths of Government guff that I wish to bust.  One such myth is when the Government states: \"The answer to the problem is supply, supply, supply, and we will ramp up supply.\"  It goes on to highlight, for example, all the planning permissions that have been submitted and claims to be on the way to sorting the crisis out.  What is actually happening is that applications for planning permission are being submitted to inflate the value of the land holdings of the property speculators who have bought the land.  In many cases, they have no intention of building anything at all.  I cite as an example the Sentinel building in Sandyford, which has approximately 20 storeys and has been called a work-life pod.  It is a new term.  It has been designed in order that the developers will not have to allow even 10% of it to be used for social housing.  What is a work-life pod?  Would anybody like to guess?  It is just nonsense.  It might be a bedsit but by calling it a \"work-something\", it is not quite classed as a residency and, therefore, the developers do not have to use 10% of it for social housing.  It does not matter because the building is sitting there as a half-built skeleton in any event, towering over an area where people are crying out for affordable housing.<\/p>  <p>  Richard Barrett and his gang, Bartra, in D&uacute;n Laoghaire have submitted an application for planning permission for a site which had been granted planning permission for 50 apartments to allow them to build 200 co-sharing units.  Co-sharing units are rooms, if one could call them that - boxes would be a more accurate description - of 16 sq. m. with fold-out beds and no kitchens.  Approximately 30 or 40 of the co-sharing units will share a kitchen and their occupants will be charged approximately &euro;1,300 for living there.  They are the tenements of the future.  Alternatively, they will be leased back to the council for use as an emergency hub because the Government will not have delivered the public and affordable housing that is necessary and the housing crisis will get worse.  We will end up probably leasing the property from Mr. Barrett for a fortune to house the increasing numbers of homeless people.  Although I am sure he will probably not even build the property and is instead merely seeking the planning permission, even if the supply is delivered, the strategic housing development process means he will have bypassed the normal planning process.  That is shocking.  Even if the property is built, although most of it will not be, none of it will do anything to address the housing crisis or to provide secure, decent, proper, dignified affordable or public housing for the people who need it.  All the Government is doing is enriching and facilitating the speculators while the crisis continues to get worse and worse.

I do not usually sit in the Chamber and listen to the speeches of the Government because they are usually claptrap, although the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton's, contribution on the Bill was even worse.  I listened to it and have read a copy of it.  I am sorry the Minister of State has left the Chamber because I do not think he believes what he read out.  It was amazing.  Economic, social and cultural rights were mentioned in the context the recommendations of the Convention on the Constitution, which reported in March 2014.  The Minister of State indicated that the Government will refer the matter to a committee to consider whether housing rights should be enshrined in the Constitution but it has been five years since the report.  That is a load of rubbish.  I have moved two economic and social rights Bills, most recently in 2016, but both times the Government voted them down and rejected them.  There is no way the Government will consider the matter in committee at some stage in the future.  The Government intends to move it to a committee rather than voting it down because local elections will be held next week and a general election is probably coming within the next year.<\/p><p>That is why the Government is doing it.  It will give this claptrap of how a committee will sort it out.  It is a load of rubbish.  Then we hear from Fine Gael's partners in government, Fianna F&aacute;il, stating it has to consider carefully these rights.  This crisis in housing has been going on for eight years.  For the whole time I have been a Member of the D&aacute;il, the crisis has been ongoing.  Fine Gael has been in power for the whole time and it has done absolutely nothing.  Ideologically, it wants to see the crisis continue because it supports developers and does not see a right to housing; it sees that housing will be provided by the private sector and that is where it will stay.<\/p> <p> In his contribution later the Minister of State, Deputy English, will probably state we are in crisis and we cannot deal with this now because we have to deal with the crisis and we have been under the cosh for so many years and we have had to deal with all of that.  Portugal went through a crisis and bailout at the same time as us but Portugal had housing rights and economic, social and cultural rights protected in its constitution.  What happened was the European Commission could not attack those rights and neither could the Government because they were enshrined in the Constitution.  As the rights were protected constitutionally, it could not attack them when it got there.  Now, Portugal is one of the leading lights of left-wing governments in Europe.  It welcomes people and does not try to stop them coming in.  If this right had been enshrined in the Constitution eight years ago we could have protected our people.  There is a chance now to enshrine it in the Constitution but the Government will not do it and neither will Fianna F&aacute;il.  That is the way it will be and that is fine but the Government should not pretend to Sinn F&eacute;in that it will refer this to a committee and the committee will speak about it and come back to us on it because the Government has already voted this down twice in recent years and it will do so again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400048#XX00300","speaker":"1366","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557865200,"counter":468,"content":"<p>I fully support the Bill.  It is almost 71 years since the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 25.1 of which sets out that everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself or herself and of his or her family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care.  We are failing utterly on all of these issues.  With regard to housing, the proposed amendment is minimal.  It simply seeks that the State would recognise the right of all citizens to adequate, appropriate, secure, safe and affordable housing 71 years after the declaration of human rights.  We were asked to do this by the convention five years ago, as my colleague pointed out, and we have been asked to do it by the UN special rapporteur on the right to housing, who called on us to make housing a constitutional right.  She stated what was unfolding in our housing crisis was tragic and serious but solvable.<\/p><p>We are not here to shout and roar.  We are not here to be negative.  I agree with the UN special rapporteur that it is solvable.  The way to do it is to look at what is happening.  If the Minister of State is tired of listening to me, I would not blame him because sometimes I tire listening to myself because it is like an echo chamber.  We must remember that we should not be dependent on charity but let us look at what COPE, a charity in Galway, is doing.  It is asking all of the local election candidates to pledge that if elected, they will ensure that Galway City Council meets its housing targets through the building of new social housing.  It also asks them to make three other pledges.  It bases this on a comprehensive document.  This tells us that the housing assistance payment, HAP, on which we pay almost &euro;500 million per year, is not working.  The amount has doubled within one year.  It tells us the HAP does not produce additional social housing stock and does not represent good value for money for the public purse in the long term.  It also tells us the housing and homeless crisis continues to increase unabated despite the best efforts of all to impede the increasing number needing support.<\/p><p>We can also look at <i>daft.ie<\/i>and daft is a good name when we think about it.  I do not know what word could apply to the housing crisis.  We have left and right in both parts of government with Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  I was going to criticise the speech of the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, and wonder who wrote it and I was going to invite that person to Galway for a little tour but then I heard the prepared speech from Fianna F&aacute;il and the Minister of State's speech seemed like a work of art.  The <i>daft.ie<\/i>rental report tells us we have the lowest number of properties available for rent.  It looked at rents in Galway, where they are now 91% higher than when they bottomed out in 2012.<\/p><p>I will repeat the figure, because it is important, that 10,305 people are homeless, including 3,821 children.  We are normalising this homelessness.  I find this to be repulsive and unacceptable.  In Galway, 309 people are homeless and the very same charity that is asking us to make pledges - it is right to do so - must rely on bed and breakfast accommodation and hotels to house homeless persons.  Within bed and breakfast accommodation, people are not allowed visit one another in their rooms.  If they break the rules in a private bed and breakfast they are told they will have to self-finance for a number of days.  Listen to this new language.  We are listening to Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael telling us that rights should not be placed in the Constitution.  We are placing charities in terrible positions where they must fight for accommodation and introduce appalling rules.  We are relying on charities but all the while we have solutions.  We have public land on which we could build.<\/p><p>Earlier today, I asked that Galway be chosen with regard to climate change.  Intimately connected to climate change are housing, public transport and biodiversity.  They are all tied in.  We have lots of land in Galway.  We have the docklands, Ceannt Station and an area out at the airport all sitting there waiting to be developed but no master plan.<\/p><p>I absolutely support the motion.  It is the most basic requirement if we want to call ourselves a civilised society.  I despair of the type of speeches that have been read out in the Chamber this evening particularly, as my colleague has said, with regard to the Minister of State telling us the recommendation made five years ago by the Constitutional Convention will be referred to a committee.<\/p><p>Government policy is responsible for the crisis.  We have relied on the marketisation of social housing and public land.  The Government continues to do this unabated and the most unacceptable part is the twisting of language to call it social housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400049#YY00200","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1557865200,"counter":469,"content":"<p>It is worth recalling that in January with great pomp and ceremony we all decamped from here and went around to the Mansion House to mark the centenary of the first D&aacute;il and, in particular, its Democratic Programme.  That Democratic Programme was very clear that our country would &quot;be ruled in accordance with the principles of Liberty, Equality and Justice for all&quot;.  It is worth recalling what the programme said on the issue of housing.  It stated &quot;we reaffirm that all right to private property must be subordinated to the public right and welfare&quot;.  It stated &quot;It shall be the first duty of the Government of the Republic to make provision for the physical, mental and spiritual well-being of the children, to secure that no child shall suffer hunger or cold from lack of food, clothing, or shelter&quot;.  In total contradiction, the Irish Constitution protects the right to property.<\/p><p>Perhaps previous Governments had a much more honest position to events such as 1916, the Proclamation, the First D&aacute;il and the Democratic Programme.  The anniversaries of these events were largely ignored by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  Perhaps this was a better position than the verbalised republicanism of the establishment parties of these times.<\/p><p>At the Mansion House event the Taoiseach described the first D&aacute;il as a bold, profound and decisive statement about the future of Ireland.  It is a great pity he does not agree with that bold, profound and decisive statement.  One hundred years later, citizens in this state have no legal right to a home.  James Connolly, the great Irish revolutionary in 1899 predicted all of this.  He wrote:<\/p><blockquote>After Ireland is free, says the patriot who won&rsquo;t touch socialism ... if you won&rsquo;t pay your rent you will be evicted same as now.  But the evicting party ... will wear green uniforms and the Harp without the Crown, and the warrant turning you out on the roadside will be stamped with the arms of the Irish Republic.<\/blockquote><p>Today the courts regard a lending institution as having superior rights over those of the occupier or homeowner.  Citizens and families with children in cr&egrave;ches have no effective remedy through the courts.  In 2005 the State opted out of Article 31 of the revised European Social Charter, which concerns the right to housing.  That brings us to the nub of the problem, which is that the Irish establishment does not believe in a citizen's right to a home.  That has to change.  The programme of the Government states it will be judged on how it addresses the issues of housing and homelessness.  Out of its own mouth it is condemned.  No amount of fancy words, spin or pl&aacute;m&aacute;s can disguise the Government's disastrous housing policy, its failure to prevent increases in rents and to end evictions, the huge number of people on housing waiting lists, the fiasco of local councils refusing to draw down available funds for housing for Travellers and the number of citizens, especially children, who are homeless.  All of this exposes the inability of the Government to govern in a fair way.<\/p> <p> By any measure the Government has failed.  It has failed families, pensioners and children.  The March figures were the worst ever for homelessness, with 10,305 people homeless, including 3,821 children, despite the massaging of the figures.  In my part of the State, that is, counties Louth, Monaghan and Cavan, there were 60 people homeless in March 2018, but in March this year the figure was 173.  The past eight years have seen a 490% increase in the number of homeless children, while the level of family homelessness has increased by 40%.  The level of pensioner homelessness has also increased dramatically, by 80%.  There are generations of people who, in bad times in this state and on this island, at least had a home over the heads.

In County Offaly there are 50 people homeless, while there are 19 homeless in County Laois, which is absolutely shameful.  The responsibility for the housing crisis belongs with the right-wing failed private market policies of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  This week new figures from <i>daft.ie <\/i>reveal that rents have increased by, on average, 8.5% in County Offaly in the past year and by 10.7% in County Laois.  How are ordinary people supposed to come up with the money to meet these increases?  Workers' wages are not increasing at that rate and some workers are not getting any increase at all.  Amazingly, rents in counties Laois and Offaly are now 30% above 2008 peak prices.  Families are being priced out of their homes and forced into homelessness.  People have come into my constituency office in the past week whose rent has increased by between 20% and 30%.

We have consistently called for State intervention in the market to get a hold on the problem, but the Government has failed to even designate the midlands as one of the rent pressure zones which are not working to any great extent.  The Government has failed to do anything in the market in the midlands.  Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il have repeatedly clubbed together to vote down our proposals and it looks like they are going to do the same again here this evening.  They are two parties which represent nothing more than a landlords' coalition and do not represent the interests of the average renter or mortgage holder.  It is outrageous that we now have the lowest ever total of homes available to rent.  Eight local authority houses were completed in County Offaly last year and just 34 in Counthy Laois.  They are moving at a snail's pace because the Department is deliberately slowing down the granting of approval.<\/p><p>It is time for the State to step up and take action with a massive house building programme in every constituency.  That is why Sinn F&eacute;in is demanding that we enshrine in the Constitution the right of every citizen to a home.  It would be just one measure and not a silver bullet.  We have called for a three-year rent freeze and 8.5% tax relief on rents paid, with a doubling of the number of local authority homes.  Some people are paying half their wages in rent.  It is essential that we build more local authority homes and start to build affordable homes and introduce rent controls across the country.

We can make all the changes we want here, but it does not necessarily give us houses.  The constant mantra that there is no social housing building programme is dishonest.  It is not true and wrong to keep repeating it.  I have no problem with Members saying it is not enough and showing how things can be done on a site by site basis, but it is dishonest to keep saying there is no social housing building programme.  Leading people out to protest on Saturday under the impression that there is no social housing building programme is wrong.  The protesters have many demands, one of which is that the Government start a social housing building programme, but we started it over three years ago.

The Housing Act 1988 places particular responsibility on local authorities to provide for the accommodation needs of people who are homeless.  There are also many legislative protections in place in regard to private housing and rented accommodation, including protections for the family home, which again is very often dishonestly discussed in this House.  It includes the right to a four-year tenancy, or a six-year tenancy for those tenancies commencing after 24 December 2016, with limited grounds for termination in private rented accommodation if a tenant has been in occupation for six months continuously and no notice to quit has been served; the right to graduated notice periods that must be given to tenants on the termination of a tenancy, reflective of the length of time spent in the tenancy; the right to a rent that is no greater than the current market rent; and for tenancies in a rent pressure zone, the right to a rent increase that is no greater than 4% annually for three years.  We all agree that rents are too high.  Nobody is disputing that.  We accept that, but we disagree on how to address it.  Sinn F&eacute;in does not believe that supply bears any reference in that regard, but it does.  Four years ago, a house an hour's drive from here could be rented for half the price it costs today.  Supply is relevant.  The warped view that supply is not relevant is wrong.  Of course supply is relevant.  In 2011, we had 3,000 ghost estates and thousands of empty houses.  Rent was much cheaper then because there was available stock.  Ten years later, owing to a lack of building for seven or eight years, there are fewer properties available to rent and so rents are higher.  The issues are linked.  They are not the sole reason for the problem but they are linked.

The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2018 was passed by D&aacute;il Eireann on 8 May and it was before the Seanad this evening.  The main provisions of that Bill relate to making it a criminal offence for landlords to implement rent increases that contravene the law.  It provides powers to the RTB to investigate and sanction administratively landlords who engage in improper conduct.  It allows the RTB to initiate an investigation without the need for a complaint and requires the annual registration of tenancies with the RTB.<\/p>  <p>  The designation of existing RPZs will be extended to the end of 2021.  The exemptions from the 4% per annum rent increase restriction in RPZs have been revised so as to apply only to the first rent setting rather than to every rent setting during the period of RPZ designation in respect of a new rental property, including a property that had not been rented in the two-year period immediately prior to the commencement of a particular tenancy.  Also, a definition is proposed to illustrate the type of works that qualify for the exemption from the rent increase restriction in respect of a substantial change in the nature of the rental property.  Again, we have all heard the evidence around this issue and we are trying to deal with that too.  Revisions are also proposed in respect of the average rent qualifying criterion for RPZ designation.  Outside of RPZs, the requirement for biannual rent review cycles rather annual reviews will continue to the end of 2021.<\/p>  <p>  The new RTB sanctioning regime will apply to improper conduct by a landlord who contravenes the tenancy termination provisions.  Landlords will be required to copy a tenancy termination notice to the RTB.  Where a landlord terminates a tenancy because he or she intends to sell the property, he or she must enter into a contract for sale within nine months of the termination date or else offer to relet to a former tenant who provides his or her contact details.  There are more changes provided for in that legislation, of which those who took time to attend the debate on it will be aware.  These key measures and reforms are designed to enhance enforcement powers for the RTB, to provide greater security of tenure for tenants and greater rights, and to underpin further the operation of the RPZ arrangements, with some further targeted priority measures.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to the Sinn F&eacute;in Bill, it is important to note that, as stated, the general concept of potential inclusion of a right to housing in the Constitution is not intended to be opposed outright.  I have said that I do not have an issue with the proposal, but there is a process to go through to get there.  Any such step should be taken with the appropriate level of scrutiny and with due regard to the complexities that arise in proposing such an amendment to the Constitution.  This matter was referred to a committee.  Members of the relevant committee should try to have it brought forward for discussion.  In the case of this Bill, it is not immediately clear what the effect of the proposed amendment would be.  Given the potential for unintended consequential policy, legal and financial effects and the complexity of the issues raised by the eight convention report, it is appropriate that the Government should oppose this Bill and instead follow the process agreed, namely, referral of the eighth report of the Convention on the Constitution to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform.  I hope that it will go through that journey also.<\/p>  <p>  On a practical level, it is unclear what tangible effect the proposed constitutional amendment would have in terms of solving our current housing problems.  I am not convinced this would provide us with additional houses.  I have raised that question many times, but nobody has shown me how it would help us deliver more houses.  I cannot see it.  The Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, is of that view also.  This debate can continue, but it does not help or hinder us in any way in terms of what we are trying to do, which is to rebuild our social housing stock.<\/p>  <p>  The social housing building programme has started.  Money has been ring-fenced for the next ten years under Project 2040 to deliver that programme.  I reiterate that nobody has challenged me on this.  The ambition is to deliver 12,000 social houses per annum every year to 2028.

I will tell him something.  A real estate investment trust, REIT, buying up apartments, snatching them away from families who want to put a roof over their heads, does not have to pay a penny of tax on the income, or any of the 33% capital gains tax, CGT, that everyone else has to pay on the gains they make.

It does not want to see the truth, or to hear about what is coming down the line in terms of the number of evictions that are about to happen.  <\/p>  <p>  This Bill is timely.  It is not radical.  This is something that was supported five years ago by 100 randomly selected citizens.  Some 84 of them said the right to housing should be enshrined in the Constitution.  However, Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il say no.  They will cry crocodile tears when people do not have that right.  They say it will make no difference, but that is nonsense.  It will make a difference, because there will be an obligation on the Government and successive Governments to bring forward policies that are in line with that constitutional right.  I appeal to Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael to do the right thing, for the first time since this Government came into being, on the issue of housing.  They should stand up and do the right thing for the people by fulfilling the desire of the Constitutional Convention and allow this legislation, proposed by Deputy &Oacute; Broin, who has brought forward many solutions for this crisis, to be enshrined in the Constitution.  It should take the right step along the road to recovery for the first time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400052#BBB00300","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1557867000,"counter":501,"content":"<p>I will respond to some of the points made by the two Ministers of State and Deputy Casey.  The Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, said this issue had not undergone sufficient scrutiny.  Everyone else has referred to the very detailed work of the Constitutional Convention, which was very substantive.  There was also detailed consideration of this proposal at the Committee on Housing and Homelessness, including presentations from experts, legal advisors and legal professionals.  We also have examined this matter in great detail at the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government and reports have been authored by Mercy Law Resource Centre, the Ombudsman for Children and a range of other figures.  Many Members have spent their time wisely and have considered this matter in great detail.  If members of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael have not used that time in the same way, I am sorry.  They were given the opportunity of listening to the real and clear benefits that such a right would have.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy English, listed what he believed to be a set of rights.  I would hazard to guess that if he submitted those arguments in an undergraduate law essay, he would fail.  Rights are not something to be applied for which one might get by meeting certain criteria.  That is the opposite of rights.  It is why legislation has the word \"may\" rather than \"shall\" when outlining what a local authority may or may not do.  They are not legal rights.  To answer his question very directly, all of the legal opinion we have heard at the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government has shown the value of a legal and constitutional right to housing is the fact that it provides a basic floor of protection, so that every single thing a Government does - legislation, policies and budgets - must have due regard to how it will vindicate that right.  It does not provide everyone with a set of keys to a home nor is it a silver bullet that will resolve all problems.  However, it provides an additional check and forces Governments to consider these issues, in exactly the same way it has to do with all of the other enumerated rights in the Constitutions.  To Deputy Casey I say, of course, it is not a stand-alone proposal.  He is correct that referendums cost money, but the idea that his party would oppose a legal right to housing because it might mean an additional 75 homes in his constituency is almost comical.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400052#BBB00400","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1557867000,"counter":502,"content":"<p>There are more reasons besides that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400052#BBB00500","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speech","time":1557867000,"counter":503,"content":"<p>In fact, if we had a legal right to housing his county would not be in the mess it is in at the minute, because the Government, the Opposition and the local authorities would be forced through the courts to deliver the homes that the Deputy said he wants to deliver for his constituents.<\/p>  <p>  One of the most striking aspects of this debate is the absence of the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and the Front Bench spokesperson for Fianna F&aacute;il.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400052#BBB00600","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1557867000,"counter":504,"content":"<p>He is in the Seanad.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400052#BBB00700","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1557867000,"counter":505,"content":"<p>I know he is in the Seanad.

I have some sympathy for Deputy Casey and the Minister of State, Deputy English, because on the occasions their parties deliver unpopular news, they are sent in to take the hit for their seniors.<\/p>  <p>  There are tens of thousands of families with housing needs which are not being met by this Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael coalition.  This includes tens of thousands of renters, first-time or aspiring first-time home buyers and people languishing on social housing waiting lists.  The Minister of State is correct; social homes are being built.  In fact, if he had listened to my contribution, he would have heard me acknowledge that.  The problem is that it is nowhere close to enough.<\/p>  <p>  The crucial difference between our party and Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael is that we would double capital investment in social and affordable housing.  It is the only way in which to begin to increase output.  We would shorten the delivery time we proposed to the Department in terms of approval and procurement to get those homes built more quickly.  We would set higher targets for the local authorities to deliver social homes, affordable rental homes and affordable purchase homes, which is something that the Government, actively supported by Fianna F&aacute;il, is refusing to do.  Crucially, we would enshrine in the Constitution, subject to the approval of the people in a referendum, a legal right that would ensure that in the future parties such as Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael which say they want to resolve this crisis but which will not act to ensure that is done will be forced, either through the Constitution or the courts, to provide the homes that families so desperately need.  Anyone watching this debate will be deeply disappointed, but not surprised.  Once again Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael say they want to solve this housing crisis, but are showing by their actions that they are neither interested, capable or able to do it.  That is why I believe there will be a major mobilisation on the streets of Dublin on Saturday in an attempt to force those parties to take this crisis seriously, for once and for all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400052#BBB01600","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1557867000,"counter":514,"content":"<p>Cuireadh an cheist.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1557867000,"counter":515,"content":"<p>Question put.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1557867000,"counter":516,"content":"<p>V&oacute;t&aacute;il.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400052#BBB01800","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1557867000,"counter":517,"content":"<p>In accordance with Standing Order 70(2), the division is postponed until the weekly division time on Thursday, 16 May 2019.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051400052#BBB01900","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1557867000,"counter":518,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at at 9.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 15 May 2019.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
