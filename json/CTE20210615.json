I have a few points on which I would like them to elaborate over and above the information they have included in their submissions.  My big question is based on my observations of the organic schemes to date.  We hear all the bells and whistles about the scheme being opened up again, and that it will do the devil and all and that we will have organic farmers left, right and centre.  Then we are contacted by people interested in joining the scheme who are complaining they have been eliminated from doing so because of the scoring system and the points system for applications.  People tell me it is very heavily weighted towards dairy as opposed to sheep or tillage.  I would like witnesses to comment on this.  How do they see that a more level playing field could be created with regard to making the scheme as equally accessible for every sector of the agricultural sphere?<\/p> <p>  I would also like to hear a little more on what education and training schemes and systems they would like to see incorporated into the organic sector.  This is specifically for organics as opposed to across the board education and training.  I will mention one specific aspect.  I read the submissions from the two groups before us now and the submissions from the two groups joining us in the second session.  I was a little surprised that the word \"soil\" was not mentioned in any of them.  To me, from previous deliberations with those involved in the organic sector, soil is the key factor when it comes not just to organic farming but also in the climate change sphere we are in.  Soil, for its sequestration value, seems to be a key player in how agriculture will evolve and be maintained in future.  I would like comments from the witnesses, especially on the back of the announcement of the pilot programme for soil sampling.  Is there a bigger role for soil sampling and perhaps other initiatives regarding soil and soil structure sequestration values and storage values?  I would like to hear some comments on what way the witnesses would like to see policy being developed, which as much as anything would help and evolve their knowledge of soil and soil structure and how it can be used.  I will leave it at that for now and if time allows, I may contribute again at the end.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021061500002#A00300","speaker":"1651"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":7,"content":"<p>We have history on the scoring issue and it is a good question.  In 2018, the scheme opened for a very short period of time.  There were 225 applications and 110 people were not successful.  The scheme was flawed because it was done on a points basis.  The bigger the farms were, the more points the applicants were allocated.  This is wrong and the IFA is totally against it.  People should be judged on merit, not on the size of their farms.  There are many small farmers in the country and we should not discriminate against small farmers accessing a scheme, which is what happened.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine admitted that was the case but nothing was done to rectify the matter.<\/p> <p>  Of those farmers who did not get into the scheme, 63 of them, who are called the pilgrim farmers, stuck with the organic scheme even though they never got into it.  They paid to do an organic farming course, modified their buildings and paid certification bodies.  They had to abide by all the rules and regulations but they never got a payment.  That needs to be addressed.  Some people would say it cannot be addressed but the &euro;50 million scheme for beef producers was a retrospective payment for cattle they had killed in Ireland.  This could be done.<\/p> <p>  With regard to training and education, a number of years ago Teagasc had three organic farms and five advisers.  Approximately a month ago, we met Teagasc and we highlighted the fact it does not have an organic farm.  Teagasc does not even have an organic farm but schemes such as farm to fork are promoted.  Teagasc had one adviser and has taken on another.  This needs to be addressed.<\/p> <p>  Senator Daly mentioned soil.  In terms of organic farms, the soil is where we are at.  Generally, we do not highlight it because it is what we have to do.  With regard to soil health and the nutrient uptake of soil, soil sampling is very important, and what would also be very important would be a programme for liming land.<\/p><p>All types of farmers, whether they are spreading chemical fertiliser or any type of nutrient, need lime to get the most out of their grass.  That is what we need.

The points raised by Senator Daly are very worthy of comment.  I agree with much of what Mr. Renaghan put across.  I do not think there is any conflict in what has been said.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Bord Bia and all the other bodies involved have no real ambition to promote organic farming.  The last time, the scoring system put off a lot of farmers.  I know farmers who applied and who farmed organically for almost a year only to be told they were not successful.  When I talked to them about the new application, it was a case of once bitten, twice shy.  They were not going to put themselves through the trauma of that again, albeit perhaps they would have got in this time.  There is no ambition.  Dairy farming is the sector that is most heavily weighted towards scoring.  We need some ambition here.  We have fabulous products in the shape of lamb that need to be actively promoted and we need bodies like Bord Bia to develop and create markets for what should be quite easily marketed.  It is a fabulous product and people would purchase these organic products if they were educated on the benefits of them.  I am totally against the scoring system because it shows no ambition whatsoever on behalf of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.<\/p> <p>  I agree with everything Mr. Renaghan said about education and training.  In addition to what he said, we need the knowledge-transfer mechanism, which I hope will come into effect in the next round of the CAP to do something specifically for organic farmers.  I am an organic farmer in Inishowen in Donegal.  At most, there are probably ten people within 30 miles of me who I know are organic farmers.  We need a wee bit of a stimulus package to get us together into a formal workshop or knowledge-transfer situation so that we can co-operate and learn from each other.  A lot of organic farmers I know feel very isolated.  For the sake of expanding on the ideals of organic farming to our neighbours, it is critical that people get exposed to organic farming.<\/p> <p>  Another huge issue, which is the elephant in the room relating to farmers in the organic scheme, is the Irish stipulation of a minimum stocking rate of 0.5 livestock units per hectare.  The reality is that can be quite difficult to attain on high nature value land, uplands and high carbon soils.  I know the organic certification people say that if we do not reach it we get a lesser payment, but to properly incentivise organic we should not be made to reach this artificially high stocking rate.  Natura land and hill land do not have the carrying capacity to reach 0.5 livestock units per hectare.  It is effectively excluding a huge cohort of farmers who cannot even dream of entering the organic scheme who are almost organic anyway with very low fertiliser inputs and very low concentrate feed usage.  These farmers are totally excluded.  If we are to have any ambition, this is one thing that really needs to change quickly.<\/p> <p>  I agree with the Senator's comments on soil.  The whole organic farming system is based on good soil management.  We have lessons to teach all farmers about carbon sequestration, carbon storage in soils, water and filtration in soils from diverse types of cultivation.  There is a lot that can be done if the will is there but at the moment it does not seem to be there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021061500002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Henry O'Donnell"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for attending today.  I gather that Mr. O'Donnell killed two birds with the one stone and also joined his neighbours on the mica protest.  I extend the best wishes of this committee to everybody involved.  As we know, they include quite a number of farming families.<\/p> <p>  I welcome this initial conversation on organics.  This is an area of great potential for the agrifood sector, in particular as it allows the farming community to diversify in a way that can increase the returns coming to farming families, if it is managed right, while also being of significant benefit to the environment.  Therefore, it is regrettable that we have seen such a lack of vision and imagination from statutory bodies, specifically the Department, in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Both speakers referred to Teagasc and Bord Bia and we have heard of some of the failings.  Both of these bodies are statutory bodies that are bound to take direction from the Government.  What direction do we need to give to Teagasc in terms of research, education and training and what does it need to do to support the organic sector in a sufficient way?  There is not enough emphasis by Bord Bia on the marketing of organic products.  Reference has already been made to the sheep sector.  What do we need to put in place?  Do we need to ring-fence a proportion of Bord Bia's budget for the promotion of organic food or do the witnesses have any other propositions?<\/p> <p>  Mr. O'Donnell referred to a point made in the INHFA's submission about the blockages to entry in the scheme.  He mentioned stocking rates.  There was also a reference to commonage.  What needs to be put in place in order to allow those with commonage land to be able to avail of the organic farming scheme?<\/p> <p>  Perhaps Mr. Renaghan can answer this question, and other witnesses might also wish to contribute.  There is a particular problem concerning the lack of competition in the organic feed processing sector.  Do the witnesses have a sense of what could be done to ensure that we do not end up with the same situation in the organic sector as the wider beef sector in that the market is entirely dominated by one or perhaps two big players?  Is there more we can do to support organic marts that can export organic live cattle out of the country?  I know this has been attempted at Ballybay mart, for example, in my constituency?  Could we put more in place at a central level to encourage that type of activity?  I will leave it there for now, a Chathaoirligh.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021061500002#B00300","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I will start with the last question first.  Deputy Carthy mentioned the organic mart in Ballybay.  I was in contact with the mart manager before he set it up and I encouraged him to do it.<\/p><p>It is a slow process but being able to export live cattle would be a major bonus.  That brings me to the beef sector and I will be honest with the members about it.  Some of our members are involved with the Irish Organic Beef Producers Association.  Effectively, it involves many farmers stretching from Dublin to Galway.  They were supplying Good Herdsmen.  They had a three-year deal to supply a certain number of cattle a week.  In the middle of that the farmers were shafted.  They were told they were not wanted any more and their contracts were torn up.  We in the IFA met the farmers.  Some of the farmers involved are on our project team.  We tried to re-establish a deal.  We went to the Bord Bia stand at a show in Germany and met John Purcell.  We engaged with him to see if anything could be done but we were put off the Bord Bia stand at BIOFACH, which is the biggest organic show in Europe.   Myself, Niamh Brennan, our executive secretary, our vice chairman, John Curran, Gordon McCoy and another farmer went there.  Effectively, we were put off the stand and told we were obstructing business, which we were not.  We were trying to help those farmers.  Since then contact was made with the same group of farmers.  It said they would not deal with them as a group but would deal with them individually.  The Government is promoting producer groups.  We had a producer group that was up and running selling approximately 35 to 40 head of cattle every week and it was cast aside.  That was disgraceful.  An offer was made to some of those individuals a few weeks ago to the effect they could sell beef at &euro;5 a kilo but they ended up getting &euro;4.90 a kilo and the promise of &euro;5 a kilo was not met.  Traditionally, the price for the sale of beef was at least &euro;1 a kilo more.  If we take the sale of price of the beef at &euro;4.20 per kilo plus the Bord Bia bonus of 20 cent a kilo, one would wind up, taking everything into account, with a price of &euro;4.50 a kilo.  No bonuses are being paid now.  The flat price is &euro;4.90 a kilo.  Farmers must be Bord Bia approved to get into that scheme but farmers are not getting the 20 cent per kilo bonus on top of the flat price of &euro;4.90, which they should be getting. <\/p><p> One company is controlling the Irish beef industry.  It bought Good Herdsmen.  The ABP Group controls more than 90% of all beef processed in the Republic of Ireland.  That is a fact.  It is little wonder the price is at the level it is at.  At a minimum the price should be &euro;5.40 or &euro;5.50 a kilo if not more.  In Scotland, the price of beef is more than &euro;6 a kilo.  There are questions to be asked about that.  Our organisation has asked that company those questions but we have not got answers.  Perhaps the members of the committee could ask those questions.  I would welcome any questions members may have on that issue. <\/p><p> Regarding Teagasc and the knowledge transfer structure, we mentioned what could be done.  Teagasc is in operation and my colleague from Donegal mentioned the knowledge transfer structure.  We are all farmers and I do not distinguish between any of us.  Teagasc should not be doing any nitrogen trials.  That is a problem.  EU Directive 92\/43\/EEC is an important one.  It states at a maximum a mountain cannot be stocked above 0.25 livestock units per hectare.  I agree with the stocking density allowed on a mountain area.  Some people will say the payment in respect of that is a retrospective one.  Farmers will get it in any event.  The payment for organic producers is based on 60 ha.  There are not a great number of farmers with more than 60 ha in mountain areas.  We should have a stocking level that a mountain area is able to support and there should be a mixture of cattle on that land.  There is a notion that mountain areas need to be farmed but the use of nitrates on that land needs to stop.  Many farmers are taking up swathes of hills using them for nitrates.  They do not even know where the nitrates are and they are not farming the land.  If they are putting in for the payment they should be farming the land and there should be a mixture of cattle on it.  A farmer with a shed housing 200 Holstein bulls on a hill 2,000 ft above sea level is not farming the land.  That must be addressed.  If farmers say they are using the land, they need to do so and to have traditional breeds of cattle on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021061500002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Nigel Renaghan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I must interrupt Mr. Renaghan as a number of speakers wish to contribute.

It is timely with respect to organic farming, which contributes to the protection of the environment and climate and the long-term fertility of the soil, as referenced by Senator Daly who rightly placed great emphasis on it.  It also relates to having high levels of biodiversity, a non-toxic environment and high animal welfare standards and, therefore, it must be of concern to this committee.  Before I ask a few questions, I am conscious that the IFA submission stated that 2.6% of Ireland&rsquo;s agricultural area is under organic production versus the European norm of 7.5%, which is quite low.  Those are very low numbers and that must be disappointing.  Clearly, we must be more ambitious.  We would be familiar with the move to transforming food and farming through the EU organic action plan 2021 to 2027.  We are also conscious of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP.  The programme for Government references increasing the amount of land we would use in organic production.  Therefore, what are the issues?  Much of it is about knowledge transfer.  When we look back to 50 or 60 years ago, rural Irish farmers were practising organic farming.  They did not have certificates of organic production.  They left school at the age of 13 but they knew the land and the soil, and about animal husbandry.  They knew what worked for them, which was particular to their land and given set of circumstances.  There is much to be said for looking back at some of those practices.  Farmers must be progressive in all areas, including in terms of generating food.  One of the guests spoke about a stimulus package.  What did they mean by a stimulus package?  I would like to hear more about that.  Clearly, we must do something.  I am also mindful of knowledge transfer and innovation and I think we are missing something there.  Are there enough market outlets for the smaller producers, particularly those engaged in organic vegetable, salad and food production?  I go to organic markets every weekend.<\/p><p>I see producers throwing stuff out on a Saturday or Sunday evening.  There are not enough marketplaces.  I speak to a lot of producers who say that there are not opportunities to sell really high-quality organic, albeit seasonal, vegetables and fruits and that they do not have a place to market them.  The big question I want to ask the two organisations is whether there is a case to implement some sort of policy or restriction that would ring-fence or set aside a percentage of Bord Bia's marketing budget for the promotion of organics.  I am interested in the experience with Bord Bia one of our guests described.  I have heard of others but I am still very supportive of Bord Bia and its work.  It does good work.  There are conflicts from time to time, of which we hear reports.  Will both organisations share with us the measures they believe could be taken to market organics?  If one does not have a marketplace and marketing budget, one will not be able to sell produce successfully.  I am interested in having more produce but also in the stimulus package the organisations would suggest to achieve this increase.  I do not believe 7% or 8% is ambitious enough.  On an island like ours, there is capacity and capability to achieve a much greater increase.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021061500002#C00900","speaker":"1634","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I work with the IFA as the executive secretary to the organic project team.  To address some of the Senator's point, we 100% agree.  We are used to hearing all of these figures thrown at us in Europe and at meetings of the Committee of Professional Agricultural Organisations, COPA.  Unfortunately, we are at 2.6%.  We are well below Australia, Estonia, Sweden and the likes, which exceed 20%.  The programme for Government sets a target of 7.5% but there is a target of 25% in the agrifood strategy and the farm to fork document.  What is the difference between A and B?  What are the challenges?  We in the IFA are clear that any increase in production must be market-driven.  One cannot put stuff in the marketplace for which there is no market.  That is our number one priority.<\/p> <p>  Of course, we are not here to reinvent the wheel either.  An organics strategy development group was set up and established in 2018.  We have big issues with that.  It produced an excellent document.  It brings together Teagasc, Bord Bia and all of the other stakeholders and sets out different aims.  If these had been progressed, we would not be having this meeting today.  We would have advanced much further than the current 2.6%.  We have had two seats on that group since 2018 and, since then, that group has only met on one occasion, in March.  This followed repeated requests from the IFA for the group to meet.  We recently sent a letter outlining that the tillage and dairy farming sectors are not represented on this group, which is something we want addressed immediately.  We want action points from each one of these meetings.  There are some updates on the website but they are in the form of presentations and it is very hard to gather any hard facts from them.  That is one thing on which we are strong.  Everything we need is within that strategy group.  A lot of work went into it.  If that was fulfilled and progressed, we would be further along than we are.<\/p> <p>  I will address some of the other problems quickly.  It was great that the organic farms scheme reopened but another major issue with the latest reopening, in which there were 317 applicants for a potential 400 or 500 places from the funding of &euro;4 million, was that it was run in parallel with the results based environment agri pilot programme, REAP.  Farmers in the IFA were contacting us and wondering what they should do.  It is clear that there is not enough technical advice for farmers as to what direction to take.  They were caught between a rock and a hard place.  There was a higher payment per hectare for REAP but they may have been set on the organics up to that point.  If there are two payments side by side and one is higher, that will make up a lot of people's minds as to what direction they will take.  Since the scheme has closed, we have had farmers on to us saying that they would have went for it and that they are disappointed with the choice they made.  Perhaps advisers in the sector were driving them towards the higher payment.  That is the reality.  We are clear that we want the organic farms scheme reopened immediately to allow the rest of the funds to be drawn down and to allow more farmers in.  <\/p> <p>  We will back the Senator 100% with regard to research, innovation and knowledge transfer.  The main issue is demand.  Any increase in production must be market-driven.  The report to which I have referred shows that market development is the number one aim of the organic strategy group.  We would like to see more established markets for organic produce in Ireland and internationally, and public procurement could also be brought into it.  It is not going to happen overnight but, if we work on the markets, we will move on a long way.  Mr. Renaghan may also have points to make in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021061500002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Niamh Brennan"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I have to bring in some other Deputies.

It is almost impossible to sell cattle as organic if one is in a peripheral area like a peninsula.  Most of the time, I end up selling them in the ordinary market.  The price is poor, to say the least.  The grants are also poor so one is really being organic for the love of organic farming rather than for the love of financial remuneration.  I pay tribute to Mr. Renaghan, with whom I have had a lot of communication down through the years with regard to raising issues of concern to try to rectify the situation of people with, perhaps, 70 acres of land.  Such people pay a licence of approximately &euro;600 a year and pay planners approximately &euro;500 every year to get their plans, which generate &euro;2,000 or &euro;2,500.  It is shockingly poor money.<\/p> <p>  I will ask a few questions but, first of all, I welcome the guests.  I will refer to a matter raised earlier with regard to the 225 applications made in 2018.  I met many of these farmers from my own area, as other Deputies have.  They were exasperated.  They had done courses.  Some apparently had weekends out of it.  There seems to be a great deal of criteria to qualify as an organic farmer.  Previously someone had to fill out some forms and understand how it worked but now course after course is required.  Somebody else is making a dollar out of these courses along the way.  There were 225 applications but, after doing these courses, 110 applicants did not get into the scheme.  Why was this the case?  Why were people left outside the system?<\/p> <p>  Is public procurement of organic produce available through a producer group?  The new organic farming scheme was not full.  Do the witnesses know why?  What is the difference in price between organic and non-organic beef?  This is a big one.  Some 98% of the market is not organic.  Can something be forced through with regard to the organic sector so that there will be a market available for the beef cattle raised by organic farmers, no matter what part of the country they are from?  Some people cannot live in the middle of the country.  Regardless of whether someone lives in the south west, the north or anywhere else, everyone should have a market open to them.  Perhaps the marts should be brought further into this.  They could have a special organic sale every two or three months or something along that line.  It is not happening.  People are selling their cattle as non-organic after rearing them as organic.  It is very unfortunate.  Since I entered the organic sector 20 years ago, it has not moved.  That is astonishing.  We have had the Green Party in government before and it is in government again now.  I will be very disappointed if there is not some kind of movement on the ground very quickly.  I would appreciate it if some of those questions could be answered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021061500002#D00400","speaker":"1461"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I will make a couple of points.  People are trying to put a finger on what the obstacles are.  I have some figures here.  Some 10,750 people applied for the REAP while there were 317 applications for 500 places on the organic farming scheme.  On an average farm with mixed types of land, a farmer would get &euro;5,000 per year for five years under the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, which is &euro;25,000.<\/p><p>The administration costs of that are 2.5%.  On a similar piece of land, a farmer would get &euro;2,000 per annum on the organic farming scheme for the same area.  Over five years that comes to &euro;10,000.  The administration cost is 25%.  There is a factor of tenfold on those costs.  Almost ten times the number of people applied to get into the results-based agri-environment pilot, REAP.  Those figures marry up.  There is definitely a problem here.  <\/p><p> The last point in our submission highlighted the need for an independent review of the entire system.  I call on the Chairman to instruct the committee members to push for an independent review.  Those involved in organic farming and the organic representative bodies would probably appreciate this being looked at by an independent set of eyes.  There is a great future in it if the obstacles can be eliminated.  Beef and lamb farmers who have a business plan to directly sell their products have priority access to any organic scheme.  At the moment there is an obstacle to those people getting in.  They do not score very high on the scoring matrix.  That may also answer the question.<\/p><p> There has been reference here to a sort of monopoly on slaughtering.  This would take a lot of that action away.  A person would find their own butcher and sell locally at the local farmers' market or direct sell online or wherever.  There are opportunities and I believe if there is a review those solutions can be proposed then.  Instead of faulting the actions and the things that are there at the moment, we need to find a way around them through this review.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021061500002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe Condon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I call on the other witnesses to respond to Deputy Michael Collins's questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021061500002#E00200","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I would like to come back on a few points.  Deputy Michael Collins has first-hand experience of what organic farmers are up against.  The committee should listen very carefully to what he says.  There are certain basic stumbling blocks preventing the development of organic farming, which the representatives present have outlined today.  We will not solve these major stumbling blocks by working around the edges of the current scheme.  It really needs to be looked at in detail.  If it continues as it is going, it will discourage even more farmers.<\/p> <p>  As Deputy Collins mentioned, that cohort in 2018 were all potential organic farmers and were willing to enter a scheme, but 110 of them did not get in.  They paid a professional to help them draw up an organic plan.  They paid a certification body to certify that plan as being appropriate.  They then spent a considerable amount of their time to be certified as having done organic training at a significant cost to themselves.  In addition, they also farmed organically for nine months after their application until they were told they were unsuccessful.  They purchased expensive organic feed.  They started small tillage operations in their farm.<\/p> <p>  What was done to those farmers was criminal.  It is no wonder that we did not get the 500 applicants this time.  I am sure every one of those farmers told another ten farmers around them of the horrendous experience they had.  Somebody needs to get a grip on this and take some control over it to ensure that it never happens to a farmer again.  It would not be tolerated in any sector nor should it be.  <\/p> <p>  Deputy Carthy made some points on commonage land.  We have been told by the certifying parties that because it is commonage land and a range of owners are involved it cannot be classed as organic.  I believe somebody with a bit of ambition could look at that.  Where I live in Inishowen I am surrounded by commonages.  They never received pesticides or fertilisers.  They have been totally organically managed in my living memory.  Farmers are grazing there to protect the biodiversity and are producing a fabulous product.  If this scheme cannot be adjusted to accommodate that pristine landscape, there is not much ambition in our organic farming scene.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021061500002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Henry O'Donnell"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I welcome our guests.  Rather than supporting the production of affordable food, the focus of the CAP negotiations seems to be on increasing environmental measures without the funding that would be needed to do so effectively.  Commitments and targets have been signed up to without the backing of the agricultural sector here.  In the race to catch up with our commitments, will the EU the funding be weighted to the larger operators to the detriment of our smaller family farmers?<\/p> <p>  We recently discussed alternatives to horticultural peat and the production of coir, for instance.  It is said to have environmental consequences for the countries that produce it.  When it comes to the alternatives for feed, additives and pesticides, we need to enable the organic farmers to prosper.  What levels of self-sufficiency do we have in this regard?  Could we develop our own capabilities to produce these items?  <\/p> <p>  In Ireland we pride ourselves on our premium produce which is known throughout the world.  It is dispiriting that successive Governments have paid little attention to producing organic food.  This country has a global reputation for the finest produce that others can only dream of.  This committee continually needs to discuss it.  Over the years our farmers have not been presented with accessible and viable additions to their farming prospects.  I ask the representatives here today to outline the experience of their members when giving consideration to getting into organic farming.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021061500002#E00400","speaker":"1613"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":30,"content":"<p>Mention was made of the farmers in 2018.  I concur with my colleague from Donegal because I was one of those farmers.  I was one of the 63 who stuck with it even though I never got in.  I have a modified building, a six-bay cattle shed.  I was required to have a 60% lie-back area.  All these things needed to be done at enormous cost.  In addition to doing a course, I had to pay certification bodies.  Sheds needed to be modified.  It was horrendous.  A farmer who is in conversion is not allowed to use ordinary meal and must buy organic meal.  There are now only 63 of those farmers who never got in.  An injustice was done to those farmers and I am one of them.<\/p><p>That needs to be rectified.  We talk about getting people into organic farming.  Most countries in Europe have public procurement for organics.  The Government has a huge role to play in this area of public procurement.<\/p><p> There is huge potential for organic lamb.  While there is not much demand for it from factories in Ireland, there is demand for it on the Continent.  We are not in that space, however.  The word missing from all of this is \"seasonal\".  Let us take a farmer on Arranmore Island who is doing a joint venture with other farmers on the mainland.  If they are to do organic lamb right, it needs to be seasonal and promoted as a seasonal product because that is what it is.<\/p><p> If we are to move organic farming on, we must have a payment.  As has been said with regard to the payments, 25% of the money is accounted for by leakage to certification bodies, people doing up plans and so on.  For us to drive this on, we need &euro;520 for conversion and payment of &euro;470 after two years.  That may seem like a lot but bear in mind that under GLAS, a payment of &euro;900 per hectare is available for wild bird cover.  Let us compare like with like.  We also need a 60% grant because the farmers are not in a position to use chemicals.  Everything must be done manually and farmers need costly equipment to be able to do that.  That must also be taken into consideration.<\/p><p> Reference was made to what we are doing and what we can do to promote organics.  We held an organic producers day when we teamed up with F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  We asked it if there would be any interest in funding.  We did a joint venture with F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  It was supposed to happen last year but Covid knocked that on the head and it was cancelled again this year.  However, we had a day in Marlay Park for organic producers from across the country.  We introduced them and it was a very successful day.<\/p><p> As Deputy Michael Collins said, it is important to note that anyone producing organic beef or other produce in a part of the country where there is no organic mart, that produce is lost to the system.  That is a fundamental flaw.  Better knowledge transfer is required.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine could provide a networking facility to enable organic producers to contact each other and sell or supply each other.  Having more local abattoirs would also be of huge benefit.  This would facilitate us farmers in being able to process.<\/p><p> Another area has not yet been touched on today.  When we talk of what we can and cannot do in organic farming in Ireland, we must look at what is being imported.  There is no point in Bord Bia talking about all this organic produce in Ireland because a lot it is not worth passing remarks on.  We not going to start producing nuts in Ireland.  It is just not going to happen.  We have to see what we can produce and where we can produce it.  We can produce organic beef and seasonal lamb.  Flahavan's imports more than 3,000 tonnes of organic oats every year.  We should be able to fit into that area and marry up with it.  Even in my local area people are starting up mills to make flour.  There is the tradition that says one can only make flour way down the country and that we cannot produce it here in the northern part of the country.  There are, however, lots of parts of the country that can produce flour on a small scale, be it oats for eating or flour for bread making.  It can be done and is being done.  Farmers like us are not being incentivised and are not getting financial supports to be able to do that.  Whether one likes it or not, most organic farmers are small farmers.  We need supports to be able to do that, either at a co-operative level or at local level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021061500002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Nigel Renaghan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses.  I have a few questions.  A farmer with a small amount of land who goes into organics receives a payment of approximately &euro;600, while a farmer with 70 ha or 80 ha receives only &euro;1,100 or &euro;1,200.  This puts off smaller farms.  I would like the witnesses' views on that.<\/p> <p>  There is all this talk about getting &euro;1 per kilo more for organic beef than for other beef.  Mr. Renaghan mentioned that.  Is it correct that there is actually no bonus involved in this?  If we take out the 20 cent a farmer will get from rearing an animal in the conventional way, through the graze, and considering that it sometimes costs an organic farmer &euro;40 or &euro;50 to transport cattle because there is no choice, as was highlighted, it basically becomes unreasonable and unworkable to transport the cattle.  Have options been looked at for exporting them on the hoof to places such as England for killing, as some other cattle go?<\/p> <p>  The Chairman might also respond to my next question.  Lambs on a mountain in Mayo or Donegal are, in my view, organic.  They are up on a hill the whole time.  Is anything being done to try to get them in under the organic bracket?<\/p> <p>  Are the witnesses worried about the new scheme on straw?  I am aware that criteria for producing organic state that the lying down area must be 50% slatted and the other 50% must be straw.  Are the witnesses concerned that there has been a tilt towards dairy and tillage for organic?  Off the top of my head, I believe there are some 1,700 or 1,800 people producing organic.  We would get people into organics if we paid them the money.  As was highlighted earlier, we would get people into organics if we looked at the schemes.<\/p> <p>  With regard to overheads, I would go higher than the 25% figure mentioned.  If we taken the case of a farmer with 10 or 12 ha, of which there is one in my county, he or she will pay &euro;600 to join an organic scheme.  That cost and all the other bits involved meant it was a complete and utter waste of time.  We have a Minister of State in the Department from the Green Party who is supposed to promote organic farming.  It is a sad reflection on this country that we struggle to get rid of the produce.<\/p> <p>  Are organic lambs killed the same way as other lambs, or are they killed somewhere else?  I am not aware if they are.<\/p> <p>  Have the witnesses met Bord Bia to see what markets it has?  Lidl and Aldi, for example, have advertisements on RT&Eacute; and TV3 stating everything is sourced in Ireland.  We see images of a farmer walking around with a dog and cattle, and everything looks lovely.  What is the story on the organic meat these supermarkets use?  Are they buying anything here?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021061500002#F00200","speaker":"1508"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":33,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Fitzmaurice for the questions.  I totally agree with his first point on certification costs.  The closest thing a conventional farmer gets to certification is Bord Bia approval.  Some farmers may have difficulties with aspects of Bord Bia inspections but at least they are not charged for them.  Surely the organic system could be the same and certification should not be an additional cost to a farmer?<\/p><p>As I said, conventional farmers are certified as Bord Bia-approved.  Surely, there could be similar mechanism for organic farms.  The next thing Deputy Fitzmaurice mentioned is the transport of organic stock.  I was laughing to myself thinking of that.  Living 20 miles from Malin Head, I am acutely aware of this.  Part of the issue, to my mind, is that the organic sector is not properly developed.  If there were more farmers, more things could be done.  There could be more co-operation.  In the short term, our proposal put in that organic farmers should get access to at least a 60% targeted agriculture modernisation schemes, TAMS, grant for proper livestock transport trailers.  The closest organic mart to me is Drumshanbo.  If I were assisted and had a good transport trailer to transport them, it would be some help in the short term, at least.<\/p><p> Regarding the lack of organic lamb, Deputy Fitzmaurice is obviously aware that the Irish Natura and Hill Farmers Association, INHFA, has spearheaded a campaign to develop a market for our hill lamb.  As the Deputy rightly said, they are organic, for all intents and purposes.  The current certification and organic system does not work, end of story.  We have looked at it in great detail.  That is part of our reasoning that our organic scheme needs to be overhauled.  We have an organic product that we cannot get certified as organic; we cannot sell it as organic; and we cannot market it as organic.  Therefore, there is something intrinsically wrong there.  We have basically organic produce that cannot be certified.<\/p><p> The straw would be a concern.  Organic farmers are more dependent on straw than anybody else.  I would have thought it would be easy to provide a derogation to a conventional farmer.  He would still get the straw chopping payment measure.  He would still get the payment, if he were able to prove that he sold the straw to an organic farmer.  Again, something could be done there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021061500002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Henry O'Donnell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":35,"content":"<p>The last member who wants to get in is Deputy Brian Leddin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021061500002#G00200","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":36,"content":"<p>This might have been broached already as I joined the meeting late.

First, there are only 1,800 organic farmers in the country.  It is not a massive number of farmers.  That is the first starting point.  On what we are doing, we have an organic project team within IFA.  That was set up by John Curran, the Meath chairman, and myself.  That has only been up and running for approximately three years.  Since then, we had a producer day in Marlay Park.  We have lobbied in the same way as Mr. O&rsquo;Donnell.  We are all looking for the same things.  We are trying to get a margin for farmers.  In terms of what we are doing, there is an island off Donegal called &Aacute;rainn Mh&oacute;r Island.  We have been out there a couple of times.  They are not able to finish the lamb that comes off the mountain on the island.  We have had two meetings: one with the Longford lamb producer group, and one with the Monaghan lamb producer group.  The Monaghan lamb producer group is the biggest lamb producer group in the country.  We spoke to the boys on the island and asked them about the number of lambs that they have.

I spoke previously about the difficulties many farmers have.  I was in organic farming for 20 years until last year when my son took over and he is involved in it now.  The organic scheme has not moved in the 20 years I was farming.  It is stagnant.  Farmers are getting very poor payments.  They are only doing it for the love of being organic.  There is a strict criterion in place but that is not an issue with any farmer.  They get inspected on the farm once every 12 months.  It costs roughly &euro;600 to have a licence.  If a farmer is on about 70 acres with &euro;2,500 taken in payments, he or she would be lucky to have &euro;1,000 profit - if we want to call it profit - a year.<\/p> <p>  I know the witnesses are in the governing bodies, which are over organic farming, but have they any connections with the Department to see if organic farming can be progressed from where it is at present and to encourage people to come into it?  We spoke about the 225 people who, in 2018, went to great lengths and costs to register as organic farmers but 110 of those did not get in.  Some 63 went into organic conversion thinking they would be certified organic but failed to do so.  Things have not got better.  We have the Green Party in government now and things should get better.  I come at this issue from the perspective of having been an organic farmer, and proud to have been one, but it is not for profit.  It is for the love of the land that most farmers are doing it now.<\/p> <p>  Could the two organisations get involved in the sale of animals for farmers and be active in that?  For many farmers in rural areas, there is no sale for their cattle.  There is no point in telling them that there is a sale elsewhere in the country because they cannot take cattle 150 km to 200 km to be sold.  Could the organisations organise with the marts so that there could be a mart in every area once every two to three months when it is time to sell cattle?  There needs to be some movement here.  I am worn in the tooth from saying this.   Working with organisations and looking at the poor grant payments and the criteria, one will soon have to become some kind of a professor to become an organic farmer.  That is not the way it should be.  Farmers are a protector of their lands and most of them love their land and will protect it.  They deserve the right to be organic, if they want to be in organic farming.  They do not need to be doing courses.  Of course, they need to be advised but it is not paying them.  Can the witnesses shed any light on this?  Do they see this moving in a different direction from where it is at this stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021061500002#H00200","speaker":"1461"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":49,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Irish Organic Association, I thank the committee for the invitation to be here today.  I am sorry but I missed the first few minutes.  Something went wrong with the system.  It was going fine but then it suddenly crashed.<\/p> <p>  I take Deputy Collins's point.  In encouraging farmers, a much more progressive common strategic plan is required to support organic farmers going forward.  We understand there were issues in 2018, which was a targeted scheme, for farmers coming in.  I must admit that it was targeted and agreed by the organic strategy group because there was a limited budget.  The budget will underline many of our responses here today and financial supports will form a large part of it.  In terms of how we move forward with this, we have a significant amount of ideas put forward.  We have been very active, as members know, on our climate and Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, submissions, and development work, etc., that we try to do.  The only thing we do not get involved in is sales.  We used to book animals into the mart for all organic farmers in Ireland and that has stopped.  Farmers book them in now.  There are many more marts but perhaps still not sufficient numbers.<\/p> <p>  On the farmers who came into the scheme in 2018, as Deputy Collins said, many farmers did not get in.  Some 63 farmers who managed to come in have stayed and of the 317 farmers who came in this year, one would have to deduct that.  There were other farmers who did not get in but who had previously been in organics.  Therefore, there were not 317 new farmers.  It is trailing behind, and there is no nice way to say this.  It is lagging behind, and it is a bit of an embarrassment in terms of the rest of the EU.  Ireland should be a leader in organic production.  We certainly agree with all the things, or at least most of them, the previous speakers mentioned.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the minimum stocking rate for hill farmers, etc., we do not set that rate.  That is set by the Department and I am sure it will be happy to take members' questions on that.  We will be happy to listen in on that as well.<\/p> <p>  As I said, minimum stocking rates is for the Department.  I refer to a previous question on the commonage area and some of the barriers that were addressed.  Farmers can use commonage, however, they do not get an organic farming payment from it because it is not under that control, even for hefted flocks, etc.<\/p> <p>  We would like to see a significant increase and we are happy to discuss that today.  We have many ideas on how that can be done.  Some of the previous speakers alluded to parts of that in terms of public procurement, proper promotion and some sort of cohesive strategy.<\/p> <p>  In terms of ambition, it seems that just a small amount of interest would be accepted more so than ambition.  We would like to see a significant push.  We think it is here and that it can be sold.  It is a win-win situation in terms of its environmental and climate contribution.  It answers the call for more product.  Consumers are asking for more products and we need to deliver this.  My colleague, Mr. Meredith, might like to come in on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021061500002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Gillian Westbrook"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":50,"content":"<p>I will let him in shortly.

We need to correlate with the EU action plan and the 2030 agrifood strategy and we need proper co-ordination between the various policies, including the CAP.  The strategy, and the CAP strategic plan specifically, needs to align with public spending.  There is no doubt about that.  There are also things like Horizon Europe.  Europe has put considerable funding towards research and innovation so we need to align policies with that.  If the EU says we need to put a certain percentage of the funding into organics, then maybe we should ring-fence the budget for that.  I had not considered that but it is a good idea.  We also have other national programmes and the likes of Bord Bia.<\/p> <p>  We think the target should be closer to 12% and should be supported with a pull-push approach.  It is all very well to say that we are going to get to 7.5%.  That is the EU average now but it will not be the EU average by 2030 so we need to look ahead a little and see what we can do.  If 30% of the research budget is for the agrifood sector, and specifically for organics, then we should put 30% of the budget towards it.  We also need a combination of EU and Irish research to meet that target, although that is easier said than done.  It is easy to rattle this off.  However, coming up with a proper strategy is certainly not impossible.  We only have to look around the rest of Europe to see how other countries have managed to do it.  We have initiatives such as the national soil sampling programme and the farm biodiversity study but we need equal access to pilot schemes, carbon farming and the development of monitoring systems.  We are reading some good work in Ag Climatise.  It is good and we welcome it but quite a few issues have been omitted.  I will leave it to others to discuss those issues but it would be nice to see some recognition of organics in Teagasc's MACC curve, for example.  The EPA has called for an agrifood policy of 25% organic farming to meet its farm to fork strategy, although that is an EU target rather than an Irish one.<\/p> <p>  We have to recognise that organic farming contributes to the reduction of pesticides, a 20% reduction in fertiliser use and a 50% reduction in antimicrobials and so on.  Dare I say it, what is really required is a disruptive change of culture at all levels.  That is how we will be able to adapt and continue to make a living in farming in Ireland.  Otherwise, we are going to get left behind.  We will come to a tipping point soon where consultations and business concerns will become irrelevant and we are going to be made to do it.  The Government is going to have to answer to the taxpayers as to why it is buying carbon credits and paying fines for non-compliance.  If we could get over that cultural shift initially, that would be a big step forward. <\/p> <p>  As regards our role, we are running a European innovation partnership with 11 farmers but that can certainly be reproduced elsewhere.  The point of it is that it will be replicated.  As regards what others can do, such as the Department, Teagasc and Bord Bia, they could provide better marketing, and Teagasc specifically could do better farm advisory.  The recent call for the organic farming scheme was a bit disappointing but a lot of people went into REAP instead because it was more incentivised financially for both the farmer and the adviser.  We need to ring-fence the marketing budget, or alternatively, put it out to tender to someone who feels more appropriate to do the job.  We need to give it a big push and not be scared to highlight the environmental attributes of organic farming.  It is good for rural development, rural communities and agriculture.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked whether we need a separate advisory body.  It would be nice to see some demo farms.  That is in Ag Climatise and two grassland or tillage farms are to be put through with Teagasc but it would have been nice to see a blueprint for the dairy side as well.  Maybe that will happen soon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021061500002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Gillian Westbrook"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":54,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses from the different groups.

Ms Westbrook said earlier that we should not be afraid to highlight the environmental attributes of organics.  I could not agree more.  Perhaps it is not said enough.  One of the attributes she did not mention, which I am sure she would mention if she had another go, was reducing emissions, which is a significant focus of the State through to 2030 and beyond.  It seems that if we can enhance the organic sector and set policy so that farmers are incentivised to get into it such that they get a fair price for the produce they bring to market, that seems to be a no-brainer for the State.  I noticed that Ms Westbrook mentioned that the target is 7.5% organics by 2030 and that Europe is moving so we should move and not stick with the 7.5% target.  I do not know whether she meant all elements of organics or whether it was one element in particular.  Dr. Oliver Moore from University College Cork, UCC, wrote recently about how organics could take off in Ireland.  He mentioned that 12% was being achieved in Normandy or Brittany in France.   He was speaking about dairy farming.  Does Ms Westbrook think this level is achievable in Ireland within the decade?  What are the policy barriers to getting there?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021061500002#K01900","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":89,"content":"<p>I might let in Mr. Meredith.

Obviously, we need to build on that and on the new EU organic action plan to make sure it is aligned.  It is then that we need to look at the nuts and bolts of the different schemes that are offered to organic farmers.<\/p><p>The schemes are very important in sending a signal to farmers about the way the Government wants to see agriculture develop over time.  The EU has been clear on that in respect of the European Green Deal.  In the programme for Government, Ireland has set out the 75%.  It really comes down to the schemes that the Government wants to put in place.  Much of the focus was placed on the organic farming scheme in the last session.  We would agree with much of that.  Some points to highlight include that the scheme must be attractive and reliable.  In the current CAP period, the scheme has only been opened four times, whereas the scheme is usually opened regularly across different European countries.  That allows farmers and food businesses to plan in advance.  That is key.  Conversion to organic farming does not happen overnight.  It is a two-year process before farmers can start to use the symbol.  Therefore, a scheme needs to be put in place which farmers know is going to be open regularly.  It also must be open for an extended period.  An opening period of two months is better than what was provided in the past.  There needs to be a more regular opening so that farmers have time to plan.  In some cases farmers will try to plan the system themselves, and in others, they will ask for advisers.  Those are the points I wish to make on the organic farming scheme.<\/p><p> I am aware that the IFA mentioned that there needs to be an increase in payment rates.  If we compare the current rates with the EU member states, we are well below the EU average.  That sends a very strange signal to farmers.  The organic farming scheme is definitely the starting point.  However, it needs to go further than that.  The Deputy touched upon the issue of environmental performance and climate.  The Government can use organic farming as a tool to move further into and build on the green reputation that farmers have, as many of the Deputies mentioned.  That is where we see the combination of organic farming and agri-environment schemes as a win-win for developing further organic and making it more attractive, but also achieving those environmental targets.  Currently, there are problems with GLAS because organic farmers have priority access to GLAS but some of the farmers have to forego their organic farming payment, despite it not being a requirement of the organic regulations.  That sends a strange signal.  There are situations, for example, where farmers may want to manage a traditional hay meadow or a low-input permanent pasture, or even farm land birds, and they are told they can do that but they must forego their organic farming payment to do so.  That means that a farmer has to make a strange decision at a time when he could deliver both elements.<\/p><p> The land management schemes are important.  We saw a lot of promise with the new REAP scheme.  Many of the objectives go beyond the standards of organic farming in terms of improving species variety, managing hedgerows, etc.  However, organic farmers were excluded from the scheme.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine is on record as saying that it is double funding.  For us, it is not clear that that is the case.  The outcomes that are pursued under that scheme are precisely what organic farmers can deliver if they are given the right incentives.  The objectives of the scheme go beyond the organic standards, as I stated.  We know that it is a pilot scheme.  We would hope that organic farmers will be prioritised in the roll-out of the full scheme and the new CAP.  It is also very important that we move beyond that and think about the eco scheme.  If we are really serious about targeting organic farming, we need to link the schemes to a budget.<\/p><p> In the current programming period since 2014, there has been a 42% increase in organic land.  However, we have still not reached the 5% target set in Food Harvest 2020.  There seems to be a disconnect between the budget that is allocated for the CAP and that available for the organic farming scheme and also for agri-environment payments, etc.  Land management is definitely a big area.<\/p><p> Deputy Carthy spoke on the issue of advisory services.  It is fair to say that Teagasc has a number of basic advisory services for organic farmers.  They tend to be mainly relevant to farmers doing conversion.  It is fair to say that the services are quite basic.  The farming associations have pointed to the fact that are only two organic advisers.  One was recently hired.  We understand that there are a number of general advisers who also focus on organic farming but we are yet to find a list of them.  We want to see a certain percentage of the accredited farm advisers being organic.  Perhaps it needs to be 7% to represent that target.  We need to think about ensuring we have advisers who understand that organic farming is not simply about reducing the use of fertiliser - it is about completely changing the system and thinking about how the land and farm management and animal health and welfare work.  Advisers are needed to do that.  As well as the advice, knowledge transfer is required.  That was touched up by the farming organisations.  That could work hand in hand, with advice being provided by Teagasc or the private adviser and the use of facilitated group meetings that allow farmers to share their knowledge with others.  Such knowledge transfer could be within sectors or cross-sectoral.<\/p><p> Those are some of the measures that we would like to see put in place.  It really needs to be tied to a very strong budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021061500002#K02100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Meredith","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":92,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for attending today and for their submissions.  I have a few questions.  Some of what I intended to ask has already been covered and dealt with efficiently.<\/p> <p>  On the organic growers' submission, I have a question concerning the sourcing of organic seed for the sector post Brexit.  I ask for more elaboration on that.  Could there potentially be a future for Ireland in becoming an organic seed producer now that we have identified that there is a gap in the market?  We had a similar issue with the organic and inorganic seed potato post Brexit.  It has been addressed.  A big drive has been undertaken with a view to us becoming producers.  Is there an opportunity there?<\/p> <p>  The other question I have is more a discussion point in respect of organics in the current climate action debate and the traditional regulation and certification of organic farms.  The consumers really see the emphasis as being on the quality of the food coming from the lack of pesticides, herbicides and artificial fertilisers; and in the meat products, from the lack of microbial intervention, etc.  In the current debate, is there enough emphasis on the sustainability side and the actual carbon footprint of the produce and the food?  I could be an organic farmer tomorrow morning and tick all the boxes, have the organic packaging and the stamp and meet all the criteria.  However, I could be using the biggest diesel-guzzling tractor in the world on the farm and nobody would even be aware of that.  Therefore, do we need to tie the whole sustainability side of organics into it and give farmers a better chance to become organic if they can prove that they are environmentally-friendly and have low carbon emissions, which they could achieve by tying in some microgeneration as part of their overall farm process?<\/p> <p>  In the research I have done and the material I have read on organics, nearly every article opens with the positive of the increased demand for the product, but the number of farmers who want to become organic is not keeping pace with that increased demand.  \"Why so because\", as they say down in our country?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021061500002#L00200","speaker":"1651"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":93,"content":"<p>I will take some of the questions.  I will leave the one on seeds for Ms Maher, if I may, as it is her area.  Climate action was raised by Senator Paul Daly and Deputy Leddin.  We see there is a clear advantage in the climate argument for organics, namely, that, as identified in the Ag Climatise document, approximately 40% of nitrous oxide emissions are associated with chemical nitrogen fertilisers.  I point to that alone and note that , which does not take into account the manufacturing footprint of the fertiliser.  Obviously, removing that 40% nitrous oxide completely would be very beneficial.  That is just a back-of-the-envelope calculation that stands out.  Not that we put an awful lot of emphasis on carbon sequestration but that has a big part to play and carbon farming is becoming more and more apparent.  We think organic farming has an awful lot to offer in the context of climate action.  That is why the EU is supporting it as well, which is worth pointing out.  There is a reason it is in there with the European Green Deal and that is to answer many of these challenges society is facing.  That is why it is being supported and there is a myriad of research to support that.  Various evaluations have been done and one of the Scottish systems, for example, was showing just what could be done in that it found organic farming had the single highest emission reduction opportunities.  There is a huge amount of supporting information and as I said, that is why it is being supported by the policy.<\/p> <p>  The Senator referred to the quality of food.  It absolutely is quality food.  One of the reasons the food sells so well in the EU is because it is associated with Ireland and the whole artisan side.  The organic one is often the one that actually gets there first and onto the shelf.  There is a massive reputation in that regard.  It is a quality product and we need to be proud that it is.  Consumers, as supported by Bord Bia, have no problem spending at least 10% extra on organic products.  Thus, organics should not be knocked for that but should instead be supported.  On the sustainability package, I absolutely agree; the sustainability is actually in the regulations.  These regulations have been developed since 1991.  They were around before but were never formalised and legislated for until 1991.  Sustainability is actually enshrined through the regulations.  That is why the whole sustainability package and organics is certainly part of the European Green Deal.<\/p> <p>  In terms of increased demand, there is a massive increase in demand but what is more important is where the projected demands are going to be coming from.  We in Ireland hover around at between 1.6% and 2% organic farmland.  The rest of Europe is gearing up.  We can try to sell it under some other sustainability package but members should also bear in mind there is a massive amount of marketing and support going into the EU logo put on organic foods.  When all that is tied together as a package, sustainability is at the heart of organic production.  It always has been.  It has been a driver of it.  It has been used by others since then and sometimes in an \"almost organic\" or \"organic lite\" form, or whatever one wishes to call it, but organics is very much the real thing and that is because it contributes to our environment, our climate, etc. in a positive way.  We can look at other means of assessing carbon footprints and sometimes there tends to be a bit of cherry-picking in what we use.  In other words, do we use the input from a contractor, or if the farmer does not use one then are we using that carbon footprint?  Overall, however, I would say that organics comes out on top of all of these.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021061500002#M00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Gillian Westbrook"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":94,"content":"<p>I will be brief because I am conscious of time.  We have had a really good debate.  One might call it one of the great frauds or whatever but we have the clean, green Ireland image yet we are the second lowest in Europe for organic farming.  That is really being hammered home today.  I thank the various guests who have highlighted that but it is a real challenge to everyone involved in agriculture.  I have one question.  It is for Ms Maher and it is on the subject of organics in horticulture.  We did not have time to cover it as much as I would have liked.  I am a professional horticulturist and have studied horticulture.  I was involved in organic trials in Kinsealy in the 1970s and 1980s, mostly the 1980s.  Ms Maher highlighted the need for internships, partnerships, learning and knowledge transfer.  I note by the way that though it was said that the Department does not fund the OGI it does supply funding for training.  The witnesses may correct me if I am wrong to say that.  In just a few sentences, will Ms Maher outline how she would like us to develop the training, internships and knowledge transfer training specifically in relation to organic horticulture?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021061500002#M00200","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":95,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for the question.  I am only here to speak on organic horticulture but I concur with much of the sentiment that is being expressed at this meeting.  We do not receive funding as an organisation; we are a voluntary organisation.  Certainly the OGI operates on a shoestring in that context.  We do, however, receive funding for an internship programme that we developed in 2014.  That was really to react to a lack of training opportunities within the sector.  It is running seven years and 48 interns have gone through the programme, with many of them gaining employment opportunities directly on organic farms so that is a success story.<\/p> <p>  I will also address Senator Paul Daly's question on the seeds.  The whole area of organic horticulture is actually a success story.  Sales are growing exponentially and producers are finding it very hard to keep up with market demand.  This is an issue, as Senator Paul Daly raised, of running into barriers where we cannot supply what the market is demanding.  Going back to what Deputy Leddin said earlier about emissions, at the moment in the horticulture sector we are still importing 70% of organic fruit and vegetables sold in Ireland.  Thus, when we talk about climate and emissions, that is something that really needs to be addressed.  We have under 200 members.  Per the statistics from the Department on organic growers, there are 385 certified organic growers in the country.  They are supplying every aspect of the retail chain.  They are supplying the big supermarkets, the major multiples, the catering sector, independent specialists and stores, online sales, market sales and importantly, they are dealing directly with consumers.  Consequently, they are very much on-trend with consumer needs and what consumers want and Irish consumers want more local organic produce.  The stats from Bord Bia indicate that in 2020 sales of organic fruit and vegetables in Irish multiples increased by 38%.  As a result, it is a huge opportunity in terms of markets.  As Deputy Leddin said, it is a no-brainer, and the embarrassingly low level was mentioned earlier by Deputy Carthy.  We really need to address this issue.  The opportunities are there and from the OGI's perspective, we would like to see more support for training.<\/p> <p>  Senator Paul Daly mentioned the whole seeds area.  We are seeing opportunities there.  We have some interest from some of the indigenous seed companies which see that Europe is serious about organics; whether Ireland is or not is another matter but Europe certainly is.  If 25% of land area is certified organic by 2030 all of those organic farmers need to use organic seed, so we in OGI would certainly like to see some national funding being directed towards organic seed development and to organic seed breeding programmes specifically.  That could be through public private partnerships but ideally we would love to see participatory programmes.  These happen in other European countries and consist of farmers, growers, plant breeders, seed companies, researchers and everybody involved along the way in developing seeds and varieties which are suitable to the Irish climate.  Unfortunately, most of the research we are dealing with at present tends to come from other European countries.<\/p><p>We need more research and more education.  You cannot do a third level degree in organic farming in Ireland, and in this day and age asking people to go into an industry when they cannot get a third level qualification in it is something out of the dark ages.  We need to get real on education.  The market opportunities are there.  The problem in the organic horticulture sector is that growers simply cannot keep up with demand.  If you grow good-quality organic vegetables and fruit, they will sell.  That is not only the anecdotal experience of small growers but also the message coming from the buyers at multiple levels.  Put Irish-grown organic produce on the shelves and it will sell.<\/p><p> Some of our growers are involved in the EIP project to which Ms Westbrook alluded earlier.  That has been a phenomenal success in improving on-farm efficiencies and supplying more product into the sector.  Collectively, we just need to see some support.  As I outlined, many OGI members are not in receipt of any payment, so something like the small farmers scheme, which is adopted in other EU countries, may be an option.  We need support right throughout the supply chain, from training and research to marketing opportunities.<\/p><p> Thank you for the opportunity to speak, Chairperson.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021061500002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Grace Maher","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":97,"content":"<p>Ms Maher has covered most of what I was going to say.  To come back on what Senator Boyhan said, it is no wonder Ireland ranks second lowest in Europe for organic farming when the research into organic crop production is being done by the groups themselves and there is no funding for it.  No supports are being given in order that potential suppliers can grow.  I wonder about the research end of this.  Ms Maher mentioned the small farmers scheme in place in 15 other countries under the CAP.  Have the witnesses priced an overall package?  How much would it cost a government to get involved in this?  I imagine that in the overall scheme of things it would be very little money, but the potential to grow that sector could be huge.

That number has grown from 300 in 2017, so we have seen a 30% growth in the number of organic growers coming into the sector.  While overall there is not a lot of movement, there certainly is the will from growers to get involved in the sector because they see it as a growing sector.

We are talking to various parties about getting more involved.  We see that an awful lot of research institutes are looking more towards researching organic here in Ireland because the funding will be made available through the Horizon funding stream.  An awful lot more are coming on board and they are certainly needed.  We can do an awful lot here.  Interestingly, in some of our promotional videos and other things we did we promoted farmers growing heritage wheat and so on in the likes of the Monaghan and Cavan area.  It is interesting that apparently people were told over many generations that they could not grow cereals there.  Well, they can, they have done a really good job and it is a fantastic product.  There is a massive amount of opportunity here to add value to output in some cases.  The beef and lamb sector is a huge one for us, but there are also an awful lot of opportunities for cereal growers, be it for their own livestock or for the bakery and distillery industries.

We really need to understand how much CAP money will be used to develop organic farmland and to maximise the environmental performance organic farmers can deliver.  Ms Westbrook and Ms Maher have mentioned the research.  Then we need to look at marketing.  Bord Bia does some really good stuff for the agriculture sector overall.  There are a number of interesting initiatives for organic but we need a coherent strategy behind them.  It can no longer be a case of initiatives here and there.  We need a clear strategy as to how Bord Bia will push organics market development further in Ireland.  Also, we need to draw down the funds that are available.  Looking at the promotional programming, not a single amount of the money drawn down in Ireland went to organics, whereas in Denmark and Austria, for example, at least a third of that money went specifically to the organic sector.  It is really about looking at the national funds and the EU funds and having a clear package that we can link.  We can have nice words and action plans and strategies, but if there is not money behind them, we will not reach the 7% target, or even 12% and beyond.  We really need to capitalise.

I remind the committee that, apart from me and members of the committee secretariat, all members and witnesses are required to participate remotely and all members are required to participate from within the precincts of the Leinster House complex only.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Stanton and Senators Gavan and Ahearn.<\/p> <p>  Today we will give consideration to the general scheme of the companies (small company administrative rescue process) Bill 2021.  Recently, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Robert Troy, wrote to the Business Committee seeking an exemption from the normal pre-legislative scrutiny requirements in light of the urgency of getting this Bill enacted.  This is the third time the Department has requested an exemption from normal pre-legislative scrutiny requirements from us, and these are not requests to which I agree or ask the committee to agree lightly.  Pre-legislative scrutiny is an essential part of our role as legislators.  Since the beginning of the year our committee has been very busy and has agreed to pre-legislative scrutiny on the corporate enforcement authority Bill and the sale of tickets Bill, since enacted, and we are to complete pre-legislative scrutiny of the competition Bill.<\/p> <p>  The general scheme we will be discussing today provides for a rescue mechanism for small and microbusinesses facing financial and trading difficulties exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic, with the aim of preventing the closure of otherwise viable companies and providing them with the necessary breathing room to continue in operation and trade their way out of present difficulties.  The Minister of State's request to the Business Committee for a waiver of pre-legislative consideration has been passed on to this committee for our observations.  Following today's meeting we are required to communicate these decisions to the Business Committee for it to decide on the application for a waiver.  As the committee will know, we had been scheduled to commence today's meeting at 9.30 a.m. with the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Troy.  Subsequently, however, the Minister of State was unable to attend.  A letter to this effect has been circulated to members explaining his reasons.  In his place, we are delighted to welcome the Minister of State, Deputy English, who indicated that he would be available from 9.45 a.m., hence the later start time for today's meeting.  I am pleased to welcome the Minister of State to brief the committee on the general scheme and on the case for a waiver of pre-legislative scrutiny.<\/p> <p>  Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses regarding references witnesses make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, today's witnesses, as I said, will give their evidence remotely from a place outside of the parliamentary precincts and, as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.<\/p><p> The opening statement of the Minister of State, Deputy English, has been circulated to members, as has a letter to the Business Committee from the Minister of State, Deputy Robert Troy.  To commence our consideration of this matter, I now invite the Minister of State, Deputy Damien English, to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021061500002#A00200","speaker":"1509","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":113,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair for the introduction and for facilitating the time change to allow me to participate in the place of the Minister of State, Deputy Troy.  I thank the committee for the invitation to discuss the forthcoming Bill to amend the Companies Act 2014 and to provide for a small company administrative rescue process.  I am joined online by two officials from my Department, Ms Fiona O&rsquo;Dea and Ms Tara Keane.  They are happy to take any questions if I am unable to answer them.  After today's discussion, we will be happy to engage with the committee over the coming weeks.  We hope to finalise work on the Bill and bring it to Cabinet on 22 June or the following week.  We will then bring the legislation through the Houses and discuss it with the select committee.<\/p><p>The companies (small company administrative rescue process and miscellaneous provisions) Bill is included as a legislative priority on the Government&rsquo;s legislation programme for the summer session.  It delivers on a programme for Government commitment to review the Companies Act to simplify and improve examinership laws in response to the Covid-19 crisis and follows on foot of proposals by the Company Law Review Group, CLRG, in response to the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s request that it examine the issue of corporate rescue specifically for small companies and advise as to how such a process might be put in place.  I know this is an issue the committee has discussed several times and members have sought to find a simplified and less costly process to address the matter.  <\/p><p>On 8 July 2020, the T&aacute;naiste requested that the CLRG examine the issue of rescue for the sector.  Membership of the CLRG, which is a statutory body, is wide and representative of a broad range of stakeholder experts, making it uniquely well-positioned to advise on company law.  It has served us well in this space before.  The CLRG submitted its report in October 2020 and recommended a rescue process for small companies, which would be stand-alone and separate from the examinership process, but which would mirror key elements of the examinership legislation.  Since receipt of that report, the Department has worked closely with the Office of the Attorney General in developing the CLRG&rsquo;s advice from both an operational and policy perspective.  Throughout this process, we have also had strong engagement with the Revenue Commissioners, the Departments of Social Protection and Justice and other relevant stakeholders.  In addition, my Department launched a public consultation earlier this year to inform development of the general scheme.  The Minister of State, Deputy Troy, notified this committee of the consultation and invited it to make submissions.  An overview of all submissions made, the responses to them and the reasoning underpinning those responses is available in a report on the Department&rsquo;s website. <\/p><p>In overall terms, the Department has engaged in a process which has been transparent and accessible and has involved substantial submissions from representative bodies for employers and employees across all sectors and industry professionals in the field of company law and insolvency.  As a consequence, I am pleased to note that the general scheme of the Bill has met with a generally positive response from industry and professionals in the field.  I ask the joint committee, in considering our request for a waiver of pre-legislative scrutiny, to bear in mind the role of the CLRG in developing the Bill and the level of engagement with stakeholders in the public consultation.<\/p><p>As members will know, the primary purpose of the Bill is to provide for a small company administrative rescue process, one that can assist viable<i><\/i>small and micro-size companies to remain in business, as the economy recovers and supports are phased out, and to try to protect as many jobs as possible.  <\/p><p>We know from years of experience that examinership works.  It saves both companies and employment.  It is internationally recognised and is a successful tool for restructuring, in its own right.  However, examinership is overseen by the court from beginning to end.  For this reason, it can be an expensive undertaking and, thus, potentially out of reach for the average small company, whether that be a local restaurant, hairdresser or other similar businesses.  The small company administrative rescue process is designed to reduce those costs insofar as possible and provide access to an affordable and much-needed avenue of rescue and recovery for small companies in difficulty.  It has limited court involvement where creditors are engaged in the process and positively disposed to a rescue plan.  However, the option for court involvement remains, if there is no agreement by the creditors.  This is an important part of the process.  <\/p><p>The Bill replicates key provisions of the examinership model in an administrative context.  While it provides for certain novel concepts, it does so by building on a tried and tested framework, with the benefit of years of experience and jurisprudence.  The proposals are founded on an existing bedrock of well-understood and well-respected law and they deliver an accessible, fair and balanced process for the broad range of stakeholders impacted by corporate rescue. <\/p><p>The introduction of this legislation, or any new legislation, is not without risk.  For this reason, officials in my Department have engaged extensively with the Office of the Attorney General to ensure the process is constitutionally robust and meets the required standards of procedural fairness.  Therefore, the process incorporates robust safeguards, including court oversight, where appropriate.  It strikes a fair balance between the needs of the company and its creditors.<\/p><p>The main provisions of the Bill can be broadly summarised as follows.  The Bill is designed to help small and micro companies, as defined by the Companies Act 2014, which constitute approximately 98% of companies in Ireland.  The rescue process is commenced by resolution of directors, rather than by application to the court.  It is concluded within a shorter period than examinership.  It is overseen and implemented by a qualified insolvency practitioner, to whom we refer in the context of the Bill as &ldquo;process advisor&rdquo;.  The rescue plan can be passed by a majority of creditors.  The Bill provides for the format of cross-class cram-down of debts, designed to reduce costs.  The process does not require an application to court in circumstances where no creditor objects to the plan.  Where creditors do object to the rescue plan, the courts will then have a role in adjudicating the matter, as is currently the case in examinership.  The Bill also incorporates safeguards against, and penalties for, irresponsible or dishonest director behaviour. <\/p><p>On foot of recommendations made by the CLRG in its first phase of work in the area of employees' rights as creditors during a liquidation and taking into consideration the Irish Congress of Trade Unions&rsquo;s, ICTU, minority report to the CLRG report, the Bill also enables the Companies Act 2014 to provide for a number of actions that can be addressed in the short term to improve the quality and circulation of information to employees as creditors.  In that regard, I am also happy to engage with the committee on the overall plan of action that we discussed previously, as it is not fully dealt with in this legislation.  I will also be happy to engage with the committee on its report on this area.<\/p><p>These amendments feature in the plan of action the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, and I published last week.  It contains a range of commitments, including amendments to employment law and company law, to enhance protections and ensure transparency for employees in insolvencies. <\/p><p>As we emerge from a sustained period of lockdown, and as Government supports for businesses are gradually phased out, this is a Bill of the utmost importance and urgency.  We are all aware of the enormous pressure business owners currently face in terms of not only their immediate liquidity, but also the sustainability of their businesses into the future.  This is particularly true of small and micro companies, which employ almost 800,000 workers.  Some 78% of small and micro companies operate in sectors that have been particularly challenged by the pandemic, such as retail, hospitality and the service industry.  The contributions these companies make to our economy cannot be understated.  They will be key to our country&rsquo;s economic recovery, which we want to be jobs led.  It is for this reason that the Government is so committed to providing a genuine, alternative rescue framework for these companies.<\/p><p>This Bill is an integral part of Government&rsquo;s response to the economic impact of the pandemic.  It provides for a rescue framework for small and micro companies, many of which have been significantly challenged by Covid-19.  Our response to the crisis has proven successful in mitigating the immediate impact of the pandemic on these companies, so far.  However, as the economy reopens, we must have an appropriate regulatory response, not simply planned but actually in place and available to small businesses.  It should support fundamentally viable companies to continue to trade and get themselves back on their feet, and to preserve employment.  It is our responsibility to ensure that this essential rescue process is implemented in time to make a difference to these companies.  To that end, I ask the joint committee to approve a waiver of pre-legislative scrutiny, so that we may achieve enactment of this important legislation before the summer recess. <\/p><p>As I said, my officials and I are happy to answer members' questions and provide greater detail on the provisions of the Bill.  We are also available after the meeting to go through any finer points if members want or need more time on this.  We would like to have the support of the committee on the journey of this necessary legislation.  As I said, we hope to bring it through Cabinet next week or the week after in order that we can begin the formal process in the Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021061500002#B00200","speaker":"1505"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":114,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

How much quicker is it anticipated that it will be in comparison to the current process?  This leads to another question and if it is all right, I will take the two of them together.  It is about the cost of it.  Does the Minister of State have an estimated cost of the process at this point in the proceedings?<\/p><p> Head 52 relates to the costs and remuneration of process advisers.  It indicates that they will use the resources of the company, but they might not exist.  We are talking about small businesses, so we are not talking about places that would be massively overstaffed with administration and backroom staff.  In the event that it is not there or that it is not forthcoming for whatever reason, could that lead to a situation whereby costs will escalate in a way that would not be desirable?  Perhaps the Minister of State will respond to those questions first.

I totally accept the concerns about not having pre-legislative scrutiny.  I accept that is a process she would not like to see continue.  I know we will avoid it as much as we possibly can.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the other legislation, I hope to have something for the Deputy in the coming week or two.  As per my commitment, as soon as I have it, I will share it with everybody, and we will tease it out.  I know there has been some engagement with our officials on that piece as well and it can continue because we want to have everybody on board with it is as much as we possibly can.<\/p> <p>  The rough timeline we expect is that once a process adviser is appointed, he or she has up to 49 days to produce a rescue plan.  That is the target.  In terms of how long the process will take thereafter, it depends on the rescue plan and what is put in place in that regard.  My understanding is that there is no official end time on the process, but the aim is to save companies that are viable and can be protected and to put in place a plan, by agreement, within 49 days.<\/p> <p>  It is hard to clarify the exact costs that will be involved.  At the moment we think the costs of examinership are an issue and a barrier to the process.  They are in the region of &euro;80,000 to &euro;120,000 for the normal examinership process.  What we expect for this process is somewhere between &euro;20,000 and &euro;50,000.  Naturally, if there is full agreement and everyone is on board, there is a quick resolution and a plan is put in place quickly, it could be a lot less.  That is roughly what we expect if creditors are in agreement and there is no need to involve the courts in the process.  That is based on experience and getting feedback, but I cannot give any guarantees on that.  What we hope to do is to put in place a cheaper model if everybody plays his or her part to reduce the costs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021061500002#C00200","speaker":"1505"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":118,"content":"<p>That would involve both the co-operation and the staff being available at that point.

I know there are constitutional issues that the Minister of State has referenced in regard to property rights, and they are difficult to circumvent.  There are situations where the debts are effectively strangling a company that might otherwise have a very sound business model and be a very sound business but, due to the commercial rents and the lack of forbearance on the part of commercial landlords, they are being driven into debt and driven towards this process.

Where this comes in with regard to leases is that, in examinership, the repudiation clauses are frequently used to renegotiate rents and other onerous contracts.  It is actually very unusual for it to end up in court because it provides the stick with which one can encourage those negotiations and mutual reorganisation of the contract.

We hope a majority would buy into this process, as opposed to objecting to it or going into the courts process.  I understand the point the Senator is making, that is, that one individual, large creditor could have an impact on the overall process.

I warmly welcome this and believe it is timely and much-needed.  I have no doubt there are many companies which are carrying burdens and that need restructuring but, underlying that, they are viable companies.<\/p> <p>  It goes back to the cost of access.  The reason we have only about one fifth of the access to examinership that there is in the UK is the very high cost in Ireland associated with going to court.  I know the role of the court has been reduced but, on the choice of a requirement for qualification as a liquidator, I would be interested to know why that was required and whether it creates a very high entry barrier for small companies looking to use this procedure.<\/p> <p>  We get the impression that liquidators are a small group of people and they can almost name their price and, as I understand it, their bill is the first that has to be paid from any resolution.  On that element, I would be interested to know why there cannot be a little bit more relaxation in regard to the type of person.  Undoubtedly, they need to be capable of assessing and ensuring that no creditor is unfairly prejudiced, and all the rest of it.<\/p> <p>  Second, I want to understand the threshold for moving ahead with the proposal.  Is it that it includes over half of the creditors by value?  I know that, obviously, one has to have the power, and I think the term used is to \"cram down\", although in a fair way, but we cannot let one hold up the overall.  How is the threshold decided as to when there are enough creditors on board for the process to proceed, albeit that an objection can still be raised?<\/p><p>The speed issue, which Deputy O'Reilly raised, will continue to be a concern.  If this runs on for a long time, it will be more difficult and onerous.  Will the Minister of State indicate where he thinks the quicker process has been achieved?<\/p><p> Many companies, having come through this process, will be short of capital.  There is a risk that viable businesses will become zombie companies in that they cannot get access to new capital.  One of the problems with examinership has traditionally been the lack of finance providers willing to take on companies that have been established as financially viable following restructuring.  How does the Government intend to approach that?  Certain categories of investor get support from the Exchequer in one form or another.  For companies coming through this process, will there be a need to establish access to capital?  Some of the vehicles the Government has put in place may be suited, but in some cases there may be a need for new equity.  Will that be part of this process?  Could the process involve a requirement to have new equity come in and to identify its sources?  I am trying to better understand how one would get a company that is temporarily struggling to return to a viable growth path.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021061500002#D01400","speaker":"1549","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":146,"content":"<p>I will deal with a couple of the issues the Deputy raised Ms Keane will address the issue of the register.

It is generally their legacy debts that are the difficulty.  The process of putting the rescue plan in place should deal with ongoing financial costs and highlight where they are part of the plan or access to finance is key to making the plan.  Often, companies in this position have a bright future from a trading point of view if they have time to deal with legacy debts.

We would be willing to review the credit guarantee and proposals brought through the system with the approval of the House of the Oireachtas.  They are working extremely well and de-risk financial providers of those loans, be they credit unions, mainstream banks or others.  They are encouraged to back sustainable businesses because the State and the EU take on some of the risk.<\/p> <p>  The credit guarantees in place for this and next year, which we have extended, should be sufficient but we can track that and monitor any judgments.  The Credit Review Office will deal with refusals of credit.  We can track that as well.  They are measures in place now that were not in place after the last financial crisis and which would have been of great benefit back then.  Structures are in place but we will have an ongoing review of that and track that.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy referred to equity as opposed to borrowing finance.  The SME task force highlighted this as an issue we need to look at to encourage equity stakes in SME communities and microbusinesses.  The budget will look at that but there are no proposed changes linked to this legislation.  The point is well made and I will track that.<\/p> <p>  In this case, the threshold for proceeding with a proposal is a majority of creditors by value.  That is different to an examinership, which is a majority by value and number.  That should result in greater acceptance of the plans. <\/p> <p>  On the necessity to qualify as a liquidator, it is important that the person who will become process adviser has the qualifications to do the job.  The Deputy made the point that it should not be cost prohibitive.  A number of people are qualified to do it and it is linked in the legislation.  Ms Keane may wish to speak on the specific qualifications but my understanding is that the bar is not especially high but not everybody concentrates on this business.  Once this process is in place, we may see a number of companies use it that have not been able to use examinership processes in the past.  More people might make themselves available as process advisers.<\/p> <p>  The question the Deputy will probably ask next is what are the likely numbers.  We do not know.  The Deputy and many others have made the case strongly that this legislation needs to be put in place and we share that view.  We have no idea what the numbers will be like because Government supports, with the backing of the full Houses of the Oireachtas, have kept those businesses alive to this stage.  Only in the recovery stage will we find out what businesses are in a position to continue.

One has to be qualified as a liquidator, which means it is open to members of an accountancy body, qualified solicitors, members of one of the other professional bodies regulated by the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority, IASSA, suitably qualified people from other member states and people with significant experience of insolvency proceedings under a grandfathering provision.  There is a good pool of people from which to choose.  However, I take the Deputy's point that there will be a cost involved.  We felt it was important for the overall robustness of the process that a specialist person be in place to advise the company.  Notwithstanding that this applies to micro and small companies, they may have tricky affairs which need to be considered.  It speaks to the overall robustness and protection of creditors if we ensure someone suitably qualified does that, particularly in circumstances where we have removed court supervision.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the point about overall time saving.  Currently, examinerships can run for up to 150 days, on the basis of temporary amendments being made under the Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Covid-19) Act.  However, they typically last 100 days.  This process is expected to conclude in 70 days, which is subject to getting a rescue plan by day 49 and having a  21-day cooling-off period.

There are two issues.  Leasing, I believe, is dealt with under head 48 in relation to contracts.  There is a process to have a conversation with the landlord.  There are two issues.  Separate from this legislation, we have had an ongoing conversation with the business community on potential legacy debts from rent and arrears.  Since the start of the pandemic, the Government, through the Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, and many others have requested that all landlords and others involved in leasing, be they institutional landlords or private landlords, engage with their tenants to try to find a way through this.  We have put in place a voluntary code of conduct to try to enable this process.  It has been of assistance in many cases.  My Department is doing work on this in conjunction with the Department of Finance to determine whether we need to assist more.  An arbitration model that has worked well in other countries is being suggested by some but, in the majority of leasing contracts here, an arbitration process is already identified.  Therefore, we are not convinced about what the State could add to the process.<\/p> <p>  Under the process in the proposed legislation, there is an opportunity for the process adviser to work with all creditors, engage and put in place a rescue plan, which would involve dealing with rents, leases and ongoing costs.  There is an opportunity to repudiate contracts and to try to deal with this issue.  What the Deputy is talking about is a rescue plan in this regard.  As he knows, various supports have been provided by the State on behalf of the taxpayer to the businesses in question.  We did not stipulate which costs or bills businesses would pay.  That is a decision every business has to make for itself.  In most cases of which we are aware, people have sat down with all their providers of services, including in respect of properties, and worked out a payment plan.  That is what we would encourage in this regard.  Those conversations have gone on.  Admittedly, there are still some cases that are not dealt with.  Naturally, we do not want legacy debts to drag a business down.  We will continue to engage and work on this. <\/p> <p>  The supports announced under the economic recovery plan will assist businesses with their ongoing costs, certainly their wage costs.  The Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, is continuing.  The new business resumption support scheme, BRSS, payment, to be introduced in September, will assist companies that have still not reached a turnover allowing them to pay their bills.  The small business assistance scheme for Covid, SBASC, is in operation and there are various other arrangements.  I accept they are not all sufficient to replace lost turnover and profits but they are certainly of assistance in paying some of the bills.<\/p> <p>  With regard to Revenue, warehousing was mentioned specifically.  As the Deputy knows, the option to warehouse debts in this regard was extended beyond August of this year until the end of this year.  For all of 2022, there will be no interest charged on the warehouse debt but the charge will kick in thereafter, in 2023.  Therefore, one has a full 12 months, after which Revenue will engage on plans for repayment over a suitable period.  Revenue has been asked to engage in a pro-business manner.  It is engaging in this way and has responded quite well over the past year.<\/p> <p>  With regard to this legislation, both the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Protection are excludable in respect of the start of this process.  In most cases, the Revenue Commissioners have engaged in the examinership process and have been supportive of plans but in some cases, based on historical dealings with a company or some of its directors, they may opt not to do so to protect the State.  That is their job.  In general, however, the Revenue Commissioners have been quite supportive of the process.  Our indications are that they and the Department of Social Protection will continue to be supportive under the legislation under discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021061500002#F00200","speaker":"1505"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":155,"content":"<p>The Revenue Commissioners, by default, are included in the rescue plan but they have the option to remove themselves based on confined statutory grounds.

That does not happen here; they do not have that opportunity so we have included the measure as a safeguard to protect moneys owed to the Irish people.  We have drawn the section from the Personal Insolvency Act 2012, which also provides for the Revenue Commissioners to be excludable.  The difference, however, is that we have said they can have the option to exclude themselves only on statutory grounds, as opposed to having a carte blanche to exclude themselves.

All of that is going to add to the cost.  I am conscious of what Deputy Shanahan was saying in that we are talking about small companies.

If it is not there, consideration should be given to ensuring that this cannot happen unnecessarily.  I understand it is tricky because we must balance that with the fact that the process advisers probably will need some additional help.

My focus, as an economist interested in agricultural policy, is how to incentivise the changes that will be necessary to meet this target.  We are all aware that agricultural emissions make up 35% of total territorial emissions, excluding emissions from the land use, land-use change, and forestry, LULUCF, sector.  Agricultural emissions were 21.2 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, MtCO2e, in 2019, which is the latest year for which we have data, compared with 19.3 MtCO2e in 1990 and the low point of 18.5 MtCO2e in 2011.  The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, expects emissions to further increase by 2.5% by 2030 compared with 2019 levels if we continue with existing measures.  Agricultural emissions are going in the wrong direction.<\/p> <p>  At the same time, there are significant net emissions from the LULUCF sector, mainly from drained organic soils and wetlands, of around 8 MtCO2e, only partially offset by net removals by the forest sector and harvested wood products of 4.5 MtCO2e.  Agricultural emissions consist almost entirely of methane and nitrous oxide, driven mainly by ruminant animal numbers, manure management and the use of chemical nitrogen.  There are some technical and management solutions available and in use that can help to reduce use of chemical nitrogen and emissions of nitrous oxide, but their uptake needs to be greatly accelerated.  At this point in time, there are few technical or management options available to farmers to reduce methane emissions, which implies that a reduction in animal numbers will be necessary to meet the 51% target.  This can be achieved by incentivising farmers to switch grassland to alternative land uses, or by encouraging more extensive systems of production on remaining grassland.<\/p> <p>  When designing its strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill 2021 requires that the Government take account of the special economic and social role of agriculture, including with regard to the distinct characteristics of biogenic methane.  Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas and its concentration in the atmosphere must be reduced if we are to achieve the Paris Agreement&rsquo;s temperature targets.  However, it does not have to be reduced to zero.  Rising methane emissions add significantly to global warming.  By 2019, methane emissions in Ireland had risen by 17% from their lowest recent point in 2011.  Continued emissions of methane at a broadly stable level of around 3% reduction per decade would not add to global warming, although they would sustain warming that has already occurred.  Sustained reductions in methane emissions reverse global warming and effectively cool the planet from existing levels, so reducing methane emissions represents an important mitigation opportunity. <\/p> <p>  Against this background, I have three messages for the committee.  First, we need to invest in measuring and monitoring farm level emissions and removals.  All farmers need to know what their greenhouse gas emissions are and how these are affected when they change their farm output and farming practices.  Every member of this committee will be aware that if something cannot be measured, it cannot be improved.  Second, we need to catch up and invest properly in innovation that addresses the climate challenge in agriculture.  Members do not need to be reminded of the billions of euro being invested in the development of alternative proteins by private equity funds at the present time.<\/p><p> We need to focus innovation in three directions.  Our efforts to improve the sustainability of ruminant grass-based agriculture are puny by comparison and relatively recent.  There is great potential in learning how to manage microbes in the rumen, in manure and in the soil to minimise emissions.  Second, we must invest much more in nature-based solutions to understand the contribution our soils, wetlands and peatlands as well as agroforestry, hedgerows and forests can make to offset agricultural emissions.  We have to invest much more in potential alternative land uses that are suited to Irish agri-ecological conditions and attractive to farmers.  Existing efforts looking at the potential for renewable energy and biomass, as well as conventional and unconventional land uses, have to be stepped up.<\/p><p> Third, measurement and innovation alone will not get us to where we need to be unless we incentivise action across tens of thousands of farms.  This will only happen if we put a price on emissions and removals and pay for performance.  We know that farmers respond to incentives.  The European Commission in its farm to fork strategy has introduced the idea of carbon farming as a new business model for farmers.  The intention is to create direct incentives for land managers and farmers to increase and protect carbon sinks in the land sector.  A similar model should also be applied to agricultural emissions consisting of methane and nitrous oxide.<\/p><p> Considerable funding can be made available for climate action through the new Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, strategic plan, and the Government has earmarked a further &euro;1.5 billion in proceeds from the carbon tax to encourage and incentivise farmers to farm in a greener and more sustainable way.  Previous agri-environment climate schemes such as the green, low-carbon, agri-environment scheme, GLAS, may have had benefits for biodiversity, but have had no impact on emissions reduction.  We also need innovation in policy design.  We must have measures that explicitly focus on reducing the absolute level of net emissions, accompanied by reduction targets, not the rather diffuse measures that have characterised climate action in agriculture to date.  One could imagine, for example, inviting bids, using a reverse auction process, from groups of farmers who commit to reducing emissions below a baseline level, whether through stock reduction, nature-based offsets or changes in land use.  Once farm-level greenhouse gas budgets are rolled out to most farms, one could envisage introducing a cap-and-trade system where an overall emissions ceiling would be set for Irish agriculture and farms could trade emissions permits among themselves.  Perverse subsidies such as the VAT exemption for fertilisers and the double income tax relief on the use of agricultural diesel should be removed and the savings recycled to promote more climate-friendly farming.<\/p><p> To incentivise agriculture to step up and address the climate crisis requires new and innovative approaches.  Business as usual is no longer an option.  I look forward to any questions that members of the committee may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021061500002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Alan Matthews","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":183,"content":"<p>Thank you, Professor Matthews.

I am the policy co-ordinator of Stop Climate Chaos, which is an advocacy coalition for faster and fairer climate action.  We represent faith-based, development, environmental, social justice and community organisations throughout Ireland.  We welcome the initiative of the committee to discuss the role of agriculture in climate action.  As Professor Matthews highlighted, agriculture is responsible for 35% of Ireland&rsquo;s annual greenhouse gas emissions and is the largest sectoral contributor to Ireland&rsquo;s overall climate impact.<\/p> <p>  The EPA stated in its most recent emission projection reports that emissions from the sector are increasing and that they are driven by increasing dairy cattle numbers and associated nitrogen inputs.  The dairy sector currently contributes half of all of Ireland&rsquo;s agricultural greenhouse gas emissions and has been driving the increase in agricultural emissions in recent years.  Recent Central Statistics Office, CSO, data show that there was a 41% increase in the number of dairy cows between 2010 and 2019, making Ireland an outlier in comparison to other EU member states.  We find it worrying to note that the Teagasc dairy strategy to 2027 envisages yet further growth in herd numbers, a goal that is totally incompatible with climate policy.  If current projections for the sector are realised in terms of animal numbers and milk and beef output, there will be an inevitable increase in absolute greenhouse gas emissions, regardless of whether on-farm efficiencies are implemented.<\/p> <p>  On-farm efficiency measures do not in themselves reduce total climate impacts.  Total absolute emissions of greenhouse gases and nitrate-ammonia impacts must be reduced, which is almost impossible to envisage without a reduction in livestock numbers.  However, reliance on the uptake of voluntary efficiency measures that were drawn up by Teagasc and in the more recent Ag Climatise roadmap, which was published by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine at the end of 2020, fails to adequately address the underlying drivers of emissions: cattle numbers and nitrogen inputs in the form of fertilisers and animal feed.  The Ag Climatise roadmap is not consistent with the programme for Government commitment to reduce emissions by on average 7% per annum or 51% by 2030, as the strategy assumes a stabilisation as opposed to an absolute reduction of methane emissions by 2030.<\/p> <p>  Climate action policies for the agricultural sector have to date been based on assumptions about farmers' responses to theoretical cost savings from voluntary mitigation and efficiency measures, as promoted by Teagasc.  However, even if fully implemented, these measures will not address the multiple environmental impacts of the sector, nor can they be scaled up quickly enough to deliver the required emissions reductions in a timely fashion.  This approach does not consider the effect of policies to expand agricultural output or consider rebound and interaction effects, and is thus somewhat skewed towards business as usual.  Without an overarching mitigation policy, measures are merely cost savings for farming that rebound to increase emissions, as we have seen over the past decade.  Moreover, the focus on cost efficiency falsely assumes that if farms are efficient in the sense of maximising outputs per unit of input in the form of feed and fertiliser, they are environmentally sustainable.  In fact, the only important measure of climate and air pollution action is absolute, instead of relative, annual emissions as reported in the national inventory of greenhouse gas emissions that is published annually by the EPA.  Therefore, efficiency measures in the absence of legally binding targets or a cap are a distraction.  Agricultural emissions of methane, nitrous oxide and ammonia have been increasing steadily since 2011 due to dairy expansion and greatly increased nitrogen inputs, with only a minimal reduction in beef cattle numbers.<\/p> <p>  Requiring herd reductions from beef farmers will not by itself address the water and biodiversity impacts from the dairy sector that we highlighted in our report, jointly published with the environmental pillar and the Sustainable Water Network, SWAN.  We concluded that these reductions could even lead to rebound effects as more land becomes available for silage production for dairy cows.  The Climate Change Advisory Council undertook a special review of agriculture, forestry and land use in 2019, but assumed in its scenarios that no herd reductions would take place in the dairy sector.  Thus it ignored the growing ecological burden of intensive dairy farming in many areas of the country.  Farmers must be supported with policies that provide both stable incomes through diversification and that facilitate reduced stocking rates with decreased inputs.<\/p> <p>  Without substantial and sustained reductions in agricultural methane over the next decade, it will not be possible to meet current national and EU climate targets.  It is not expected that agricultural emissions should fall as fast as emissions in other sectors of the economy over the next decade.  It is expected, however, that there must be substantial year-on-year reductions in absolute emissions from agriculture.  For the Government to allow one economic sector in society, a sector that represents one third of Ireland&rsquo;s emissions, to simply continue business as usual and to insist that the rest of the economy reduce its emissions by two thirds to achieve the overall target for 2030 is highly unfair and impractical.  Dr. Paul Deane of University College Cork, UCC, has estimated that if agriculture only achieved 10% emissions reductions, the buildings, energy and transport sectors would have to do more than 70%.  Steadily and permanently reducing agricultural methane in the near term, with annual reductions in the order of 3% to 5% from 2022 to 2030, will be necessary to limit overshoot of Ireland&rsquo;s national \"fair share\" of the remaining global carbon budget that is aligned with meeting the Paris Agreement commitments.<\/p> <p>  Policies that support carbon sequestration, although highly important for carbon storage in trees, soils, hedgerows and wetlands, are neither reliable nor permanent methods to offset greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture or fossil fuel combustion.<\/p><p>Furthermore, biomethane production at a large scale involves risks, uncertainties and high costs.<\/p><p> Changing the types and quantities of foods we consume could also have a significant impact on emission reductions.  Shifting diets in line with health recommendations would have the positive benefit of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and freeing up land for other uses.  However, it needs to be acknowledged that while there is potential for emissions reductions from a shift towards plant-based diets among Irish consumers, a reduction in the consumption of animal-sourced food in Ireland is unlikely to have a significant impact on Ireland's total agricultural greenhouse gas emissions.  This is because most agricultural commodities are produced for export markets.  For this reason, the Government, in its approach to agriculture and food production, must address the total impacts of all food production in Ireland on a territorial basis regardless of where the food is eventually consumed.<\/p><p> We have a series of recommendations in our report and I will highlight a few of them here for the committee.  The first is that we recommend that the Government needs to publish a revised roadmap for agricultural emissions reductions that sets out a timescale to achieve, at a minimum, compliance with EU and national law.  We recommend that the Government put in place a declining cap on total national reactive nitrogen and phosphorus usage; consult with stakeholders and implement measures based on international best practice to limit and reverse recent expansion in the dairy sector to bring sectoral greenhouse gas emissions back to 2011 levels by 2025 or as soon as feasible thereafter, with immediate priority given to farms in sensitive catchment areas; and put in place compensatory measures to facilitate and incentivise herd reductions and diversification in the beef suckler and finishing sectors.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for the invitation and look forward to taking any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021061500002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Sadhbh O'Neill","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":186,"content":"<p>I thank Ms O'Neill.

There is a much greater reliance there on forestry offsets.<\/p> <p>  At a more regional level, there are some other comparable countries.  Scotland, for example, would not be that far away from Ireland in terms of its share of agricultural emissions and clearly so would the North of Ireland, but at a member state level, we face a fairly unique challenge in terms of agriculture.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021061500002#C01000","nonspeaker":"Professor Alan Matthews"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":195,"content":"<p>My final question for Professor Matthews is a simple question to pose but, perhaps, not so much to answer.

As I say, the two main gases that we are talking about when we talk about agricultural emissions are methane and nitrous oxide.  Certainly, on the nitrous oxide side, there are measures available but they are not being taken up and adopted to the extent necessary.  This is where I suggest that the committee perhaps should look at a little bit at what is necessary to incentivise the change there to encourage greater adoption.<\/p> <p>  In the short term to 2030, reducing methane emissions is really around animal numbers.  Clearly, per animal, dairy cows have a larger emissions footprint than beef animals and that is important to take into account.  We know that many dairy farmers benefit, from, for example, nitrates regulation derogation, and there is potential there.  The nitrates derogations are there to protect water quality but there is potential there to integrate.  We need to look at this issue in a more holistic way to integrate the protection of water with climate action.  There is potential there to ask dairy farmers to do more, if one likes, in terms of reducing absolute emissions.  I absolutely agree with the emphasis that Ms O'Neill put on that aspect.  There is potential to move.

Interestingly, over the past two decades, the Danish Government has been much more proactive in regulating nitrogen pollution and phosphorus pollution.  We have heard about similar examples from the Netherlands.  Over recent decades, it has reduced ammonia and nitrogen emissions by between 15% and 20%.  Interestingly, this is below what is economically optimal for farmers to utilise on their land.  The Netherlands set targets to double organic production by 2020.  I am not sure whether it actually reached that target.  Essentially, it has reduced total nitrogen input since 1990 by 50%.  By comparison, Ireland's nitrogen inputs declined by 20% to 2011 and started to increase again following the abolition of the milk quota.<br\/><br\/>The reason I give this example is to highlight the influence of policy.  Where we have a strong regulatory regime, it is perfectly possible to get these numbers under control but in Ireland we have experienced a much more <i>laissez-faire<\/i>approach to agricultural output.  Not only has it been <i>laissez-faire<\/i>but it has been positively promoted in terms of increasing output under the Food Wise and Food Harvest agrifood strategies.

I agree with Ms O'Neill, who stated that ultimately the emissions are the key measure and we should begin with them.  The nitrates directive was mentioned as an opportunity.  As I understand it, the fourth programme is due to expire at the end of this year.  Is this the moment for Ireland to stop seeking the derogation it has been seeking in respect of the nitrates directive?  Do we need to move away from derogations in respect of this?  It looks as though we have six or seven months to plan for a different approach.<\/p> <p>  Professor Matthews mentioned that we still have perverse incentives to use fertilisers with nitrates.  There are natural sources of nitrates and there are chemical nitrates.  If we were to take very strong action on chemical nitrates, they would seem to be the lower hanging of what are difficult fruit as we look to address natural nitrates.<\/p> <p>  With regard to methane, I was a little concerned that Professor Matthews mentioned the idea that it does not contribute long-term to global warming because it has an incredible impact for a period of ten to 12 years.  That is how long it stays.  This is the ten to 12 year period that is our focus, the period until 2030.  In this context, how imperative is it that we do not increase methane and that we actively reduce it?  It is eating into the window we have.  Some of the longer term changes we might make on climate change may have effect in 20 or 30 years' time but right now we need to look to what we can do in the short term.  In that context, what measures should there be to pause expansion?  Aside from incentivising reduction, which I know is difficult, what measures should there be on pausing expansion of the herd?<\/p> <p>  The idea of incentives was mentioned.  I agree that incentives are the key but I am a little concerned about the idea of the cap-and-trade scheme, as mentioned, and overall emissions.  I am concerned it could end up effectively favouring larger agricultural corporations and those that are capital rich.  This is the danger when we have carbon as a commodity and as an input that people can afford to have in certain contexts.  It could, in fact, lead to further inequality in the farming sector.  In this context, I would appreciate thoughts on how we can have incentives that are about carbon reduction or sequestration but also dovetail with some of the elements that were in the GLAS scheme on good agricultural practice and biodiversity to ensure that we do not talk in units but reward ecological care or guardianship, which I know is something many farmers care about.<\/p> <p>  Ms O'Neill mentioned the idea of more stringent reductions being made later.  If we do not take action in the next five to ten years, how much will it intensify the potential shock to farming at a later point when we have to take more stringent and urgent action?

On the nitrates directive, I refer the Senator to the section in the joint report by the Environmental Pillar, SWAN and Stop Climate Chaos in which we address the multiple drivers and threats to the environment that emanate from the agricultural sector.  We have a whole section devoted to the issue of water quality.<\/p> <p>  If abandoning the derogation will bring us closer to achieving the objectives of the water framework directive, that is what should be done but it should be a decision taken quite carefully.  My understanding, and I am not an expert in water quality, is that derogation farms are, in some sense, more closely supervised than non-derogation farms.  There would be some benefit to the current system if it delivered improvements in water quality.  Unfortunately, as we have seen from EPA reports, this is not happening due to a variety of factors.  We can see from the water quality data that the concentration of water pollution and deteriorating water quality happens in those areas where more intensive dairy farming takes place.  I suggest the Senator makes enquiries of SWAN and the EPA on what the best approach is on the derogation.  What is most important is that we achieve the objectives of the water framework directive, which is to improve all water body qualities and to achieve good water quality status in all of them.  The trends in Ireland are the reverse, unfortunately.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the question of stringent reductions, Deputy Alan Farrell, or perhaps it was Professor Matthews, mentioned New Zealand.  It is interesting to note the Climate Change Commission in New Zealand has just published its report to the government there, setting out its proposed carbon budgets for three periods until 2035, not unlike the periods the climate Bill in Ireland is considering.  What it suggests is that methane emissions need to be reduced quite urgently, by 8% by 2025 and by 17% by 2035.  It is interesting the focus is on near-term action because it recognised exactly this point and the cooling effect of methane reductions.  It also acknowledged that it foresees a reduction in agricultural production - it has come out with this quite explicitly - and that there might need to be a reduction of dairy cattle in particular by 8% by 2030.  If we are using New Zealand as an example of a country similar to Ireland with a similar emissions profile and similar pressures, we need to be heading in a direction that is similar to this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021061500002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Sadhbh O'Neill"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":203,"content":"<p>To take up a couple of the points made by Senator Higgins, my main concern about the nitrates directive is that we should make use of it to address climate action as well as the water issue.  We should think climate when we look at the revision.  It is essentially a stocking rate limitation, and then the derogation allows farmers to exceed it but there are obligations required.<\/p><p>It is a commercially valuable derogation.  It allows more intensive production and, therefore, dairy farmers who avail of the derogation should be asked to do more in respect of climate and water.<\/p><p> I agree with Senator Higgins regarding the methane issue.  I hope she picked up the point that methane reductions are also a very important mitigation opportunity in the near term.  I agree with her on that point.  I did not put in the cap and trade idea as something which would be immediately applicable.  More direct instruments are available to us, such as the CAP and the funding from the carbon tax revenue, that we could use to incentivise change.  However, the key point is to think about what incentivising change means.  At the moment, we pay farmers to produce food.  We pay them for food and, therefore, not surprisingly, that is what they concentrate on doing and they do it very well.<\/p><p> However, no value is given to the other, negative, outputs, such as water pollution or climate pollution in the form of greenhouse gas emissions.  Unless we somehow find a way to put a value on those elements, and it could be a price or a subsidy, which encourages farmers to think about the implications of producing these by-products along with food production there is no reason for farmers to take them into account.  Some of these by-products can be positive, such as biodiversity, which we pay farmers to deliver, but some of them are negative externalities.  There is no incentive now for farmers to take those negative externalities into account.  That is the message I would like to get across.  The instruments to achieve that goal are, of course, something that we can discuss later.<\/p><p> The Senator rightly highlighted the issue of the impact of policies on the distribution of incomes and farm sizes.  My point in that regard is that perhaps we must think about different policies for different objectives.  To the extent that putting a price on emissions is the right way to go, that may result in some tendencies we do not like.  Therefore, we may need a different instrument to try to address this point.  We should not try to do everything through the climate action instrument that we choose.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021061500002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Alan Matthews","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":205,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Matthews.

Farmers took to the streets in protest recently, mostly out of fear of CAP reform but also because of a fear that certain climate obligations will impact them.  Having spoken to and liaised with farmers, they know that business as usual will not suffice and that change is coming.  Farmers just want to ensure that change is done in a way that will allow farming to remain viable and ensure that there is a future for young farmers as well.  That is fair enough.  These sessions will be really helpful in trying to get to the bottom of those aspects.<\/p> <p>  I have four quick questions and they are all for Professor Matthews, simply because these are the issues he touched on.  He spoke about the need to invest in measuring and monitoring greenhouse gas emissions and removals.  If we are talking about severe emissions targets for the agricultural sector, do we not then have to invest in such monitoring and the scientific aspects in that regard first?  I refer to finding out where scientific knowledge stands regarding the removal of greenhouse gases and nature-based solutions before imposing very severe budgets.  Would it be fair to state that because the science in this context is not as advanced as it may be in areas such as energy and transport that there is an argument to be made for agriculture to be given specific treatment?  I pose that as a question and not as an answer.  That brings me to my second question regarding nature-based solutions and carbon capture, specifically in the form of hedgerows and mixed-species swards as opposed to monocultures.  Where does science research stand on that approach now?  I refer in particular to the carbon capture element.  The science concerning biodiversity is very good, as Professor Matthews said.  However, is there established scientific research to suggest that it is possible to bring about real carbon capture and removal in that regard?<\/p> <p>  Turning to reform of the CAP, and payments under Pillar 1, some 25% to 30% of the funding will go to eco-schemes.  I am coming at this aspect from an environmental and biodiversity perspective and in that context it sounds great.  It has been suggested, though, that those payments would be less than those that will be available for just undertaking production.  Surely that situation should be flipped and there should be more of a payment to incentivise and encourage those eco-schemes.  I would like to hear the witness's opinion on that aspect, because at the moment it is looking like there will be less of a payment for the land which will be put into eco-schemes.  Finally, I would like a comment on anaerobic digestion.  For whatever reason, it is something that we do not hear enough about.  I visited an anaerobic digester recently in my constituency in Cork South West and such a process makes sense to me.  Waste from farming, from piggeries and from dairy farms, went into that anaerobic digester and it is possible to power a small village as a result.  In addition, the manure which is leftover after anaerobic digestion has fewer emissions than the unprocessed manure spread on a farm.  I ask Professor Matthews for his comments in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021061500002#E00300","speaker":"1545"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":207,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

The issue here is that we want to ensure that farmers get credit in the national inventories where they make changes to their farming practices.  We can measure animal numbers and tonnes of fertiliser spread relatively easily.  It is more difficult, however, to capture changes in practices.  I refer to examples such as whether tillage farmers have a cover crop in the winter, what they do with their crop residues, whether they leave them in the field or remove them, and if slurry tanks are covered, which serves to reduce emissions of ammonium greenhouse gases.  We need much more information in that regard.  However, I do not think that we need to wait for that kind of information in order to incentivise some of the required changes.<\/p> <p>  Turning to nature-based solutions, it is important to emphasise that the land sector - the so-called land use, land-use change and forestry, LULUCF sector, which is different from the agriculture emissions that we also referred to - is a net emitter in Ireland.  The land sector in Ireland is not a sink for a net removal of carbon because we have been draining our organic soils for decades and the result is that they are now emitting a great deal of the carbon that they originally contained.  Therefore, re-wetting some of those soils is certainly something which was included in the Ag-Climatise plan and we must emphasise that aspect more.  It is not a silver bullet by any manner or means, however.  Ms O'Neill alluded to issues regarding the verification of emissions, the carbon that might be sequestered, the permanence of that sequestration.  Ultimately, we reach a sort of satiation level.  It is, though, a lever which is available to us in the period up to 2030 and we certainly should make use of it.  In overall terms, therefore, land is actually a net emitter in Ireland and that is another aspect where we differ from most other EU member states.<\/p><p>On the CAP and eco-schemes, I will ask the Deputy to come back to me if I have not fully understood the question.  It is clear that farmers receive a basic income support payment at the moment.  On top of that, they get a greening payment.  That payment will disappear but, depending on the outcome of negotiations, somewhere between 25% and 30% of the Pillar 1 direct payments will be allocated to eco-schemes.  That is potentially quite a significant step.  It depends, of course, on how our strategic plan decides to use that funding but it is a considerable addition to the agri-environment climate funding we already have in Pillar 2.  The issue is to ensure that we make better use of that funding in terms of climate action, biodiversity protection, habitat creation and so on than we have done with the schemes to date.  I see it as a positive step and an additional lever we can use to incentivise climate action.<\/p><p> On anaerobic digestion, I agree with the Deputy that it seems a potentially attractive solution for some types of emissions.  My understanding is that it is still an expensive solution, particularly if we just look at it in terms of the cost per emissions reduced.  It may not necessarily suit the small-scale structure of Irish farms.  One hears, for example, about the very large dairy units in California and that is one of the main ways in which they have succeeded in reducing their methane emissions but it will not necessarily apply in an Irish circumstance.  We must try to invest in scaling down this technology so that it can be used.  I am not sure it will ever be viable to use the technology at an individual farm level in an Irish context but perhaps we can use it as a part of co-operative or community-based solutions where a group of farmers might come together and agree to supply such a small-scale digester.  That is a part of the innovation programme that is necessary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021061500002#E00600","nonspeaker":"Professor Alan Matthews","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":211,"content":"<p>I would like to come in on Deputy O'Sullivan's question.  It might be helpful to make a distinction between sequestration and offsetting.  When we discuss sequestration, we are talking about the ability of land, trees, soils, hedgerows and plants to absorb carbon from the atmosphere.  As Professor Matthews highlighted, that is difficult to measure because it changes over time and is affected by weather patterns, climate change and drought.  If trees are chopped down, they are clearly not sequestering carbon any more.  Given that land use is subject to so much change over time, it is difficult to say that when trees, for example, sequester a tonne of carbon, it is permanently offsetting a tonne of fossil carbon that is released into the atmosphere.  For that reason, quite a number of scientists and environmental non-governmental organisations, NGOs, recommend we do not use land-based sequestration to offset any fossil carbon.<\/p> <p>  In addition to that, we have a problem in Ireland because, as Professor Matthews highlighted, we are releasing more carbon than we are sequestering.  Some of the anxieties the Deputy is describing he hears from farmers is around a misunderstanding of that reality.  It is not, in fact, the case that they are sitting on carbon treasure.  The reality is that we are releasing millions of tonnes of carbon from drained soils, bogs and also from a certain amount of deforestation that takes place.<\/p> <p>  The issue is that sequestration policies are beneficial for biodiversity and soil health but are very limited in what they can do for climate mitigation in the short term.  Given the length of time that carbon dioxide stays in the atmosphere, it is vital that we take measures to drastically cut emissions form fossil carbon and, at the same time, protect the carbon sinks that we already have in our soils and forests.<\/p> <p>  Hedgerows and carbon stocks are only roughly estimated.  It is very difficult to calculate them with any degree of accuracy.  We do not have the tools yet to do that.  Of course, as I say, one would need to be measuring it on an ongoing basis because it is subject to change all the time.  What information is there is already included in the Environmental Protection agency, EPA, reports.  These values, it claims, are subject to a high degree of uncertainty.  The EPA also highlights that total hedgerow length has decreased over the past few years in Ireland and there is a widely reported increase in hedgerow cutting, suggesting that there is a net loss of carbon from hedgerows.  <\/p> <p>  In addition to that, the EPA has reminded us time and again that we can only take credit for any changes in land use.  The existing store of carbon is not what farmers will be able to use to establish any credits, if you like, against their emissions.  They would have to increase the sequestration, afforestation and so on for that to be counted in any sense.  It is important that we distinguish between sequestration and the measures we take to draw down more carbon by protecting soils, planting more hedgerows and engaging in more forestry.<\/p> <p>  When it comes to offsetting, we need to be clear that land-based offsets do not reduce emissions.  The problem is establishing permanence and additionality.  There is a lack of measurement tools to capture the changes over time.  The offsetting programmes we have seen emerging around the country through the voluntary carbon markets often use inappropriate metrics based on carbon intensity and not absolute emissions.<\/p> <p>  I will also highlight the fact that if there is a mechanism to establish carbon trading schemes within farms, there would need to be corresponding adjustments to the national inventory to reflect the fact that the credits are now being sold to somebody else, perhaps a company.  They would have to be added back to the national inventory, if that makes sense.  This is the subject of current discussions under the UN convention on Article 6 of the Paris Agreement.  It is highly complicated and will not be a quick fix for Ireland's agricultural challenges.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021061500002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Sadhbh O'Neill"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":212,"content":"<p>I thank both of guests for their presentations.  I wish to ask about the progress that has been made by other EU member states.  I see that overall agricultural emissions among the EU 28 were static over the period from 2005 to 2016.  That suggests there is not much innovation going on in the rest of Europe.  What does that mean for us?  We know Europe is making progress, but not in agriculture.<\/p> <p>  I have an allied question for Professor Matthews.  I ask him to clarify exactly what he is saying about what we need to do on methane.  Perhaps I mistook it, but I took him to say that if we were to reduce methane by 3% per decade, we would stabilise the contribution of methane.  As I understood, if we want to cool, we must reduce by more than 3% per annum.  That is not a very ambitious target over a ten-year period and people have been talking about far higher targets.  Can the professor clarify that?<\/p> <p>  The key issue I want to raise is what scale of change is possible in farming.  Professor Matthews in particular, with his knowledge of a farming background, is best qualified to answer that.  What is practical for us to expect the agricultural sector to achieve, given all the structural issues we know about it?<\/p> <p>  My next question relates to carbon farming.  I am sympathetic to the suggestion Professor Matthews is making that we pay farmers to farm carbon.  It then seemed that Ms O'Neill was pulling the mat from under that idea by saying sequestration cannot be used in that way.  If we want farmers to do things such as re-wetting soil, planting forests or whatever, we cannot expect them to deliver the 3.5 million tonnes by which Professor Matthews is saying our land use is in arrears and only then start paying them.<\/p><p>That is just not practical politics.  As the Kerryman would say, you cannot start from there.  If we buy into carbon farming, which is a good idea, what policy tools would we put in place to implement it?  Farmers should be able to say that in ten years' time, they will be generating X from carbon farming and Y from their livestock, dairy or crops and then, with those two sources of income, they could have a viable family farm.

The Deputy is quite right about the trend in EU emissions.  After an early fall in emissions after 1990, European emissions from agriculture have been more or less stable over the past two decades.  That also has to do with incentives.  As we are all aware, agriculture is covered in the so-called effort sharing sector.  The EU climate architecture distinguishes between the energy sector and large industries, which are covered by the European emissions trading scheme, and the effort sharing sector, which includes buildings, transport, small industry, waste and agriculture.  The land use sector also has its own set of rules and targets.  As agricultural emissions are relatively small across the European Union as a whole - they are only 10% of total emissions - countries could effectively ignore the requirement to reduce agricultural emissions because they could achieve the effort sharing targets by reducing emissions from transport and buildings and so on.  That helps explain why we have not seen more reductions at the European level.  Apart from one or two countries, such as Denmark, there has not been that pressure to reduce agricultural emissions, although that is certainly going to happen now with the more ambitious EU targets for 2030.<\/p> <p>  I thank the Deputy for giving me an opportunity to explain the methane question.  We need to reduce methane.  In Ireland, methane makes up a significant proportion of our national greenhouse gas profile.  Yes, methane has to be reduced.  Otherwise we simply will not meet our 51% reduction target by 2030.  One should remember that methane emissions from Irish agriculture have increased by 17% since 2011, so we have been increasing.  However, if we had a stable level of methane emissions, in broad terms, then reducing methane below that stable level would contribute to cooling.  It would have the same effect as carbon sequestration from a climate point of view.  It would help pull warming gases out of the atmosphere.  I will come to the point about carbon farming in a moment.  We are proposing to pay farmers to sequester carbon in soils and wetlands.  My argument is that, by applying that to agricultural methane, there is a case to be made for paying farmers to reduce those emissions rather than regulating or penalising that reduction.  That is the way I would draw a line from the particular characteristics of methane to its policy implications.  I ask the Deputy to please come back to me if I have not been clear.<\/p> <p>  As regards what scale of change is possible, significant land use changes such as shifting from agriculture to forestry or significantly ramping up renewable energy crops and so on will take time.  We need to start now because in many cases the benefits will accrue to us after 2030, rather than in the immediate future.  We need to start taking action now.  In terms of livestock numbers, I see potential for quite rapid change because on many farms. the income from livestock farming comes almost entirely from transfers under the CAP.  It is possible to safeguard farm incomes or even increase them by also paying, through eco-schemes, for biodiversity benefits, water quality benefits and so on.  It is possible to maintain farm incomes and yet at the same time reduce livestock numbers, if we take into account that there are negative externalities that are not currently being priced adequately into the equation, if at all.  I see potential for quite rapid change there.  <\/p> <p>  On carbon farming, I am aware of the reservations environmental NGOs have about using carbon sequestration to offset fossil fuel emissions and seeing those as a one-to-one relationship.  I am less concerned about that issue in the Irish context because our 51% reduction target is so ambitious that we will be doing everything we can to reduce fossil fuel emissions and that will not be sufficient to get us to 51%, so we also need to make use of the potential for carbon sequestration over this period.  It is worth drawing the committee's attention to the fact that in the recently adopted European climate law, which enshrines the net-zero target for the European Union by 2050 into law, that target is a net one, as is the target of a 55% overall reduction by 2030 compared to 1990.  The Commission is going to do two things that will have a bearing on the credibility of these removals.  Later this year it will be bringing forward a communication on how carbon farming might operate in practice and it will also bring out a regulation looking at the framework for how credits from carbon farming could be used in the overall accounting framework to address the real danger of double-counting, to which Ms O'Neill has alerted us.  These developments at European level have great relevance for us here in Ireland and we need to keep an eye on them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021061500002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Alan Matthews"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":215,"content":"<p>I will briefly respond to the challenge from Deputy Bruton on carbon farming.  I was being critical of carbon offsetting.  Conceptually, we need to be extremely careful about how we deploy that concept and ensure that schemes we put together or claims we make stand up scientifically.  The idea of carbon farming is that it is more of a mechanism to measure the emissions and removals in a very site-specific way.<\/p><p>The same challenges are going to arise in respect of measurement and verification.  I am not saying that we should not explore it.  We need to have this information for our own reporting purposes.  However, it seems to me that we still sometimes neglect the low-hanging fruit, which is addressing the bulging livestock herd numbers.  That could be a much cheaper than some of the other measures proposed.  Setting up any kind of carbon trading scheme is extremely expensive.  It is very expensive to set something up that can be rigorous and verifiable with regard to an international or even voluntary carbon standard.  <\/p><p> We could be looking at the elephant in the room instead, which is the forestry sector.  We have a very low level of forest cover in Ireland and very little in the way of agroforestry.  There is great potential for farmers to engage in more sustainable approaches to forestry and afforestation than we have seen in the past few decades.  This will be particularly important because a lot of what commercial forestry we do have will become ready for harvest in the middle of the 2020s, which suggests that there may be a loss of carbon during that period.  We need to greatly ramp up our rates of afforestation but also to use this as an opportunity to enhance biodiversity and nature-based solutions rather than undermining them with the monoculture approach, which has unfortunately been detrimental to water quality and biodiversity in many places.  The climate action plan recommended a target of 6,500 ha of planting by 2025 but it does not look likely that this will be achieved.  That will have an impact on our inventory and our emissions reporting.  From a policy point of view, we should focus on areas in which we can make the quickest and cheapest gains that are sustainable.  This is definitely an area at which the committee could look in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021061500002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Sadhbh O'Neill","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":217,"content":"<p>I thank our guests very much for their presentations.  Professor Matthews has pointed to the reimagining of our agriculture industry as opposed to mere management of the new regulations.  I believe he is looking at a new departure for agricultural incentives.  As he points out, they are critical.  Does he believe that the State is giving enough attention to this reimagining and to assisting our farmers not only in reaching targets but in adopting a new approach?  What does he have to say about the need for direct measures as opposed to the diffuse approach we have?  Does he see an appetite in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to direct our farmers in these measures in a clear way and to adopt a curative approach to emissions as opposed to telling them they will just have to take their medicine and accept that this is what has been meted out by the Paris Agreement?<\/p><p>I also have a general question for Ms O'Neill.

To answer the question, I will refer to my initial statement on the need for much greater investment in innovation.  I might differ with Ms O'Neill a little bit insofar as I do not see us moving fully away from grass-based livestock production in Ireland.  This is largely our comparative advantage.  We can tweak that a little bit and we can clearly change land use.  I want to see much more effort put into finding ways to reduce the absolute emissions from animal farming.  There are really quite exciting opportunities, partly because there has been so little effort put into this in the past.  Most agriculture research has focused on improving productivity and efficiency and on getting more output per unit of input.  We have very little understanding of the microbes in the rumen or of the behaviour of microbes in soils and manure, for example.  We see potential for different feed additives that can reduce methane emissions quite significantly.  These will become available within the EU but, initially at least, will only be of interest with regard to indoor livestock, animals that are fed indoors rather than out on pasture like the majority of such animals in Ireland.  We need to invest a lot more in trying to enlarge the portfolio of tools and measures available to farmers to reduce their absolute emissions.  Having said that, changes in land use will also be important.  Are we doing enough to re-envisage that?  Again, I suggest that we need to invest much more in conventional opportunities and, perhaps, in some unconventional opportunities.  For example, there is some pilot work under way with regard to using grass for grass protein and that may have potential in the future.<\/p> <p>  I believe the Deputy's second question was whether there is an appetite for direct measures.  That may be a question for the Department itself to answer.  My sense is that it is aware of the challenge and clearly it is looking for ways to use the opportunities provided by the CAP strategic plan, and I hope it will use them.  This is a major opportunity to increase our focus on climate action and other environmental issues such as biodiversity.  That is my answer to that question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021061500002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Alan Matthews"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":219,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for her interesting questions on the narrative.  She is hitting on something very important.  In other countries where more research has been carried out into alternative scenarios and narratives, some interesting findings have been published.  For example, there is a well-known report produced in the UK by the Centre for Alternative Technology in Wales called Zero Carbon Britain, which has been updated since its first publication.  This report maps out exactly what zero emissions for the UK would look like and uses that as a backcasting tool to work out what the implications are for land use.  Unsurprisingly, the report found that there needs to be a shift away from livestock production, which implies a concomitant shift towards, in the main, more plant-based diets.  I refer to diets that do not exclude meat entirely but which are plant-based.  More land would also be devoted to the production of food for humans rather than the production of feed for agricultural livestock.  Unfortunately, we do not have a similar mapping exercise available to us in Ireland which we could present to the public or to farmers to show what zero carbon looks like.<\/p><p>Instead, the public has been confused by different numbers, metrics and ways of describing intensity and the impact of food.  The reality is that 91% of our dairy and beef produce is exported.  There is no sense in which Irish people feel connected to the agricultural landscape in the same way that existed in the past.  It is quite detached from local food consumption.  Consequently, having that national conversation is extremely important.  That is where we get to sit down and talk about food production in terms of consumers, rural communities, the variety of livelihoods that depend on farming, land management and the future of farming so farm viability is guaranteed into the future, which was exactly the Deputy's point.<\/p><p> Other countries in Europe, to a certain extent, have started to outsource their dairy and beef production to countries like Ireland that, on the one hand, can perhaps claim to be doing it more efficiently, according to certain metrics, but at the same time, that means the countries in question can regulate their agricultural emissions more easily.  The question for Ireland is, do we want to bear that pollution burden on behalf of countries that are consuming our products?  The Irish public has not been given an opportunity to answer that question.<\/p><p> The Deputy's second question, which was also very interesting and relevant, was about how to support farmers with diversification and whether there is enough courage in the system to take the measures necessary.  The Deputy is hitting exactly on a core issue, which is that the farm advisory services and research services provided by Teagasc have been skewed in favour of what we call the business as usual, the livestock model and increasing production efficiency, as Professor Matthews said.  It is very influenced by the interests of the dairy and beef industries and, unfortunately, there has been much less attention and effort put into diversification in respect of research or working with the many farmers who are actually engaged in these practices.  They feel very detached from Teagasc, do not feel supported and do not feel the research is supporting their efforts to manage their land according to agroecological or regenerative farming principles.  The few agencies and research centres engaged in that kind of thing are tiny in comparison to where they should be.  <\/p><p> We should be world leaders in regenerative agriculture but the courage is lacking.  We need to instigate a review of Teagasc, just as we might review other public bodies from time to time to ensure their mandate, the composition of their boards and the level of expertise available to them are appropriate for the public services those bodies are required to provide.  That includes bringing on board more ecological expertise into the agronomic and agricultural sciences, because if those disciplines are so detached from each other, it is no wonder we have seen the agricultural pressures on the environment we have experienced. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021061500002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Sadhbh O'Neill","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":221,"content":"<p>I have a very quick point, which follows on from what Deputy Cronin's comments.  I met some farmers from Wicklow during the farm protests on Friday.  It is becoming clear to me that the policy drivers of the State, over many years, have forced or encouraged farmers down this very industrial and intensive path.  Farmers are very good at doing their job.  If you give them a job to do, they will do it.  They have done exactly what the State has required of them.  Now, the State is going to require a different approach.  The farmers to whom I have been talking know there are changes to be made, but how we get there is what is important.  They do not want to left behind, naturally enough.  No one wants to be left behind.  If they were tasked with looking after our environment and biodiversity and with storing carbon, they would do that very well.  The question really comes down to whether those policy drivers are there, to which Ms O'Neill referred in her previous answer.<\/p> <p>  One of the key things I have looked at is the concept of just transition, not the narrow union focus as initially played out but a just transition that applies to our farmers as well.  They are a key part of this but it is not something we are seeing discussed in relation to our agricultural communities.  Is that a big gap?  What are the risks of farmers not identifying with that just transition concept or the Government not applying it?

I will highlight the fact that in 2019, the Climate Change Advisory Council produced a special report on agriculture, which is a really excellent read.  It discusses many of the issues regarding metrics, details and the drivers eloquently, clearly and succinctly.  It identified five key drivers for emissions in Ireland.  It is worth recapping them, namely, an increase in global demand for dairy and beef products; abolition of the milk quota; the agrifood strategies, Food Harvest 2020 and Food Wise 2025; beef sector supports such as the beef environmental efficiency programme-suckler, BEEP-S, mechanisms; and target agriculture modernisation schemes, TAMS, that is, support for capital investment, which has greatly encouraged dairy intensification.<\/p> <p>  If we are going to do anything about mitigation, we need to first of all look at what is driving the problem.  This is clearly the place to start.  We cannot do much about global demand except possibly divesting ourselves of the responsibility of producing food to feed the world, because that is a nonsense.  We should not have to do that.  We should also recognise that, globally speaking, the focus on beef and dairy is driving species to extinction.  It is using far too much land and is not going to support the nutritional needs of a growing world population.  Ireland should not be jumping on this bandwagon in a desire to support our farmers.  We have to provide an alternative model consistent with meeting the human development needs of a growing population.<\/p> <p>  The milk quota was a major driver in Ireland but, unlike other EU countries, we used it as an opportunity to expand dairy production.  We did not need to do that because the trends were moving in a positive direction prior to this and emissions from agriculture were coming down steadily until 2011, when they started to increase again.  The first port of call is to make sure that any future agrifood strategy, and comments for a current draft of a strategic environmental assessment are closing today, has to be consistent with meeting our climate and biodiversity obligations by 2030.  If we pass or adopt another agrifood strategy that even suggests a modest decrease in methane emissions, we will be failing.  That is a failure.  It is a recipe for disaster and we will be asking ourselves again in five years' time, how did it happen and how did it come about that agricultural emissions are going up?<\/p> <p>  If we want to communicate to farmers what a just transition looks like, the first thing we need to do is get our house in order on the policy side.  We need to provide an articulated, clear, policy framework that is consistent between the Department of the Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the climate action agenda.  The regulatory context in which that is going to unfold, if the climate Bill is passed, will be extremely tight.  There will be consequences if emissions targets are not met.  We need to have a look at those supports, whether they are fossil fuel subsidies or any form of subsidy that is giving the wrong incentive, whether in the beef sector or in dairy capital investment programmes.  They need to be looked at again.  We need to stop incentivising the bad and to start incentivising the good, including eco-schemes and providing additional supports where that is appropriate.  <\/p> <p>  We need to do something on the market side, because if food prices do not reflect the environmental costs, we are on a hiding to nothing and farmers will wonder why they are being asked to do something that is completely uneconomic.  We need to address the bigger picture of market failure.  The role of intermediaries, like supermarkets, is critically important in Ireland because supermarkets and wholesalers have a very strong level of control over the standards of food production from their suppliers.  I do not know if that adequately addresses the Deputy's question, but if there if any further detail I will be happy to provide it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021061500002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Sadhbh O'Neill"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":225,"content":"<p>I thank Ms O'Neill.

Market forces have largely driven the expansion of dairying once the milk quota was removed and that is important to bear in mind.<\/p> <p>  My objective is not so much to target beef and dairy, which, as I said, will be the mainstay of Irish agricultural production for quite some time, but rather to target the emissions in the climate sense and the negative impacts on water quality and biodiversity.  We need to send signals to farmers that they cannot just produce food and ignore the environmental impacts.  If we could try to integrate these environmental damages into farmers' decision-making, we would move quite a long way towards a more sustainable animal sector.  It is, of course, the case that elsewhere in Europe, much animal production is based on cereals that could be used for human food production but that is not fundamentally the case in Ireland.  We are using grass which we would not be able to consume ourselves.<\/p> <p>  My view would be to emphasise the need to address the negative outcomes and to put a price on these as some kind of signal to farmers that they need to take these into account.  They cannot exceed the environmental boundaries that are real, and the herd numbers will have to reduce in order to achieve that.  The focus should not be on the herd numbers themselves.  It should be on preventing the environmental damage that arises from that.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the just transition, which is obviously a hugely important issue, I would point out that there are very significant supports that go to agriculture which are not necessarily targeted in the most sensible and effective manner.

To what extent does it do a disservice to rural Ireland and farmers to not be honest about the survival of rural Ireland based on the agricultural practices, either that we have now or that we are moving to?  I am thinking in terms of water quality and flooding.  I would like to hear from both witnesses what the impact of not changing our agricultural patterns would be on rural Ireland and the sustainability of farm incomes over time if we look at changes in European funding over time.  Small farmers, in particular, feel they get a raw deal.  Coming from the west of Ireland, that is what I hear.  It is a very different story from that of the large dairy farmers that is coming to my door.  The witnesses might speak about that.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses, and particularly for Ms O'Neill, have been critical of existing agricultural policies.  I would like to hear from both of them about the importance of moving the climate Bill on and the part to be played by the climate advisory council in shifting policy in Ireland.  That is important and it can get lost in the conversation that policies need to change but there needs to be an imperative in order to do that.

Without that vision, it can be quite difficult.<\/p> <p>  There has been a good bit of conversation about offsetting.  My understanding of what the witnesses are saying is that it is not really to do with offsetting.  It is to do with the fact that if we shift to a different land use, that naturally brings emissions down.  There are different practices.  It is not only about offsetting carbon but about the fact that one also has a reduction in particular types of farming that create those emissions.  I am particularly interested in forestry and the part it can play.  Do the witnesses have any figures on the impact on emissions?  If we have X amount of coverage, what does that looks like?

On the question of Senator Pauline O'Reilly's worries about the impact on rural Ireland, if we look at the overall figures, first of all, in nominal terms, I agree that if we have inflation the real value of the CAP has been reduced.  If we look at the budget for Ireland for the CAP in the current seven-year period from 2021 to 2027, in nominal terms it has been maintained - in fact, even slightly increased.  There is the same level of funding.  If we add to that the &euro;1.5 billion the programme for Government indicated will be made available, in addition to the carbon tax revenue, it seems funding should not be the issue.  It is a question of making the right use of it and making sure that we target that funding in a way that rewards farmers for those practices that are benefiting society.  It also sends a signal that there are by-products - we are talking here about greenhouse emissions - which we need to reduce.<\/p><p>It seems to me that it is a question of targeting the payments but, overall, the payments will be maintained in their value.  I very much agree with the Senator on the importance of the Climate Change Advisory Council.  I had the privilege of being a member of it in its first term.  It has a valuable role to play as an independent source of expertise, both advising the Government but also holding the Government to account where targets are not being met.  I am sure the current council will continue to fulfil that role.  Establishing the council was an important step for Ireland.  We were one of the early movers in that.  We see a similar body now being proposed as part of the European climate law at European level and other member states are introducing such councils, which are important.<\/p><p> On the forestry side, I must admit I am not an expert on forestry.  It is clear, and Ms O&rsquo;Neill already highlighted this, that planting rates have fallen quite dramatically.  The rotation period, particularly in the commercial forestry species such as spruce and pine, is relatively short.  We had significant planting ten or 20 years ago.  Those forests are now coming to maturity.  They will be cut but we are not replacing those at a sufficient rate.  The deforestation that will occur over the coming ten years will exacerbate the problem that our land sector is a net emitter rather than a net source.<\/p><p> How does one reverse that?  There are significant financial incentives in place.  I understand there are some real problems in terms of licensing.  There may be others here who are more familiar with this.

I will try to be as brief as possible.  First, I agree with the Senator that we need to be honest with farmers about the challenges posed by climate action and the biodiversity crisis that we are experiencing in Ireland.  We will have to take a close look at our land management practices and make some tough decisions.  While I support the principle of a just transition, it is unfortunate that measures that have been designed to support farm incomes have maintained the situation as it is in relation to the beef herd sector for so long.  The lesson should be learned that while politicians want to step in and rescue a sector that is undergoing a financial crisis, we must not create a legacy effect or an incumbency that generates more problems in the future with which we must deal.  What we can learn from other countries that have done this kind of thing successfully is first to connect producers and consumers.  The reality is that we are exporting commodities and we are importing food that we eat.  We should look to scenarios where there is much more localised food production.  That will involve greater use of horticulture and tillage.  It is important to highlight that Teagasc, in its outlook report for 2021, estimates that there will be further decline in the tillage area by 2030.  It estimates a drop of another 14%, on top of the decreases that have already taken place.<\/p> <p>  The current trend is all moving in the wrong direction.  We are neither growing the food we need to consume, nor what consumers want to buy.  However, there is potential to embrace those kinds of shortened supply chains, to increase the net benefit for farmers and producers directly.  Obviously, it increases Ireland&rsquo;s food security if we produce more of our own food rather than importing it.<\/p> <p>  The Senator&rsquo;s second question was on the climate Bill.  I agree that the climate Bill is important because of the tight governance structures contained within it.  No matter what concerns various groups, including even ourselves, have about the weaknesses in the language, and certain things that are not mentioned at all, the important thing is the mechanism by which the Climate Change Advisory Council now has the authority to propose a carbon budget.  That carbon budget is going to embrace the emissions economy-wide.  It is going to have to be consistent with the target of 51%.  It will at least have to pay heed to Ireland&rsquo;s commitments under the Paris Agreement.  That is ultimately what should drive climate policy: an awareness and appreciation of the global catastrophe that awaits us if we do not take urgent action to reduce emissions and to halt the loss in biodiversity.<\/p> <p>  I am not an expert in biodiversity, but my colleagues are always keen to highlight to me the potential for various farm practices to improve biodiversity.  At the moment, the areas the Senator describes in the west of Ireland, where there is much high-nature value farming, are in decline because of all of these economic pressures.  Therefore, we need to make sure that the measures we take to support farmers in transitioning and diversifying continue to support high-nature value farming in those areas.<\/p> <p>  It is important that the Bill moves swiftly into law, because it will dictate the carbon budgets that are due to come from the Climate Change Advisory Council, the Department and the Minister and then back to the Oireachtas, in the coming months.  Therefore, if the Bill is not enacted, that process and timeline will falter.  That will lead to yet further delays.  As the Senator knows, we have been delaying and delaying in Ireland on climate action for far too long already.<\/p> <p>  On the Senator&rsquo;s final question about forestry, I do not have precise numbers for her.  However, suffice to say, unfortunately, the forestry sector is also in crisis.  Commercial forestry has hit many roadblocks in the licensing process.  On the biodiversity side, we have seen major impacts to water quality and biodiversity from the type of commercial forestry planted heretofore.  I am a member of the forestry working group.  There is a number of different workstreams addressing different parts of the Jo O&rsquo;Hara report into the Mackinnon report.  I am optimistic that it will at least attempt to reconcile the multiple objectives for the sector.  However, it remains to be seen whether it can get a new strategy out in time to reverse this pattern of farmers losing interest in forestry, and in less commercial forestry, which is important for timbering construction, as well as for sequestration.<\/p> <p>  On the environmental and sustainability side, we need to look to trees, wood products and forestry for the multiple benefits that they can provide to biodiversity, air quality, amenity, recreation, timber products, food crops and, even, edible crops from trees.  There is so much potential there.  We in Ireland seem to have suffered from a lack of vision in relation to forestry for so long.  Forestry is so denuded from the landscape that the public has forgotten what trees in the landscape would do for us all.  Hopefully, the forest working group will address some of those issues.  If the Senator requires some detailed estimates, I can try to find them for her.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021061500002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Sadhbh O'Neill"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":236,"content":"<p>I thank Ms O&rsquo;Neill and Professor Matthews for their comprehensive answers to Senator O&rsquo;Reilly.

At least, we want to protect livelihoods in farming and in rural Ireland.  I do not think there is too much disagreement on that.

It is the very last recommendation - action No. 29, if I recall correctly - and I see no reason it cannot be enacted immediately.  It is a commitment to engaging in a stakeholder dialogue between scientists, representatives of the farming community and environmental interests, in conjunction with other stakeholders.  This is a very welcome development because, to date, it has been very difficult for environmental interests, including environmental scientists, to get a foot in the door when it comes to the conversation about agriculture.  We have been somewhat excluded and our efforts to engage have been difficult.  This would be a very welcome initiative and it is entirely up to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to get the ball rolling.  I certainly think it would be a helpful initiative.<br\/><br\/>The Chairman's question about carbon leakage is one that comes up regularly.  I refer to the point that is made very succinctly by the Climate Change Advisory Council in its 2019 review:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe extent to which leakage may occur is unclear and dependent on multiple factors, including international trade agreements, the carbon footprint of production in other countries and [crucially] their own commitments to emission reductions. <\/blockquote> <p>In the context of all countries having to step up under the Paris Agreement, it is quite difficult to estimate the extent of the problem in advance and what the effect will be if Ireland were to act a little more quickly than other countries to reduce emissions in agriculture, for example.  Other countries make the same claims about their pet industries.  Whether it is shoe or car manufacturing, steel or cement, every country seeks to protect its key industries.  Increasingly, there is a global effort to look at particular commodities that are traded globally.  I do not expect there will be any escape clause for any industry.  Even the steel, cement and car industries are coming under much closer scrutiny, not just by governments and regulators but also by shareholders.  I expect that will also happen in the case of agriculture.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021061500002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Sadhbh O'Neill"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":239,"content":"<p>I thank Ms O'Neill.

I agree with the comments made by Ms O'Neill.  The first point I would make is that it is important to bear in mind that we cannot assume the current situation is the appropriate counterfactual and things will continue as usual.  There will be, and already is, huge pressure coming from the supply chain, that is, from the supermarkets and processors, which have taken on climate commitments themselves - in many cases, they have taken on net-zero commitments - and want to secure them through their supply chain.  If we do not make the changes that are necessary, we will simply find ourselves losing out on existing markets.<\/p> <p>  The second point I would make is to stress that carbon leakage will occur.  In any traded commodity, it is clear that if standards are increased in one country, some production will move offshore.  The question is whether we will increase global emissions, which obviously would not be a desirable outcome of policy.  This is an empirical question and my own assessment, if we could go into it, is that it is unlikely to happen.  Most of the competition for Irish beef is either from the UK or other EU member states, all of which will have stricter binding targets on emissions.  There is a limit to which increased production in those countries can replace any reduction in Irish output.  In terms of international competition, we need to remember there is already a very high level of border protection against third-country imports.  In the case of fresh and frozen beef, it is a tariff of approximately 45%, on average.  There is a limited likelihood that we would see global emissions increasing.  As I said, however, it is an empirical question.  The claim in this regard is often made without very much evidence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021061500002#M00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Alan Matthews"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":241,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Matthews.

The time for tinkering around the edges has long passed.

The key issue here is putting a value on emissions in order that farmers take them into account in their decision-making.  This is entirely a matter for policymakers to decide, but it can be done through regulation, subsidies or through taxes or levies.  The appropriate choice will depend on distributional impacts, administrative feasibility and so on.  Cap and trade is not something that would potentially be available in an immediate sense.  There certainly are much more direct instruments we can use.<\/p><p>We are saying to farmers or groups of farmers that if they can show us that they can reduce their overall greenhouse gas emissions, be that nitrous oxide, methane or carbon in their soil, we are prepared to pay them to do that.  That is putting a value on the action.  It immediately changes the incentive structure for farmers and they will change their behaviour as a result.  I do not see that as something that will necessarily work against the interests of, for example, smaller farms.  It may well be that they are more attracted into such a scheme than other farms.

If we cannot satisfy those criteria, it is unlikely that projects would even meet the new standards that are coming forward under the voluntary carbon market regulations that are being proposed by Mark Carney's Taskforce on Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets. <\/p> <p>  The reality is that we have to take action to reduce emissions and protect and restore biodiversity on our own territory in the first instance.  If there are market opportunities, these mechanisms may well play a role in the future.  For now, it is important we get our fossil carbon emissions down and stop releasing carbon from sinks.  There is a stock of carbon in the soil, trees and hedgerows.  It is urgent that we focus on what is available to us close to hand.  We do not have to invent new, complicated and expensive schemes to do that.

The publication of the report has resulted in a great deal of commentary in various circles, most importantly from survivors who participated in the process.  Many relived traumatic and painful experiences in an attempt to have their voices and stories heard and to assist in healing their suffering.  It was only natural to expect that, following the publication of the report, such commentary would take place.  The committee, following contact from a number of participants, wished to afford the former members of the commission an appropriate forum to engage with genuine questions on behalf of survivors.  We believe that this would have been a helpful process.  Unfortunately, once again, members of the commission have decided to decline the invitation to address the committee.<\/p> <p>  On behalf of members of the committee and on my own behalf, I assure survivors of these institutions that this committee is committed to prioritising in its work programme the progression of matters that come before it which impact on the lives of survivors.  The aim of the committee is always to ensure that such matters are treated in a respectful and balanced manner.  As members of an Oireachtas committee, we are disappointed by the decision of the members of the commission to share their response to the invitation request with media outlets before the members of this committee had the opportunity to comprehensively consider the response.  While the committee has to accept the refusal of the former members of the commission to appear before the committee, members have agreed to publish the response received from Ms Justice Yvonne Murphy to the committee's web page.

I am pleased to join other stakeholders in this session, Ms. Orlaith Traynor, chairperson of the Adoption Authority of Ireland, and Mr. Conor O'Mahony, special rapporteur.  I am joined by my colleagues, Ms. Siobhan Mugan and Mr. Cormac Quinlan, who are the two most senior staff involved in the management of the adoption services provided by the Child and Family Agency.<\/p> <p>  The pre-legislative scrutiny by this committee of the general scheme of the birth information and tracing Bill 2021 is an important stage of the intended provision in law for an adequate response to rights and needs of many.  The Child and Family Agency, Tusla, as the statutory provider of adoption assessment, placement and tracing services, welcomes the opportunity to place on record our observations on the general scheme.  I make clear that Tusla welcomes the proposed legislation, which finally addresses the right to identity.<\/p> <p>  Tusla has, through its predecessor structures, the HSE and health boards, and also significant changes in the landscape of former adoption societies, become a key custodian of substantial amounts of information, access to which has been the subject of extensive debate for several years.  I am acutely aware of the expressed hurt and distress of many in that debate, most notably adopted people, those with a false, illegal or incorrect birth registration and many who were nursed out, boarded out or placed in pre-adoptive foster care.  They and others who were born in or resided in certain institutions listed in the general scheme have in many cases sought access to their identity and birth or early life information in what can be best described as a weak legal framework.<\/p> <p>  In recent years, Tusla was the main State agency which had to represent that complex legal position, resulting in many people not having access to their identity and all that flows from that.  Notwithstanding the findings of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes and Certain Related Matters on this particular aspect, namely, that any State agency would have been in the same position, I recognise that many people were hurt and had a sense of being let down by the State in their search for answers to the most basic questions.  I offer a sincere apology to any person who attributes that hurt to their dealings with Tusla.  Whether limited by law or any other circumstance, it would never be our wish that any person would be left with such disappointment in his or her dealings with the agency.<\/p><p>Given the limited legislative framework within which Tusla has had to function to date, we are pleased that the Minister has brought clarity in the form of this proposed new legislation.<\/p><p> I want to set out the response of Tusla to the general scheme.  I will do so in nine observations, recognising that as the legislation advances we will have ongoing engagements with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability Integration and Youth on detailed operational aspects of the various provisions.  Our response, therefore, could be described as \"high level\" at this time.  First, the scheme is welcome in many aspects but specifically for dealing with the core issue of access to birth identity and significant personal information.<\/p><p> Second, the contact preference register makes good provision for the appropriate separation of the issues of information and contact, with good additional provisions for counselling supports.  It would be a useful consideration in the view of Tusla to extend the provision of counselling to all people searching for their identity or early-life information and who may identify such a need for themselves.  Such a need might arise, for example, on receiving that information or details regarding any expressed wish on the contact preference register that is passed on to them.  While supports are generally provided for under head 36, this would be more beneficial if included in the statutory duty.  <\/p><p> Our third observation is that the applicability of the provisions to people under 18 may suggest a particular need to focus on supports and the duty of care to those young people as they access some information.  <\/p><p> Four, the statutory authority proposed to be conferred on Tusla for tracing, including if deemed necessary by the Minister in the public interest, demonstrates the core value of the tracing service, which has been evidenced many times over the years by Tusla but not always understood in the public domain.  Tusla envisages that strong working protocols will be required with the Adoption Authority of Ireland, AAI, as both are authorised to provide a tracing service.  The complexities attaching to both the AAI and Tusla holding information together, with both providing a tracing service, must not be underestimated.  <\/p><p> Five, the enabling of Tusla or the AAI to request information from other persons or bodies, as set out in head 13, is clear.  However, again, strong and robust sharing protocols are viewed to be necessary in light of the challenges of recent years for all agencies on the complex subject matter of sharing information.  This legislation will provide for GDPR-compliant protocols and remove doubt.  <\/p><p> Six, the clarification of further use of the database of the mother and baby home commission, as set out in head 35, is welcome and will remove several of the current limitations and uncertainties.  <\/p><p> Seven, the clarifications of restrictions of rights and obligations under the provisions of GDPR and as set out in head 40 of the general scheme are helpful given the notable perceived conflict to date.  <\/p><p> Eight, it is important that all people to whom these provisions relate understand the very variable nature of the records that are currently held.  The quantity, quality and accuracy of some records is a concern and the agency is mindful of the potential disappointment or error that may arise in some cases because of this.  <\/p><p> Nine, Tusla recommends that a Department-led process including the Tusla and the AAI be now undertaken to scope out the various types and complexities of demand that may arise on enactment of the proposed legislation.  This scoping will need to result in careful consideration of the resource dependencies and working arrangements necessary to ensure timely access to rights for all as set out.  We are, as an agency, conscious of the demand in information and tracing to date and the challenges still faced despite increased resource provision.  While ultimately the provisions proposed will likely lead to some levelling off in demand or associated input required, the expertise in information management and counselling and social work will still need some consideration.<\/p><p> Tusla holds some 70,000 records prior to the receipt of the mother and baby homes commission database.  These records include adoption, boarded-out, placed-at-nurse and other arrangements that were made for infants by many entities over the decades.  Adoptions in Ireland since 1953 numbered 44,862 up to 2019.  It was in the early period of the 1960s that recorded adoptions were in the hundreds.  From the mid-1960s to the mid-1980s, the annual number of adoptions was consistently above 1,000.  The number steadily decreased to 79 in 2019.  The context of that 79 is vastly different for that of earlier decades, with 51 involving adoption by a step-parent, 21 involving a conversion from long-term foster care, one being associated with an extended family arrangement, and six infants placed for adoption.  For the majority of that 79, access to identity will not be an issue, but this Bill is significant for the small number for whom it might be in the future.  It is, however, likely that this Bill will be active and utilised for many years to come as many among the 44,862 adoptees and others exercise their right to identity.  This is a very positive step in legislative reform.  <\/p><p> It is the function of Tusla to support the people who will have an interest in this legislation at whatever time in the future that might arise.

I thank the members for the invitation to speak today.  I warmly welcome the Bill.  It is long overdue and has been a long time coming.  I am conscious that it is not the first version of it.  I previously addressed this committee in 2015 regarding an earlier version, which never made its way across the line to become an Act of the Oireachtas.  I very much hope the process will result in a successful outcome on this occasion.  Ireland is currently an outlier in not making provision for adopted people to access their birth information records.  It is one of only two countries in the European Union that does not make provision in this regard.  Our obligations under international human rights law are clear in that every person, including every child, has a right to identity.  Our international human rights obligations compel us to enact laws to address the gap that currently exists in the legal provision in this area.<\/p> <p>  For all these reasons I welcome the fact that the Bill makes provision to allow for access to birth certificates and other early-life information.  I welcome the provisions on the contact preference register and the legal basis for information-sharing, which has been mentioned several times already, and also the provisions on rectifying the register where there is evidence of incorrect or illegal registrations.  I welcome the register of acknowledged identity, which would allow people to continue to use an identity they have used all their lives unaware that the original registration had been illegal or incorrect.<\/p> <p>  The core of the Bill is generally strong, which I warmly welcome.  At the periphery of the Bill, there are some issues that might benefit from some further consideration.  The main issue I would like to raise concerns where the records would be maintained.  The Bill takes the approach of keeping all the records where they currently are.  That is perhaps not the best approach in the sense that it leads to fragmentation of records, both physically and between different agencies and bodies.  There is a risk, when it comes to providing a tracing service, that this approach creates logistical difficulties, notwithstanding that the Bill makes provision for information-sharing.  We may encounter logistical issues in providing a tracing service that has to access and cross-reference records across several locations and agencies.  A lot of difficulty is caused for adopted persons by lengthy delays in accessing a tracing service.  This does not seem likely to be helped by the fragmentation of the records.  It is likely that there would be a more efficient service if the records were centralised within a single agency and, ideally, if they were digitised to allow for maximum searchability.  I acknowledge the latter would involve a very significant project but it would be the most efficient way of dealing with searches.  I acknowledge there is some very specialist knowledge in respect of particular archives.  There are staff members who care for certain archives who have special knowledge of their nuances.<\/p><p>If it were deemed necessary for some staff to migrate with the records, as it were, perhaps that should be considered.<\/p><p> I will briefly mention an issue relating to head 2 where it deals with incorrect birth registration.  That is linked to head 29, which allows for rectification of the register.  That deals with cases where the identity of the parent is incorrect in the birth registration.  It does not deal with situations where the date of birth is incorrect.  There is evidence that is one of the things that was done in some cases historically.  In order to impede efforts at tracing, incorrect dates of birth were entered in the register.  Ideally, development heads would include that within their scope so that issue could be rectified, as well as situations in which the identity of the parents is incorrect.<\/p><p> The Bill currently addresses provision for information meetings and counselling supports, as were mentioned earlier, only in respect of adopted persons whose birth parents had registered a preference for no contact.  As has already been mentioned, there is scope to consider whether it would be worth looking at extending that provision, whether on an optional or compulsory basis.  There is room for discussion there.  It seems as if there are no good reasons why supports which are made available in the category of cases where a preference for no contact is stated would not be made available in cases where a contact preference or no preference is stated.<\/p><p> The issue of a minimum age for access to records will be applicable to future adoptions.  The minimum age before someone can seek to access records is proposed to be 16.  International human rights law is very clear in providing that the right to identity is not a right which crystalises upon entry to adulthood.  The right to identity is a right of children as children.  For that reason, setting a minimum age of 16 is inconsistent with international human rights law in that respect.  We should, of course, acknowledge that parents have a role in guiding children's right to identity with other rights while they are still children.  I have made recommendations elsewhere in respect of Government services and donor-assisted human reproduction to the effect that records should be available to parents on behalf of children up to the age of 12 and directly to the child from the age of 12 on.  I repeat that recommendation in respect of access to adoption records in this Bill.<\/p><p> There is a discrete issue in head 13, which deals with requests for information made by the Adoption Authority of Ireland or Tusla and our direction to provide information to them.  There is no enforcement mechanism in that head.  There is a gap there.  If an adoption society did not comply with a request for information under head 13, there is no way of enforcing that request.  That would ideally be addressed.<\/p><p> Those are the issues I would like to highlight and I am happy to discuss them all further as the meeting progresses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021061500002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Conor O'Mahony","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":262,"content":"<p>The Adoption Authority of Ireland welcomes the opportunity to give input to this historic Bill.  For the first time in Ireland&rsquo;s history, critical information, including original birth certificates and important medical information, will be made available to adult adoptees.  The authority believes this draft legislation is a thoughtful rebalancing of rights to identity and provision of supports to all those, including birth mothers, who will be affected by the legislation.  The authority is of the view that the Bill reflects the obligations imposed on the State under the general data protection regulation, GDPR, and the Data Protection Act 2018.  Moreover, it meets the requirements of the European Convention on Human Rights.  In this regard, Article 8 of the convention has been construed as requiring the contracting states to protect the right of a person to information concerning their identity and origins.<br\/><br\/>The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child was ratified by Ireland on 21 December 1992 without reservation and, as such, is binding on the State, albeit not on the domestic courts.  While the Bill envisages the provision of identity information to adult adoptees, the principles enunciated in the convention on this issue provided a useful framework for drafting legislation in this area.  Of particular relevance to the discussion are Articles 7 and 8, headed &quot;name and nationality&quot; and &quot;preservation of identity&quot;, respectively.  Article 7 provides: <\/p> <blockquote> \t1. The child shall be registered immediately after birth and shall have the right from birth to a name, the right to acquire a nationality and as far as possible, the right to know and be cared for by his or her parents. <br \/><br \/>2. States Parties shall ensure the implementation of these rights in accordance with their national law and their obligations under the relevant international instruments in this field, in particular where the child would otherwise be stateless.  <\/blockquote> <p>Article 8 is in the following terms: <\/p> <blockquote> \t1. States Parties undertake to respect the right of the child to preserve his or her identity, including nationality, name, and family relations as recognized by law without unlawful interference. <br \/><br \/>2. Where a child is legally deprived of some or all of the elements of his or her identity, States Parties shall provide appropriate assistance and protection, with a view to re-establishing speedily his or her identity. <\/blockquote> <p>The right to know one&rsquo;s parents expressed in Article 7.1 has been construed by the relevant international law agencies as enshrining a right of the child to knowledge of origins.  Thus, the Committee on the Rights of the Child, in comments regarding the United Kingdom's compliance with the UN Convention, made the following recommendation: <\/p> <blockquote> \tIn light of articles 3 [best interests of the child] and 7 of the Convention, the Committee recommends that the State party take all necessary measures to allow all children, irrespective of the circumstances of their birth, and adopted children to obtain information on the identity of their parents, to the extent possible.  <\/blockquote> <p>A similar view of the extent of the obligations imposed on contracting states by Article 7 has been expressed in the academic commentary.  Mr. Alistair McDonald, for example, observed that in order to preserve the identity of a child, the child must have full knowledge of each of the components of his or her identity, including his or her birth parents.  He also stated that the adopted child's right under Article 7(1) as far as possible to know and be cared for by his or her parents will encompass the child's birth parents as well as his or her adoptive parents.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the national adoption contact preference register, the authority has significant experience in operating this register for the past 16 years.  We welcome the fact that all data of 13,800-plus registered parties will be retained and that the authority will oversee the new register as outlined in the Bill.<br\/><br\/>With regard to timeframes, we have concerns related to the short window of three months and believe it will take a minimum of six to 12 months to advertise in Ireland and beyond, to communicate and disseminate the key messages and the changes the legislation will bring.  It is critical that as many people as possible are reached in order to encourage huge participation in this historical scheme.<br\/><br\/>The authority notes that it will require significant additional resources in the area of records and information management, archivist resources, administration and social work in order to provide an excellent and timely service from day one of enactment of the legislation.  The authority is aware that very large numbers of persons will wish to apply for their birth certificates, early life and medical information in addition to those who may wish to register and be supported in a no-contact preference.  There will be a grave impact on the provision of timely services if resources are not put in place in advance of enactment.  Due to limited resources and challenges in recruiting social workers, the authority currently has a two-year-plus waiting list for services.<br\/><br\/>What will the definition of &quot;early life information&quot; encompass?  Is this only information up to the time a baby was placed with adoptive parents?  Information may subsequently have been placed on file when the adopted person was under 16.  Should this be included as early life information?  Should birth mothers be encouraged to provide information on the adult adoptees&rsquo; birth fathers and can a section be added to the new registration form to facilitate this, even in the event that birth mothers are registering a no-contact preference?<br\/><br\/>The area around the release of medical information will require careful and considered operational procedures as medical information is personal sensitive data.  Release of medical information to a nominated medical practitioner may, in fact, result in an adopted or fostered person knowing that the information relates to the birth mother in situations where, for example, he or she is an only child or only has male siblings.  If medical information is subsequently added to the register, how is this information to be shared with the relevant party?  We are pleased that crucial medical information should and will be given to adult adoptees.  However, the authority notes that it will require careful consideration and the authority will require expert medical advice.<br\/><br\/>Regarding a nominated medical practitioner, there will need to be guidelines on how this process would work.  How, for example, would the authority verify the credentials of the nominated medical practitioner and any GDPR issues associated with sharing sensitive medical data with a registered GP or other medical person as nominated?<\/p><p>Clarity will be required on who exactly is responsible for the release of adoptee birth certificates.  In most cases, the adoption files held by the authority contain copies of original birth certificates.  The proposed legislation also suggests that Tusla could fulfil this role.  Given that the authority usually provides Tusla with a copy of the certificate, it would seem counter-intuitive to expect Tusla to provide this service as it would have to approach the authority on behalf of the adoptee, thereby prolonging the process.<\/p><p> We would ask that if there is correspondence on the adoption file, unrelated to the register yet clearly confirming a \"No contact\" preference, this no contact can be considered as part of the release of a birth certificate.  In some instances, birth mothers have written, themselves or via a solicitor, to strongly indicate no contact.  This information will be on the adoption file but not on the national adoption contact preference register, NACPR.<\/p><p> Will the adult adoptee have a choice, which we believe is important, to request face-to-face support when receiving information?  We note that the onus is on the service provider to share sensitive information in a way that is in the best interest of the service user.  Some adult adoptees may not wish to meet a social worker and could, we believe, meet another staff member in the authority.<\/p><p> Regarding the release of information for those aged under 18, we would ask that particular attention and thought is given to 16- to 18-year-olds.  Regarding the release of information to applicants aged 16 to 17 years, will this take place in an information session or will the procedure be the same as for those aged over 18?  It is not assumed that they will require or seek additional supports in receiving information.  In instances where they do, however, we believe this should be available and provided in a child-centred and informal manner.  The authority intends to work with the Ombudsman for Children's office to develop appropriate child-focused approaches to this cohort.<\/p><p> Regarding counselling for birth parents, will counselling be made available to birth parents who register a no contact preference?  Will the same service be given to those who are registering for contact or who are trying to decide what is the best option for them?<\/p><p> We believe the Bill should also strongly reference birth fathers and allow them to register no contact should they so wish, and also allow birth fathers to avail of support services.  Can adopted people register a no contact preference?  Can other people register no contact, for example, adoptive parents where the adopted person is deceased, relatives of birth mother or birth father or other parties who do not want to be approached when the birth mother or birth father is deceased?  Can foster parents register no contact?  Will a no contact preference continue indefinitely?  Is a contact preference too restrictive?  Is there a failure to take into consideration that those who lodged one might want to change their minds after a period of time?<\/p><p> The authority wishes to raise a number of questions with respect to the no contact preference.  Are there any circumstances where a no contact preference can be overruled, for example, if an adoptee or a relative is ill and up-to-date medical information is urgently required?  Can a system be put in place whereby the authority can return to the person who has lodged the no contact preference and inquire whether he or she wishes to retain or revoke the no contact preference?<\/p><p> Regarding the procedures for registering no contact, what is acceptable if a person is unwilling or unable to provide photo identification and complete the register?  Could another person register on behalf of that person?  Could another party, such as a solicitor or family member, register a no contact preference on behalf of, for example, a birth mother?  This is important to give choice and supports to those coming forward to place details on the register.<\/p><p> Can birth parents apply to get their children&rsquo;s birth and adoption records?  Could this be included in the proposed legislation?  The authority believes that consideration needs to be given on the implications of releasing personal information, for example, a person named as the birth father on record, which later proves to be incorrect.  Releasing this information, which has not been confirmed with the birth mother, may have implications for the person concerned and, if he is deceased, for his family.<\/p><p> We would ask that careful thought is given to the implications of releasing other information not confirmed by the birth mother, for example, the true relationship with the birth father not noted at the time.  Some women did not speak in the past of the fact that their children were conceived through incest or rape.  Again, the authority believes a range of supports should be made available for those who wish to receive them, including counselling, advocacy and other required supports.<\/p><p> With regard to the media campaign, the authority would welcome receiving the media publicity pack from Tusla regarding extensive preparations, which were already made in 2016, to avoid duplication of the huge work and the consultations that took place at that time.  The authority has a positive and collaborative working relationship with Tusla and will continue to engage with it on all matters related to the Bill.<\/p><p> The authority intends to publish the key messages of the legislation not only in Ireland but throughout the world, acknowledging the Irish adoption diaspora who are living around the world, in particular in the UK, the USA, Australia, Canada and beyond.  We would urge the Oireachtas to consider &ndash; as took place in 2005, when the NACPR was launched &ndash; that each household in Ireland would receive a copy of the key provisions of the legislation and plain English information on how to register and-or access information or supports they may require.<\/p><p> We look forward to collaborating with colleagues in Tusla and also to hearing from support groups and other adoption service providers on how best to communicate the critical information in the new Bill and how to implement its key provisions in a timely, professional and considered manner for all.<\/p><p> I thank the committee very much for taking time to listen to the authority's perspective.

My first question is around the three-month window.  I hear that we need to ensure that everyone is aware of their opportunity to register their \"Contact\" or \"No contact\" preference, whichever that would be.  I very respectfully hear Ms Traynor when she says that period must be longer.  I am, however, naturally nervous about the fact that the heads of the Bill as they currently stand have a stay on adoptees and people having a right to their own information until that period has elapsed.  I would, therefore, see this as a rolling opportunity to register and perhaps suggest that we need a longer campaign.  I would value Ms Traynor's thoughts in that regard.<\/p> <p>  With regard to Tusla, has the data processing impact assessment on the mother and baby homes database been published?  I am curious to know that.  As Mr. Gloster referenced it and as it is being strengthened within this Bill, I am curious to know where we are at this moment.<\/p> <p>  My thoughts also go to the cohort that was particularly referenced by Mr. O'Mahony, that is, those people whose information about themselves, which they think they know about, is false, including their date of birth.  I refer to the St. Patrick's Guild group.  As time moves on, however, more and more people are finding that similar experience for themselves.  They do not know whether they are with the St. Patrick's Guild group or not but they certainly have the same experience of all their information being false.  In that regard, what are the thoughts around perhaps having an opportunity for additional relatives to register their knowledge?  When such people are contacted and have had the experience of being contacted by Tusla, sometimes the information they have been given is incorrect and has later been proven to be so by DNA.

We did it on the basis of saying it was iterative and that anybody could comment on it as we progressed, and this would remain the case until such a time as this legislation emerged.  This legislation will cause us to revisit that data protection impact assessment in a different way, and hopefully, in a much more significant way in terms of the process of information being released to people as intended in this Act.<\/p><p> We are processing requests relating to our paper records and the mother and baby homes commission database.

He mentioned how he almost felt that Tusla's capacity had been overwhelmed by the work it had to do in respect of adoptees.  Do Tusla and the Adoption Authority believe that they have the capacity to work under this Bill?  Some of the adoptees I have met feel traumatised by what has happened in recent years and do not have trust in Tusla.  They feel too traumatised to go back to it.

The Department will need to lead a process, with the Adoption Authority and Tusla, to scope out not just the resources required to give effect to what is intended in the legislation, but the resources to do so in a timely way that does not result in lengthy waiting periods.  At the end of the first quarter of this year, we had approximately 800 people waiting for an information and tracing service.  In terms of response times, they will wait somewhere between 13 and 23 or 24 months.  Separately, we have had approximately 432 information requests this year under FOI or subject access requests, all of which have to be responded to within a statutory timeframe.<\/p> <p>  On the flip side, we have increased the number of information personnel.  At the start of this year, we increased the number of tracing personnel in terms of social work staff who are approved to work in the service.  The service has grown exponentially.  Today, we have approximately 116 whole-time equivalent staff as well as a number of vacancies that are being filled through various processes.  Quite a deal of work has been done.  The actual number of staff is 135, equating to approximately 116 whole-time equivalents.<\/p> <p>  On the suggestion of just one agency, let me be clear.  Regardless of whichever agency has dealt with a matter to date, the same legal complexities have prevailed.  This view is not shared by everyone, but it is an important point to make.<\/p> <p>  As to one agency holding all of the information or conducting all tracing in future, we are a State organisation and whether that happens is fundamentally a decision for the Government.  If the Government decides it is best to do that work in one place, then that is what is best and in the interests of the people.  If the Government decides that, pragmatically speaking, the expertise of the authority and the agency combined is the best place to start from, we would support that view and carry out our functions fully in line with what they were intended to be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021061500002#E00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard Gloster"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":275,"content":"<p>I am in Leinster House.

We are saying that, based on the needs each person might identify for him or herself, we or some other organisation should have a statutory duty to provide it if requested.<\/p> <p>  The second point I attempted to allude to was the potential need for a slightly different consideration for people between the ages of 16 and 18.

Counselling is helpful in that situation as much as any but counselling should be provided for all who require it.  If time allows and members want us go into more detail on the quantity-quality issue we were debating, my colleagues can do that.  We are concerned about expectation.  When people hear Tusla has 70,000 records, some will have the perception that Tusla has 70,00 comprehensive details with all the records, details, information and clarification.  It might be much less than that.  Depending on where and what part of history they came from and how they were compiled, there could be accuracy issues.  For example, an accuracy issue arose, evidenced in the RT&Eacute; Investigates programme \"Who Am I?\", regarding two people being connected to each other who were subsequently found not to be related.

Third, the Bill states that adopted people applying for birth certificates whose natural parents have registered a no-contact preference must attend an information session before the birth certificate will be released.

For example, touching on the notion of the file, there might be an archive specialist or somebody who is excellent in advocacy and support.  The definitions around who will provide that information must be scoped out in more detail.

On the information meeting and the counselling, what struck me was that there are two separate heads in the Bill on this issue.  One relates to the information meeting, which is for adopted persons, and the other is about counselling supports, which are offered to the birth parents.  In both situations, the Bill only makes those provisions in cases where there is a no-contact preference.  I would like to view all of this as a supportive measure.  Deputy Cairns suggested that we are trying to warn adopted people in some way about the need to respect the privacy rights of the parents.  I do not like to look at it in that way.  I like to see this as a supportive measure.  If it is to be a supportive measure, the Bill as it stands only offers it in one circumstance, which makes it look more like a warning.  I do not think that is what we want to achieve.  If we are going to have it as a supportive measure I would rather see it offered to both adopted persons and the birth parents in all cases.  That raises a knock-on question.  For birth parents it is an option or right to access counselling services but not an obligation, whereas the Bill makes it a condition of access to birth information to attend the information meeting.  That right could be replicated across both cohorts or we could make the meeting an option for all.  My main concern is that this should be seen as a supportive measure and not some form of warning exercise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021061500002#G00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor O'Mahony"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":297,"content":"<p>My colleagues have comprehensively covered the range of possibilities and I do not necessarily disagree with any of them.

A no-contact preference might be difficult for some people to hear and the purpose of the information session is to ensure that information is delivered properly.

Senator Higgins and I, and a few others, have been part of this conversation since 2016 and there was a time when we did not think we would even get to this point.  We were blankly being told \"No\", that the balance could not be found and so on.  It is a good sign that we have moved the conversation along to this point.<\/p> <p>  I take Deputy Cairns's point about the information meeting.  I had to pull myself back originally.  I am not an adopted person so I cannot speak from that point of view but as someone working on this issue, the meeting felt like something that would be better than where we are.  Sometimes we need to go back and ask what that compulsory meeting means for people and whether they really need to have it.  The general feedback I get from adopted people is that they do not want to be framed constantly as a burden, as something to be frightened of or something that can show up on people's doorsteps.  It is about battling some of those myths.  If we could find a way of doing that which is more supportive than this compulsory obligation on adopted persons to attend a meeting, that would be preferable.<\/p> <p>  The AAI and Tusla will play an important role in this.

I also wish to thank everyone today.  It has been very informative.  Many of my questions have also been asked already.  One of the biggest concerns I have is about the information request and the lack of any enforcement mechanisms.  Information is of critical importance and is crucial.  I would like that to be looked at.<\/p> <p>  As for people who wish to receive counselling, that is welcome but we also spoke about other required supports.  Perhaps that can be looked at and we could find out what is available, because it is important that all supports are in place.  We spoke about resources today.  I note Ms Traynor stated \"Due to limited resources and challenges in recruiting social workers, the authority currently has a two-year-plus waiting list for services.\"  That is a matter of significant concern because while we all welcome this Bill and have been waiting for it for a long time, it must happen in a way that is right.  When it does, the services have to be there and they must be delivered.  That is one of the most crucial things I will take away from today.<\/p> <p>  I refer to enforcement and ensuring that people can access their information.  I welcome the apology that Mr. Gloster gave on that today.  How can this be remedied and how can we see change occurring here?<\/p><p>People have been hurt.  We cannot ever let that happen again.  All of us have worked with different people and survivors over the past few months, especially on the commission's report into the mother and baby homes.  I feel that this hurt cannot ever happen again.  I ask that we remedy this, and that we are never in that position again.<\/p><p> It is great to see everyone here working together, but I also have a concern about communication.  Everybody working together, including Tusla, the support groups and the adoption services, means that communication will be critical.  It is about everybody working together to make sure that we get the Bill right, and that includes us as Deputies and Senators.  We may need to have more information sessions for people.  Do we need to look at what we can do to ensure the Bill we deliver is right and that the services required are delivered?  That is one of the biggest issues today.  I thank all the witnesses for coming.  It was very informative.  I had other questions, but most of them have been answered.

Mr. Gloster has spoken about this in the past.  It is not just in adoption services; it is right across the board.  A range of supports could be put in place that do not have to be focused solely on social work provision.  Many adopted adults are happy to meet with an advocate or another professional.  We can put in a range of resource supports, both through the Adoption Authority of Ireland and Tusla.  We must offer people choice in the types of support and the way they receive such support, counselling and guidance.   It may not be that all persons wish to receive counselling.  They may wish to have an information meeting with an archivist specialist or with an advocate, as I said earlier.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021061500002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia Carey"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":321,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  Dr. O'Mahony made observations on the enforcement question.  The Deputy's view on supports other than counselling is a very good lens through which to look at this.  Counselling is not for everybody, or it is not for everybody at that point in time.  For other people it is often practical assistance to connect them with other personal or health-related social services.  It must be very broad.  This is why the skill set, as referred to by Ms Carey, which is beyond but not exclusive to social work, would help both the social work and would help people with regard to time.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of the apology, one of the things I want to say is that the debate about the law and what the law did or did not allow around people's access to identity has long since been aired.  I do not believe there is anything more I can say other than as a State agency we were obliged, and are obliged, to operate within the law.  Notwithstanding this, the frustration, pain, hurt and anger people have described around not being able to get their basic identity is their experience.  Inasmuch as we are the people who had to be party to that decision or deliver it, or be at the provision end of that, this is why the range of the apology is important.  This is why it goes far beyond the story of the mother and baby homes commission piece, because that is not the total story of adoption either.  I want it to be much broader than that and to talk about people's own sense of their experience of having had to engage with both sets of State agencies that were the main drivers of the management of records for the past couple of years.  I would not want to qualify it beyond that because it could do a disservice to them.<\/p> <p>  On the question of how \"we cannot ever let that happen again\", it is one of the greatest phrases if one looks at every inquiry into personal and social services in Ireland or every health-related inquiry when things have turned out to be not good, totally unsatisfactory, or have gone completely wrong.  We produce inquiries that are helpful and instructive but our response as human beings is that this cannot happen again.  Access to information is in whatever is the final version of the Act to come out of the Bill we are discussing today.  This is how that will \"never happen again\". <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021061500002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard Gloster"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":322,"content":"<p>Would Dr. O' Mahony care to add anything on those questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021061500002#J00500","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":323,"content":"<p>The enforcement issue was considered with head 13, which is just one stage of the process where Tusla or the Adoption Authority of Ireland make a request to a third party for information needed to assist in the process of tracing.

There is a period where there is an opportunity to register a non-contact preference, which is set as three months.  I noted in one of the submissions a desire that this would be for much longer.  My fear, however, is that the period we establish is a period for which there would be a stay on the right to access information.  I would welcome a comment on the effects of lengthening that period.<\/p> <p>  We talked about the records being in one place and that it would be better if they were under one roof.  I understand that in setting out the heads, a conscious choice was made to first provide the right of access and then over the course of time gather the information separate to that, with a right of access as quickly as possible.  It was considered that this was the best way to discharge the enormous obligation and entitlement for access to personal information.  Perhaps Ms Mugan could answer my question on this.  How long would it take to gather everything in one place?  What sort of a trade-off would we have to make on that?<\/p> <p>  My third question is on counselling.  Mr. Gloster referred to the counselling by Barnardos, which has been a success, and most certainly I have heard that.  I have also heard, however, from people who have had the experience of finding out that everything about their identity was incorrect and that they were obliged to go to the Barnardos service.  It is called \"family counselling\".  In light of the fact that these are people who have discovered, perhaps late in life, that the family they thought they had was not their family, from what is written and documented, they found this terribly insensitive.  Perhaps we need to apply this going forward and we need specialists who do not use the words \"family\" in their title.  Perhaps we need a bespoke counselling service that deals with attachment and trauma, the consequences of the person's attachment, and what happens when the person finds that his or her lifelong attachment has been the subject of misinformation, at its kindest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021061500002#J00800","speaker":"1682"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":326,"content":"<p>I will address the issue of the three-month window.  We have to balance trying to get the information out to as many people as possible.  As the Chair mentioned, we must communicate with the diaspora of the adopted around the world.  The last time there was a national communication was in 2005, which was for the national adoption contact preference register.  At the time every household in Ireland received an information leaflet about the register.  We would ask for that again.  We would also ask for an international campaign through our embassies via the Department of Foreign Affairs.<\/p><p>It is important as it gives people an opportunity, not only if they wish to register \"no contact\", but also if they wish to register.  Many birth parents have moved around the world, maybe for reasons of trauma from being in Ireland, as have adult adoptees.  We ask that consideration would be given, in terms of balance, that that window would be slightly longer than three months.  I think 12 weeks is a huge ask, in terms of the resources and the pressures.<\/p><p> The other question asked  was about gathering all the files into one place.  The Adoption Authority of Ireland, as the statutory holder of every legal adoption file in Ireland, and the Child and Family Agency both hold a significant number of agency files.  As I said earlier, we have worked with the National Archives of Ireland for the last five years in terms of developing ourselves as a place of deposit and that the files would be held at National Archives of Ireland standards.  Into the future, there are plans for a national adoption and memorial archive.  At the moment, however, the files are split between the Child and Family Agency and the Adoption Authority of Ireland.  By the end of the year, all of the formal adoption society files will be either with the Child and Family Agency or with ourselves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021061500002#J01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia Carey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":328,"content":"<p>I call Dr. O&rsquo;Mahony.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021061500002#K00200","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":329,"content":"<p>On the medium term, I am sensitive to the issues expressed by colleagues about the logistical challenges they face and respect their position.  At the same time, we have to try to remember the background and context of all of this, in terms of how long it is taken to get to this point.  In some cases, the clock is ticking for people who want to access information.  Very long lead-in times sometimes make me nervous, if we think about the legislative process and about how long it will take to get from pre-legislative scrutiny, through to the actual enactment and signing into law of this Bill and then through to commencement of the Bill.  We must not forget that there can often be a delay between something being signed by the President and then commenced by the relevant Minister.  The clock starts ticking again on a lead-in time period.<\/p> <p>  What occurs to me in my experience is that I started my legal career working on issues around special educational needs, SEN, law.  I wrote my PhD on the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004.  It was enacted 17 years ago and has still not been commenced by the relevant Minister.  This partially happened because that Act was enacted with a long lead-in time.  Then, things on the ground changed and it never came into effect.  Long lead-in times, therefore, make me nervous, because of that particular experience with that legislation.  If a little bit more time than three months is needed, I would defer to my colleagues' view on how long they might need.  However, I would urge the importance of avoiding going too far with that.  I would also emphasise that the gap between enactment and commencement may afford a window of time during which preparatory work can be done to get everything in place, so that they can make the best use of the time following commencement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021061500002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Conor O'Mahony"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":330,"content":"<p>I call Mr. Gloster.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021061500002#K00400","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":331,"content":"<p>I will defer to Ms Mugan on some of the specifics on the point Senator Seery Kearney raised.  However, I absolutely hear the concern about the three months and what can be done on this.  I equally share the concern on how long it goes.  Whatever the provision is, if the provision is three months, there has to be some extendable provision beyond that, for people who are not captured within the three months or who are not identifiable.  That may be one way to look at that.  To be fair to the Adoption Authority of Ireland, as the responsible body for the register, I would defer to its insight into that.  Three months is short in many ways.<\/p> <p>  On the information in one place, I do not dispute that.  I firmly believe in the nature of the records we have.  This could be said about any part of Ireland&rsquo;s statutory health and personal social service systems.  If one were to gather all of the records to try to cohort them in one place with one entity, the time it would take would distract from the need for the right of access first.  It is right of access first.  After that, it is the issue of location and best practice location.<\/p> <p>  I hear the point about the terminology that can surround personal social services, including counselling.  I have not yet encountered a terminology challenge, when it comes to the State talking about the provision of services.  No matter how well-intended anyone's contribution is in that, words mean things.  They can mean different things to different people.  Sometimes it is hard to get that right, but it is a fair observation.

They are all from the National Anti-Bullying Research and Resource Centre at DCU.  The witnesses are attending to brief the committee on school bullying and its impact on mental health.  Before I begin, I thank the centre for its invaluable assistance to the committee.  Our seminal meeting with the centre on 5 November had a profound impact, as evidenced by the extensive media coverage seen in recent months.  Our examination followed on from that meeting.  I am speaking on behalf of the committee when I say that it has proved a worthwhile and important piece of work.<\/p> <p>  The format of the meeting is that I will invite Professor O'Higgins Norman to make an opening statement, which will be followed by questions from members of the committee.  Each member has a six-minute slot to ask questions and the witness will respond within those six minutes.  If there is time left over, I will allow members to contribute again.  As Professor O'Higgins Norman is probably aware, the committee will publish his opening statement on our website following the meeting.<\/p> <p>  Before I begin, I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect of they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Witnesses are giving evidence remotely from a place outside of the parliamentary precincts and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity as a witness who is physically present does.  Witnesses have already been advised of this issue and they may believe it appropriate to take legal advice on same.  I remind witnesses of the long-standing practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of a person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory regarding an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed by me to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.<\/p> <p>  I call Professor O'Higgins Norman to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021061500002#A00400","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":354,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for inviting us to attend this meeting.  We are happy to be able to help the committee in its work on school bullying and mental health.  DCU's anti-bullying centre is located in the DCU Institute of Education and staff at the centre have been doing research and education on bullying for 25 years.  In addition to our research activity, the centre delivers a number of educational resources, including the FUSE programme, which is a nationwide anti-bullying and online safety programme for primary and post-primary schools.<\/p> <p>  As outlined in our various submissions, previous research has consistently shown that being involved in bullying as a target, bully or bystander at school can be associated with a number of mental health problems, including psychosomatic complaints, anxiety, depression and suicidal ideation.  Issues of identity seem to remain at the heart of bullying behaviour.  One report from UNESCO involving 144 countries found that physical appearance was the top reason for being bullied.  Closer to home and in terms of identity, a recent study at our centre found that teachers of religious education had specific concerns about students who were practising Catholics being targeted for bullying more than those who did not practise a religion.<\/p> <p>  It is well established in research that negative childhood experiences have a negative effect on the development of a child, particularly when the bullying is related to identity.  Our research shows that school principals understand and recognise this.  The next step then should not be to go over old ground any longer, but to think critically about how we can prevent bullying.  Our research shows that this is the piece that principals are less sure about.<\/p> <p>  There have been some significant developments at policy level in terms of school bullying, most significant of which was the introduction of the Action Plan on Bullying and the related procedures for primary and post-primary schools as well as Circular 0045\/2013, all of which comprised a landmark in educational policy relating to bullying prevention and intervention in schools.  We suggest that the Action Plan on Bullying be audited to ensure that it continues to be informed by up-to-date research and evidence, is connected to subsequent policies on child protection, well-being and relationships and sexuality education, RSE, and is benchmarked against the recommendations that were recently published by UNESCO's scientific committee on tackling bullying and cyberbullying in schools.  Such a brief audit of the action plan and procedures to ensure that they comply with UNESCO's recommendations will not be overly burdensome, nor will it allow us to be distracted from the continuing task of implementing the action plan and procedures in schools today.  Separately, there is a need to provide further support to assist schools in implementing the requirements of the action plan and procedures while also ensuring that, possibly through the Department's inspectorate, schools continue to prioritise bullying prevention and intervention as part of a whole-of-education approach.<\/p> <p>  Regarding bullying policy, we warn against the dangers of conceptual pluralism where issues like bullying prevention and intervention are conflated with concepts such as well-being and positive school culture, as this may result in a dilution of the focus and efforts required to tackle bullying and cyberbullying fully among children and adolescents in our schools.<\/p><p>Parents and schools are rightly concerned about issues related to cyberbullying and online safety.  Moderation of cyberbullying content and behaviours on social media and online gaming platforms is improving and increasingly relies on proactive artificial intelligence, AI, with the aim of identifying bullying before it is reported by a user.  Published information on bullying content that is detected proactively would be more meaningful if we had more information, such as the overall incidence of bullying involving minors on a given platform and what supports were provided.  To that end, it will be increasingly important to ensure interdepartmental collaboration between the Departments responsible for the action plan and procedures, the online safety and media regulation Bill, as well as the implementation of Coco&rsquo;s law.  Furthermore, in addition to their role in preventing bullying behaviour within schools, school staff need to understand they also have a role under the action plan and procedures regarding bullying that occurs outside of school, including online.  Consequently, mechanisms to support closer collaboration between communities, school communities, social media-gaming platforms and statutory agencies will be required.  This has already started informally, for example, between Dublin City University, Facebook and the Department of Education regarding the roll-out of our FUSE anti-bullying and online safety programme.  The results of our current fieldwork suggest this could also include greater collaboration directly between schools and online platforms in reporting abusive content. <br\/><br\/>Over the past three years, we have translated our research on school bullying and cyberbullying into a programme of resources for schools.  This programme, called FUSE, was made possible with financial support from Facebook, Rethink Ireland and the Department of Education.  At the heart of the FUSE programme is the aim of building capacity in schools to tackle bullying and online safety and to empower children and adolescents to understand their own behaviour, be able to recognise bullying and online safety risks and to be confident in how to report and seek support when they need it.  So far, more than 12,000 students have been registered on the programme across 127 schools in every county.  Evaluations show the majority of those who complete the programme have increased their self-efficacy in noticing, responding and reporting bullying and online safety issues. <br\/><br\/><b><\/b>On the question of what to do next, based on national and international research, we recommend there be an audit of the action plan on bullying and the procedures to ensure they continue to be informed by the latest research and comply with UNESCO&rsquo;s whole-education approach.  We need further fieldwork to understand why some schools are encountering challenges in implementing the existing action plan and procedures.  We need to increase transparency from schools, social media, gaming and other online platforms on how they are handling reports of bullying and cyberbullying.  We need greater awareness raising of the vulnerability of students based on identity.  We need greater involvement from the Department of Education&rsquo;s inspectorate in supporting schools to implement, review and take action on bullying prevention and intervention programmes.  Schools need to have appropriate access to counselling for those negatively affected by bullying.  We also believe schools need to be required to provide specific hours each year to implement an approved programme of resources such as the FUSE programme to teach about bullying prevention within a whole-education approach and alongside social personal and health education, SPHE, relationships and sexuality education, RSE, and well-being frameworks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021061500002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Professor James O'Higgins Norman","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":356,"content":"<p>I thank Professor O'Higgins Norman for his presentation.

Who should be involved in recording the metrics?  I imagine it would be the companies but what exactly are we talking about?<\/p> <p>  Does Professor O&rsquo;Higgins Norman consider there is a need for a digital safety commissioner or similar who would have some element of oversight?  These tech companies have the facility, as Professor O'Higgins Norman referenced, of using AI from the perspective of having a general ability to notice this type of behaviour.  He also spoke about the need for greater collaboration with schools, which we would need to facilitate.  How would that relationship work?  What would be the structure and enforcement powers, for want of a better term?  How would we see the outworkings of that?

We typically talked about whole-school approaches to tackling bullying and cyberbullying.  However, now we are looking at a different type of world, a much more joined-up world, both online and offline.  The idea that a school would be left to deal with an issue like bullying or cyberbullying on its own would not work.  We suggest there is a role for the school, as part of the wider education system and societal system, to be connected in some way with the online safety commissioner or directly with social media companies or gaming companies, which might have a facility to report negative and abusive content that is not picked up by AI.  For example, one suggestion we make is that there be a trusted person in each school to whom children or parents could report if they are concerned about something going on in the school that has made its way online, and there would be a speedy communication line directly to someone who could do something about it, whether that be in the social media company, the gaming platform or at a regulatory level with respect to the online safety commissioner.  There needs to be a formal structure in place for that.<\/p> <p>  We know AI is working to a certain extent when it is used by social media and gaming platforms but we do not have a full picture of how well it is working.  Many of the metrics are collected internally by the private companies and access to those is quite limited from a research point of view.  We are flagging that the more information we have, the more we will be able to decide in wider society how effective these AI methods are.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021061500002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Professor James O'Higgins Norman"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":359,"content":"<p>Two points arise.  We need to make sure those metrics are provided, be it to a digital safety commissioner or whomever it may be, and ensure that officeholder has sufficient resources to deal with that issue.  We also need a best practice communication line, particularly, as Professor O'Higgins Norman said, if there is a trusted person in a school to whom such communication could be made.  People understand that.  While we may get the best case scenario of dealing with gaming companies and so on, legislation may be required to ensure they comply with certain rules to ensure we have a decent level of interaction.  I assume Professor O'Higgins Norman is calling for us to put a structure in place to ensure we get the metrics and have best case communication protocols.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021061500002#B00500","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":360,"content":"<p>Yes, exactly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021061500002#B00600","nonspeaker":"Professor James O'Higgins Norman"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":361,"content":"<p>That is a straightforward ask.

They will need a more specialised level of therapeutic intervention.  Something that has come up in our research is that access to this type of therapeutic intervention is not always immediately available or clearly immediately available to schools.  Something on this would be very helpful to provide the service for those who need it.  Not everybody who experiences bullying would need this type of care but for those who do need it, it should be easily accessible and readily available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021061500002#B00800","nonspeaker":"Professor James O'Higgins Norman","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":364,"content":"<p>Let us accept that what we really need is the best case scenario with regard to removing as much bullying as possible, and this is having a community-based programme and a connection with social media and gaming companies.

Our FUSE anti-bullying and online safety programme, which we deliver from the centre, is based on our research.  We are gathering data all the time when we are rolling it out.  It is designed to fuse together, which is where the name comes from, the agency of the children themselves, the concerns of the parents and the professionalism of the teachers.

The FUSE programme is evidence based.  It is linked to the nine components of the whole education approach.  FUSE shows up in each of these nine components, whether looking at student agency, education of the teachers, policy and policy development.

I thank the witnesses for their work and their presentations as we begin our research into bullying.  We have dealt with many groups.  I thank the witnesses for the two detailed submissions they have made and I have a number of questions.  The witnesses have recommended an audit on the action plan on bullying.  Principals now have a mandate to go forward and allocate staff.  The witnesses have pointed out that only 51% of schools have appointed a specific member of staff to investigate and tackle bullying in schools.  Less than half of schools, 45%, have researched and identified a specific anti-bullying programme to use in the school.  What would this audit look like?<\/p> <p>  My next question is for Dr. Mair&eacute;ad Foody on the statistics.  She mentioned a sample of 900 schools.  What is the breakdown between primary and post-primary schools in the responses received and the statistics given?  My next question is for Mr. Heaney as the operations manager.  What is the role of the school board and parents' associations in what he has seen to date?  My next question is on the roll-out.

It took a lot of work to come up with the action plan and its procedures.  Some people have asked for a new action plan or new procedures.  Before we go down this road we believe it would be better to audit the national action plan to see how it measures up against more recent research and the latest in terms of international practice on whole education approaches, such as what was published by UNESCO last year.

It is also about linking in with other key policy developments to supports schools, for example the Inclusive Education Framework developed by the National Council for Special Education.  It is a very important policy document to support schools in that way.  It is important that we are building up capacity within schools.

I thank the witnesses for presenting to us today and for taking time out from their busy schedules to discuss this really important issue.  I will not repeat what other members have said.  I will keep it really short.  I was really struck by what Professor O'Higgins Norman said about image and how research has shown a lot of children get bullied because of image.  Is that because of the colour of a child's skin, for example?  A lot of time people would look and say a child is a member of the Traveller community or that he or she is poor because he or she does not have the top-class runners other children in the class have.  Thus I am wondering about the whole area of image and what was spoken about there.<\/p> <p>  Has there been any research around bullying done on the grounds of a child's ethnicity, culture or race?  It is a similar question.  I refer to research on cultural or racial discrimination with the purpose of identifying whether or not this type of bullying has different effects and impacts than personal bullying.  While it is not nice to speak about, unfortunately this bullying can be carried out by teachers.  It is absolutely necessary we develop studies on bullying.  Will the witnesses speak to the committee about the research to date on racial bullying?  It is not about blaming teachers, or anything of the sort, but unfortunately bullying can come from the adults in the room as well as the children there.<\/p> <p>  Again, I would be interested in hearing more around what was said about image.  Is it the child with the cheap runners on his or her feet?  Is it the trans child with short hair?  That question can be for any of the witnesses.

Maybe the professor asked me to speak because I am one of the principal investigators on a project we ran recently.  It has just completed at the anti-bullying centre.  We looked at the experience of bullying among the Roma community in Ireland.  There are many other examples where identity or culture might influence a child's likelihood of being a victim of bullying.  The research we conducted, and our findings from that research, actually show it is not that straightforward.  There are a lot of different things we need to consider, especially if we think about ethnic minority groups like the Roma or members of the Traveller community in Ireland.  Classroom composition is important.  How many other members of the Traveller community are in a child's class might also affect whether or not he or she is a victim.  Social networks, having good leadership in the school and all those things influence it so we cannot really say that if a child is a member of one community he or she is more likely to be bullied.  It is not so straightforward.  What we can tell, and what the research is very clear on, is respect for diversity decreases bullying.  If there is a school culture that is positive and that promotes, acknowledges and encourages diversity and difference then there will be less bullying.  That is probably a better way to look at it than to think about who is highest risk and who is going to be a victim.  It is more like asking how we can prevent everyone from being a victim of bullying.<\/p> <p>  Somebody else may want to jump in on the other questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021061500002#D00900","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mair&eacute;ad Foody"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":383,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for her question.

I have published research in recent years on bullying towards native and immigrant children and the reasons for bullying of native and immigrant children.  We found that, according to the children's thinking, bullying towards migrant children is very much related to contextual factors, to stereotypes and prejudices that come from family, school, teachers and media.  There is a process of learning prejudices and stereotypes concerning migrants which strongly affect bullying towards migrants.  Interestingly, some of the children who were interviewed, who were first- and second-generation immigrant students, reported they experienced forms of discrimination from teachers as well and that sometimes teachers tended to underestimate their family background, and associated their national background with poverty and low skills and low school achievement.

I am interested to know if the witnesses have listened to those contributions and if they feel there are additional things we should be especially aware of coming out of today, which need to be a focus within a report and for us to get down to the granular detail of it.<\/p> <p>  Following on from Senator Flynn, with whom I sit on the Joint Committee on Key Issues affecting the Traveller Community committee and of which she is the Chair, what is interesting is we on that committee have done some training, facilitated by the Chair, on our own biases.  I wonder if teachers across the board are doing that.  In any workplace, that needs to be a feature, but here we are concerned with the education system.  Much of what happens in schools is either a reflection of what is going on in the wider society or that the school system is not set up in a way which reflects the wider society.  If biases exist in the adult world, they are likely to be replicated in the child's world.  If they are not and if there is more happening in the schools, it is likely the school is not set up in a way which reflects adult society.  Neither of those things is the correct approach.<\/p> <p>  With regard to respect for diversity and promoting diversity, that was a really interesting piece of research Dr. Foody had undertaken.  What would that look like?  I note the comments on practising Catholics in the witnesses' opening statement, which has not come up previously.  What could be changed to make all of our schools more accommodating of those from different religious backgrounds?<\/p> <p>  It is concerning overall that schools are struggling to implement a plan.  I want to put that on the record.  It is concerning for us all.  It is not just about identifying what more we can do and what changes in policy need to happen around bullying.

It proves to be a very interesting experience with student teachers.<\/p> <p>  Interestingly, that has been called for, especially for principals or teachers moving into the role of principalships within schools, in terms of the notion of leadership and leading an inclusive school.

I meant to answer that question already.  It links with what has been said by my colleague, Dr. Gorman, about schools having hegemonic cultures, in terms of a set of assumptions about everybody and the way people will live their lives.  We are in a particular place in our society in which we have become more pluralist.  Things have changed and it is no surprise people who practise religion, and maybe practise the Catholic religion, are increasingly in the minority, especially young children and teenagers in schools.<\/p> <p>  One of the studies we has done recently has shown a concern among religion teachers about what they are observing among students who are practising Catholics and are being targeted for that, more than a concern about kids who are not practising a religion.  That is coming through now and sits well with international research on that, in that when a particular world view or religion has had a dominant position in society and that changes, it often results in those who adhere to that being targeted and being seen as old-fashioned or out of the mainstream culture.  With bullying, when people are seen to be different, they often stand out and are more likely to be targeted when it comes to bullying.<\/p><p> In terms of addressing that, we need to promote in our schools an idea of the understanding of difference, that difference is the norm, no two people are the same.  All our teacher training, continuing professional development, and curricula across the whole school programme must be linked to the understanding of a human being, where we understand that difference is a good thing and that we appreciate that.  That calls for the need to look at what we teach, the way we teach and who is teaching in our schools, and the assumptions that underline all of that.

It addressed workload issues and curriculum overload as well.  When one goes down the route of promoting respect and celebrating diversity, it is important that it is done in the school culture and fitted into and embedded within the existing school curriculum, so that teachers will have more confidence when delivering sensitive topics.  What was key to that project was giving both teachers and parents the skill sets to have these conversations with their children and to teach these topics in the classroom context.

In particular, my PhD was focused on moral disengagement which is the tendency to justify immoral behaviours.  Children who bully their peers show high levels of moral disengagement.  The tendency to justify immoral conduct is socialised within the peer groups.  We know from the research that in classrooms where there is a high tendency to collectively morally disengage, children bully their peers more - in other words, children tend to justify bullying.  They think it is something that is admissible and tolerated.  They also tend to put the blame on the target for having provoked the bullying.  Morality is one of the components that is associated with bullying perpetration.  There are also some variables related to family functioning.  In dysfunctional families, for instance, in families with low levels of cohesion and communication, children are more likely to bully their peers.  This is also based on some of my research findings.

That is probably as a result of the increased awareness that young people as well as adults have of what bullying is, what constitutes bullying and the harms of bullying.  That is definitely in contrast, like the Deputy said, to the literature or research that was conducted earlier, in the past 20 years or so, when we did not even know what bullying was or what we were talking about.  Now it is clear that everyone recognises that there are very severe, long-term negative effects of bullying.  That is one of the reasons.  There are also increased amounts of money and time put into anti-bullying programmes, which are working in some cases.<\/p> <p>  Apart from that, it is important to say that, according to at least the Irish data and a lot of the international data, traditional and offline bullying is still more prevalent than online bullying, so the former is still there and has not gone away.  We just have to look at human nature, and even adults and workplaces, to know that it probably will not go away, but we are looking for it to be at least reduced further with the work we do.<\/p> <p>  On the cyberbullying side of things, Dr. Mazzone might want to comment on some of her work.  Cyberbullying, as I said, is not as prevalent as traditional bullying but its impact can be more severe in some cases.  One incident of cyberbullying might be enough for somebody to feel so isolated and alone that his or her mental health comes under severe pressure, whereas offline bullying might continue for a little more time before that person would need to seek help.  The face of cyberbullying is changing because we have so many different apps, devices, methods and means, including photos and videos, to cyberbully or to harm somebody, so that is an ever-evolving space.  Again, however, in general it is considered less prevalent than offline bullying.  Even on that point, though, it is really important we do not focus too much on these distinctions because young people are usually victims in both spaces or bullying in both spaces and are often in both spaces at the same time.  They might be online and offline talking to their friends at the exact same time, so even trying to distinguish between how prevalent bullying is in one area or one space as opposed to another is kind of futile.  We have these prevalence rates in order that we can look at the impact of our interventions, but it is really important we just think about victimisation, whatever its shape, and the impact of it, whether it happens online, offline or both.  We are just concerned with young people's experiences.<\/p> <p>  I do not know whether anyone else wants to speak about prevalence or anything else.

In addition, there is qualitative research showing that children tend to trivialise bullying.  Oftentimes they do not react when bullying happens because they are used to a certain type of language, which is offensive and harmful to some targeted children.  My point is that bullying can take subtle forms.  Of course it is a good and an encouraging result that instances of physical forms of bullying are tending to decrease thanks to the whole education approach but, at the same time, we need to address and raise awareness of subtle forms of bullying.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021061500002#G01000","nonspeaker":"Dr. Angela Mazzone"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":414,"content":"<p>I will preface it by saying I do not think there is a level of bullying we should accept within our society.

Following on from what Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh asked about where Ireland stands relative to other countries, a question Dr. Mazzone answered pretty comprehensively, what do we know, if anything, about the shape of our school system?  Much is made, for example, about school patronage and the fact that the majority of school patronage is in Catholic hands, as it were, even though society has changed and there is a need for more diversity in the future.  I think everybody agrees about that, but some sought to put in issue the question of whether faith-based patronage is a part of the problem in the context of bullying.  I hope the Christian tradition in particular would be a culture that would seek to counter bullying.  I have asked about that in the past.  Last week, Professor Hymel referred in passing to the decline of faith as perhaps a contributor to the problem of moral disengagement, which is a phrase used by either Dr. Mazzone or Dr. Keating.  What do we know about school form or ethos?  Is there any information as to how that helps or hinders the fight against bullying?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021061500002#H00600","speaker":"1673"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":423,"content":"<p>I suppose the operative ethos of a school is an important part of how people experience school.

I will go back to what we were talking about earlier about the school sitting within the whole of society and the whole education approach, where we look at the school as being influenced by society and sometimes not quite catching up with where society is or not reflecting the beliefs of parents or <i>vice versa<\/i>.

It seems that minorities are always in the line of fire for bullying.  Today's minority is not the same as yesterday's and, as a result, there is a constant need to upgrade our thinking.

The overall point is that if we can have more kindness in schools and we can have that modelled by teachers, parents and the wider community, then bullying would decrease and we would not need to be so concerned about specific identities.

There is a concern that we will get lost in all of that, but at the heart of it is the need to have more care and more kindness in schools.

The literature is quite divided.  One of the things we know from the most recent literature is that we have to be very careful when we ask children to be responsible for stopping the bullying themselves.  We do not want them to feel that they have an extra pressure, in that they are already victims and, now, it is also on them to stop the bullying.  That is a big ask for young kids.  There is also this idea that, &ldquo;Oh, they are resilient&rdquo;.  There are certainly things we can do to develop resilience but not every child would be resilient in the same scenario or in the same way, so we also have to be careful about how we use that term.<\/p> <p>  If we want to get them to a place where they can deal with bullying, we need to talk about telling and reporting, and about ways they can identify when it is happening, being a good bystander and all of these other things that will also influence bullying rates and attitudes for other children as well.  It is things we can do with all the kids, not just victims, and that we work on things like empathy, being good bystanders and making sure they have the capacity to report and tell when it is happening to them.<\/p> <p>  On the other point about parents, in addition to what Dr. Mazzone said, namely, that we do the same thing, we also need to be a good role models as parents.  We need to ask our children to be empathetic online and offline and make sure they are responsible digital citizens.  Therefore, whatever way, shape or form that takes, we are recognising that if we see something online that we do not like, we feel a sense of responsibility for dealing with that as well.  That could be one way that parents could mediate or try to influence cyberbullying, by talking to their kids about it and taking responsible actions, even if they are not the victim or the bully.

I will go into them quickly and put them all together, and the witnesses can then respond.<\/p> <p>  We have heard that the 2003 anti-bullying policy needs to be completely updated.  An interesting comment was made at last week's meeting that we need to change the language around that, and instead of saying \"anti-bullying\", we need to couch it in very positive and proactive terms.  I thought that was a very good point and I would be interested to hear the witnesses&rsquo; views.<\/p> <p>  It would seem that a problem with that policy is that it is more or less saying to schools they need to have a policy but is not very clear what those policies should be.  I had not realised until this meeting that only 51% of schools had actually complied.  I am quite surprised to hear that.<\/p> <p>  There were differing views as to whether there should be a database in regard to school bullying incidents and the type of incidents, and whether tracking these incidents and how they are dealt with should be done on a national basis.  I would be interested to hear the witnesses&rsquo; views.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the question of a roadmap, it has been very clear from the witnesses we have heard that we need to have a very clear roadmap.  There seem to be a lot of very good tools that are being used in different schools but it is a case of never the twain shall meet.  Many very good practices are being carried out and, for example, the ETB schools have a very specific policy.  A number of schools are also doing restorative practice.  I have spoken to a few principals about that and it certainly seems to be excellent in terms of dealing with the perpetrators, as well as the victims, and, of course, the bystanders.<\/p> <p>  I want to mention three other areas.  In the context of appointing an online safety commissioner, Senator Mullen spoke about cyberbullying.  There is certainly a belief that an online safety commissioner would play a very important role in that area.<\/p> <p>  Particularly since Covid, there has been a bigger conversation about education, what the importance of education is and a possible steer away from having just academic learning towards having a well-rounded, holistic young person at the end of that, who is enabled to have a broader lifestyle and broader life skills.  It even goes back to what Professor O'Higgins Norman was saying about being kind, just taking that moment to think about being kind and showing respect.<\/p><p> Finally, what is the role of the parent in collaboration with the school in dealing with bullying activity?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021061500002#J01000","speaker":"1689","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":439,"content":"<p>I will address some of those points and some of my colleagues might like to pitch in.  On anti-bullying language, there is much disagreement internationally in this field.  By calling it \"anti-bullying\", it is making a clear statement against bullying, which drives the work in that direction, but that is defining it negatively.  There is much debate on that and there are good points on both sides.  The bottom line is about trying to create an atmosphere and a reality where people do not experience bullying in schools or online.<\/p> <p>  The figure of 51% of schools relates to those that have implemented a local programme to tackle bullying.  All the schools in our research have policies in place, that is, they have all taken their lead from the national action plan on bullying and implemented a local policy.  The next step was to implement an anti-bullying programme in their schools and only about one half of schools had reported they were able to do that.  I personally believe there should be a database on which we track the level of bullying in the country, which goes back to a question one of the other members raised earlier.  Having good-quality data allows us to make informed decisions about the initiatives we use and how effective they are, so I very much support beginning to do that and building those data.<\/p> <p>  On the roadmap, the international research suggests there is not a one-size-fits-all programme or approach to tackling bullying.  Schools need to be able to draw down on resources of use to them, depending on what they are dealing with locally.  A programme such as the FUSE programme we offer, for example, provides schools with a programme of resources and an approach, and they are then able to adapt that and use it locally.  The effectiveness of saying to every school that it must do a particular programme at such a time in such a way is not always proven.  The one-size-fits-all approach is something I am cautious about.<\/p> <p>  The online safety commissioner is really important, although the role still needs to be worked out.  It is my understanding it will not be possible to make individual complaints or reports through the commissioner&rsquo;s office, which will be disappointing for people looking for somewhere to go when they feel there is nowhere else for them to go and they have tried everything else in regard to reporting the problem or seeking help with online safety issues.<\/p> <p>  As for a well-rounded education, Dr. Keating will talk about how the overall curriculums, including the social, personal and health education, SPHE, curriculum and so on, sit alongside the anti-bullying work we do.  The role of the parent is the key, going back to Senator Mullen's point.  We need to help parents such that they will feel strong and confident and have a purpose to the way in which they educate their children about bullying, both offline and online, and be able to do that in a consistent and confident way.<\/p> <p>  I might hand over to Dr. Foody to comment further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021061500002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Professor James O'Higgins Norman"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":440,"content":"<p>To follow up on the point about principals and the national action plan, that was research we conducted at the centre in which we assessed the work of principals in Ireland.  There were more than 900 respondents, so while it was not every principal, it was a good sample.  As Professor O'Higgins Norman said, that figure of 51% we talked about meant that 51% had not appointed a specific member of staff to deal with bullying cases in their school, but there were many very positive findings from the study.  Almost every school, or 99% of them, has a policy and all the principals recognised the impact of bullying on school attendance, academic achievement and mental health.  We are cautious in regard to being negative about the work that needs to be done on the procedures because principals are used to them and there is much good stuff in there.<\/p> <p>  The main finding from the work was that principals had not identified a specific anti-bullying programme.  That study and other Irish studies, including one by Corcoran and McGuckin in 2014, have found that what principals in Ireland wanted above all was support in resourcing and finding materials related to bullying and to be told by the Department what intervention they should run and what steps they should take.  They are seeking more support.  They are doing everything in their power in terms of their policies.  Our results show that perhaps assigning a specific member of staff might help.<\/p> <p>  On the point about tracking, that is a good idea and it is one place principals could start if they were given support with somehow being able to assess the level of bullying in their own school confidentially in order that they would not be afraid those data would be available or would influence their attendance rates, for example.  They should also be given support in specific areas, if they need it, for it to be reduced, and that is something the FUSE programme could fit into.<\/p> <p>  A number of member raised this research.  To clarify, it related to 900 principals from primary and post-primary - mainly the former - and covered both  DEIS and non-DEIS schools.  There was no difference in their responses depending on school type.  In general, the responses were the same, irrespective of level or school type.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021061500002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mair&eacute;ad Foody"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":441,"content":"<p>The language within the policy itself is important and it should be made accessible for parents and students.

Children&rsquo;s use of technology has become much more prevalent and there are many different social media platforms.  I have heard frightening stories of children in fourth and fifth class using Snapchat, Facebook and many other platforms.  One question I have asked every guest before the committee in recent weeks relates to how to educate parents and get into their minds.  A steady stream at all the meetings suggests that often the parents who need to be got to are the ones who will not listen, attend meetings, inform themselves, communicate with the school or get involved in it.<\/p><p>The million dollar question is how to get those parents involved.  How should we communicate with them?  How can we get a commitment from them?  How can we inform them of the dangers of social media?  Dr. Foody spoke about parents' sense of responsibility.  Everyone who brings a child into the world has a responsibility to do their best for that child.  Many parents are not doing their best for their children while allowing them on some of the terrible social media platforms that are meant for adults.  Children as young as nine, ten, 11 and 12 are using them.  They are not just using them after school, but sometimes up to 2 a.m. or 3 a.m.  Parents are allowing their children on these dangerous social media platforms until that hour of the morning unsupervised.  They do not know whom they are communicating with.<\/p><p> If the witnesses had responsibility in the Department of Education tomorrow, what additional supports would they give to primary and post-primary schools to assist the principals and teachers to support the pupils through the bullying and other difficulties they experience?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021061500002#K00600","speaker":"1619","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":445,"content":"<p>I will answer the second question.  If I were to wave my magic wand, I would give every primary and secondary school in Ireland an audit tool to assess the effectiveness of their policy every year.  This would comply with the existing oversight management which is outlined in the Department of Education procedures for schools.  It would highlight to schools what they are doing well.  We do not want to come across as telling schools precisely what they should be doing.  Schools need to understand what great work they are already doing and how to build on that work.  They should assess their policy annually and include every staff member, the caretaker, the school secretary and anyone who may potentially witness bullying behaviours in the school.  They need to be aware and have a voice so they know what to do.  If those data were centralised, it could feed into annual reports highlighting areas where schools are struggling and areas in which schools are succeeding.  That can assist in putting supports in place the following year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021061500002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Seline Keating"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":446,"content":"<p>My first question related to how to inform and collaborate with parents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021061500002#L00300","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":447,"content":"<p>The lack of engagement from some parents might be linked to them being unaware of bullying and cyberbullying and the effects of this behaviour.

How could an online safety commissioner be empowered to tackle cyberbullying?  Are social media companies doing enough to tackle bullying on their platforms?  This has been the subject of major debate at the committee in recent weeks.  I believe the policies of social media companies are not strong enough.  I believe the Government is not doing enough to tackle these social media companies and should be doing more.  I have heard some absolute horror stories, some of which have resulted in suicide by youngsters, some of them in their teens because of ongoing online bullying.  Somebody needs to take this by the scruff of the neck.  I hope that the proposed online safety commissioner will be given the power to do that.<\/p> <p>  Investment by social media companies here in Ireland contributes a considerable amount.  However, we should not be afraid to take them on, given that they are causing such harm.  Social media can be very positive, but there is also much negativity about it.  I feel sorry for some kids growing up.  When I was going to school, both primary and secondary, bullying happened within the school.  Now it goes far beyond that and comes right into the home and into a child's bedroom.  It is a dangerous tool if it is not used correctly.<\/p> <p>  I would be interested in hearing Professor O'Higgins Norman's views on the online safety commissioner.  What sorts of powers should the commissioner have in various areas particularly in tackling cyberbullying?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021061500002#L00500","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":449,"content":"<p>Social media refers to many organisations and companies.  Some of them are extremely small and are providing apps that kids can download very quickly to their phones without their parents realising the full implications of them.  It also refers to enormous corporations, such as Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and so on.  In recent years I have seen greater engagement by some of those and not so much by others in trying to deal with online safety.  Any of the companies we have worked with are very anxious to try to address these problems.  They often look to us for solutions, help and advice.<br\/><br\/>I think things are getting better.  Everyone agrees that more needs to be done.  We also need to recognise that the behaviour that makes its way onto these platforms is human behaviour that exists without the platforms.  I am not so sure we can say the platforms cause it.  For example, some of the research that looks at gaming shows that there is very little in online games that causes or produces negative behaviour, but the way people behave in those games, the way they speak to one another and the way they relate to one another can be really horrible at times.  This comes back to being a human behaviour that needs to be addressed.  Whether it is expressed on social media or elsewhere, it is a problem.<br\/><br\/>The online safety commissioner's role must be to make it as easy as possible for people to have some place to go if they have a problem.  As I said earlier, at the moment there is considerable development in artificial intelligence, AI, to address some of these issues.  However, AI can only do so much.  Education and regulation are the way forward.  People need to feel they have some kind of recourse to the online safety commissioner when everything else fails.  Before that, we need to have education and have people using these facilities in a different way from how they have been using them.  <br\/><br\/><b><\/b>The Chairman also asked what we would do if we had a magic wand.  Regarding resources for schools, as someone said earlier, time is getting squeezed out of our schools.  Every day there is increasingly less time to think and to do things that are really meaningful because teachers, parents and everyone in the school are under so much pressure.  If we had a way to give schools a bit of time, maybe cover for substitutes to allow teachers to take up continuing professional development and making time available in that way, it would be really important.  There is also a role for the school inspectorate in the whole-school evaluation and looking at how schools are handling bullying and cyberbullying issues within schools, particularly educating teachers about the fullness of their role.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021061500002#L00600","nonspeaker":"Professor James O'Higgins Norman"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":450,"content":"<p>At one of our meetings someone spoke about the curriculum at primary and secondary schools to allow for more physical exercise for pupils.

At primary level it is only 30 minutes per week.  That is where the life skills take place, the decision making, feelings and emotions and how to manage and regulate them and how pupils learn to cope with scenarios they may face.  It also includes media education.  It is very challenging for teachers to deliver meaningful lessons in a 30 minute slot.  There can be a tendency, as research has shown, that where classes run over time in other subject areas, SPHE is often the subject that gets missed out on.  The review of primary and post-primary has included significant redevelopments in valuing SPHE.  This is clear in this year's revised version of the well-being programme for junior cycle and the National Council for Curriculum Assessment, NCCA, draft primary school framework in 2020.  There is now a focus on well-being as a subject area.  From junior infants to third class, the well-being umbrellas includes SPHE and PE.

The consequence can be a narrow focus on the curriculum and then looking at practices such as ability grouping and streaming.

In recent days, we saw a very large fire in the Sharya refugee camp which destroyed 400 tents and left more than 1,000 Yazidis homeless.  Those who have returned to their home areas have very limited access to the most basic services.  Many areas are still extensively mined and have not been rebuilt.  Most importantly, there is an absence of justice, accountability and reparations after almost seven years of ongoing genocide.  In addition, there is instability in Yazidi areas due to political insecurity and geopolitical conflict between national and regional players.<\/p> <p>  To discuss these issues, we have two speakers from Yazda.  The first speaker is Ms Nasreen, a member of the Yazidi Survivor Network, YSN, and a Yazidi human rights activist.  The second speaker will be Ms Natia Navrouzov, who is one of the leaders of Yazda and the head of our documentation and legal team, as well as being our legal advocacy director.  Yazda is a global Yazidi organisation which tries to bring justice, healing and rejuvenation to vulnerable ethnic and religious minorities in Iraq and Syria who have suffered or been affected by the genocidal campaign of ISIS in 2014.  Yazda works on three main missions: humanitarian, justice and advocacy missions.  As part of our humanitarian mission for the past six years, we have been providing services and supports to survivors of the ISIS genocide, people in IDPs and refugees.  This has included, but has not been limited to, mental health, psychosocial support, case management, education, medical, healthcare, livelihood and legal supports.  Our justice mission aims to bring justice to survivors through the documentation of ISIS crimes and filing cases against those accused of persecution.  Our advocacy mission seeks recognition of the ISIS genocide and to empower survivors, like Ms Nasreen, to speak out about their experiences and anguish.  I hand over now to Ms Nasreen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021061500002#B00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ahmed Khudida Burjus"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":472,"content":"<p>Good afternoon everyone.  I apologise, my English is not very good.  I hope the committee can understand me.  I thank the committee members very much for inviting me to participate in this meeting.  I am a Yazidi human rights activist and a member of the Yazidi Survivor Network.  Perhaps not all the members of the committee may be aware of the Yazidis, so I will begin by defining us as a religious and ethnic minority who live in many parts of the world, but mainly in northern Iraq and specifically in Sinjar.  They have been subjected to many genocides, the most recent of which occurred on 3 August 2014 in Sinjar and was perpetrated by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, ISIL, also known as ISIS.  As a result of this genocide, thousands of Yazidi men were killed, thousands of women were enslaved, with many subsequently traded by their captors multiple times, children were trained as soldiers and hundreds of thousands of Yazidis were displaced.<\/p> <p>  I am one of those Yazidi women who has subjected to sexual violence in the form of rape, slavery and physical and psychological torture.  In addition, we have lost our beloved family members.  More than 5,000 of our fathers, husbands and brothers were shot and buried in mass graves.  It has been seven years since the genocide, but about 3,000 Yazidis are still missing, including 14 members of my family, whom I miss very much.  There is not enough time to talk about this genocide in detail.  I will focus on the Yazidi survivors who have been subjected to one of the most awful crimes in this century.  They are also facing many difficulties now following their liberation from ISIL captivity.  They have lost everything and they are trying to restore their lives from nothing.  Most of them live in tents in IDP camps.  Despite all these difficulties, these survivors are very brave and are advocating for their own rights and those of others.  They also work very hard in helping the authorities to bring justice for everyone.  We are fighting to prevent future genocides from happening to us and everywhere else in the world.<\/p> <p>  The Yazidi Survivors Network is an example of brave survivors who work on advocating for the rights of Yazidi survivors and the survivors of many other cases.  However, to carry out this advocacy work effectively, we require capacity building training courses in different fields.<\/p><p>We were deprived of the opportunity to continue our education because of being in captivity.  We need more education to be taken seriously and to be part of the decision-making process, especially on topics that are directly about us.<\/p><p> The main issue we now face in developing the Yazidi Survivors Network is funding.  I would like to take this opportunity to ask the committee to support the network members in any possible way so that we can support other survivors and our community in general as much as we can.  I thank the committee very much for listening.  I am sorry my English is not good.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021061500002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Nasreen","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":474,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Nasreen for her very clear and direct presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021061500002#C00200","speaker":"1589"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":475,"content":"<p>Ms Nasreen did a great job.  I thank the Chairman, Deputies and Senators for the honour of addressing the committee today.  I wish I could be there in person.  I will keep my remarks short so there is room for questions and a discussion with members.<\/p> <p>  I want to start by giving a little more background about the Yazidi Survivors Network, as mentioned by Ms Nasreen  This network brings together 15 Yazidi survivors in advocating for their rights.  The starting point of the network was a draft Bill on reparation for Yazidi female survivors presented by the Iraqi President to the Parliament in March 2019.  Although the name of the Bill was the Yazidi female survivors law, not a single survivor was involved in the drafting process.  Even though the Bill was for them and was meant to address the harm they had suffered and are still suffering, none of them was consulted.  The draft law was a good step in the right direction but it needs improvement.<\/p> <p>  To tackle these challenges, Yazda UK and Ireland brought together a group of survivors and provided them with capacity building on transitional justice, mainly on the topic of reparation.  We explained to the survivors the obligations of the state in terms of reparation and, more importantly, their rights as victims.  A core group of this network started to advocate for the improvement of the Bill and the Iraqi Parliament took some of its suggestions into consideration.  The law was passed in March this year and by-laws are being drafted to ensure its implementation.  The next step is to ensure survivors are also involved in the implementation phase, especially through a monitoring mechanism, which will need to be established.<\/p> <p>  After their experience with the Yazidi female survivors law, the survivors realised how strong their voices can be, as individuals but also as a group.  The wish to establish a formal network came from them.  Having strong voices of survivors is essential in a country where the process is often top-down.  However, to ensure these strong voices remain and become louder, we must continue to develop the network.  To pursue this important work, the survivors in the network are asking for simple things, some of which Ms Nasreen mentioned.  They are asking for further capacity building, with English classes, Arabic classes, IT classes, public speaking and advocacy lessons.  As Ms Nasreen mentioned, most of them are not able to go back to school because of the year's gap they had and because of being in ISIL captivity.  They are asking for an office space where they can meet to discuss important topics related to their community and develop advocacy strategies together.  They need funding for transportation costs, to be able to go from their camps to the office, and for mobile telephone chargers to enable them to speak to each other through WhatsApp groups and for general Internet use.<\/p> <p>  We have calculated that to fund such a campaign for the network for a year, approximately &euro;370,000 will be necessary.  It is a significant amount of money but the impact this network could have would be much greater.  Yazda UK and Ireland would welcome the opportunity of a subsequent discussion with the Minister and his officials to explore the possibility of obtaining this funding.  Just as the Irish National Teachers Organisation is helping to fund primary education for our community, we hope Ireland will be able to help fund survivor empowerment and capacity building.<\/p> <p>  I want to give another example showing why it is important to encourage and support strong victims' voices in Iraq.  At the end of April this year, the government of the Kurdistan region of Iraq presented a new draft Bill to its Parliament.  This draft law is about establishing a special tribunal in Kurdistan to prosecute ISIL suspects for international crimes.  Currently, there is no legal framework in Iraq to prosecute ISIL members for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.  Only trials under antiterrorism laws are taking place.  This draft law is a very good step in the right direction.  Such a tribunal is needed to enable justice for survivors.  Again, however, there is the same risk that the survivors are not being consulted, even though such a tribunal is meant to bring justice to them.  Therefore, the survivors will need to proactively seek to be involved in the decision-making process.  We can enable this by empowering them.  Yazda UK and Ireland is advocating for consultation with survivors and civil society to take place in regard to the draft law.<\/p> <p>  We have already had initial discussions with the Yazidi Survivors Network on this Bill and one of the main comments from survivors was that the tribunal needs to have strong international involvement because of the local mistrust towards Iraqi institutions.  To avoid history repeating itself and this tribunal facing the same challenges as the Iraqi High Tribunal, which prosecuted Saddam Hussein and his party, the international community, including Ireland, needs to be part of the process from the start, which is now.  For example, Ireland can lead European Union countries in the discussion on the tribunal to ensure the voices of survivors are heard and that the tribunal has a strong foundation and legitimacy.  I am happy to answer any questions related to the draft law during our discussion.<\/p> <p>  I would like to finish by saying that the fight against ISIL is not over.  It needs to continue in courtrooms and we need to arm survivors to face their perpetrators.  Survivors like Ms Nasreen have already taken a major step by sharing their story.  Yazda UK and Ireland alone has collected more than 2,000 statements of survivors.  We need now to take a step towards them and show them we care by empowering them and enabling accountability.  The UN Security Council did this in 2017 by creating UNITAD and the international community needs to do so again by supporting the creation of a tribunal in which all the evidence gathered can be used.<\/p> <p>  ISIL is not only an Iraqi or Syrian issue but a global one.  Initiatives such as the one in the Kurdistan region of Iraq need global support and survivors like Ms Nasreen need to see that international crimes receive an international response.  I know that at the previous meeting of this committee, the issues affecting Yazidis were raised in members' discussion with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who was presenting before the committee.  I very much welcome the points raised by a number of members on behalf of our community and their understanding of the challenges facing minority and ethnic groups in many parts of the world today.  I also put on record my appreciation for the positive responses from the Minister, Deputy Coveney.  I hope our delegation can provide further information and detail to assist the committee in any further deliberations.  I thank members very much for their attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021061500002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Natia Navrouzov"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":476,"content":"<p>I thank both witnesses for their very concise and compelling presentations.

I was particularly struck by the testimony of Ms Hassan.  It was truly brave and remarkable of her to make that statement given the lived experiences she has had to endure.  Like her, so many other Yazidi people have suffered at the hands of the barbaric terrorist organisation ISIS.  I commend the witnesses on their bravery in speaking out to try to get justice for their people.<\/p> <p>  I have a number of questions.  For a number of years, I have been following what was happening to the Yazidis at the hands of ISIS and, similarly, the people in Syria, Northern Iraq and Kurdistan.  It is appalling.  Similarly, the slowness of the international community to step in and try to provide assistance to the people when they were being slaughtered by ISIS was appalling.  What happened has left an awful lot of trauma legacy issues.  Suicide is prevalent given the extent of the trauma, the displacement of the Yazidi people and the uncertainty as to where loved ones are.  It was striking to hear from Ms Hassan there are still 3,000 people missing, including 40 members of her family.  That must serve as a message to the international community to step up to the mark and provide assistance to reunite families and find loved ones that are missing and to provide the tangible assistance laid out by the witnesses in their statements.<\/p> <p>  I have a number of specific questions.  For me, what happened to the Yazidis was genocide, pure and simple.  It is important that when a genocide takes place the international community calls it out for what it is in order that we can learn from it and hold people to account.  I will touch on the need for a tribunal later.  On the specific issue of genocide, am I correct that the UK Government is the only government that has declared what happened a genocide and how helpful would it be for the international community to state it as it is? <\/p> <p>  As a member of this committee I had the opportunity to put questions to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, when he was before us a couple of weeks ago.  I am struck that Ireland is one of a few countries that has not contributed to alleviating the difficulties and plight of the Yazidi people.  As I am aware that Concern is active on the ground in parts of Iraq and that there are particularly sensitive security issues around that, I will not prise the witnesses for information on that.  In terms of assistance from the Irish Government, what more can be given?  I note the witnesses have a specific request for &euro;368,000 to assist the excellent work they are doing.  Sinn F&eacute;in will support that.  It is the minimum the Irish Government should do.  I am sure the committee will come back to this issue in terms of some of the specific requests from the witnesses, on which, I hope, all committee members will be able to agree.<\/p> <p>  Other than financial aid, what more can Ireland do?  Ireland has a seat on the UN Security Council and is a member state of the EU.  There is a specific request that Ireland would lend its voice in regard to the tribunal.  It is critically important that survivors are listened to.  What message would the witnesses send to the Irish Government in terms of the tangible assistance needed to ensure Yazidi voices are heard within the tribunal?  Given our own conflict and attempts at conflict resolution and the peace process within Ireland, what role could Ireland play in terms of trying to negotiate a settlement?  I am aware of some of the issues in regard to Kurdistan and in terms of the international support for a tribunal.  Kurdistan still has the death penalty, as does Iraq.  That might be a problem.  The witnesses might address that issue.  If that is a problem in terms of the international community getting involved, given Ireland's involvement in the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement, what role could it play in terms of trying to get agreement and having the death penalty set aside to ensure accountability can be heeded.?<\/p> <p>  I have a couple of other questions.  Sinjar is still in ruins and the Yazidi people are dispersed across many different countries.  In terms of the rebuilding of Sinjar, for example, what commitments have been given by the international community and what work is happening on the ground to help people to rebuild their communities, livelihoods and lives in general?  In terms of recommendations, the committee should consider putting forward a recommendation on the funding to Department and the Minister in regard.  On the tribunal, Ireland needs to use its voice to ensure the voices of survivors and victims are central in that process and it is essential there is recognition that a brutal genocide against the Yazidi people was perpetrated.  I again commend the witnesses and thank them for being here, in particular Ms Hassan, whose statement was truly powerful and touching.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021061500002#D00100","speaker":"1625"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":478,"content":"<p>I will take questions from a number of members before reverting to the witnesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021061500002#D00200","speaker":"1589"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":479,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses and I thank them for their incredible and powerful statements.  My first question relates to the international process needed for the courts.  I ask the witnesses to highlight precedents where such a process has happened previously.  I refer, for example, to Rwanda where the international community and the UN Security Council has done something similar.  I would also like to know about the impediments to the international process in terms of the courts.  Would the absence of legislation in Iraq to deal with an international court hold up such a process and, if so, what can we do to encourage the Iraqi Government to pass the legislation that will be needed to collaborate on such a process?<\/p> <p>  My next question in relation to the international court pertains to Ireland and its position within the EU and on the UN Security Council.<\/p><p>What would the witnesses strongly encourage our State to do to assist in this plight?<\/p><p> Will the witnesses tell us about the education work that they take on and the support they have been receiving from the INTO in that regard, and what we can do to help support that essential work?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021061500002#D00300","speaker":"1560","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":481,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their contributions.  Ms Hassan's English is more than suitable for conveying the horror that she and the Yazidi people have experienced.  She should feel incredibly proud of the statement she made and the dignity she showed when making it.<\/p> <p>  I do not want to go over areas that have already been covered, but I will add something further on the question of the court system.  It is vital that survivors have their day in a court of law and see the perpetrators of the crimes against them stand before that court.  For that to happen, though, survivors need scaffolding.  They need multiple layers of support around them.  They need to be physically capable of standing in a courtroom.  They also need to be psychologically prepared to be there and to rebuild afterwards.  That is not an easy task.<\/p> <p>  The female survivors law is really disappointing.  It is beyond disappointing to hear that women were not included in its drafting.  That makes no sense whatsoever.  Sadly, we know from experience that sexual violence is used as a weapon in conflicts.  How likely are women to engage in the process and utilise this law if the proposed amendments are not taken into consideration and included in the final legislation?  One of the key issues for survivors is that they do not feel like they have got justice if they are not involved.  They do not feel like they have been represented if their voices are not heard.  If their voices and lived experiences are not included, it can sometimes create a barrier to utilising laws.  How do the witnesses see that playing out?  How can it be ensured that those who most need this law benefit from it?<\/p> <p>  Education was mentioned.  It is right to say that education is key.  It is the cornerstone that will change the lives of people who have experienced conflict, as it allows them to develop into fuller people.  Will the witnesses give us more detail in that regard, please?<\/p> <p>  Mention was made of the Kurdistani draft legislation.  Due to the nature of ISIS, we know that many people will have fled.  How many countries are likely to need to pass similar legislation?  If multiple countries must pass multiple laws, what impact will it have on the timeline for delivering an end result for the Yazidi people?<\/p> <p>  My final point is on the project's funding.  The project is a wonderful idea and could make a major difference to people's lives.  Will the witnesses give us more detail about it?  Will they tell us more about the potential service users, its location, its potential structure and the governance that will be put in place?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021061500002#E00200","speaker":"1495"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":482,"content":"<p>Does Ms Navrouzov wish to respond to the questions on the law?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021061500002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ahmed Khudida Burjus"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":483,"content":"<p>Yes.  I thank the Deputies for their questions, which were relevant.  I tried to write down as many as I could, so if I forget any, they might let me know.<\/p> <p>  I will focus on accountability and the tribunal.  Turning to Deputy Brady's comments, Ireland could provide support through diplomatic channels, particularly given that Ireland now sits on the UN Security Council.  It would be great to remind the Security Council that, while establishing the Investigative Team to Promote Accountability for Crimes Committed by Da'esh\/ISIL, UNITAD, was a good step, it was not enough.  What is the point in having an investigative team gathering evidence that cannot be used in Iraq?  It comes down to spending billions of dollars without serving justice to survivors at the end of the day.<\/p> <p>  I am unsure as to how aware the EU is of the draft law.  It was presented at the end of April and matters are moving forward quickly.  The Kurdish Parliament is conducting various consultations, but consultations with survivors are not scheduled yet.  Ireland and the wider EU could push for these consultations with survivors, but also for consultations with the international community, including Ireland.  ISIL is a global issue and needs to be addressed globally.  From my experience as a lawyer, Ireland has great judges.  They could sit on the tribunal or advise it.  Unfortunately, due to the lack of a legal framework, the Iraqi judiciary does not have the expertise to prosecute international crimes.  As such, capacity building is needed.  Funding for the tribunal is also much needed.<\/p> <p>  A good point was made about the death penalty.  It will be a sticking point because, with a death penalty, there will probably be no international support.  We saw the same with the Iraqi High Tribunal, for which there was a great deal of goodwill.  There was the will to prosecute international crimes, but because of the death penalty, the lack of transparency, the lack of involvement by survivors and the hearings not always being fair, the international community did not support the institution.  We need to ensure that the same does not recur if a tribunal is established.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Gannon asked about the example of Rwanda and what had happened previously.  There are different ways to have an accountability mechanism.  It could be the same one as was used in Rwanda or the former Yugoslavia, for which there was agreement between the UN Security Council and those countries through resolutions to establish a court.  That is still an option in this case if Ireland and other countries negotiate it with Iraq at a diplomatic level.  UNITAD is an example of Iraq's will in this regard, but Iraq might be too scared to deal with the issue alone.  As such, the support of the international community is much needed.<\/p> <p>  Another solution could be the International Criminal Court, ICC.  Unfortunately, Iraq is not part of the Rome Statute, but it could agree to be.  That would enable such trials in the ICC.  This is something else that Ireland could look into with Iraq.<\/p> <p>  Another option is a hybrid tribunal, that is, a mixed national and international process.  This is actually what is being suggested now.  There would be some international involvement under the draft law, in that some of the judges could be from the international community.  Unfortunately, the number is not specified.  If there was a majority of Iraqi judges and a minority of international ones, it could reduce the decision-making power of the international judges.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the Yazidi survivors Bill, it was sad to see that the survivors themselves were not involved in the process.<\/p><p>We really advocated for that.  At the end of the day, some of our recommendations were taken into consideration.  Currently, in the by-law drafting process, Yazda along with 31 other NGOs have formed a coalition that is working on reparation, which has provided a set of recommendations to the Council of Ministers in Baghdad.  We are currently working on the by-laws.<\/p><p> Our main point was to have a survivor-centred approach and put the survivor in the centre of everything we are doing.  We start by doing outreach.  Many survivors in Iraq do not know even know this law was passed.  It was discussed two years ago and it was passed in March this year.  Outreach is, therefore, needed.  It is important to ensure that survivors understand the process and know where to go to submit their paperwork.  These are very practical things whereby if no-one really deals with them then this will not enable the survivors to be part of this reparation programme.<\/p><p> Another question was regarding the Sadiki initiative and how many other countries would need to pass such laws.  I am not sure.  I know that in Europe, some trials against Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, ISIL, members for crimes against Yazidis are taking place.  There is no need as European countries already have the legal framework.<\/p><p> Other countries might need that but I am not able to tell the committee how many.  Since most of the victims are in Iraq and most of the crimes happen in Iraq and Syria, it is very important to ensure there is a legal framework in this country.  Otherwise, trials can be scattered like what is happening now.  Only a handful of trials are being conducted, for instance, in Germany.  If, however, there is no legal framework in the country where victims are or where the crimes took place, there will not be much justice served for the survivors.<\/p><p> There should also be accountability.  Iraq needs to deal with the issue in terms of broader transitional justice to enable trust-building again between the society and the country.  As I said, at the end of the day, survivors, unfortunately, do not trust the institutions anymore because they are saying the institutions did not protect us.  Having a court would, therefore, send a positive message to the community.<\/p><p> One final point from my notes was about the funding we are requesting for the Yazidi Survivors Network.  This funding would enable us to continue to empower the survivors.  Currently, we have a group of 15 survivors who are willing to get further capacity-building on public speaking, IT, Arabic, and English so that they are able to carry the messages they want to carry in Iraq but also globally.<\/p><p> As I said, unfortunately, we are not able to be there physically with the committee.  One of the things survivors want to do is travel and explain what has happened to them.  Some survivors have done that and Ms Nasreen is a great example of that.  There are, however, so many other survivors who are willing to do so and there are so many things that need to be done.  We need hundreds of survivors to be able to speak up.<\/p><p> In terms of localisation, these activities will be mainly based in Duhok, Kurdistan, where we would want an office where we would be able to build out these capacity-building sessions where survivors could meet.  This was one of the issues.  They are currently scattered in different camps.  They are not even able to meet physically to discuss what is important to their community and what they need to advocate for.  Sometimes, they are not even able to communicate virtually because they do not have the money to buy the communication methods.  As I said, the cost would be &euro;370,000.  It is a lot of money but it would also have a great impact on these survivors.  Members will see the results quite quickly and for many years.  I thank the committee.  I hope I covered the questions that were for me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021061500002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Natia Navrouzov","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":485,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Navrouzov very much.

I believe the Deputy asked a specific question so and I will quickly answer.  In terms of genocide recognition, parliaments or governments in the US, UK, Canada, Australia, Armenia, Portugal and the European Parliament have recognised the genocide.  We hope, therefore, that Ireland will follow these countries and recognise and acknowledge not only the genocide but also Isis crimes against all communities, especially the minority communities in Iraq and Syria.<\/p><p>This would be a moral support for all victims and all communities there.  It would also help as an important step towards justice.  We hope the committee will include this on its agenda.<\/p><p> There were a couple of questions about education, what we are doing now and what the needs are on the ground.  Basically, even before the ISIS attacks, Sinjar had been neglected and persecuted systematically by the current Government and, before that, by the Government of Saddam.  For example, I graduated from Sinjar.  We have almost 5 million people there, including in the surrounding area.  There is no university there.  We have an institute.  We have what we call villages.  In the village I lived in, there were approximately 30,000 people and we had only three or four schools..  This is for all the people in all the region.  What was there ISIS has destroyed and we have been left with a broken education system.   It was already broken before ISIS. This is why the needs are very great in terms of education.<\/p><p> I will give a few examples.  In an assessment over six months in Sinjar, we found that almost 30,000 students in primary, middle and secondary schools had only 120 formal teachers and 400 volunteer teachers.  For instance, a school of 600 students has only a few teachers.  There has been general spending from the international side and it has supported the provision of 35 teachers in high schools between 2018 and this January.  There have also been other initiatives from other organisations.  These are all temporary solutions, however, and only help for a short time. We need funding to rebuild schools.  We need to hire more teachers.  We also need school supplies.  We receive very small but generous support from Irish teachers' organisations, which support informal educational programmes to help children to learn English and other activities after school.<\/p><p> There was a question about other countries.  I would like to acknowledge some of the work that has been done by international organisations and countries, including the US, the UK, Germany, the Netherlands and other countries.  For example, the US has been heavily involved in providing mental health support and psychological support case management.  The Netherlands has also helped over the past two years in providing these types of supports.  There have been 700 beneficiaries, mainly survivors.  The UK has helped with demining the area.  I cannot mention all of the activities supported by all of the countries.  We thank all of them and we hope Ireland will also come forward and get involved in some activities.  What has been done is appreciated but it is really not enough.  It is very little compared to the needs of people.  As I have said, all sectors are destroyed and we need to rebuild.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021061500002#F00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ahmed Khudida Burjus","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":492,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Khudida Burjus.

First, my work as a minister centres on peace and reconciliation.  I have the privilege of working with people from all backgrounds on this island, across the UK and further afield.  Second, I believe it is critical that conversations regarding the future of Ireland extend beyond the political arena.<\/p> <p>  During our previous discussion, I argued for a citizens' assembly, as I am passionate that our conversations are not solely politically-led, but also extend to being people-led.  When one gets to the core of what matters most to people, it is not their political stance.  It is the bread and butter issues that affect all of us, concerning education, housing, healthcare, the economy and so forth.  Therefore, I am sure the Chairman and members can understand my disappointment at some comments made to my colleague, Mr. Niall Murphy, at the previous committee meeting.  One member, in an attempt to link us to a political party, publicly stated: \"If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it is a duck\".  I understand political opposition, but I kindly ask that this is not projected onto those of us who are not political.<\/p> <p>  The work of peace and reconciliation calls us to have the courage to extend beyond our own boundaries and to step into all places and spaces.  I was born into a unionist family.  My family, friends and colleagues are unionists.  I am currently involved in various projects, which include the Catholic and Protestant divide, gender equality, racism, LGBT+ rights and inter-faith work.  I write a column for Belfast Media Group.  I am a champion of progressive faith and public theology simply because I believe in equality, inclusion and creating a fair society for all.  I have had the privilege of serving as chaplain to two Lord Mayors of Belfast.  It was an honour to champion our city.  My reason for sharing this is that peace and reconciliation are best exampled when people from very different backgrounds not only work together, but form friendships.  I assure the committee that my work is not politically motivated or linked to any political party.  This is important to me.<\/p> <p>  Previously, I shared my vision of creating a nation of neighbours based on the ancient question: who is my neighbour?  This question is foundational to my work, as I believe it has the potential to help provide a unifying framework to build a nation of neighbours.  Thanks to the Anabaptist Mennonite Trust I have been accepted to begin a PhD this coming autumn on this very theme from a faith and theological perspective.  This is important to me because I am your neighbour and you are mine.  It does not matter what background we are from &ndash; we must always find ways to work and partner together, creating a better place to live.  Even though it was disappointing to hear those comments, I was overwhelmed by the response and support for myself and the work of Ireland&rsquo;s Future.  We are not part of any political party.  Those of us who are entrusted with a place of leadership have the responsibility to move away from name calling, labelling and any type of pigeon-holing.  Let us learn to lead well and by example.  Let us together, regardless of our background, put our shoulders to the wheel of peace and reconciliation and concentrate on the main thing, which is creating a better home and future for all of us.<\/p> <p>  In conclusion, I extend the hand of friendship and welcome to the Chairman and all the members.  I ask them to come to Belfast and spend time with us, to hear our stories and about the work in which we are involved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021061500002#B00700","nonspeaker":"Reverend Karen Sethuraman"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":510,"content":"<p>Thank you.

He specifically referred to Brexit and how it has accelerated the conversation by placing the focus on the need to prepare for a potential referendum.  In terms of that preparation and taking into consideration what I have just heard from Reverend Karen, I would like to hear from her about her perspective on the current level of discussion that there is within the Protestant unionist loyalist, PUL, community or those who identify as British regarding future constitutional change.  Within that, what specific issues or concerns does she think there are within the community or among those individuals who, perhaps, identify as unionist in respect of their cultural identity if there was to be reunification?<\/p><p>What protections or guarantees can be put in place to reassure members of that community, and individuals who identify as British, that their rights and cultural identity will be upheld?

None of us wants to make the same mistakes made with Brexit, for example, with regard to the proposed Oireachtas joint committee and looking ahead at how we prepare, work and propose initiatives.

I will answer the first question because it was directed at me.  Ms Begley is absolutely correct.  There is no doubt, right across the spectrum of our communities, that Brexit has catapulted us to this place.  Things are changing and shifting and people are beginning to ask whether there is something better.  That is a great and very healthy question to ask.  Much of the focus in this conversation is on how we get unionists to engage and bring them into the conversation.  It is the wrong question to ask.  I am being honest in stating that the unionist community will see this through the lens of certain political parties, whether we like that or not.  This is why I am very passionate that we begin to put a light on being people led and not just politically led.  That is not in any way to denigrate anyone because I am thankful for all the work members of the committee do.  I could not do their job.  On the question of unionists being at the table, I would not expect them to come and join my conversation about a future shared island Ireland because they are adamant.  It is important to them to be part of the UK.<\/p> <p>  The reason I raise is the conversation needs to focus, and the spotlight needs to be on, building the case.  The invitation is for the unionist community to build its case for being part of the UK.  I will be honest that I am up for that.  I am from a unionist background.  I go into my meetings and have great, healthy banter with people like, \"Well, here's Karen who would love to see a united Ireland and there's us who want to be part of the union\".  It is good, healthy banter and the root of it is, \"Okay, you convince me and I'll convince you.\"  If there is going to be a conversation at a table, then our precious unionist community must begin to build a case to be part of the UK, which it is doing.<\/p> <p>  I commend some of the groups that have been set up.  We do not need to threaten violence or threaten our peace process.  Healthy debate is being conducted by people like We Make NI, United UK, a new group called Union NI, or groups like Her Loyal Voice and Let's Talk Loyalism, which are groups doing what we are doing but on the other end of the spectrum.  That is not a negative because the central question is not, \"Do you want a united Ireland?\".  Of course, unionists will say, \"No\".  The central question is how to begin to think higher than where we are, lift our eyes beyond where we are, begin to build the case for being part of the UK and look at what we are doing to begin to build the vision of us being together on this island.  It is not a negative to think about unionists.  The reality is their voices are just as important as any of ours.<\/p> <p>  I am interested in those people in the middle ground, who are the unheard, unseen, silent majority.  I am interested in our youth, teens and students.  There are voices that want to be persuaded and that is what I see.  The majority of people in Northern Ireland want a better future.  We just need these conversations to be structured so we can begin to plan for that.  If we learn from Brexit, when people head for the polls on a big question of what they want they should be well informed.  I welcome and encourage the committee to consider inviting and hearing from some of these groups, such as Union NI, We Make NI and United UK, not to convince them of a united Ireland, but to hear their vision.

I compliment Reverend Karen on what she said.  It was an exceptional introductory address and wholly summarises the philosophy of Ireland's Future.  We are so delighted and proud that the Reverend Karen is now an ambassador for our message.  It was a real privilege to be on this call to listen and hear what she had to say because it really sums up exactly how we want to conduct this conversation.  There is a huge responsibility upon all of us, on politicians and anybody who is engaged in this discourse in civic space, to be as open, reflective and respectful as possible.  That is precisely how we want to manage our affairs.<\/p> <p>  On Mr. Maskey's inquiry on what an Oireachtas joint committee might look like, we respectfully consider that should be complementary to our citizen-led approach in which we are just a participant.  We are not defining the conversation and do not seek to.  All we want is to provide a platform and contribute to public discourse.<\/p><p>We want that to be done in a spirit of mutual experience, reflective of everybody.  I consider it as a bowl of stew in which everybody is a different ingredient.  Everybody brings to the conversation that which they have experienced, personally and as a community, and does so with respect and confidence.  If there were to be an Oireachtas joint committee in that sprit, the ambition might be for us to get to the position to which Scotland got in 2013.  Our overriding overture is that there must be detail, evidence-led and empirically robust positions that everybody and read, comprehend, understand and contribute to.  As I mentioned in my remarks two weeks ago, the Scottish Government was in a position to publish a 670-page analysis outlining its vision of how Scotland would transition to independence in the event of a positive referendum.  Of course, that did not happen.  There is no preconceived outcome to all of this but our position is that detailed preparation should be undertaken to inform the conversation.  That is where I think an Oireachtas joint committee can outline, drive, procure evidence, monitor, engage and review how a transition in respect of constitutional change might occur.  That might also be complemented by the appointment of a Minister of State with dedicated and specific responsibility to develop strategies to advance constitutional change while co-ordinating with all of the Government's other all-Ireland policies.<\/p><p> The work that has been commenced by the shared island unit was rightly brought to my attention and that of the committee two weeks ago.  I compliment that positive step.  The finance which has been regenerated and made more specific has infused more energy into what are wholly and fundamentally positive engagements.  Reconnecting the synapses of our island is crucial to everybody's best endeavours in this regard.  Our respectful analysis is that more needs to be done.  As I said, there is a responsibility on all of us to conduct our affairs as transparently and openly as possible.  The best mechanism for that is, of course, through the convention of a committee such as the one we are attending today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021061500002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":522,"content":"<p>The point about the &euro;500 million for the shared island initiative was also referred to at our most recent meeting.

I am delighted because I missed the committee's engagement with them a couple of weeks ago.  I welcome Ms Harmon and Reverend Karen.  I asked Mr. Murphy a question a couple of weeks ago so if it is okay, I will focus on asking questions to Reverend Karen and Ms Harmon.  I would love it if both of them could answer my question.  Reverend Karen mentioned the need to provide a unifying framework to build a nation of neighbours, which I think is powerful and vital to the creation of meaningful dialogue and the cultivation of positive attitudes towards political opposition.  I know Reverend Karen is a champion of peace and reconciliation.  Her words today were powerful.  My question relates in particular to young people.  We all know that young people have not experienced the trauma of the conflict.  My question as to how we bring in young people is also directed at Ms Harmon.  How do we bring young people into the conversation on their vision of what a new Ireland would look like?  It is really important to bring young people into the conversation.  I ask that question to Reverend Karen in the first instance.<\/p> <p>  I will ask Ms Harmon about a citizens' assembly.  I know she did phenomenal work on the campaigns to repeal the eighth amendment and the campaign on the marriage referendum.  She was involved in and championed those campaigns.  She did phenomenal work.  My question to her relates to young people and a citizens' assembly.  How do we engage young people?  I am really asking the same question of both our guests.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021061500002#D00300","speaker":"1632"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":524,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for her welcome and for a great question.  It is a timely question because, as I have shared, in terms of my role in Ireland's Future, I really want to go after what I call the kitchen table conversations.  Those conversations are happening around the kitchen table and in businesses.  Someone contacted me and told me about a project that was happening, led by a CEO named Jacinta Linden.  I had never met her before.  She is a hero of community and is the CEO of Bolster Community.  She received PEACE IV funding to work with young people.  It was to run a programme called Youth Up Front for Newry, Mourne and Down District Council.  A campaign called Beyond Tolerance involved 120 young people, aged 12 to 15.  I really want the committee members to hear this because they are going to hear their voices this morning.  I hope we will all pay attention to them.  Their idea was to overcome adversity, to build inclusive and cohesive communities and to begin to build leadership skills in the young people.<\/p> <p>  I approached Ms Linden, told her I was part of the Ireland's Future team and asked her to facilitate three questions from me for the young people.  As I mentioned earlier, the starting point with conversation is not to ask people if they want a united Ireland.  That is not the place to start, certainly with young people.  I pitched three questions to the 13- to 15-year-olds.  I explained that this is our home and our home belongs to all of us.  I asked how do we make our home a better place to live.  I also asked the young people what are their dreams for our future together.  My third question, which is for the committee members, asked the young people if they had one message they wanted our Governments to hear, what would it be?  I do not have time to read all the responses but I want to read some of them so the committee can hear how important it is that we have these inputs on the table in this conversation.<\/p> <p>  In response to the question as to how we make our home a better place to live, &Eacute;abha, aged 14, said that we need to start by making friends with each other.  She said that we are all just human beings.  Grace, aged 15, said that she never really gets the chance to meet young people from different religions and have more opportunities to mix and build understanding.  James, aged 15, asked why there cannot be more tolerance.  He said that surely there is room for all of us, regardless of who we follow.  The following one tugged at my heart.  Caoimhe, aged 15, said she wants to grow up without ever having to face the sectarianism and danger that her parents faced when they were her age.  Those young people's voices matter and we have a duty to pave a way for those young guys.<\/p><p> The second question was what are the young people's dreams for their future together.  &Eacute;abha, aged 14, dreams that everyone will be treated equally, regardless of race, religion or sexuality.  Dan, aged 14, got straight to the question, even though it was not asked.  He said that he thinks a united Ireland would be a good future but that he does not want the journey to be too bumpy.  Sin&eacute;ad, aged 14, mentioned integrated education and a lack of conflict.  James, aged 15, said that he wants to be a leader who will consider the hopes of others.  Tom, aged 14, said that the tensions and fears between all religions and races will end.  Not one of these kids gave an answer about flags; they want peace, a future and to share this home together.<\/p><p> I want members to hear the answer to the next question.  The children were asked what message they would like their Government to hear.  Jessica, aged 15, said that she wants to give everyone an equal chance.  Sophie asked the Government to be more accepting, to try to engage with everyone and to consider all options before making impactful decisions.  Christina, aged 14, asked the Government to get rid of sectarianism and discrimination.  James, aged 15, said that we need kindness in our Government, that we have so much to live for and asked the Government to give us hope for a better future.  I love the answer of Jana, aged 14.  She asked the Government to listen to children because they want a future in Northern Ireland.  She also said that young people need more opportunities to get together and understand better.<\/p><p> That is a little snippet of from 120 young people from all backgrounds taking part in a PEACE IV programme.  We have a duty to honour their young voices.  They are not just our future but our today.  They are the voices that matter as we shape our future in terms of the role of Ireland's Future and of other organisations that take part in conversations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021061500002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Reverend Karen Sethuraman","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":526,"content":"<p>That is very powerful and as my mother used to say: \"Out of the mouths of babes\".

I am speaking in a personal capacity as a member of Ireland's Future, which I joined a number of months ago.  I am part of the events' team, I am excited to be on board and I am excited about this dialogue that is already happening.  It is important that we facilitate these conversations in a proper manner and that we are part of them.<\/p> <p>  I work for the Irish Council for International Students and I used to work the National Women's Council of Ireland in Dublin as well.  As part of that work, I was the head of voter mobilisation for Together for Yes.  Previously, back in 2015 I was the president of the Union of Students in Ireland, which is an all-island organisation that represents students North and South.  It also has a trilateral agreement with the student union in Britain and in the North so that provides a lot of learnings.  I would have been involved in making submissions to the Constitutional Convention between 2012 and 2014 in the lead-up to marriage equality and the Citizens' Assembly, particularly the one on the eighth amendment to the Constitution.<\/p> <p>  I am from a Gaeltacht in Cork and I have been in Dublin for a number of years.  The reason I joined Ireland's Future is that there is a need to have a non-political entity driving this.  We saw in recent referendums the importance of having these conversations led by citizens.  That is not to say that politicians should shy away from those conversations.  They should be involved in them but they should be citizen-led initiatives that are inclusive of all aspects of society and they should not be tied to one political party or another.  It is important for us to bear that in mind.<\/p> <p>  I will get to the questions that were asked.  On young people, I echo what Reverend Sutherman has outlined and it is fascinating to hear the views those young people have expressed.  It is great that the shared island unit is engaging with young people as well and that those conversations are happening.  When it comes to young people and from my previous experience with the Union of Students in Ireland, one of the reasons the marriage equality referendum in particular was so successful is that we saw mass voter registration drives of young people.  Young people were part of the conversation and they were not just a sideshow but they were at the table, which is important for this issue.  When we are talking about a shared island and having these dialogues, we should not just be going off in silos and just having specific youth consultations.  Those are important and we need to consult with all the representative youth groups and ensure that young people from all creeds and backgrounds with different languages, including the Traveller community, the Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, LGBTQ, community and the migrant community are represented.  Also, when we are having conversations, young people need to be included with older people and be at the table when there are panels and debates happening.  It should not just be a sideshow with young people.  They need to feel that they have ownership of this issue and that they are just as valued as any other age group in society.  That is important.<\/p> <p>  I know the Citizens' Assembly was discussed at the last meeting as well.  First, having it citizens-led is important if it is to be a citizens' assembly but politicians and political parties should not just take a back seat either.  Political parties need to step up and be responsible for the issue but it is important that it is citizens-led.  One of the things that worked well with the Citizens' Assembly which started in 2016 was that it was not polarised and that there was a random selection for it.  That is not to say that any future citizens' assembly should purely be a random selection of citizens.  This would be a completely new entity because it will have to include the North and the South and citizens in the North will be vital in their self-determination around this issue.<\/p> <p>  It is valuable to include citizens who might not necessarily have been involved with the issue before and who might not have their opinions made up yet.  That is all part of the process.  People are on a journey to figure out where they stand on the issue and to figure out what issues are important to them in terms of a shared island, education, health, a post-Brexit economy and issues of rights.  We need people at the centre, therefore.  We need to have an opportunity for groups to feed in from all perspectives with their issues.  These include issues of unity, issues from youth groups and issues from all relevant sectors.  People must be able to make submissions and request to address the assembly if that is what it will be called.  There will be recommendations out of it that can then be taken into consideration by Governments.<\/p> <p>  Planning is really important because the public across the island are ahead of politics.  These conversations are already happening in schools, around kitchen tables and in workplaces.  I have personally seen such an increase in people talking about this issue, not just in the media or in places like this but in everyday life.  We need to be ahead of the curve, start planning and start looking at what models will work best.  That is not to say this is something that should be rushed but it is something that needs to be planned and to have forward-thinking.  It should never be something that is rushed but it needs to be started now because these conversations are already happening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021061500002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Laura Harmon"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":528,"content":"<p>I thank our guests for their presentations.  I apologise that I missed some of the meeting earlier because I had difficulty getting connected.  In one of his responses, Mr. Murphy made a point on detailed preparation for what I, along with others, want to see in the future, which is constitutional change on our island.  Like many others, I aspire to a united Ireland to be achieved through the mechanisms laid out in the Good Friday Agreement.  It is extremely important that detailed preparation is made in every respect.<\/p><p>Something I have repeated <i>ad nauseam <\/i>at this committee is the need to utilise and maximise the potential of the existing agreements and political architecture in place already with the Good Friday Agreement, the Stormont House Agreement and the New Decade, New Approach agreement.  All of these are important pieces of the political architecture on this island, predominantly the Good Friday Agreement.  I have always believed it is most disappointing that all of its aspects have not been implemented.  We know how important the commitments made in the New Decade, New Approach agreement are and we sincerely hope they will be honoured without delay for the benefit of all of the people of the island.<\/p><p>At our previous meeting at which Reverend Karen was present, Mr. Lunn left us to go to the announcement of the results of the inquest into the Ballymurphy massacre when I was making my contribution.  I mentioned the issue of the civic forum in Northern Ireland and I suggested that perhaps Reverend Karen would discuss it with Mr. Lunn as a member of the legislative assembly.  From memory, in the multiparty talks, the Women's Coalition was a powerful advocate for a civic forum.  Subsequently, as a result of signing the Good Friday Agreement, the Civic Forum was established in 2000.  Unfortunately, it has not met since 2002.  Its purpose was to have a means of consulting civic society to ensure better understanding of social, economic and cultural issues.  We all know that such assemblies or fora are prevalent throughout the world and are associated with various parliaments and parliamentary systems.  I have always believed there has been a huge lacuna without the Civic Forum to involve and engage civic society.<\/p><p>The contributions we have heard from Ms Harmon, Reverend Karen and Mr. Murphy have focussed very much on involving civic society.  They speak about a citizens' assembly.  We have provision for a civic advisory panel that, unfortunately, has not been put in place or used at present.  I am not saying it would solve the problems of our country but were the politicians to put that structure in place to ensure the different voices all the witnesses have spoken about today could be listened to, it would be an important message to give out to civic society in Northern Ireland about the mechanism provided for in the Good Friday Agreement and Stormont House Agreement.<\/p><p>If I got the message coming from the young people Reverend Karen quoted, it was about the need to listen and consult.  The witnesses are advocating very strongly on the potential for an all-Ireland citizens' assembly.  Will they comment on the deficiency we have at present in not having the Civic Forum?  It could contribute something to the general debate, not just on constitutional issues but economic, social and cultural issues also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021061500002#F00100","speaker":"1556"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":529,"content":"<p>It is always great to discuss the future of Ireland.

I would love to know from her point of view how has she reconciled this in herself, coming from a unionist background and wanting union with the UK and now wanting a union of Ireland.<\/p> <p>  I have another question for Ms Harmon and Mr. Murphy.  Reverend Karen spoke about what the children had said about integrated education and about listening to children.  I look at the education system in the North and how segregated it is.  From the point of view of the witnesses, what can Northern politicians and Southern politicians do to advance an integrated education system in the North?  To me, this is a huge barrier to peace if we are to move forward to a united Ireland, which is my ambition for this island.  We have a lot of work to do in the North and its education system and for our young people to make sure either side does not have two heads.

In reference to this, the battle over many decades was with the British establishment and British Government.  Since the Good Friday Agreement, that pathway has changed.  We have our own destiny and how we create that destiny is what this is all about.<\/p> <p>  One of the questions I asked on the previous occasion, and I pose it again in the context of what Reverend Karen said this morning, was how do we break down these barriers.  What can Ireland's Future do as an organisation?  It has done a lot of good work.  What can it now do to bring the unionist communities, parties and tradition, and the Protestant people in Northern Ireland with it?  Much of the work it has done heretofore has been very heavily on the nationalist voice.  There is a pathway for a group such as Ireland's Future to do massive work on bringing in these unionist speakers and voices and letting them have their say.  We need these voices at the table.<\/p><p>We are crying out for them and we crying out for them on this committee.  The pathway ahead must be one that we all share.

I am going to answer the question from Senator McGreehan.  The Senator and I need to get a cup of coffee.  It is a long road to Damascus.  I grew up in east Belfast, with Union Jacks on the lampposts.  Going to the bonfires for 12 July every year was an outing.  I grew up in that community, where we had street parties as kids, championed the English football team, partook in all the things the unionist community does and I loved every bit of it.  I do not know if there was a big road to Damascus moment.  I probably started to see outside of my own narrative because of my pastoral experience.  I started to work and get involved in peace and reconciliation work and through that I realised that there was another story apart from the one I grew up in.  I realised that there were other people who were hurt and busted and who did not agree with the same outlook.  I was probably sheltered from that view as a young person who grew up in the Troubles.  If I am being honest, though, I am not sure that I really understood what they were fighting over.  I just knew, and remember being told, to just not go to this community, that I should stay in this community and all of those things.  However, that is a whole other conversation.<\/p> <p>  To be quite frank with Senator McGreehan, I fell in love with people.  I lifted my eyes up a little higher to think about whether there might be something more.  I ended up becoming a mum myself and that wrecked me even more because - and we still laugh at this as a family - when I was driving my kids, who were 16 and 18 years old, one day they asked me whether they were Catholic or Protestant.  I thought it was wonderful to have moved so much forwards that my kids did not know that.  I am not really into labels, but I would probably label myself as a \"neither\" in that regard and someone open to being convinced and persuaded either way.  However, when I got out of the little bubble in which I grew up and went down to Donegal, I fell in love with the beaches and the people there.  When I went to Dublin, I wanted the diversity of that city for Belfast.  When I went down to Cork, I also fell in love.  Something in me realised that I may have grown up and identified as British, but I am Irish and I am proud of that.<\/p> <p>  There is something about working, looking back and thinking that here we are one hundred years after partition.  However, is it not the work of peace and reconciliation to seek to bring together what has been divided?  That is probably where my answer focuses.  The root of my changed perspective is that I fell in love with people.  My kids have also changed me.  I am not sure how we identify.  I have people in my family, and I am talking about people in my close-knit family, who are unionists and that is the bottom line.  I have a daughter who is Irish and she wants to live in Dublin.  I have another daughter who probably identifies with the Alliance Party.  Therefore, we are just this great mixed bunch and I think that is an example of many people here in Northern Ireland.  There is something about hearing other people&rsquo;s stories.  I want to make this clear.  I commend the Government, in respect of wanting to build bridges with neighbours, on acknowledging the passing of Prince Philip.  Simple things like flying the flag at half-mast reach out to our unionist neighbours.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the question from Senator Blaney, we can often break ourselves wondering how we can get unionists to the table.  We must shine the light on a different question, which is not whether people want a united Ireland.  That question may very well come in a border poll at some stage.  However, the question now is let us consider that we may be bigger than the UK, and that the other option on the table is that we may be part of an all-Ireland entity.  That is the invitation to unionists.  Unionists cannot be asked to be part of something they do not want.  However, it is possible to ask them to build the case regarding why they are better off in the UK and what that means to them as a people.  When it then comes to the time for a border poll, unlike Brexit, people will be going to that poll having been informed.  Politicians will share their visions and raise the flag for what they believe is best, and that includes unionists, nationalists, the Alliance Party and all sorts of parties.  The people will then decide.<\/p> <p>  A better question, however, which is the question we pitched to those children, is what do they dream of as being our future.  What does such a future look like?  Cases can then begin to be built for the UK and for a new island.  It is also important to say that we would not expect those who are champions of the UK to be part of the Scottish conversation on independence.  We would not expect representatives of the Scottish National Party, SNP, to be at conversations concerning championing the UK.   We would expect a case to be built for such arguments, and that is all that this is.  I see myself as extending the vision beyond Northern Ireland being part of the UK.  I refer to the possibility that what may be best for us is to join up with the South.  I am up for that.<\/p> <p>  I love everything about the whole island, including the freedom to be able to have those 12 July celebrations and go to bonfires.  It would be great if Ireland embraced all of that as an island and recognised 12 July as an all-island celebration and as a holiday.  I think there are ways in which we can work together but the starting place is how we can make our home better.  I hope I have answered the question from Senator McGreehan but let us grab a coffee and I will share more about the road to Damascus.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021061500002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Reverend Karen Sethuraman"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":534,"content":"<p>I thank Reverend Karen for that very important, revealing and clear analysis.

I will pick up on a point Deputy Brendan Smith made about the Civic Forum.  This is an aspect that I have raised, and I note people like Emma DeSouza fly the flag for the Civic Forum.  To me, it is just a gaping hole in the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  That agreement belongs to everybody and mechanisms were put in place to ensure that politics left nobody behind.  Unfortunately, however, we have seen how politics has left people behind, particularly in the loyalist communities.  Therefore, I am very much on the same page as Deputy Brendan Smith in respect of ensuring that the Civic Forum is progressed.<\/p> <p>  I refer not only to the Civic Forum, but also to the North-South consultative forum.  There have been moves regarding the forums in the New Decade, New Approach document but there is no better time than right now to set up those forums.  I refer to looking at the economic opportunities that are there for the taking by the North in respect of having access to the British internal market and the European market.  The North-South consultative forum would be a very valuable place for businesses to engage regarding the all-island economy and for the Northern businesses as well.  We are absolutely on the same page in that regard.<\/p> <p>  I look forward to meeting again over the summer in more face-to-face forums when opportunities arise as Covid-19 lifts and we are all able to get out and about more as we, collectively, are part of this bigger conversation about the future.

The organisation has people within it who have different views about timing and urgency.  I presume that they accept that.  It is a good thing.<\/p><p> Regarding the shared island unit, much of the Government's emphasis is on multilateral action and seeking consensus rather than pursuing unilateral action.  Do the witnesses see the benefits of the shared island unit as a good approach to getting more people involved in this conversation in a positive way?

I was struck by the Deputy's description of the political architecture of the Good Friday Agreement.  It is right to say that this is an important feature of the Good Friday Agreement that has not been given expression, and we are all the lesser for it.  In short, we are in favour of the inception of a tangible and meaningful civic forum, but it should be as well as rather than instead of the citizens' assembly, which we have advocated for.  They would address two discrete and different sets of relationship, but they could complement each another.<br\/><br\/>Regarding the political architecture, a quote came to mind about international law, namely, <i>pacta sunt servanda<\/i>, or agreements must be kept.  That is a fundamental principle in international diplomatic relations and law.  It is a regrettable fact that several aspects of political agreements over the years have been left unexecuted, as it were, for example, an Acht na Gaeilge.  We are 500 days on from New Decade, New Approach, 15 years on from the St. Andrews Agreement and 23 years on from the Good Friday Agreement, all of which made explicit and express affirmations in respect of Irish language legislation.  In terms of citizenship and the architecture of the state, it has been argued in court twice that the Good Friday Agreement is not binding on the courts or the British Government.  We have also seen that expression used in judicial review proceedings taken by a parent who had chosen an Irish route of education for his or her child and applied to Col&aacute;iste Feirste.  The Northern Ireland Department of Education attempted to persuade the court that the Good Friday Agreement was advisory rather than binding.  Obviously, and rightly, the court dismissed that argument.  We have had agreements on how to resolve the legacy of our past, for example, the Stormont House Agreement, but we still do not have an historical inquiries unit, HIU.  The matter was addressed more generally in the UK Supreme Court yesterday.  Perhaps most egregiously, we have had a Secretary of State express his intention to break international law in terms of Brexit, which is an issue that continues to vex the G7.  The political architecture is important, but it is also important to consider it in a wider context, the overriding fundamental principle being that agreements are all well and good, but they are no good if they are not abided by.<br\/><br\/>Deputy Brendan Smith was right to bring to our attention the utility and good auspices of a civic forum, and I would welcome the inception of such a forum, but it should be as well as rather than instead of our call, which is to promote an all-island dialogue on the exclusive issue of the potential constitutional change on our island.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021061500002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Murphy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":538,"content":"<p>I wish to comment briefly on Senator McGreehan's comments about education.  What we have seen with the Erasmus+ programme post Brexit has been interesting.  The funding committed to in order to continue it was positive.  The education system in the South is evolving, as it is in the North, for example, the issue of patronage in the South.  A much wider discussion on what education might look like probably needs to happen, but it could be held as part of a citizens' assembly-type forum in consultation with the students themselves and their parents.<\/p> <p>  Regarding Senator Currie's comments, the shared island unit is a great initiative and the Government's commitment to funding it is important.  The Senator also spoke about timing.  We are all in agreement that timing is key.  As we outlined, though, many of these conversations are already happening and public opinion has been shifting.  As the Senator knows, it will take a great deal of time to get the structure of a citizens' assembly right, for example, who will be the chairperson and how to include all citizens and voices.  There is nothing to stop us starting the preparations for the assembly now.  With previous assemblies, issues have not necessarily been acted on straight away.  If there was a recommendation from this citizens' assembly for a border poll, it might not occur immediately.

I thank Reverend Karen for her thoughtful and excellent contributions thus far and at previous meetings of this committee.  I believe it is important, particularly for people in the South - in the Twenty-six Counties - to understand that when we talk about unionism, it is a broad church in the North.  It is not all DUP voters.  And also, many people who vote DUP do so because they want to remain within the United Kingdom.  They do not necessarily agree with that party and all its different points of view, however.  It is very complicated and multifaceted.  Perhaps Reverend Karen could talk more about the engagements Ireland's Future is having with the unionist and loyalist community in the North and also about the multiple layers.  She described the layers and colours in her own family.  I believe that is a healthy thing in a healthy democratic society.  I hope to see more of that in the new Ireland I intend to be a part of.<\/p> <p>  If we could deal with that issue, it would really cover it.

I will ask this question of our guests, because we ultimately ask it of all our guests at the committees; if they had one request of the committee in terms of what it can do and should be doing on this issue of promoting dialogue and a citizens' assembly going forward, what would that be?  We have had citizens' assemblies before on issues that would have appeared to be contentious, intractable and fundamental and nobody said we could not have a citizens' assembly because an issue was too sensitive.  Maybe that was said at the beginning but it ultimately came to the point where society led matters to a position where that reality could no longer be denied.

We wholly accept that, in terms of comments that were made.<\/p> <p>  I know that someone mentioned that people are moving away from the DUP.  I do not want to get into politics in that sense but I mentioned earlier that in my heart, I regard myself as being in the middle ground and that I would classify myself as a \"neither\".  A lot of people are moving away from the two-community distinction because we are more than two communities.  We need to lead outside of that box.<\/p> <p>  I am interested in the unheard, the silent majority, the \"neithers\", those in the middle ground and the ones who want to bring change and who dare to dream of something different.  A lot of us have shifted into that place.  I said the last time that it is a bit sad that the media only portray certain voices.  That is why opportunities such as this are key and critical.  One gets to hear other people and one gets to hear the voices of children that I shared earlier.  Those are the sorts of voices around which we need to build the vision of a better future together.  That is important.  If we focus on the minority, then the alternative is that we remain where we are.  I do not want to remain where we are; I want to move forward and I long to bring people with us.  As Mr. Murphy has said, we will engage with everybody and anybody.  I will seek and endeavour to continue to hold those kitchen-table conversations and at every opportunity feed back to the committee, like I did for those 100 young people from all backgrounds, in order that we can hear that there are other voices that deserve to be heard.<\/p> <p>  This is our home and that is our starting place.  I have said this many times.  The starting place is not to set out what we would like it to be and that we would like to include people in that.  The starting place is that this is already our home.  Nobody is an addition and we are more than two communities.  We owe it to those children and the generations that come behind us to pass something better on.  One of those young kids said that she did not want to grow up in what her parents had to go through.  She is the voice of the majority and of everybody who is present here.  Therefore, I plead that the committee does not focus in on what we must have but that members understand that there is a majority of people who are open to this and that these conversations are already taking place.<\/p> <p>  That takes me to my request, which Mr. Murphy addressed, and that is that we get to the next step.  Conversations have been happening for quite some time and the next step is the support of the committee to set up the citizens' assembly that provides structure for these conversations.  Let us remember that there are other organisations such as the SDLP's new Ireland commission, the shared island unit or Think32, which has been holding podcasts with our unionist friends.  There are other people besides us and we are all doing this together.  I do not join things but I signed up to this because I believe in passing on a better future and a home for all of us.  Opportunities like this are brilliant, therefore.  Having the place to be able to hear the groups we mentioned that are championing the UK, to hear their voices and to hear their vision for being part of a United Kingdom is important.  Our role as Ireland's Future is to continually reach out the hand of friendship.  We would want to reassure everyone that this is what we are doing.  We are working in the background and meetings have been organised throughout the year, beginning in the autumn, in places across this island.

I genuinely do not believe this is required and I do not intend to accept these amendments.<\/p> <p>  Section 48 deals with the establishment and operation of the register of relevant public land.  That is there already.  The Deputy is just seeking to rename that to a public register of relevant public land.  I do not consider the amendment to be required, although I remain to be convinced.  I am happy if Deputy &Oacute; Broin wishes to come back for some particular reason.  It is not the title of the register that will determine that it will be a publicly available register but rather the provisions that are already in section 48(5), which provides that, \"The Register shall be published and made available for inspection by the Agency on its website.\"<\/p><p>It will be a public register and that is important.  The LDA has already commenced work on the register, as we all know.  A prototype is available on its website but more work is required.  The development of the register is a priority and it has to be, as I have said to the LDA.  It is important that there is full public oversight.  I assure all Deputies, particularly the Deputies who tabled this amendment, that a register will be publicly available for use by all and at all times.  I completely agree that the register is a vital tool for the LDA and the Government to identify all relevant public lands; that is, lands owned by relevant public bodies in areas with populations greater than 10,000, as we understand.  I think we are all clear on that.  The register will detail land such owned by the Office of Public Works, OPW, Departments, local authorities and all other State bodies, including commercial State bodies.<\/p><p> The register will be used to identify public lands.  If they are not sold, they will have an affordability requirement attached to them under the legislation, which is really important too.  This will ensure that regardless of whether the land is being developed by the LDA or another developer, there will be a requirement to provide 50% affordable housing, at least in certain areas.  We will deal with other changes to that next week.  I intend to increase that further - above 50% - in other areas.  The register will be used by the LDA to report to the Government on the use of public land.  We really need that.  We need to ensure there is full visibility and full oversight.  In order to ensure the register is as complete as possible, public bodies will be required to co-operate with the LDA, and the LDA will be able to request information from such bodies in terms of all relevant public lands they have.  Unless Deputy &Oacute; Broin believes we have missed something, I am happy to listen.  It is important that we focus on what the register does as opposed to what it is named, and I think we have been incredibly clear on that in section 48.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 141 is purely a technical amendment and corrects an editing error in section 48(3) by replacing the word \"on\" with \"in\".  The phrase \"entered on the Register\" has been changed to \"entered in the Register\".

That is important because one cannot have a situation where elected members of local authorities are under a legal obligation to co-operate with the LDA.  Of course co-operation is a good thing but members of local authorities must not be legally obliged to do so because there are times when they may, within their rights, decide on a different course of action, and the correct one, from the one being proposed by the LDA.  Members of local authorities must explicitly be exempt from this rather than what is in the Minister's amendment, which leaves it unspecified.

These amendments are technical in nature and provide for the inclusion of a subsidiary designated activity company, DAC, in an number of places in section 50.  We had a series of these earlier in the Bill and this followed feedback I received from both Government and Opposition Members on Second Stage.  The section deals with reports to the Government relating to certain lands and provides that the LDA must report on relevant public land and land owned by the agency.  It was always the intention of this legislation when it was being drafted that the reference to the LDA would also refer to subsidiary DACs but to avoid any doubt at all and taking on board the input and feedback from members, I am moving these amendments to clarify that the LDA must also report on any land owned by a subsidiary DAC.  These amendments are being inserted to provide that particular clarity.<\/p> <p>  I want to make a couple of point on amendments Nos. 145 and 151 on development plans.  I take the point that is being raised.  The LDA will seek planning permission for its proposed developments via the appropriate procedures under planning and development Acts in a similar way to any other planning applicant.  In making decisions on proposed LDA developments, the planning authority or the board is required to determine that these planning applications are in accordance with the provisions of relevant development plans, local area plans, or strategic development zones, SDZs, that are in force.  I know there have been some issues around SHD, which expires this year as members will know.<\/p> <p>  A number of LDA developments have been through the planning system to date.  As members may know, Shanganagh Castle in Dublin and St. Kevin's Hospital site in Cork had to take into account the provisions of the county development plans.  All planning authorities provide access to pre-application consultations under this.  Having said that, I understand the point that is being made that it might not be any harm if we were a bit more prescriptive in fully stating that it is subject to the development plans themselves and to other plans.  If Deputies are agreeable, I will endeavour to come back on this on Report Stage.  I want to check those two amendments out in particular.  I will do that and I will come back to Deputies.<\/p> <p>  I take the point that Deputy Paul Donnelly is making and I have been a councillor myself as well.  Councillors are important.  They have a reserved function to vote on and put together their own county development and local area plans.  That is something I have always been a firm supporter of.  If there is something we can insert to make it abundantly clear that this is the case, I am happy to look at it.  I want to check that there are no unintended consequences.  I do not believe there will be any but if it is acceptable I will take those two amendments away and come back on them specifically on Report Stage.  The Deputy will reserve the right to reintroduce them if he is not happy with what we are coming back with.<\/p> <p>  Is amendment No. 152 in this grouping as well?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021061500002#C01600","speaker":"1561"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":619,"content":"<p>Yes, as are Nos. 153 and 154.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021061500002#C01700","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":620,"content":"<p>I will not be accepting amendments Nos. 152, 153 or 154.  I know what Deputies &Oacute; Broin and Gould are referring to in the housing needs demands assessment, HNDA, but the wording there might even be problematic because it might be too prescriptive.  We are doing that.  I would be afraid that if we put that specific wording in, like we have the HNDA rolled out to all our local authorities, that phrase is not consistent with the phrase in amendment No. 152 and could well cause us a problem.  I know what the Deputies are trying to achieve and I do not have an issue with that but it might cause difficulties.<\/p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 153 and 154 would just put further requirements on the LDA that are above and beyond what any other agency does.  We discussed at length at a previous hearing how the LDA will be fully answerable to the committee.  It will also have Comptroller and Auditor General oversight and it will have to report to whoever the Minister is at that given time.  This would be providing another layer of reports that have to be laid as well as seeking to put additional provisions in place.<\/p><p>I am satisfied the provisions in the section are robust enough when it comes to laying any report before the Oireachtas or the Government.  The Oireachtas committee can use the report and call witnesses in that regard, if it so wishes.  The report, prepared by the LDA under this section, is to enable the Government to decide on the use of public lands.  It is what the section relates to.  It is not appropriate that the agency would prepare this report for the Houses of the Oireachtas as it would not have any decision-making powers for the use of relevant public lands and, if required, the disposal of such lands through it.<\/p><p> It is fully appropriate for a report to be furnished to the Government so it can make the appropriate decisions.  It would be laid before the Oireachtas once the report has been submitted to the Government.  Any decisions that arise from this on the use of public lands must be made by the Government following the report and they will also be laid before the Oireachtas.<\/p><p> I have dealt with amendment No. 152 so I believe that covers all the amendments in the group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021061500002#C01800","speaker":"1561","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":622,"content":"<p>I welcomed the Minister's previous amendments that clarify the standing of the subsidiary designated activity companies and I welcome these amendments from him as well.

I reserve the right to reintroduce them.<\/p> <p>  I accept the Minister's point about the wording, \"housing needs assessment\", and this has been overtaken by the housing need and demand assessment.  Will he consider the inclusion of that as well if he is tabling a Report Stage amendment on this?  It will be such a key tool for determining the local authorities' housing plans.  For the first time we will have an empirical evidence base indicating not only how many homes we need within a local authority over five years but we could have the information down to local electoral area and or in even finer detail.  We will know how many of them should be one-bedroom, two-bedroom, three-bedroom of four-bedroom properties.  It would be wholly inappropriate if the LDA in its plans to develop public land was not obliged to take into account that evidence base in the same way we expect local authorities, etc., to do so.  Will the Minister give us a quick update on whether the LDA toolkit for local authorities will be ready by the end of the year?  There has been some good progress on that.  I am happy to withdraw those three amendments and reserve the right to reintroduce them.<\/p> <p>  That leaves the final two amendments in the group.  The functions that the LDA will be given are a little different from other State agencies and more similar to the National Asset Management Agency.  This agency will have control, albeit subject to Government approval, to very large tracts of public land.  Having an additional layer of scrutiny with a report to be sent to the Oireachtas committee would be sensible.  We often complain that simply laying something before the Houses of the Oireachtas or putting it on a website does not bring it to the attention of a busy committee.  Therefore, I will press that amendment.<\/p> <p>  Likewise, having a timeframe for laying the report is important.  The Government must make its decisions but we would like it to do so in a timely fashion.

That would be a good solution because the demand for housing is likely to be greatest in more highly populated areas.

On a general point, it is important to remember that the vast majority of both social and affordable homes will continue to be delivered by local authorities.  That is why we are tooling them up to do that.  That is why we gave them the largest housing budget in the history of the State.  We will continue to drive that on by giving them additional resources, which I announced last week, around the project management area, quantity surveying experience and beefing up their housing delivery teams.  The LDA will deliver in excess of that.  It will supplement, not supplant.  We must be clear on that and reinforce it.<\/p> <p>  There is no question that a big bad commercial entity is going to come in and gobble up council land that has been identified for housing.  That is not the case at all.  If anything, the Government is trying to get councils to deliver that more quickly.  I brought in the single-stage approval process to be able to push that on.  We are looking to amend that further to get councils back doing what they were good at.  They have started to do that, even leaving Covid aside, by building their own developments.  They will deliver direct-build affordable housing as well.  Members have seen many of the sites I visited with Government colleagues recently.  That is the context of this debate.<\/p> <p>  We are looking here at the instances in which it would be appropriate for the LDA to develop that land.  We have seen in Shanganagh Castle, for argument's sake, that is can be done in partnership with the local authority.  That will happen with the LDA on some of the larger sites when cost rental and other housing is being delivered.  I have seen that happen.  I wanted to make those general points first before dealing with the amendments because they are relevant to what the LDA is about.  Some previous amendments at this committee were proposed because people did not want the LDA to be involved in residential development at all, which is baffling.  If we have State-owned land that is non-local authority land, which is the bulk of what the LDA is going to work with, this Government and I want to see those lands put to productive use to deliver affordable housing, social housing and cost-rental housing for people at scale.  We must do this.  We all know of sites throughout the country, for example in our regional cities, that have been sat on by State bodies and have not been used.  In some instances, council sites that have been identified for housing have been run into the ground for 20 years because of indeterminate arguments, going back and forth.  We are in the middle of a housing crisis, which means we must deliver more homes.  We must do things differently to make sure we get that supply up.<\/p> <p>  In relation to the specific amendments before the committee, Deputy Duncan Smith is not here to move amendment No. 185.<\/p> <p>  I cannot accept amendments Nos. 186 and 187 because they seek to provide in section 55 that the LDA would require the consent of the Oireachtas to dispose of land rather than by ministerial consent, as is currently drafted.  It is not appropriate that the Oireachtas would replace the obligations of Ministers in this provision.  I do not think any future Minister would agree with this.  We can imagine the potential additional delays in getting homes developed.  We have seen that at local authority level.  The last thing I want is to see that happening with a new agency.  The Minister with responsibility for housing and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will be the shareholders of the LDA.  There is no provision for any other shareholder.  It is wholly appropriate that the Ministers, as shareholders and as Ministers of the Government, rather than the Oireachtas, would have to consent to the disposal of land by a commercial State body.  The ministerial consent requirements are consistent with the existing procedures under Department of Public Expenditure and Reform circulars for the disposal of State assists.  They are consistent with all other State agencies, as well as the ministerial consent which is required under the State Property Act.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 187 seeks to introduce a further amendment to section 55.  It proposes that land which was previously acquired from a local authority and is being disposed of by the LDA \"shall be offered for purchase to the local authority at the prevailing market price or the price paid to the local authority at original acquisition, whichever is the lower\".  I cannot accept this amendment because it does not serve any purpose, in that a local authority would offer land for sale to the LDA after it had already decided to dispose of the land.  The LDA will only acquire such land where it considers the land is suitable for development under the legislation.  I do not envisage a scenario where a local authority would want to have first refusal to purchase back land it had decided to dispose of.  If one were to think about it this way, we have ensured through this Bill that other State agencies will have to offer land to the LDA first.  That is the position in relation to disposal of lands.<\/p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 188 and 189, as tabled by Deputies McAuliffe and Higgins, seek to amend section 56, which relates to arrangements regarding the disposal of land by a local authority to the LDA, to provide that it will only apply to land zoned for housing.  Amendment No. 189 looks at larger urban areas.  I am giving these amendments close consideration.  At this stage, I am not in a position to accept them but I am looking at whether section 183 of the 2001 Act may only apply if it is land that is not designated or zoned for housing.  It would apply in that instance.  I see this as an extremely rare scenario.  Land zoned for housing that has not been used by a local authority - we do not envisage that being the case &ndash; would not be subject to section 183.  I will work through some of these suggestions, taking account of the feedback received from Opposition and Government Deputies, and indeed our colleagues in local government, to see whether we can fine-tune this some more.<\/p> <p>  There is a very good reason for this.  Members of the Oireachtas, in opposition or in government, cannot continue to countenance the adding of further delay upon delay on specific sites that are there.  We must do things differently to deliver at least 33,000 homes a year, both public and private, which is what the ESRI based its research that I commissioned on.  That is what we must achieve, but we are way off that figure.  That is why we need the LDA to develop and manage State-owned land that is not being used productively.  I reiterate that the local authorities will still be the main deliverer and provider of social and affordable housing, so much so that I gave approval last week for local authorities to acquire more lands.  I changed the way the recoupment of costs for land purchased by local authorities is done.  I held four housing summits last week with all chief executive officers across the country.  I advised them and issued a letter in that regard.  They are aware that when local authorities are short on land banks, which many of them are, and after the next few years they will be short because of what they are doing, they are to get back out and acquire land.  We need that.  I asking them to acquire land in order that they can build public homes on public land and build affordable homes on affordable land.  If we say to local authorities that we want them to buy more land, and the Government gives them the funds to do that and asks them to do it, as sure as hell they are not going to be taking it away on the other side.  We want the LDA to develop and provide homes on land that has not been used productively.  I wanted to give this context because it is important.  There are aspects of this that I am looking at and will come back to on Report Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021061500002#H00300","speaker":"1561"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":731,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister's commitment that he will return to this section on Report Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021061500002#H00400","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":732,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for taking on board my views, those of Deputy Higgins and other members of the committee who have raised this issue, and those of members of our party who are not members of the committee.

The fundamental disagreement here is that I do not believe one or two Ministers should have the authority to decide whether considerable tracts of public land should be sold, including to private actors.<\/p><p>One of the great values of the section 183 process in local authorities, to which I will come in a moment, is that there is a level of democratic accountability and scrutiny of both the substance of the decision and the decision itself.  Land being transferred from a local authority to the LDA, which the LDA could then decide to sell on all or a portion of to a private interest with the approval of one or two Ministers by way of a phone call or email, is not an appropriate way to deal with what is possibly one of our most valuable public assets.  I will, therefore, be pressing the amendment.<\/p><p> I will speak briefly to amendments Nos. 188 and 189, in the context of having tabled a formal opposition to section 56.  That formal opposition to section 56 has been requested by the Association of Irish Local Government.  In some senses this is one of the most negative elements of this legislation, even if one were in favour of a single centralised State agency to displace councils and develop housing, which is what I believe this will become.  The Minister claims otherwise but we take a different view on where this will go and that is fair enough.  Section 183 has two functions and it is important that the public and other interested parties listening in understand them.<\/p><p> First, there is a transparency function.  When a local authority is considering transferring any piece of land for residential or commercial development, from a small ransom strip to a large piece of land, the director of development has to publish a report stipulating the purpose of the transfer of the land and the financial return to the local authority.  If that financial return is lower than the market value, the manager must outline the reasons for that.  There are many cases where that might be done because it would improve economic opportunity, create jobs or provide a community dividend, etc.  That public, transparent process is the first function of section 183, which would be lost if section 56 of this Bill goes through.<\/p><p> The second aspect of section 183 is that the full body of elected members then has to vote on that process.  Therefore, what section 56 of this legislation proposes to do is remove all the transparency and accountability and all the mechanisms by which local authorities outline what to do with what is essentially public land, which belongs to the taxpayers and the wider community.  It would deny elected members a vote.  I do not accept the contention that that is being doing to speed anything up.  Let us look at some of the lands in question.  Shanganagh Castle, for example, was sold by the Department of Justice to D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council almost 20 years ago.  The delay in that project was not because the councillors were in any way divided over the development of that land, as Deputy Boyd Barrett will tell us.  He knows better than the rest of us because it is his constituency.  Councillors had been screaming at the Departments responsible for the environment and housing for years to fund the site.  They put what they wanted to see into the local area plan by unanimous vote, which is remarkable but positive.  The Minister's predecessor, Eoghan Murphy, refused to fund it.  The delay of 20 years in Shanganagh is due to central government not providing the funds.<\/p><p> St. Teresa's Gardens is the same.  Dublin city councillors are agreed on what they want on that site and there is no difficulty in getting councillors to support it.  The difficulty is that, before elected members have even been asked if they want to transfer it to the LDA, it is already up on the LDA's website.  The great tragedy of that is that it will split the cost-rental housing from the social housing.  Dublin City Council will buy back the rented social housing if this project goes to the LDA but the LDA will retain the cost-rental housing.  Then, in 30 or 40 years when the principal loans raised to build those apartments are paid down, it will be the LDA that benefits from the revenue surplus, not Dublin City Council, to which it would be hugely beneficial for recycling back into the maintenance of already underfunded stock.  And so on and so on.  It is never, in my experience, councillors who delay the development of sites.  It is central government not providing the funding.<\/p><p> The Minister is on record saying he wants to reassert the role of local authorities in the delivery of social and affordable homes.  That is great rhetoric but how he puts his money where his mouth is by giving local authorities the money to deliver that.  Oscar Traynor Road is a perfect example.  By a large majority, councillors have said they want 40% social, 40% affordable cost-rental and 20% affordable sale, not unlike D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council did.  Yet, all they are getting from Department officials, according to a report that went to Dublin city councillors, are delays and hurdles.  Let me be very clear: I fully accept their intentions but I do not understand why Deputies McAuliffe and Higgins would seek to amend this section.  It should be scrapped.  It has no place in this Bill.  It undermines local authorities' transparency and accountability and we will be pressing our opposition to this section. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021061500002#H00600","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":735,"content":"<p>I am more concerned about amendment No. 186 after hearing the Minister's response than I was before.  I am also concerned about section 56, which I am formally opposing as well.  There is a significant gap between what the Minister is saying and what the legislation allows for and there is a significant gap between what he is saying and what is actually happening in practice.  The legislation allows for public land and local authority land to be acquired by the Land Development Agency.  Then, if the Land Development Agency does not use that land it can sell it on to a developer or an investment fund purely with ministerial consent.  These sorts of schemes are already happening.  In that situation, there will potentially be private delivery of homes on what was public land and then the council or the State will step back in to take up a long-term lease, which would mean paying an exorbitant cost for 20 years to 25 years.  It is win-win for the investment fund or developer that ends up getting the public land and it comes at a huge cost to the public, the State and local authorities.  That is what is happening now and that is what the Bill allows for.  If our amendments are not accepted and this section is not deleted, that is exactly what is going to happen.  It does not matter what the Minister says about the LDA supplementing, not supplanting, local authorities because the Bill allows the LDA to supplant what local authorities are doing.<\/p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Broin is correct that the biggest obstacle to local authorities building social homes is the Department and the Government not providing funding and approval for schemes.  The recent report from the ESRI was damning in that regard.  It stated that the excuses being made about funding not being available are just not true.  It looked at the most conservative financing model it could come up with in terms of what could be drawn down and borrowed at historically low interest rates and, on that basis, it projected that we could easily double the amount of capital spending on social homes to deliver twice the amount of housing.  It was scathing of the current expenditure on private sector subsidies to deliver social housing.  I urge the Minister to read that report in full, if he has not done so.  If he has done so, I urge him to implement it in full and scrap the provisions in the Bill that would allow public land to be sold on to private developers and investment funds.  That is what it allows.  If the Minister is genuinely against that happening, he should amend the Bill to stop it.  It is as simple as that.  Why have these provisions in the Bill if not to keep the door open for that to happen?  That is the critical thing.  With more than 8,000 people living in emergency accommodation and more than 120,000 households on housing waiting lists or in insecure HAP tenancies, we simply cannot afford to continue with this lack of delivery of social and affordable homes.  One sure way of delaying the delivery of the houses we need is to sell off public land to private developers or investment funds that can then sit on it until prices increase or engage in a slow delivery that suits the full market prices they are trying to achieve.  I am now more concerned than ever about this section. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021061500002#J00200","speaker":"1550"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":736,"content":"<p>For clarity, Deputy Duncan Smith is not present so he will not be able to press amendment No. 185.

It is the dirty little secret behind the Land Development Agency.  The agency should be about gathering up land that is being sat on by private developers and speculators, or land being held by Departments or State agencies other than local authorities, and ensuring that land is developed for public and genuinely affordable housing.  Instead, we have an agency that is creating the opportunity to sell off public land to investment funds, speculators and private developers.  These are the very people who are responsible for the current housing and homelessness crisis.  There is simply no justification whatsoever for disposing of public land or involving private finance, speculators, developers or investment funds with the public land bank.  In fact, they threaten to undermine any attempt to deliver the public and affordable housing that some of us in opposition have been pointing out for a decade is needed to address this crisis.  This is NAMA part 2, to put it simply.  We warned about NAMA originally.

If the Government had simply provided the local authority, which had signalled its desire to build public housing on that land, with the funds to do so we would have public and affordable housing on the Shanganagh Castle site now.  The funding was not forthcoming because the Government always had a plan, of which the LDA is the culmination, to open up that public land bank, that particular site that was publicly-owned, to private finance and private developers.  The consequence of that is we do not know whether the affordable housing will be affordable.  There has also been a chronic delay in actually delivering anything and a sod being turned on that site.  Why is that?  It is because the Government has involved private financiers in the equation and they must make a profit.  The Government has been trying to square the circle of how to deliver affordable housing on public land and make a profit for private financiers and, of course, it is a very difficult circle to square.

It is very clear in this Bill that regardless of who owns the land there is an obligation to build affordable housing on it.

I ask the Minister to clarify, because it is important for the record of the committee, that the purpose of the Bill is to assign the obligation to have affordability on it, rather than allowing a mechanism to make it unaffordable.  It is not a correct for Deputy Cian O'Callaghan to conclude that the Bill will allow land to be sold and then for it to be on the open market to be developed and speculated on.  He is leaving out the most important obligation in the Bill, namely, the permanent obligation, regardless of who owns the land, that only affordable housing may be built on it.

We had a clear example there of some of the best in sound bite politics and misrepresentations of the real situation.  That is just a fact.  Throwing out phrases like \"dirty little secret\" and that type of stuff is not correct, at the end of the day.  I reiterate that where local authorities have decided to dispose of land, they, like other bodies, including commercial bodies, must give first refusal to the LDA before selling to the market.  It is only in these circumstances that section 183 of the Local Government Act would not apply as it is moving land from one public body to another.  Deputy McAuliffe's point is absolute.  Deputy Cian O'Callaghan may want to clarify what he said but the reality of it is we have already seen, very recently, schemes that have been funded by my Department, through the serviced sites fund, voted down by the Deputy's party, the Social Democrats, and voted by down by Sinn F&eacute;in, Deputies &Oacute; Broin and Paul Donnelly's party.  That is the proof of the pudding.  That is 1,200 homes gone.  Of those, 238 were to be social, 238 affordable and 150 cost-rental.  They are all gone.<\/p><p>People will have to make up their minds as to whether they really want unproductively used State-owned lands to remain in that condition with State bodies sitting on them.  I do not want that, and neither does the Government.  The Bill will ensure that it does not happen.  Saying that this measure would be a mechanism to sell off public land to investment funds, developers, speculators and so on - I am quoting - is a sound bite that might play well with some elements of the media and keep people disaffected, but we are concerned with delivering solutions.  Parties are opposing these mechanisms.  They actually opposed the LDA building any homes at all.  Deputies &Oacute; Broin and O'Callaghan went even further and opposed the LDA even planning to build for houses by saying they did not want the master plan.  Let us get real.<\/p><p> I will consider Report Stage amendments to see whether there can be further changes in this regard, but I firmly believe that we must get on with building affordable and social homes on State-owned lands.  I will table amendments to increase the affordable ratio on those lands further.  I put it to the Deputies who argue against it to set out what they will do.  Will they vote against homes for working people being built on State-owned lands as their parties have done in respect of council-owned lands?<\/p><p> We all want the State to use its land appropriately and to deliver social and affordable housing.  Some Deputies are not crazy about affordable housing and do not believe in real homeownership, but this Government does.  We want to give people a chance to own their own homes at an affordable rate and we have voted accordingly for it.  That is why definitions of \"affordability\" are contained in the Affordable Housing Bill, which is a Bill I hope the Members opposite will support.<\/p><p> I will conclude on my next point because I know time is short, but some serious charges have been made about what the LDA will do.  Deputies &Oacute; Broin, O'Callaghan and Boyd Barrett, people for whom I have personal regard, know better than that.

My point is that who delivers homes matters.  If public land is sold to a private developer or investment fund - I did not use the word \"speculator\"; the Minister used it, although he is right that land could also be sold to speculators - and a certain percentage is to be affordable or social, we know from what is happening now that the affordable housing will be at a higher price, in particular because the private sector has to borrow at a higher cost.  That is a fact.  I looked at one planning application recently where the financing costs were 14% of the total.  That would not be the case with public delivery.  Since the cost is higher, the affordable purchase price - or the rent if the property is cost rental - will be more expensive.  As such, it matters who delivers these affordable homes.  It also matters in the case of social housing.  If public lands owned by a local authority are acquired by the LDA and sold on to a private developer, the local authority or the State could end up leasing the social homes built on them back at an expensive rate.  The local authority building housing directly would be a much better use of resources, as the ESRI pointed out.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the proposal for 1,200 homes that was voted through in respect of lands in Donabate, I do not agree with the majority of those homes being sold at full market price when they are on public lands.

We are engaging with stakeholders who made written submissions on the general scheme.  This is the second instalment of our engagement on this matter.  We had a previous engagement about four weeks ago with a number of other witnesses.  I thank Deputy Carroll MacNeill for chairing that session in my absence.  She is our in-house expert on the topics involved and I thank her for stepping into the breach.  She is also the Vice Chairman of the committee and has a particular expertise and interest in the matter.<\/p> <p>  Today's witnesses are appearing virtually before the committee from outside the Leinster House precincts.  As per the current fashion, we are holding remote sessions and that is working well on a practical level but there are some limitations.  I welcome the witnesses to the meeting.  We are joined by Mr. Liam Herrick of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties. ICCL.  Mr. Herrick is welcome.  His organisation is becoming familiar to the committee and I thank him for his continued input.  We are also joined by Ms Gemma McLoughlin-Burke, also from the ICCL.  I thank Ms McLoughlin-Burke for attending.  She is a procedural rights fellow at the ICCL.  We are also joined by Mr. Kevin Condon, a principal officer from the civil legislation unit in the Department of Justice.  The Department's representatives regularly attend and participate in our meetings.  I thank all involved for being here.<\/p> <p>  I invite witnesses and members to make sure they unmute their devices when they are addressing the committee so that we can capture the sound.  I ask members and witnesses to mute their devices while not contributing to avoid picking up background noise or feedback.  I also ask that they use the raise hand function when they wish to contribute.<\/p> <p>  Before I invite the witnesses to deliver their opening statements, I advise them of the following regarding parliamentary privilege.  All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of a person or entity.  Therefore, if statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.<\/p><p>For witnesses attending remotely outside of the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present in the committee room would, and I ask them to be mindful of that.<\/p><p> Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside of the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  For members who are participating remotely, I offer the usual advice about keeping their devices on mute until they speak.  They might have their cameras switched on unless they need to turn them off and be mindful that we are in public session.  There is the procedural privilege requirement that because of the constitutional requirement as interpreted by the Houses of the Oireachtas that members must be physically present within the confines of the place, namely, Leinster House, a member cannot participate from outside Leinster House in this session or, indeed, any similar sessions.<\/p><p> Finally, I remind members that the clock is as always against us.  We have two hours for the session.  That is a decent period but if we run up against the clock, we have a strict cut-off point because of Covid limitations.  I ask members and witnesses to adhere to the subject matter because I will not be able to let the meeting stray too far off the agenda.<\/p><p> The format of the meeting is that each witness and or organisation will be invited to make an opening statement of approximately five minutes.  Once the opening statements have been delivered, I will call on members of the committee to put their questions or comments to the witnesses and the meeting.  Depending on the time, there may be an opportunity for a second such round.  Effectively, we will have opening statements from the witnesses, we will have questions and comments from members, and we might do one or two rounds depending on time.  As I said, the duration of the meeting is limited.<\/p><p> I will move on to the witnesses.  I will begin with Mr. Herrick, who has been with us before and who is very welcome back.  I am delighted to have him with us again.  Mr. Herrick has five minutes in which to make his opening comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021061500002#A00400","speaker":"1583","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":807,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.  I thank the committee members for inviting us to be with the committee today.  As the Chairman has already indicated, I am joined by my colleague, Ms McLoughlin-Burke, who is procedural rights fellow with the ICCL.<\/p> <p>  As members of the committee will know, the ICCL is an independent human rights organisation which has played an active role in public discourse on matters of law, policy and human rights since its foundation in 1976.  In particular, our perspective is to ensure that Irish law and practice is compliant and meets the standards of the constitutional rights and the rights set out in international human rights law.  Our founders include the late Kader Asmal, professor of law at Trinity College Dublin, the late Mr. Justice Donal Barrington, a member of the Supreme Court, and Mary Robinson, former President of Ireland and UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, and the administration of justice has been a particular priority issue of the ICCL in its work.  In 2007, we published a report, Justice Matters, which was a comprehensive analysis of the issues of independence and accountability with regard to the Irish judicial system and we have made a number of submissions on the question of judicial reform over recent decades.<\/p> <p>  The judicial appointments process in Ireland has been a point of contention and controversy in recent years and the ICCL believes that a deficit in formality and transparency in the system has impacted on public confidence in the Judiciary.  In that context, we strongly welcome the proposals in the proposed Bill to introduce clear and transparent criteria by which appointments would be made, and we share the Government's stated objective of promoting diversity and ensuring that the Judiciary is one which is truly representative of the people of Ireland.  Although the ICCL recognises that the proposed Bill marks a significant improvement on the preceding appointment process, we are concerned that some of the provisions fall short of international best practice.  In preparing our submission on the proposed Bill, we relied on and referred to international standards derived from a number of treaties, including international human rights treaties, the European Convention on Human Rights and the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights.<\/p> <p>  Sorry, I believe there might be somebody speaking.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021061500002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Herrick"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":808,"content":"<p>I wonder if all of those not currently contributing could mute their microphones.

We have also relied on the UN basic principles on the independence of the Judiciary, the Council of Europe recommendations on the independence and efficiency and the role of judges, the European Charter on the statute for judges and the International Principles on the Independence and Accountability of Judges, Lawyers and Prosecutors.  There is a wide range of international standards from which to draw and which can inform the legislation.<\/p> <p>  On the question of independence and who should constitute the appointing or nominating body, the current proposals recommend that the Chief Justice, two members of the Judicial Council and the president of the court in which the vacancy arises will form part of the commission.  In line with international best practice, the ICCL recommends that the three suggested judicial members of the Commission should be elected by their peers in order to ensure the strongest possible transparency and independence.<\/p> <p>  The Judiciary must be representative of the society over which it adjudicates.  All appointments should take into account the fundamental importance of ensuring diversity and appropriate representation in the Judiciary.  This should be reflected in the criteria for appointment to all judicial posts.  Broadly speaking, we welcome the approach that is taken in the proposed Bill in this regard.  We recognise, however, that as the Judiciary is drawn from the senior members of both legal professions, it will not be possible to address the objective of achieving diversity without looking at the question of diversity among the senior reaches of the Bar and the solicitors' profession.<\/p> <p>  The process must be transparent.  The introduction of clear objective criteria based on merit is welcome.  However, the number of recommendations by the commission to the Government should be reduced, in our view, to three for one nomination and five and eight, accordingly.  We believe that we should minimise the discretion of Government in the process to the greatest extent possible to achieve the strongest level of public confidence.  We also believe that there is no justification for a separate process for the appointment of senior officers of the court - the Chief Justice and the presidents of the superior courts.  A separate system for such senior appointments which is more heavily politically dominated, and has a role, for example, for the Attorney General as a voting member, risks undermining the benefit of the general appointment process.<\/p> <p>  In order for the appointment process to maintain public confidence, there must also be some level of accountability.  Where there are welcome provisions here about a report back to the Oireachtas subsequent to appointments, we believe that where the Government decides to deviate from what is recommended by the Judicial Appointments Commission it should have to give reasons.  We are clearly recommending that the recommendations of the commission should include a ranking of candidates as well as a smaller number which will greatly enhance independence.  It should be noted by the committee that the proposed approach would, in fact, retain a discretion for Government to circumvent the Judicial Appointments Commission completely.  Bearing that in mind, it is very important that we strength the process of the commission.<\/p> <p>  The ICCL sees the proposed Bill as a radical and hugely welcome opportunity to improve the judicial appointment system process in Ireland.  If approached correctly, these changes can have the potential to enhance public confidence in both the Judiciary and the rule of law.

The judicial appointments commission Bill is currently at an advanced stage of drafting.  The Government approved and published the general scheme of the Bill in December.  It was forwarded to a number of key stakeholders at that time, including the Judiciary and the legal professions, and a number of submissions were received.  I might focus on a number of principles that underpin the provisions in the general scheme.<\/p> <p>  There was broad acceptance of the need to update the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board arrangements, which were put in place via legislation introduced more than 25 years ago to deal with first-time appointment of judges.  There was also a recognition that the involvement of lay persons in the process should be increased, expanding the experience and knowledge brought to the process of selection.<\/p><p> There was a need to expand the remit of the advisory body to include promotions, or elevations, of serving judges, which now is addressed under an informal process for the appointment of serving judges.  The Judicial Appointments Advisory Board has no role in this.  In the programme for Government brought forward last year, it was determined that the process of appointing judges for the future should remain under the leadership and guidance of the Chief Justice, and a substantial judicial input in the process is advisable.  To support the new arrangements, the Government agreed that a small dedicated resource be established through an office under the supervision of the commission.  An important further principle, to which the previous speaker referred, was that merit will become the defining criterion for the selection of judges.  This should be expressed in statute, with regard to other key objectives, which the general scheme sets out.  It was also understood that the commission should be enabled to develop statements of judicial skills and attributes, as well as selection procedures, having regard to particular criteria.  This structured approach would allow the commission to further develop the requirements for judicial recommendation and selection.  A further point was that the constitutional position relating to the Government's function of appointing judges be maintained.<\/p><p> Regarding consultations, a public consultation process was conducted in 2014 focusing on questions relating to the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board process, independence of the Judiciary and related matters.  The outcome of those consultations is still informing the fabric of the scheme and the earlier forerunner Bill.<\/p><p> The Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, which was established on foot of the Court and Court Officers Act 1995, was a landmark development at the time, introducing a new, independent element to the judicial appointments process.  Article 35.1 of the Constitution provides that judges are appointed by the President.  Under Article 13.9, such power is exercisable and performable only on the advice of the Government.<\/p><p> As members will be aware, a key element underpinning the 2017 Bill, which remains in the general scheme, is the composition of the commission.  A significant change in this scheme compared with the previous Bill is that the Chief Justice will be the chairperson of the new commission and that there will be an equal number of laypersons and judges.  The Attorney General will also be a member.  The board has been chaired since its inception by the Chief Justice of the day and this ensures that the selection process is rigorous and meets the need for a strong, independent Judiciary.  I am sure we will go on to look more closely at the composition of the commission and members may have questions about that.  The lay contribution of the board is an important consideration.  The scheme makes reference to a number of areas of experience and knowledge that it is anticipated lay members appointed to the commission will have.<\/p><p> A key aspect of this Bill is that all judicial positions are covered.  The Bill replicates the 2017 Bill approach whereby all persons who wish to be considered for appointment to judicial office, including serving judges, will be required to apply to the commission.  At this time, the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board deals only with first-time judicial appointments.  For the elevation of serving judges from one court to another, there is no system at all in statute other than the constitutional process.  It would appear that it is no longer sustainable that there is no statutory process in place to address some of the most important appointments to any office in the State.  There is general acceptance that these arrangements should be updated in the manner envisaged in the planned Bill, in the interests of good governance, transparency and accountability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021061500002#B00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Condon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":813,"content":"<p>Before I call on members, I will start the ball rolling.  My first question is for the ICCL but Mr. Condon should feel free to answer if he wishes.  It strikes me that one of the deficits in the arrangements we have had for the past 25 years, since the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board was created, is that it appears to act as a sort of Garda vetting mechanism rather than an actual selection vehicle.  People have to go through the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board and get out the far side to be available for selection but it does not appear to have a role in prioritising, weighting or ranking candidates.  Am I right in saying that?  Within the confines of the constitutional framework, is that something that can be addressed outside of a referendum or would we need to go one step further and change the Constitution?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021061500002#C00200","speaker":"1583"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":814,"content":"<p>The Chairman summarised our perspective very clearly.  The Bill should be trying to achieve a shift from a system of vetting, in which candidates are simply excluded if they are unsuitable, to one in which candidates are actively selected and recommended.

Our preference is that the recommendation of the commission include a ranking of candidates in order of preference.  We note that some of the other experts who have been before the committee have also suggested an obligation to actively engage with candidates, including through interviews and so on.  That is an interesting recommendation but we are broadly coming from the same perspective.  We should be moving towards a more active selection and recommendation process.

It should be possible, however, to establish conventions and norms whereby the vast majority of appointments, if not all, are done through the process.

The 1995 Act sets out reasonably minimal criteria for that.  Nevertheless, however, it brought the involvement of three laypeople into what was a board of ten people at the time.  That board, of course, changed to 11 people when the Court of Appeal was established in 2014.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman will be aware, of course, that there was some question of having a lay majority within the 2017 Bill.  The provisions of the Bill set out a wide range of criteria that Government believes laypeople can bring to the process, whether it is experience of the courts, arbitration and mediation or administration and business.  I believe a wide range of perspectives are required to be captured on a board.  To be clear, the board has nine members.  It is actually an equality of laypersons and judges because there will be four judges and the Attorney General.  There will not, therefore, be a majority of laypersons but an equal number of laypersons and judges.<\/p> <p>  It is fairly consistent, for want of a better way of putting it, with nearby jurisdictions, which have strong and positive lay involvement.

It does not have a lay majority, which was proposed the last time around.  It introduces the Judicial Council as a source of nominees into the Judicial Appointments Commission.  That change alone to the Chief Justice chairing means there are a network of consequential amendments in the Bill, which would probably be a bit too detailed to go into.  They are there, however.  A lot of change is required.<\/p> <p>  On top of that, we have been looking at a number of other issues.  I believe I am free to say that since the scheme was passed, like any drafting process, a number of things were required to be fleshed out.

I first want to question the role of the Attorney General in all this.

However, the Attorney General would very much be the Government of the day's person on the board.  That, to me, reflects a problem.  If we think about it, that means the Attorney General will be there from the very beginning of the process right through to being at the Cabinet meeting at the very end of the process.  How appropriate is that in the context of trying to bring forward something that is supposed to change the old bad habits of the past?  That is one issue we need to try to deal with.  I would like to hear the views of both contributors on that issue, particularly the specific role of the Attorney General in all this.<\/p> <p>  Those who are selected by the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board at present are very much taken from a wide base of people, which is quite appropriate.  I refer to the procedures it uses to select people to be considered as members of the Judiciary.

That is really what the public is seeking.<\/p> <p>  With regard to promotions whereby people will be moving from lower courts to higher courts, etc., how can that measure of merit be put in place?

With regard to the Attorney General, in a sense, the appropriateness is measured against what has been in place since 1995.  The Attorney General has been a member of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board since 1995.  To some extent, the commission is certainly a development of the board.  In that context, the Attorney General has been retained.  He has been retained on the commission with no vote, however.  The only members on the commission who will be making a definitive call on a person going forward for selection, if it comes to a vote, of course, will be the lay members and judicial members.<\/p> <p>  With regard to more formalised procedures, a very important part of the scheme requires the commission to bring forward an entirely new set of selection procedures and statement of skills via the procedures committee and publish them, and to consult with whoever it needs, particularly presidents of the courts, to see what the appropriate requirements will be.<\/p> <p>  One important detail on the Deputy's final point about promotions is that those procedures would allow distinctions or differentiations to be made between different types of procedures that might apply for different types of courts or different classes of business before different courts.

I wish to raise a couple of issues, specifically with regard to what Mr. Herrick said about minimising Government discretion.<\/p><p>This is not a surprise.  The ICCL has been consistent on that line.  Does Mr. Herrick accept that there is a democratic requirement for an element of Government discretion?  Would he acknowledge that is an important part of the judicial appointments process?  Remarks have been made about bad habits of the past and things like that.  There is substantial evidence to support the notion that we have an excellent Judiciary that is functional, that abides by the rules of law and that delivers fairness, on the whole.  I am not saying that every judge is wonderful.  As a practitioner, I can say they are not.  Overall, however, we have a corpus of judges who are good, reliable and fair.<\/p><p> Mr. Herrick spoke about giving reasons for deviation from the recommendations of the commission.  In general, I think there is an absolute basis for that but, in practice, there is a real difficulty.  Ranking candidates is all very well but asking the Government to publicly explain why it has chosen one candidate over another will create substantial problems from the point of view, in particular, of the unsuccessful candidate because it results in an official declaration of what the Government sees as the inadequacy of a candidate which could be damaging to that person professionally.  In the whole process of the appointment of judges, the confidentiality of applicants is paramount because many practitioners who are qualified and who would make excellent judges would never apply if they thought applications, particularly unsuccessful applications, were going to be made public because it would massively damage them within their profession and in the context of their ability to continue in their profession.<\/p><p> Deputy Martin Kenny referred to promotion from lower to higher courts and Mr. Condon has spoken about merit as a criterion.  All of that makes sense but I wonder is that not a tremendously subjective criterion?  There are many fine legal practitioners, solicitors and barristers who turn out not to be very good judges.  While an element of knowledge and experience in the litigation process is extremely important, I wonder can any of our guests tell us what constitutes the definitive criteria for what makes a good judge?  That is a difficult thing on which to settle.  In the past, there has always been a practice not to promote judges from the District Court to the Circuit Court or from the Circuit Court to the High Court because there was a danger that it would incentivise a particular judge to behave in a certain way.  If a judge is focused on promotion rather than doing the right thing or rendering the right decision, it potentially compromises that individual in his or her ability to do the job as opposed to climbing the ladder.  I wonder if our guests have anything to say about that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021061500002#D01400","speaker":"1685","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":836,"content":"<p>On the first question asked by the Senator, it is clear that the proposed approach retains an absolute discretion for the Government to make appointments to the bench without any reference to the Judicial Appointments Commission nominations.  It is for the committee and the Oireachtas, ultimately, to decide whether that is constitutionally mandated or not.  There is nothing in our submission that is in any way critical of the quality of the existing Judiciary; far from it.  It is absolutely the case that we have had the benefit in our constitutional history of a strong, independent Judiciary that has acted and exercised its functions with great honour.  That does not mean we should be complacent, however.  We need to be mindful of taking this opportunity to have the most robust and strongest process possible to anticipate all the potential changes that might happen in the future.  In that regard, I think there is nothing inconsistent in saying we have a strong, independent Judiciary now but we can have stronger processes in the future.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Martin Kenny raised the role of the Attorney General in his contribution and that touches on this matter.  There are clear concerns about the Attorney General having any role in the process.  To a large extent, the approach that is proposed by the Government addresses many of those concerns in the general appointment process by the Attorney General having a non-voting role.  However, we are presented with a significant difficulty when we have a separate senior appointment process for the Chief Justice and the presidents of the superior courts.  In those cases, the Attorney General not only retains a role but has a significant voting role as one of three.  That is probably the greatest weakness in the proposed Bill as it is currently presented.<\/p> <p>  With regard to reasons for deviation, Senator Ward made good points about the requirement for confidentiality.  It would be interesting to explore whether it is possible to balance what we are trying to achieve in terms of accountability with the confidentiality of applicants.  There are two different ways in which the Government may deviate from what is recommended by the commission.  One is to deviate from it in terms of the ranking of candidates which we propose.  A second method of deviation is to circumvent the proposed list entirely.  It is essential that there is some requirement on the Government to explain itself when it takes the latter course and possibly to work out whether it can achieve the ranking of candidates while balancing principles of confidentiality for unsuccessful candidates.<\/p> <p>  The Senator also asked about judicial training and the specific skills that are required of judges.  We must look at the Judicial Council Act and the proposed judicial appointments commission Bill in tandem.  The requirements in place under the Judicial Council Act in terms of ongoing training of the Judiciary will be a great resource to strengthen our Judiciary and allowing it to keep up with contemporary developments.  I do not think that objective will be achieved through the Judicial Appointment Commission Bill alone, it must be considered in tandem with the Judicial Council Act.  We are supportive of what is in the Judicial Council Act.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021061500002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Herrick"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":837,"content":"<p>I thank our guests.  Much of what I was going to say has already been covered.  I agree with Deputy Martin Kenny that if the independence of the commission is so important for the Government, I find it hard to see how that sits with the inclusion of the Attorney General, who is a member of the Cabinet and has been appointed by the Government of the day, in the decision-making process.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Herrick stated in his report that the knowledge requirements are inadequate.  I am glad to hear Senator Ward has experienced great judges over the years but, while most of the judges with whom I have dealt over the years were well trained, a few have been inappropriate or inadequately trained.  Should a practitioner have spent a year or two in criminal law before he or she starts to run trials?  Should a practitioner have similar experience in family law before he or she starts to hear family law cases?  I accept the point about ongoing training but just because someone has been a qualified solicitor or barrister for ten years does not necessarily mean that he or she has any idea what is going on in, for example, the criminal courts.  Does Mr. Herrick have any views on what specific training should be required?  One would not go into the commercial court without a knowledge of commercial law.  I heard what Mr. Condon said about a background in business and commerce but we should be exploring the possibility of appointing someone with a background in consumer protection, the Private Residential Tenancies Board, the equality commission, or a former prison governor who would have a great understanding of the people who are regularly attending before, for example, the District Court and the Circuit Court.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021061500002#E00300","speaker":"1488"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":838,"content":"<p>The last question was addressed to Mr. Herrick if he would like to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021061500002#E00400","speaker":"1583"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":839,"content":"<p>With the Chairman's grace, I will refer the question about the qualifications of judges to my colleague, Ms McLoughlin-Burke.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021061500002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Herrick"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":840,"content":"<p>In relation to-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021061500002#E00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Gemma McLoughlin-Burke"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":841,"content":"<p>Is Ms McLoughlin-Burke on mute?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021061500002#E00700","speaker":"1583"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":842,"content":"<p>I should no longer be muted.

I have one specific question to put to Mr. Condon regarding the scheme of the proposed Bill, which has been worrying me since the last occasions we discussed the general scheme.  It concerns head 9, which deals with the composition of the commission and which effectively states that there will be nine members of the commission. Subhead (1)(b) of head 9 contains the phrase \"a Court President being one of the President of the Court of Appeal, the President of the High Court, the President of the Circuit court or the President of the District Court, to be determined in accordance with subhead (2)\".  Subhead (2) states \"The member referred to in subhead (1)(b) shall, for the purpose of the determination of a recommendation by the Commission in respect of a judicial vacancy or vacancies in a court, [be] the President of that Court.\"  What we have there is a rotating membership to be shared among the presidents of courts.  One problem with this is that the commission has business other than simply considering candidates.  It has to make annual reports, lay down procedures, set out criteria of this various kinds and adopt statements and the like.  I have a major problem with saying that, for instance, the position will be occupied on a kind of rotating basis depending on the recommendatory business that is going on when there is other day-to-day business which has to be carried out by the commission, such as preparing reports for Government or Oireachtas committees, handling its relationship with the chief executive and making decisions on finance, recruitment, etc..  It is not clear how that particular head works if, for example, we cannot say at any one point that Mr. Justice Michael McDowell either is or is not a member of the commission for the purposes of all those ancillary matters.  That is a point I wanted to draw to Mr. Condon's attention.  More work needs to be done to remedy the position in this regard.  I ask Mr. Condon to come back to me on that point.<\/p> <p>  I echo what Senator Ward said.  When in government, one of the aspects of appointing members of the Judiciary is that it is not always based simply on the individual merits of an individual.  For example, one might decide that the Supreme Court needs to be made more liberal or more conservative, more pro-European or less pro-European, more pro-personal injuries awards being high or pro-personal injuries awards being low or whatever.  In the context of issues on that nature, a diversity of approach and philosophy is something which a properly appointing Government may consider to be a hugely important issue.  If there are three or four people in a row who all have the same view and the Government is of the view that the court is beginning to go in a particular direction and it is not happy with that, it is its democratic function to correct the position by making its own decisions.  We have a simplistic view of merit that one person is better than another on the basis of merit, but we also must have not simply the crude rationale of, say, having people who are representative of the community demographically or whatever else.  In addition, the Government has a very clear duty to ensure that the Supreme Court has a philosophical balance to it which the Government would want to ensure is maintained.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Condon and Mr. Herrick might grapple with another point I wish to raise.  The Attorney General is a constitutional officer.  He or she is the adviser to the Government on all matters of law.<\/p><p>It is quite possible for an Attorney General to look at the slate of candidates putting themselves forward for selection and come to the view that a judge-dominated commission is knocking on the head some kinds of people that maybe should have a look in.  One of the problems with the 2017 legislation was there was a bit of intellectual confusion as to whether the Government should know who was applying for jobs.  There was a huge problem with this issue.  The then Minister, Deputy Flanagan, did his best to rescue, from the extremes of Shane Ross's approach to the matter, some degree of common sense that the Government should know, by one means or another, what kind of people are being rejected.  If liberals are being rejected by the Judiciary on a consistent basis, somebody should be in a position to tell the Government that it seems to be replicating itself and that \"judgeitis\" has descended on the process.  Somebody should be in a position to report to the Government what kind of people are failing to get onto the shortlist.<\/p><p> The Attorney General has an important role of being the canary in the coalmine and being in a position to tell the Government, for example, that there are five really good solicitors or barristers who are constantly being turned down or that others are being preferred, and that he or she is worried about it.  The only way the Cabinet will be made aware of this is if the Attorney General has some sight of what is happening at the commission.  There is some merit to the Attorney General having this role and I throw that out there for consideration.<\/p><p> There is another point that arose in the context of the 2017 legislation.  Very frequently, when it is decided to appoint the President of the Court of Appeal to the Supreme Court or something of that nature, there are consequential knock-on vacancies in the Court of Appeal and the High Court.  One of the problems pointed out to the Minister at the time, Deputy Flanagan, was that there was a very clunky process whereby where a vacancy arises in this way, the entire process has to be started again to go hunting for somebody to fill that vacancy.  What happened when I was around was that three such appointments were made on the same day in a promotional appointment chain.  This is no longer possible because we have to start again and go back to each layer of the cake and conduct interviews for vacancies that arise.  There has to be some flexibility when a vacancy is created.  I really believe there should be a standing invitation to judges to state whether they want to be, for example, on the Court of Appeal.  Those that want to be should be considered as candidates semi-permanently and, likewise, other solicitors and barristers.<\/p><p> I am unhappy with the idea that the legal profession, which often sees an awful lot more of their colleagues than judges do and see how they really think and hear what they really say over cups of coffee, or over a drink for that matter, and how their brains actually function, very frequently are in a very good position to advise whatever commission we have that Joe or Josephine Bloggs is a bit ropey.  It is a mistake, therefore, to knock out some input from the people who see these colleagues on a daily basis.  The people who have been receiving rude letters from their solicitor or barrister colleagues for 20 years can say that a person is a bit of a header.  A judge might not realise this but it is a very valuable input.  Having served on the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, I know that the input from members of the Law Society and the Bar Council was sometimes very important in sounding a warning bell about somebody who looked brilliant on paper to the effect that there was a problem and that the individual in question was not as good as he or she sounded or looked.  There are discretionary issues such as this.<\/p><p> I throw these ideas out for consideration.  I am particularly worried about head 9.  I cannot understand how the council can have only nine members and that four of them will be rotating all the time.  If the council is supposed to have a continuous corporate existence and is to make decisions about annual reports, hiring extra staff, accepting the recommendations of the chief executive and all the rest of it, who will be a member on a day-to-day basis of the commission?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021061500002#F01100","speaker":"1669","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":856,"content":"<p>I thank Senator McDowell for his comments and his insights from his various roles.

The Senator will note from our submission that we do not recommend the Attorney General be excluded from participation in the commission.  We do think the provision that he or she be a non-voting member addresses some of the concerns.  There is a separate question, of course, about the potential appointment of an Attorney General as a member of the Judiciary and whether there should be an exclusion, which is a separate question.<\/p> <p>  The Senator set out very clearly a political and philosophical perspective on the potential role of the Government in the process.  He spoke about the concepts of correcting what might be the philosophical or ideological balance on the court.  I understand this point of view but we could easily counter it.  They are subjective concepts that can also be interpreted as an excess of political input in the process.  Overall, we clearly recommend a curtailment of discretion but a retention of some discretion.  With regard to how this balance is achieved, broadly speaking the approach taken strikes the balance quite well, when it is combined with accountability on the part of the Government once it has made decisions and has responsibility for the commission and how it exercises its functions.<\/p> <p>  The Senator made the point that it is essential the Government has sight of all persons who apply.  We understand the proposed scheme retains the provision that the Government will have sight of all applicants, which would be an important safeguard against what the Senator has suggested, that the commission tends to go in a particular direction.<\/p> <p>  On the question of whether the Government might have to start again, a chain is a very important practical concern.  Our understanding, and Mr. Condon might correct me on this, is that the scheme allows for the Government to anticipate a vacancy arising so it can act before the vacancy manifests, which I imagine would happen, for example, when a judge is going to reach retirement age or where the term of office of a senior officeholder expires.<\/p><p>The scenario outlined by the Senator might not be quite as grim as he depicted.  It might be possible for the Government to act in advance and put the appointment chains in motion before the vacancy would arise.<\/p><p> The point about the legal profession is well made.  It might be possible to address that in how the criteria for lay members might be set by the Public Appointments Service, for example, and whether there would be requirements for legal professional expertise within those criteria.  We note the comments made by the Bar Council and the Law Society in that regard but, overall, we think the balance is quite well struck as it is.<\/p><p> When we speak of diversity it relates to the profound problem of a lack of representativeness in the legal professions.  This was manifested as recently as yesterday with appointments to the inner Bar, for example, where, in the solicitors' profession, five women were appointed as opposed to nine men, and, on the Bar side, it was five women as opposed to 20 men.  There are problems with diversity even when it comes to the question of gender, not to mention, as matters stand, other questions of diversity.  It is appropriate that this proposed Bill would be used to try to address the issue, but it will not be possible to do so without also looking deeper into the processes and structures within the professions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021061500002#G00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Herrick","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":863,"content":"<p>It is lovely to see Mr. Herrick and I thank him for coming in.  On his final point, gender imbalance on the courts has been substantially remedied by political intervention since 2011.  That is notwithstanding what he said about the professions - a point well made, particularly when we look at the proportion of women becoming senior counsels every year.  However, there was political intervention to rebalance that in the courts.  The big concern with a judicially dominated structure, such as the one we are talking about, is the threat of judicial self-selection.  At our previous meeting, we talked about the great Australian judge, Michael Kirby, who was the first openly gay judge and who said he would never have been selected by his peers at that time.  That was such an important statement and intervention.<\/p> <p>  I have six questions.  I am happy to break them up and come back in, whatever is best.

We drew from those, so when we talk about best practice we are talking about existing standards.  To give examples, the UN basic principles refer to standards applying to the promotion and careers of judges, as well as their appointments being better dealt with by a selection body, at least half the membership of which should comprise members of the judiciary.  There is also reference in some of the standards to a preference for the judicial members of such a body to be elected by their peers.  That is where we are drawing it from.  As the Deputy knows, any recommendations we bring before the committee on any matter will be grounded on, and derived from, international standards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021061500002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Herrick"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":867,"content":"<p>Okay.  I want to go back to Mr. Herrick on some of that.  Those UN principles date from 1985 and 1999, but what Mr. Herrick does not include is a much more significant document, which is the Mount Scopus International Standards of Judicial Independence.  All the leading political scientists and legal theorists came together to draw up those standards, which specifically acknowledge the role of governments in circumstances where there are judicial selection boards.  I can send that to Mr. Herrick.  It is so important.  For example, the standards state: \"The recent trend of establishing judicial selection boards or commissions ... should be viewed favourably [of course we have that], provided that a proper balance is maintained in the composition of such boards [by] branches of [the] government\".<\/p> <p>  The UN standards, and all the others to which Mr. Herrick referred, particularly those of the Council of Europe, which deals with so many European career judge systems, are entirely different from, and not comparable with, the common law model.  The frame of reference is very different, especially when one looks at the judicial selection systems in Latin America and Russia, all of which are covered by UN standards.  These are very different democracies that have very different standards, completely different career models for judges and a very different role for politics.  In many cases, they are absent a constitutional democracy.  They must be set carefully against a real comparative analysis, which, of course, relates to advanced common law democracies and constitutional democracies.

My questions are as follows, if that is helpful.  Leaving the issue of standards aside, there is a question of independence regarding how interviews and promotions are conducted.  There is a question about the balance of the independence of the legal profession as well.  For example, and this is something that can be worked out in the eventual Bill, who is it thought should be interviewing prospective judges?  Will it be sitting judges of the courts in which they practice?  Who will it be and how would one go through a process in order to maintain, as my colleague Senator Ward noted, the independence of judges, against a selection process where there may very well be personality clashes and in the context of which a whole range of other things may arise?  How do we protect the independence of both the legal profession and judicial members in those circumstances?<\/p> <p>  The ranking situation is quite interesting because two totally different types of candidate can come through, with different practice backgrounds and very different skills.  If it was a question of ranking me against the Chair, for example, it is obvious that we are completely different people and are not necessarily comparable.  How does Mr. Herrick conceive of ranking people with very different skill sets and experiences?  Senator McDowell alluded to trying to achieve an overall balance on the court.  I will leave it at that because I do not want to take up too much time.

As we previously stated on more than one occasion, the ICCL is very clear that we have immense regard for the quality of the judges who sit on our courts now and for those who have sat on them over the years.  We do not think there is any incompatibility between believing that we get good results, by and large, from the current system but also wanting to improve and strengthen the system for the future.<\/p><p> On the specific question about how the judicial membership might be composed and how the questions and so on would be conducted, Senator McDowell has already asked questions about how the body corporate would be constituted.  I understand from Mr. Condon that it will be addressed in the Bill.  Our suggestion is that all the judicial members nominated by the Judicial Council and those acting on behalf of the appropriate court would be elected by all members of the Judiciary.  The thinking behind that is it would strengthen the authority and legitimacy of the idea of these people acting on behalf of all judges.  It would also avoid a potential danger - not one that we believe is manifest - of having a clique of the senior members of the Judiciary that would dominate the judicial input and that would not represent the Judiciary as a whole.  That is our suggestion on that point.<\/p><p> On the question of ranking, we are talking about a selection process.  No matter how it is constructed, it will involve choices and preferences.  There are two elements to what we suggest.  The first is ranking, which strengthens independence, and the other is reducing the number of names that goes to the Government.  The two should be seen as going hand in hand.  Both would make a contribution towards strengthening, and of course either could be done separately from the other.  Both would have the effect of strengthening the independence of the process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021061500002#H01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Herrick","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":876,"content":"<p>May I come in again?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021061500002#J00200","speaker":"1480"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":877,"content":"<p>Yes, although I want to allow Mr. Condon in again.

We do not believe that the approach proposed in the general scheme precludes the possibility of procedures being set by the procedures committee.  The criteria to be established under the proposed Bill would allow the commission to take into account some of those overall considerations.  For example, we are mandating that it would take into account considerations of diversity, which, of course, cannot be considered just in terms of isolation of individual appointments and must be done in the round.  Similarly, we would have thought it possible under the current proposals for the commission to also take into account wider questions of balance as well.<\/p> <p>  It is probably difficult to make an overall assessment of the proposed approach until we see what procedures are ultimately agreed by the procedures committee.

Mr. Herrick has mentioned the international conventions, which are very important.  As far possible, we have attempted to have regard to international conventions and best practice.  The two that loom the largest are the Group of States against Corruption, GRECO, recommendations and the European Commission's view of our legislation.  It is important to say this scheme and the new Bill probably move much closer to what GRECO and the European Commission would like to see in one very important area, which is the composition of the commission itself.  That is important.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Herrick made a point about the election of judges.  I am not 100% sure about how that would be developed except that some of the nuts and bolts of the provisions are not absolutely finalised.  Looking at two Judicial Council nominees, there is a process within the council on how those members would be put forward.  That may involve some element of what Mr. Herrick is referring to.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Carroll MacNeill asked who will conduct interviews.  These are significant questions in how the eventual Bill will pan out.  There is provision for criteria and statements of qualification and procedures.  Some of the elements that those statements and approaches must have regard to include independence of the Judiciary.  There are some benchmarks around the concept of judicial independence where regard would be had when those statements on procedures and skills are produced.  I guess it will be members of the judicial commission who will conduct those interviews.  It seems a logical conclusion from the provisions as they have been developed to date.  We may have to wait to see what the commission produces.  It is required that after 12 months it should produce detailed documentation as to how the procedures are to be managed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021061500002#J00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Condon"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":881,"content":"<p>Deputy Carroll MacNeill made the interesting observation that while international comparisons are very useful and can be very informative, they have to be comparable.

I can give a practical example of the interview point.  There may be a very conservative Judiciary and a particularly difficult President of the High Court, for example.  Mr. Herrick may have been briefing counsel to try to advance civil liberties and the elements are constantly bashing up against each other.  The best senior counsels may be trying to advance civil liberties but there might be a clash between a person and the President of the High Court, who may then interview that person for a position on the High Court.  We must design systems for the worst in people and not the best.  We must try to protect the system against a nefarious influence, such as in that hypothetical example.<\/p><p>There was a point made on the retention of discretion.  The Government has absolute discretion from a constitutional point of view, and that is a necessary position for the read across under Article 13.9 of the Constitution about advising the President generally.  The practice with the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board has meant that there is absolute constitutional discretion but there is also the concept of political discretion.  As Mr. Herrick mentioned, this is the established convention, as it were.  The established convention is that the Government always - or with only one exception - has appointed judges from the list of recommended candidates from the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.  That exception was Mr. Justice Frank Clarke, who became Chief Justice.  Where it was not done, it had to be published in <i>Iris Oifgi&uacute;il<\/i>.  He is the only exception I am aware of.  There is a political convention as well as one relating to the overall constitutional point.<\/p><p>What is the discretion within that, given that this is already the case and the Government has never deviated from it?  If the point is that the Government is retaining sufficient discretion, how is that moving at all?  Does the witness accept that this has been the essential political convention for the complete period of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021061500002#J00800","speaker":"1480"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":883,"content":"<p>With the first point the Deputy speaks about guarding against the worst possible scenario in a judicial-dominated system.  One might equally point to the worst possible scenario in a politically dominated system, where an excellent lawyer who has been particularly critical of the State or represented persons that a particular Government might have a particular distaste for.  That is at least, I suggest, as great a danger as the scenario the Deputy outlined.<\/p><p>Currently, we have a system that is largely lacking in transparency and we are talking about replacing it with a model which will have checks and balances because there will be multiple actors and constituencies represented on the primary decision-making body.  There will be accountability, in the model we propose at least, whereby there will be reasons given.<\/p><p> On the second question, to say that recent Governments have abided by a convention may very well be true but that convention has been a system whereby the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board gives to Government a very long list of potential names for each particular post.  That still affords the Government very broad discretion.  The Government has abided by the convention but the convention has very broad discretion built into it.  This leaves open the risk of either political appointments or the perception of political appointments.  The latter will be restricted, curtailed and, we believe, improved by what is proposed in the general scheme and on the basis of the additional recommendations which we make.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021061500002#J00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Herrick","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":885,"content":"<p>Does Mr. Condon want to add to that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021061500002#K00200","speaker":"1583"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":886,"content":"<p>Briefly, the information the Deputy had is not information that a civil servant would necessarily have.

We have already had a good and comprehensive engagement.  There are 25 minutes remaining.  We will have to wrap up then but we may not require that time.  I will begin the second round of the questions.  There will be some latitude because we have covered many points.  We will not stray too far from the agenda but we can touch on wider topics.  My question is for both witnesses.  I am interested in hearing their responses.<\/p> <p>  The general scheme relates to judicial appointments and how people get  on the Bench.  We have had some discussion on how people will move from a lower Bench to a higher Bench, as it were.  Aside from the appointment process, I do not think judicial regulation, conduct, management or sanction, if appropriate, come within the scope of the proposed Bill, but I am not sure whether that exists, what format it takes or what process is in place.  There are two scenarios where that can unfold.  One is what has been  documented considerably certainly last year but also occasionally in the past where there has been what was considered to be judicial conduct off the Bench which was considered at times to be not appropriate or the subject of public comment, which certainly did not help anyone's cause.  There has been significant comment on that.  I hesitate to use the term \"judicial misconduct\" but there can be scenarios of problematic conduct by individuals on the Bench.  I do not mean decisions being made which a Government, a politician or even the public may agree or disagree with.  I mean standards of behaviour which, in other contexts, might be seen as workplace bullying.  It is very much the exception rather than the rule because the vast majority of academics, all the reports and even practitioners would say that they all perform impeccably.  Such issues can arise, however.  There are behaviours off the Bench which can be problematic but there are also such behaviours on the Bench.  I do not mean in terms of which side a particular judge comes down on but more how they execute that function.  It may be the case in any role when one is elevated at a certain point and is not answerable to anyone that bad habits or certain modes of behaviour can creep in which go unchecked for long periods and, in an even worse scenario, be exacerbated.  I am not sure whether there is anything in place to temper that.  I do not know, for example, whether there is a complaints process or any mode of regulation or mitigation.  If not, should there be and what might that look like?  Mr. Herrick might respond first and then Mr. Condon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021061500002#K01000","speaker":"1583"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":894,"content":"<p>The matters to which the Chairman refers are dealt with now by the Judicial Council and its conduct committee.

On behalf of the committee, I am delighted to extend a warm welcome to our witnesses from the Office of the Ombudsman for Children, Dr. Niall Muldoon, Ombudsman for Children and Ms Nuala Ward, director of investigations.<\/p> <p>  On behalf of the committee, I thank Dr. Muldoon for his report, No End in Site: An investigation into the living conditions of children on a local authority halting site, which was published in May 2021.  The report is hard to read, especially when one hears the testimony of the children about their living conditions.  <\/p> <p>  The committee is concerned that if Traveller community accommodation is not addressed satisfactorily then Traveller health, education and employment will also suffer.  The committee has received letters from primary school principals about the difficulties faced by Traveller children that has been made worse by Covid-19.<\/p> <p>  We can see from the report that poor accommodation is having a detrimental effect on Traveller education.  If Traveller community children today do not get a chance of an education, then another generation will suffer the same fate as many of their parents.  The committee is very interested in the ombudsman's report, his recommendations and his plans to look for six-month and 12-month updates from local authorities, which is particularly important.  The committee is looking at the role of local authorities in the provision of housing, particularly halting sites for Travellers.  The report, in terms of the halting sites, will be of great help to the committee.<\/p> <p>  I suggest that Dr. Muldoon makes an opening statement that lasts between five and ten minutes.  Then each member will have the opportunity to ask questions and they will have about five minutes for questions and answers.  However, members may come in a second and third time, as appropriate.<\/p> <p>  I invite Dr. Niall Muldoon, Ombudsman for Children, to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021061500002#A00575","speaker":"1575"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":910,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to appear and discuss my report, No End in Site.<\/p> <p>  As members of the committee are aware, the Ombudsman for Children&rsquo;s Office, OCO, is an independent statutory body, which was established under the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002.  As the OCO has two core statutory functions, namely, to promote the rights and welfare of children under 18 years of age, and to examine and investigate complaints made by, or on behalf of, children about the administrative actions of public bodies, schools or voluntary hospitals that have, or may have had, an adverse effect on a child.<\/p> <p>  The report was initiated because a Traveller visibility group and the local Traveller women&rsquo;s network came together and contacted the office in 2018 about conditions at a local authority-run halting site where 66 children and their families were living.  Eleven families then came forward and made complaints about the following: a persistent problem with a high rate of childhood illness caused by living conditions; a lack of safe play areas for children; the fact that housing applications were not being progressed; rodent infestation; inadequate sanitation; extreme overcrowding; safety concerns about access to a site; illegal dumping nearby; inconsistent and inadequate waste disposal; and inadequate heating systems and unsafe electrical works. <\/p> <p>  The OCO met families and visited the site on three occasions.  In total, approximately 140 people were using toilets and washing facilities that had been designed for 40 people, which the residents say has led to stress, tension and, at times, conflict.<\/p><p>During our investigation, the HSE director of public health nursing told us that the children living on this halting site suffer from skin conditions and respiratory problems at a much higher rate than the local or general population.  The chief fire officer told us that there are frequent call-outs to the site.  We met with 17 children who told us that they feel different to their peers due to the standard of conditions on the site.  One 12-year-old girl said, &quot;walking up to school you see all the rats ... they would be running up and down the walls of the trailer&rdquo;.  A 14-year-old girl said, &ldquo;people ask why I&rsquo;m dirty, but I&rsquo;d be ashamed to say.  I don&rsquo;t want to say it was from walking out of the site&rdquo;.<br\/><br\/>The conditions we found on the halting site in question were deplorable.  To think that children in Ireland in 2021 are living like this is utterly shocking.  Under no circumstances can this be accepted or allowed to continue.  Our investigation acknowledged the hard work done by the local authority and the difficult circumstances in which its staff sometimes found themselves.  Ultimately, however, we found that the local authority failed to consider the best interests of children, did not maintain the site and housing applications were not processed or were incomplete.  This meant that some families may have missed out on homes and may have remained on the list longer than they needed to.<br\/><br\/>The local authority also did not account for the disadvantage experienced by Travellers.  We made a series of recommendations and we called for these to be overseen from the top, by the CEO, to ensure that the changes happened.  Our recommendations seek to improve conditions for children living on the site in the short term, and to bring about long-lasting systemic change in how Travellers are treated by the local authority.  This was a long and difficult investigation for the families involved, the Traveller advocacy groups and the local authority in question.  The paralysis in the system cannot continue.  I very much welcome the commitments made by the local authority to implement these recommendations and, in particular, the expressed commitment by the CEO to ensure that the necessary actions occur.  I will be seeking regular updates from the local authority on the progress it has made in implementing our recommendations and how the lives of children have improved.<br\/><br\/>On 27 May, an editorial piece in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>stated that this report &quot;shines a light on a grave problem that too many arms of the State wish to ignore&quot;.  That is the big issue for our office now.  It is not the follow up of this report, but the fact that so many other sites have come to light and that nearly every local authority could be held to account in the same manner as the one in this case.  In light of that, we have taken a number of steps, including writing to An Taoiseach and all leaders of political parties, because we believe the time has come to, once and for all, eradicate the racism and discrimination in our local authority planning system that allows children to grow up in standards that were abolished for the rest of the Irish population more than 50 years ago.<br\/><br\/>On 26 May of this year, the Taoiseach stated in the D&aacute;il:<\/p><blockquote>\tMy understanding ... is there have been lots of different initiatives and plans produced over time but they have not brought a resolution.  The consequence of that failure to get a resolution to a lot of the issues is children living in absolutely unacceptable conditions in terms of health, hygiene, quality of life and so forth.  It is absolutely unacceptable and the local authority will have to move decisively now in response to the ombudsman&rsquo;s report. <\/blockquote><p>I have called on each political leader to instruct their representatives on local authorities throughout the country to vote for progress on Traveller accommodation.  No excuses should be accepted for blocking progress in the provision of Traveller accommodation or for failing to fully utilise the ring-fenced funds.  I have also asked the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to be much more proactive in the monitoring of spending in this area.  It is the only budget that is routinely not spent and the Minister must see to it that such underspends are not allowed to happen and if they do, there must be a serious oversight and audit of the workings of that local authority.<br\/><br\/>I urge all members here on this committee to back that call so that this group of citizens and rights holders can begin to benefit from proper, safe and secure housing for the first time in many generations or perhaps for the first time ever.  We are also planning to hold a seminar in July and invite all the relevant staff in local authorities.  We believe that there is a window of opportunity to change the narrative in this area away from one of blame and accusation, and redirect it to properly focusing on the accommodation services we are providing to the children of our nation.  I thank the committee again for its invitation and for members' time.  My colleague, Ms Ward, and I are happy to take questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021061500002#A00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Muldoon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":912,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Muldoon for his submission, which was very much to the point in dealing with a very serious issue.

I have studied this report very carefully and, even though I have been around a long time in politics - 35 years in total - I am very shocked by it.  I spent 22 years as a county councillor before I became a Seanad&oacute;ir.  I had a reasonable amount of involvement with the Travelling community in Kerry, and especially in my home town, with 99% of it being extremely positive.  Clearly, there are serious issues highlighted by Dr. Muldoon in this report that we, as a committee, will address seriously and bring forward.  I will not hog the meeting, but I will make a few points and I have one or two questions.  Unfortunately, this meeting clashes with the children's committee meeting, which relates to the burials, a very sensitive and important matter, and I will have to leave early to attend that.  That meeting starts at 1 p.m. in private session.<\/p> <p>  What is shocking is the health situation of the whole community in that halting site and, in particular, the health of the children.  I need not go over all the details - they are horrific.  I will target one health issues that is probably the most overlooked, which is the psychological health of those children and the sense of shame they have when they go to school.  When they go out into the wider community, they have a sense of shame about the way they are dressed and their lack of sanitation, because they do not have an opportunity to wash and so on.  I was a teacher, as was my wife, in a special school for the Travelling community for many years.  We would be familiar with that issue but not to the extent that it is highlighted in the report.  I can see that this is clearly something which must be addressed.<\/p> <p>  Another issue is the that of the tragedies which, naturally, come to mind when one reads this report.  I refer to sites where there have been serious fire incidences and terrible tragedies.  All the ingredients seem to be here, and it was just by the luck of God that no catastrophe occurred at this site in the context of the electrics.  The list of issues includes things like no working smoke detectors, badly fitted stoves, the electrical system being overloaded, etc.  It is a complete fire hazard.  They are the two issue I would focus on - the psychological health of children in particular and the fire hazard.<\/p> <p>  On a more critical note, Dr. Muldoon pointed out that this halting site was originally established to house 12 bays.  Before long, it seems there were multiples of that number at the site.  He does not go into detail as to how that situation arose.  I presume it happened incrementally.  Was it not being monitored by the council?  Were the residents, in any way, culpable of inviting or accepting, perhaps, relatives and friends on to the site?  We need to look at that a bit more because it is a critical point - that site was never intended for that number of people.  I know the circumstances that pertained to people who came in and probably felt aggrieved by the housing allocation system and the housing priorities of that council, and so on.  However, this must be highlighted.  Perhaps the council are to blame, or other agencies, for how it developed.  I want to know over what length of time this developed.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the points noted by Dr. Muldoon that council staff and outside contractors were reluctant to go onto the site, that they were, perhaps, even in fear and that garda&iacute; had to be used as moderators or mediators once or twice.  That was regrettable but I am sure there were two sides to the story.<\/p><p>Why was that situation allowed to develop?  I presume these people were coming in to do good work, to fix the electrics and do the plumbing.  Why should there have been resistance to them on-site?  Is there something we are not getting there?<\/p><p> I agree with Dr. Muldoon that it is a disgrace that certain local authorities will not even use the ring-fenced budget they get for Traveller accommodation.  Under no other heading or programme would a county council be returning money, and they would be screaming for more on every single issue.  As a committee, we discussed this in private today.  We are awaiting reports from all of the various local authorities to justify their position on that, and we will be working on it ourselves.  I engaged with the chief executive officer of Kerry County Council, Moira Morrell, and her senior housing staff in preparation for this meeting, and they presented me with a very comprehensive report, which I will not go into now but which I will be happy to lay before the Chairman and the committee.  Not to be parochial, Kerry seems to be doing more than its share, or at least an equal share, and I am proud to be able to say that.<\/p><p> I know Dr. Muldoon and Ms Ward investigated this one issue in great detail, and well done to them both.  Do they think this is typical?  Is this standard procedure?  Can we imply and take forward from this report that this type of thing is going on all over the country, in the cities of Dublin, Galway and Cork, and in our rural towns and communities as well?  Perhaps there is a much bigger scandal to be gone into.  Again, I welcome both witnesses and I congratulate them.  I regret that I have to go to an equally important meeting but I will carefully study their responses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021061500002#B00300","speaker":"1694","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":915,"content":"<p>I point out that Ms Nuala Ward is attending, not Ms Helena Collins.

I want to comment on a couple of points.  He has hit the nail on the head in that this concerns the psychological health of the children as much as the physical health.  I note from the last open meeting we had that a witness, Bridget Kelly from the National Traveller Women's Forum, said that infant Traveller children are 3.5 times more likely to die in the first year.  When we see conditions like this, we can see why.  We have been told that respiratory conditions are an issue right from the start so, again, they are being set up for long-term health issues.<\/p> <p>  When we talk about the psychological side, as a nation that is one of the top nations in Europe financially and is trying to be one of the leaders of the world in many ways, we try to teach our children to be confident, to be strong, to stand up for things and to learn about life in a safe and stepwise manner.  However, all that these children are hearing all of the time is negative, abuse, racism and put-downs.  Again, the accommodation where they start is important.  Maslow's hierarchy of needs refers to the need for shelter and for a first safe, secure place.  If people do not have that, they do not feel safe, they do not feel secure, they do not feel that is where they can retreat and be comfortable, safe and warm.  Everything else falls apart from there, and it becomes much more difficult to thrive and survive in the way that we want our children to do.  I agree that that really is a starting point.  If we can get safe, strong, affordable accommodation for this population, as is their right, then we would change enormously their projection into the future and, as was said, the impact on education and employment.<\/p> <p>  The fire risk is clear.  Unfortunately, in my first year as Ombudsman for Children, I attended one of the wakes for the children in Carrickmines.  It was horrific.  To think that could still possibly happen anywhere in the country, after all the work that has been put into it, is scary.  Hopefully, it will never happen again, but we seem to be creating conditions that could allow that to happen.<\/p> <p>  Is this typical?  One of the things we can do in our office is to carry out systemic investigations, for example, if one case leads to something that might change systems.  In this situation, we felt it was better to do a strong job on an individual authority and take the lessons from there.  The committee will have seen already the feedback to this report, and it probably struck us even more than we expected.  There are probably examples in every local authority area and there are various different elements.  Whether it is the overcrowding, the hygiene or the poor administration of housing applications, it is probably happening all over the country.  As to whether it is typical, it is certainly not an outlier, I would say, from what I can understand and the feedback I have got from different organisations.  That said, this is why we want to use this investigation as an opportunity to change, and as a starting point for local authorities.  We worked very hard with that local authority to say that we are not trying to hammer it but that we are trying to find a way to make things different and to change things.  That is why we will stay engaged over the next six to 12 months, and longer if necessary.<\/p> <p>  I will pass over to Ms Ward to talk about how the population increased from ten bays to 40, and also about the outside staff as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021061500002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Muldoon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":917,"content":"<p>This site opened up in 1989 and there was no formal means of allocating the bays to anybody.  It is very important to put the historical context on this.  Over time, families grew and nieces and nephews, children, sons and daughters moved into the site, like any other village or townland in Ireland.  What we were really concerned about is that, because the chronic overcrowding had been going on for so long, we would have expected a robust method of allocating social housing or other sites to people who live there as a very straightforward means of addressing overcrowding, but that is not what we found.  That was a very serious concern to us.  As the committee knows, overcrowding is a key contributor to all the other issues that Dr. Muldoon has identified in regard to the health and well-being of children.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the contractors, this is a critical point.  Information was given to us that, for example, there was one electrical contractor who was unable to gain access to the site.  When we looked deeply at that, looked at the minutes and cross-examined everything, we realised it was just one individual on the site who was causing the difficulties.  All the other people on the site were extremely upset that they suffered the consequences because of this one individual.  They were querying why garda&iacute; were not called and why something was not done in regard to that one individual&rsquo;s behaviour that impacted on everyone else.  When committee members read through the fine detail of the report, they will see that.<\/p> <p>  That is why Dr. Muldoon mentioned the paralysis.  We cannot just walk away from such deplorable conditions and not try to resolve them in some other way.

As can be seen from our report, that did not happen.  The legislative basis for the Traveller accommodation plan was to address the discrimination that Travellers experience in relation to meeting accommodation needs in Ireland.  The failure to meet the basic minimum legislation requirements in this regard is a key contributor for why this overcrowding was left year on, year on, and its impact on children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021061500002#C00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Nuala Ward","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":921,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Muldoon and Ms Ward.  I sat on a local authority in Galway for a very short period.  One of the most shocking things to me was the treatment of Traveller communities by local authorities.  Some of the things in this report do not come as a surprise to most people who have been active in their communities or have been councillors.  It is one of the greatest shames in some ways.  Galway City Council routinely returns funding year after year.  The local Traveller consultative committee did not sit for a number of years either.  Even if Traveller accommodation plans are put in place, to what extent are they really consultative if one fails to bring everybody together?  At private meetings we have discussed the various things that might be part of Traveller culture, such as horses.  If we are really looking at accommodating the Traveller community we must also look at accommodating the lifestyles of Travellers.  The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child is not only about provision of housing, as the witnesses rightly point out is the bedrock of Maslow's hierarchy of needs but it is also about the provision of adequate housing.  I would argue that means it has to be a home and that it has to be something that reflects the culture of that particular section of society.  In all those things local authorities across the country are failing.  Hearing the words of children is what really brings it home to adults.  There is no excuse for not going into a site and addressing issues on the basis of one or two adults who are difficult because children have rights in our Constitution quite apart from adults.  One can be quite sure that they were not the ones creating the difficulty for the Garda or the local authority to come in and sort out the problems.  On the one hand, I do not want to be too hard on local authorities but I do think it is important.  As a public representative, we have a huge challenge that unelected people are making decisions a lot of the time.  We have one of the weakest local governments in Europe and that also has to be addressed.  There are problems around councillors voting against accommodation and an awful lot of political parties are involved in doing that before anyone puts up their hand and says it is the Government, it is not.  Everyone has to take responsibility for that, particularly the largest parties who wield a lot of power in those local authorities.  I do not want to be overly political in that sense but everyone needs to step up.<\/p> <p>  First, is enough done to change the behaviour of the local authorities or is it valuable to do this kind of reporting on other sites across the country?  I know of places in Galway, for instance, where there are rats.  It is not the fault of the local population.  They have been crying out for housing.  <\/p> <p>  Second, do the witnesses believe that prioritisation of vulnerable children is happening when social housing is being allocated?  Third, transitory sites do not seem to be happening around the country.  The sites that are supposedly there for transient families moving from place to place become permanent sites without all the facilities there for the children to get to school and so on.  There is an opportunity now.  There are a couple of Ministers who deal with this area.  There is the children's Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, and also the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien, who is in the Department of Social Protection.  They have been stepping up to the plate but this is a failure over decades and it continues to be a failure because of the operations of local authorities.  <\/p> <p>   Ms Ward explained well how somewhere that has ten bays moves to 40 bays.  We cannot go shutting things down.  Where do the families move on to?  There must be somewhere for families to move on.  One cannot simply come in with the strong arm of the law and leave children with nothing if there is no provision of social housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021061500002#D00200","speaker":"1693"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":922,"content":"<p>I appreciate the Senator's remarks.  A key thing for me is this opportunity to change things from now on.  That is why we wrote to the political leaders.  The Senator is right that the local councillors are the ones who have to start stepping up but they have to be whipped, if one likes, as they would in the D&aacute;il.  There has to be a statement from the top that says that they need to vote in favour of Traveller accommodation for the next five years or whatever it might be until we get this problem sorted.  We need to start stepping up and doing our duty which is legislated for - it is a statutory obligation in many cases.  The Traveller review from 2019 suggests a pause on the section 8 element of the Act, and that maybe something we do for five years, but the key is start pushing from the top so there is no room for manoeuvre at local councillor level and they have to follow the rules which allow for Traveller accommodation.  It will not solve everything completely but it will made a huge inroad to what is a relatively small number of people on the social housing list waiting to be moved on.<\/p> <p>  Like so many things, if one unblocks one element one starts to free up all the other areas.  The transitory sites are only being filled up because there are not enough proper sites and there are not enough opportunities for social housing.  As Ms Ward touched on, what I found shocking was the administration of social housing.  We had 11 families, that is all.  It took two and a half years to get the files together around social housing for those 11 families.  The administration is very poor.  If they were sorted out, clean, clear, we know one family was there 13 years and had not been moved on to social housing.  These sorts of things would not happen in the general population.  We need to ensure the proper administration is in place so that when there is an opportunity to move on a family it is taken and used.  There are many lazy myths put out by local authorities and councillors that people have been offered X, Y and Z and are not taking it.  In reality, when we investigated the 11 families, some who had been there over 13 years waiting, only eight offers were made.  Two were taken up and the others were refused, appropriately, because they were in different areas or whatever.  Eight offers in 13 years is not exactly moving fast or providing a way to unblock the dam.  One can see how overcrowding would happen there.<\/p> <p>  I will pass over to Ms Ward to talk about the allocation to vulnerable children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021061500002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Muldoon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":923,"content":"<p>The allocation was a serious issue for us as part of this investigation.

The ombudsman's report is a milestone from the point of view of where we are at in terms of Traveller accommodation.  These reports have been coming out for years.  We have had health and safety reports on that site, going back to 2011, in which the environmental officer said it was not fit for human habitation.<\/p> <p>  We cannot let this moment go, from the point of view of where the OCO established the scenario in all its difficulties, from the local authority to councillors and to society in general.  Some ten years ago, in Cork County Council, the local authority brought a proposal to extend the bays there but the councillors did not support that.  In many ways, that came from pressure from the community not to expand the bay there.  The witnesses' information to the committee will be important in respect of how we proceed in terms of Traveller accommodation.<\/p> <p>  Should section 24 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2002, which prohibits nomadism, be repealed?  Is the ombudsman suggesting it should be repealed and if that is the case, how should it be done?  The provision of the network of transient halting sites in each local authority area is exempted under the Planning and Development Act 2000.  Is that part of the witnesses' recommendation or are they focusing on this site and other sites?<\/p> <p>  The amendment to Part 8 in the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016 has to be amended to prevent political interference with Traveller-specific developments.  That is crucial.  I listened closely when Dr. Muldoon said he had called for the leaders to instruct or put a whip on their councillors to say they had to support Traveller accommodation.<\/p> <p>  I am also interested in the OCO's meeting with local authority staff, which is hoped to be a target for July.  That will be important in moving along.  I was on Dublin City Council from 2004 and without casting aspersions on any individual, it was difficult to get the Traveller accommodation unit there to do the work one wanted it to do.  We have a site in Dublin South Central's Labre Park.  Planning for the site started off approximately five years ago and barrier upon barrier has been erected continuously to prevent that site from being developed.  Cl&uacute;id had the authority to build on the site and put plans forward.<\/p> <p>  I welcome this report and it could be a game changer from the point of view of making a start, because one is talking about a site which only accommodated ten families and now has up to 40 families.  Where were those people supposed to go, if they were not getting accommodation anywhere else?  The only option they had was to stay on the site or live on the side of the road and then there would have been ructions about that as well, from the point of view of society.<\/p> <p>  The key thing is it came from the Ombudsman for Children, in terms of the conditions in which children were living on the site.  I hope we, as a committee, can represent Dr. Muldoon's report and try to develop that as a national strategy with regard to housing.<\/p> <p>  Would the ombudsman support the setting up of a national Traveller accommodation authority to implement the recommendations of the Traveller accommodation expert group?  It will be important the Traveller community is part of that authority, to proceed with sites all over the country.  We are only talking about a small part of the population.  Surely, if we can develop, through the local authorities, good, well-run and well-looked after bays, people would accept those as part of our communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021061500002#E00500","speaker":"1569"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":925,"content":"<p>I am not an expert on the planning laws and various elements of it.  When Deputy Joan Collins asked whether section 24 of the 2002 Act should be repealed, I cannot comment.  I am afraid I would not know enough about it.  I am aware of the Part 8 provision through the 2019 review.  I listen to the people and experts who know.  A review group was put in place by a group of experts.  It was accepted by the then Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy English.  It involved the NGOs and advocacy groups and they support the concept of suspending the Part 8 provision.  I can see the benefit of that, for a period of time.<\/p> <p>  That concept of political influence is part of local authority, but we have seen the impact in terms of blocking up and stunting the growth of many generations of Travellers, not just over five or six years.  There are three generations living on the site we investigated.  Again, 11 families came to us and they all want to be moved into social housing.  If they were given the opportunity to move, one would change out one third of the total number of people nearly immediately.<\/p> <p>  There is an opportunity to be taken here.  I will not suggest exactly what could happen but there is an expert review report in place which is only two years old and has been supported by all the advocate groups and NGOs.  With regard to national Traveller accommodation authority, the Deputy called this a milestone report.  I would hope this is a milestone report but in order for it to be so, we probably need to give a year for the local authorities to start showing they might change or do things differently, the Government to back them, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to come in stronger and challenge anybody who underspends and the system to be done differently.<\/p> <p>  If that is not working after 12 months, perhaps there is an opportunity for a new authority to be considered, that is, an independent authority which creates a focus on the children of the Traveller communities.  If we get it right for the children, everything else will follow.  That is the mantra we go with all the time.<\/p> <p>  We have to look at Covid-19.  In the past 14 or 15 months, the Government has acted with great wisdom in many cases, in brushing aside much bureaucracy which was not needed.  Can we do that in this situation?  The last set of witnesses before the committee two weeks ago talked about 2,000 families living in severe, dangerous situations.  Perhaps we can find a route to solving their problems, over the next four to five years, through adjusting things such as suspending some parts of the Act, giving more power to the CEOs or whatever way it needs to be done.  I am not quite sure exactly how it will pan out.  However, if the political will is there to do that, as there has been through Covid-19, to move things forward and emphasise the importance of the individual and families, there is a great opportunity here.  I hope this will be a milestone for all local authorities.<\/p> <p>  I will let Ms Ward answer on the meeting of the local authorities and what we are hoping from that point of view.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021061500002#E00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Muldoon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":926,"content":"<p>We are very much looking forward to this meeting with the local authorities.<\/p><p>We met representatives of various NGOs a couple of weeks ago because they are obviously also critical stakeholders.

Reading the report when it first came out brought me right back to Carrickmines and brought me back to my childhood.  I am now a 31-year-old mother.  I can only speak of the experience of the halting site where I was born and reared.  That halting site opened in 1967.  At the moment, its redevelopment is not even being looked at.  I was part of a big project for the redevelopment of the site.  Many of the children spoke about playing in the mud.  I was that young child, not having a safe place to play.  It just goes from generation to generation.  Dr. Muldoon rightly said that it will be the first time in history that there will be appropriate and safe accommodation for Traveller children.<\/p> <p>  While the focus of this report is on one halting site, I would like to thank Anne Burke, Breda O'Donoghue and others in the Traveller Visibility Group Cork for their help and the work they have done with that particular halting site.  I also thank Ms Ward and Dr. Muldoon for all the hard work they put into this report.  <\/p> <p>  Reading it again was very tough but its contents were very true.  I hope that something will change as a result of this report.  Ten people from within our community lost their lives and the local authority was not held accountable, nor was the State.  We do not want that in future for our young children going to school.  I was that young child going to school in the freezing cold, not having heating in the house.  Many Travellers live in caravans and trailers.  That is people's choice of home and it is a home.  People are looking for facilities.  <\/p> <p>  Two weeks ago, I spoke about Labre Park halting site where there was an outbreak of hepatitis A.  Many children ended up in hospital over the Christmas period and throughout January.  There was a small outbreak of coronavirus on the site at the same time.  How can it be acceptable for children from the Traveller community to get hepatitis A in this day and age and nobody is held to account for that?<\/p> <p>  One side of it is accommodation and the other side is education.  Children are being failed and Travellers, who are adults now, have been failed by the system but there are no consequences for it.  Nobody is held to account.  Nobody is saying that these children's lives matter.  I have a little girl who is 20 months old.  She is now in safe appropriate accommodation.  I am trying my hardest as a mother with really bad anxiety to get her past the age of two.  Every mother in the Traveller community fears their kids being under the age of two because we know there is still a danger of not being able to survive until they are over the age of two.<\/p> <p>  I could speak all day about the inequality.  Even on a Christmas Day people living in trailers come looking for water.  None of this is acceptable.  I have lived through this.  Most importantly, young children today are still living through it, not getting the right access to education.  They have the shame of going into school while not having the appropriate uniform and being labelled for that even though it is not their fault or their parents' fault.  It is down to the accommodation they are living in and the area surrounding it.<\/p> <p>  If the witnesses were to name their top three recommendations, what would they be?  Who should be held accountable?  Would this happen if this were children in the general population?  This is why we have child protection.  I am also a youth worker.  This is why we focus on the rights of the child and child protection.  Who should be held responsible for these failures that Travellers have had to live through for decades upon decades?<\/p> <p>  I stay in Labre Park for three days a week when I am actually feeling good and when I come up.  When my nephews, nieces and other children on the site fall, they are automatically brought to Our Lady's Hospital.  Their parents are questioned by social workers.  The mothers and fathers are terrified that their kids will be taken from them due to injuries and infections that are down to the living conditions at the sites and not getting the proper supports they need from local authorities.  <\/p> <p>  If this were to happen in the general population, who would be held accountable?  What would Dr. Muldoon recommend to the committee as the way forward?  Does the Ombudsman for Children intend to do any more of these reports?  I would support that.  The Irish Traveller Movement and Pavee Point, the National Traveller Women's Forum and other local NGOs would support the Ombudsman for Children to carry out more of these reports.  I am hoping this one is serious enough that the Government will take some action.  Who would be held accountable if it happened to a child in the general population?  That is one question the committee needs answered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021061500002#F00200","speaker":"1657"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":929,"content":"<p>This question is very important for the Senator.  The experience and passion she has for it are very clear.  She knows better than I do.  I come to it as an outsider trying to learn.  She asked who is held accountable.  We have a statutory obligation to look at the public services provided to children.  Where they fail, we hold them accountable.  Who is accountable?  It is the body or individual that is statutorily obliged, in this case the local authority and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  Those are the two that are accountable.  We send our reports to them.<\/p> <p>  We engaged with the local authority and we sent our reports to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and also the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  As the latter now has responsibility for diversity and integration, we feel there is also a role for him.  The Ministers are clearly accountable.  In addition, if the Senator asks who is the boss of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, it is the Taoiseach and the Government.  That is where the accountability is and that is why I have been engaging with them as much as with the local authorities.<\/p> <p>  We feel that we get more done if we engage with organisations and try to find a way to make things work and change things from the inside, rather than to use a stick, so to speak.  That is why we have a follow-up.  We could have finished this two years ago but we would not have had the support of the local authority when we did.<\/p><p>We engaged with it and asked how we could get this right.  We got the local authority on board to support us and to accept the recommendations.  We have a follow-up at six months and 12 months.  If there is a failure or I am not satisfied after 12 months, I have the option under the legislation to write a special report to the Oireachtas and ask it to take over from there.  That has not had to happen yet and I hope it will not happen in this case, but it is an option that is always available to us.  That is where the accountability lies.<\/p><p> As regards the recommendations, they are like children - we cannot choose one over the other, as I am sure the Senator knows as a mother.  We only make recommendations that are crucial.  We make important recommendations and I would hate to think that if we identified the top three recommendations, the local authority would sit back and not bother with the rest of them.  There is a statutory obligation to provide housing, so we have asked the local authority to audit the files for the 11 families with which we were engaged and to ensure those families have not been in any way failed in terms of the way their applications were administered.  We have also asked the local authority to look at all the family applications relating to the site and to create a timeline plan for provision of accommodation up to 2024.<\/p><p> Those are the recommendations that stand out for me but I would not say one is more important than another because it is also important to have sewerage, water and a playground.  Children have a right to play and I keep reminding many public authorities that play is not an add-on luxury; it is where children escape, have fun and leave everything behind them.  It is also where they learn how to climb, jump, take turns and escape real life.  It is crucial that they have a play area.  A simple thing such as a footpath to the nearest housing estate to allow them to get to school safely and cleanly is also important.  That is why I would hate to choose one recommendation over another.  They are all crucial.<\/p><p> On the question regarding investigations, we hope there will not be any more investigations but our job is to accept any complaint that is submitted and to consider it individually.  In the context of engagement with the local authority, as Ms Ward addressed, what I would like to do and may do after the meeting is to invite the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, to join us at that meeting.  That might make for a much more rounded meeting at which we can try to engage that so that everybody is talking together and there is no miscommunication.  That may be a way of preventing further investigations.  However, if people come to us, we will look at each case individually and see what happens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021061500002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Muldoon","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":931,"content":"<p>I echo the comments of Dr. Muldoon in respect of the recommendations.

There is St. Joseph's, which is a halting site that has been there for more than 20 years.  Half the site is in use but the other half is decommissioned.  The same is happening in St. Mary's.  We lost St. Mary's and St. Christopher's and they have not been replaced in terms of accommodation.  As regards St. Margaret's, I do not know how many people I met regarding plans to expand that site in Ballymun but it still has not happened.  That has been going on for well over five years.  That is how seriously accommodation is taken by the local authorities.  On the Ratoath Road, the Gavin family is living with no water.  There are 14 men, women and children with no water in a Covid situation.  In fairness, they are being supplied with water by Fingal County Council, the local authority.  However, it is just unacceptable.  They had water but it was disconnected and they have not been linked up subsequently.  It is an absolute scandal.  That is what I have experienced in my area.<\/p> <p>  What penalties have the local authorities suffered in consequence for this?  We certainly need an overview of all of it.  There should be a group to oversee it, such as a national Traveller group, which would include our guests and many others.  That needs to be put in place because if the problem is so widespread in my area, I hate to think what it is like in other areas.  The report is so damning that one could probably identify many places where there are similar problems.<\/p> <p>  Many Traveller children in Finglas and Ballymun are in DEIS schools.  Education and getting people up to a high standard are so important.  <\/p> <p>The number of people from the local Traveller community who are coming to me seeking housing is very worrying.  Many of them are now being forced into getting HAP or going into local authority housing.  We are talking about Travellers being nomads and having their own culture, yet this is happening on a big scale.  The community is breaking down in many ways.  We should not allow that to happen.  If people want to stay in their community, we have to try to keep them in that community.  In the context of the mental health of these children and other members of the Traveller community in general, it is very important that we keep them within their own communities and we provide accommodation.<\/p> <p>  I have seen so many reports through the years and dealt with so many different issues.  It is actions that are really needed.  We need to push local authorities and change the mindset of many in local authorities, as well as local people and politicians, who are blocking progress, which is unacceptable.  I do no know what the ombudsman can do in terms of pushing this issue.  How does one push it?  Does one have to get onto a committee, as suggested, to oversee this issue?  Do we have to start identifying problems place by place or county by county?  Do we look at each place and figure out the way in which local authorities are dealing with the Traveller community in general?  Is that the best way to do it?   These issues are so widespread that I think we have a big job ahead of us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021061500002#G00500","speaker":"1470"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":935,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  He has identified several areas where he believes the same issues are arising.  I cannot argue with that.  That is why we hope this will be a trigger event rather than a one-off report.  It should be the start of something.  It is not our role to follow through at the level proposed by the Deputy in terms of getting involved with the authorities or accommodation.<\/p><p>Our job is to present this report to the Oireachtas and to make sure that the political and governmental systems takes over.  That is why we are pushing this with the political leaders.  As mentioned by Deputy Ellis, action is needed to change the mindset of the local people and the politicians.  The best way to do that is to have success, that is, to successfully move Travellers into the right systems, the right housing and the right safe, secure accommodation for the Travellers, which integrates well with wherever they need to be and provides for that nomadic lifestyle the Deputy spoke about.  Whether the local authority with which we are engaged is to create a successful template that others can only or it is the first of many in a national initiative that is fine, but as previously stated by the former rapporteur for child protection, Dr. Geoffrey Shannon, in regard to Ireland, we have some of the best legislation, policies and procedures but we suffer from implementation disorder.  As I see it, the legislation is strong and clear but the politicians are ignoring it.  They are bypassing it.  They are using the one piece, the veto under section 8, that allows the planning to be blocked.  This is providing an opportunity for people to block progress.  We need to look at that.  The mindset will be changed if we can get a successful move in the right direction for a number of areas and start using them as examples.  That will really make a difference.  <\/p><p> The Deputy mentioned the DEIS schools.  A great many schools are working hard to provide opportunities for these children.  I have met many young Traveller children, in particular the girls, who are bright as buttons and as sharp as can be.  They told me of restricted timetables and teachers telling them that nothing much is expected of them because they will leave school when they are 12.  These children have ambitions that are not being fulfilled.  They want to be doctors, lawyers, nurses and so on.  The mindset of people around them stifles them as well.  If we can make progress on accommodation, all of the other areas will start to grow as well and all of the opportunities will begin to broaden out in front of those children.  We will be pushing hard for this particular investigation to be successful and for the recommendations to be fulfilled, which we hope Members of the Oireachtas can then use to drive forward overall change for the next five years.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021061500002#G00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Muldoon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":937,"content":"<p>Given the hour, I will try to be brief.  I join in the welcome to Dr. Muldoon and Ms Ward.  I also welcome the report, No End in Site.  Our aim and aspiration is to have action now on this matter and for this parliamentary term to be remembered as the term in which the question of Traveller accommodation was properly taken on.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Muldoon mentioned that he will engage in follow-up meetings.  I understand his remarks on the importance of implementation.  I agree that the process should be consultative and that we should try to coax people towards achieving results using the carrot rather than the stick until such time as the stick is required.  Should the need for the stick arise - we pray that will not be the case - Dr. Muldoon will bring a report to the Oireachtas.  I should, perhaps, know the answer to the following question, but what is the limit of the statutory obligations or powers of the Ombudsman for Children?  If a report is presented to the Oireachtas, does this then become a discretionary matter for the Oireachtas?  Does the Oireachtas have anything more than a moral obligation to act on Dr. Muldoon's findings?  I ask Dr. Muldoon to outline the law around that as I am sure people watching online might also like to know that.  <\/p> <p>  The case has been well made by so many.  All children must have play areas.  This is fundamental to their development and growth.  They must have proper housing, healthy housing conditions and housing that is no different to that of anybody else.

I wish Dr. Muldoon and Ms Ward well in their coaxing process.  I would welcome a response on where they can go with the stick if the carrot fails.  Were the public to bring pressure on the various elected representatives that would have an implication too, but that is probably not likely in the short term and so we do need to deal with it this way.  <\/p> <p>  I welcome the report.

On the limit of our statutory obligations, we can make recommendations.  The essence of the role of an ombudsman around the world is to create moral suasion.  That is the essence of how we work.  The reason we do not go for binding recommendations is that as soon as we do that type of an investigation, people lawyer up and it becomes a different type of process and we do not get the change that we have seen.  As I said, we engaged for three years with this local authority.  The final year of the engagement was about progress being made internally without anybody having to know about it and conversations that led to these recommendations being accepted.<\/p> <p>  As I mentioned, the Ombudsman for Children was set up in 2002 and it commenced operations in 2004.  We have not yet had to do this but if we find ourselves in a situation where we need to do it, we will write to the Secretary General or the Minister of the Department - in this case the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage - advising it that we intend to bring a report to the Oireachtas.  That tends to focus the mind.  As far as I know, that has happened only once under my predecessor.  Departments then tend to follow through and help to create satisfaction on our part.  That would be my intention.  Ultimately, if we end up bringing a report to the Oireachtas there will be a moral, but not statutory, obligation on the Oireachtas to finish implementing the recommendations.  I would expect that if it gets to the stage where a Minister is being told by an ombudsman that the nation and the house of Government are not happy with the way in which recommendations are being followed through, that would be a strong argument for getting it done.

It is a privilege to have been asked by the Chairperson to chair this meeting in her stead.  It has been a very useful meeting.  The report, in its detail, is very stark and important.  Unfortunately, there are many cases of similar type throughout the country.  We do not need to do much study to know that.  Most of us know that already.  The testimony of members today points to this not being a one-off situation, unfortunately.<\/p> <p>  There is another matter of concern.  The report looks at the Traveller issue not only from the point of view of accommodation but in regard to children because children are the remit of the Ombudsman for Children.  The report is a wake-up call for us too.  We know how much early childhood experiences influence people's later life experiences in terms of health, education opportunities and so on.  The report highlights, from the prism of a child, the impact of lack of action in this area.  I can assure Dr. Muldoon that the committee will look carefully at the recommendations in the context of its report, which has a wider remit across the Traveller experience in our society.<\/p><p> I have a question regarding Part 8.  I believe it presents a barrier and we should be honest enough to admit that societal attitudes create that barrier because where accommodation for Travellers is proposed, pressure is often brought to bear on politicians.  I have argued for a long time that that issue should be dealt with and have asked whether Part 8 should perhaps be suspended.  Two suggestions have been made, one of which relates to handing the responsibility to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for the short term, whether five years or whatever, or permanently, as was done in other cases.  People would be allowed to make observations and the board would then make a decision in line with Government policy.  The other idea was to have a dedicated national accommodation authority, although one problem with that, and I would be interested in hearing our guests' views, is it could take some time before that could be set up.<\/p><p> I thought the clarification Dr. Muldoon gave was very useful.  He seems to be saying that, as is the case in all ombudsman Acts, the ultimate power he has is to report to the Oireachtas.  He is throwing the baton to us, to the Oireachtas as a whole and to this committee specifically, which has been charged by the Oireachtas to examine how Travellers should be treated as full and equal citizens in our community.  Dr. Muldoon might confirm that that is where responsibility ultimately goes, that the buck stops here in the Oireachtas and that we should call to account the Government and all its agencies to deal with this issue once and for all, and ensure that no more children will ever grow up in the conditions outlined in his report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021061500002#H00400","speaker":"1575","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":941,"content":"<p>As the Vice Chairman noted, the issue is very stark.  We did not set ourselves up as experts in Traveller accommodation and legislation.  We have learned about it through three years of investigation and through experts coming together to create that report in 2019.  One recommendation related to the suspension of Part 8.  While I can see difficulties with doing that, something radical has to happen.  We have to change the legislation in some way or other.  On the An Bord Plean&aacute;la suggestion, I could not comment on whether that is a better option.  From our point of view, it is about creating movement because the paralysis of the system is allowed through Part 8.<\/p> <p>  People are crowded.  If a site starts off with ten bays, it can end up with 20 caravans.  The key is to get people onto another site or into social housing.  If a plan is made to build social housing or to generate a new site and that is blocked, it may end up that the 20 caravans becomes 30, and there is a paralysis of the system.  Something needs to be shaken up and that means being radical and suspending or changing something.  I am not going to say clearly what the political route should be but there is an option in front of the Oireachtas with a really well thought-out report, and the decision has to be made quickly.  We need to start making it happen.<\/p> <p>  When I launched the report, I likened the issue to the tenements.  In Dublin, one can go on a tour of a tenement, which shows that living in those conditions in the early 1900s was almost better than some of the sites the committee has discussed.  We eradicated that from our general population 50 years ago and we would not allow it to happen now, yet every politician in the D&aacute;il is standing over that if they allow their local government politicians to continue to use Part 8 in that way and to allow the influence to come forward.  Those children deserve the right to live in a safe, secure and comfortable home in the way in which they want to live.  They have a right to play, health and education, and those rights need to start from proper accommodation.<\/p> <p>  As for whether I have passed the baton to the Oireachtas, I believe that is what should happen.  I hope all we need to do is talk to the committee, and members can make the difference in pushing forward with their colleagues and as a committee with its report.  I hate to think I would end up coming back with a special report, but if we did that, it would definitely be a matter of handing the matter back to the Oireachtas to take control and do something about it.<\/p> <p>  I hope it will not get to that stage.  I would love to think that in 12 months, we will have a report indicating I am satisfied with the progress made and we can see real differences for the children on that site.  I will keep my fingers crossed in that regard and we will work as hard as we can with the local authority to ensure that happens.  I hope the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the Taoiseach will, as was indicated, put forward opportunities for those local authorities to make a difference.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021061500002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Muldoon"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":942,"content":"<p>Dr. Muldoon is saying quite clearly that the time for talk is over and the time for action is here.

Next week, on 23 June, we will mark the fifth anniversary of the UK referendum to leave the European Union and, while I do not intend to rehash that decision or the events of the last five years, it is true to say that getting Brexit done was and is much easier said than done.  It is also worth noting that the implications of Brexit for Ireland and Northern Ireland were known five years ago.  Indeed, Sir John Major and Mr. Tony Blair came together in Derry and pointed out the realities of Brexit and the implications for Ireland in view of the fact that the invisible Irish Border would become the frontier between the UK and the European Union.  In fact, Brexit reintroduced the word &quot;border&quot;, which had long been forgotten, and reintroduced the implications of the word for the island of Ireland.  It is sad to say that those concerns were dismissed out of hand by Leave campaigners and they did not make a ripple in the overall campaign and debate on Brexit.  However, five years later, and it is quite extraordinary to think that it is five years, these issues are still confronting us and some, I believe, are still in denial.<br\/><br\/>On 1 January this year, Brexit formally took place and we are now actively working to implement the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement and the withdrawal agreement.  My colleague, Vice-President of the EU Commission, <font color=\"#202124\">Mr.<\/font>Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi, is responsible for monitoring their implementation and co-chairs the joint committee and the partnership council with Lord Frost, his UK counterpart.  I strongly stress to the committee that we want a good relationship with the United Kingdom as a close neighbour and a partner.  We believe that relationship must be built on trust.  Without trust we are nowhere.  The Trade and Cooperation Agreement, TCA, and the withdrawal agreement provide the framework for the EU's relationship with the United Kingdom and the TCA represents the best possible outcome, given the UK's choice of a hard Brexit.  We got as good a result as was possible within those limits - comprehensive access to the UK market with zero quotas and zero tariffs alongside a robust level playing field.  The TCA gives the tools we need to build a positive and stable relationship with the UK.  It also gives us the tools to monitor the UK's commitments and to guard against divergence.<br\/><br\/>Full implementation of the withdrawal agreement is also a prerequisite for a good relationship built on trust.  After four years of difficult negotiations, the European Union and the United Kingdom agreed the protocol together.  It remains the best and only possible solution to ensure peace and prosperity in Northern Ireland and to protect the Good Friday Agreement while protecting the integrity of the EU's Single Market.  The protocol reflects the political choices of the United Kingdom.  Indeed, the protocol was a UK choice.  Members will recall that in the beginning the UK negotiated the backstop under the then Prime Minister, Mrs. Theresa May.  Later, Mr. Boris Johnson pushed to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement and he agreed the protocol with the European Union.  The EU agreed the protocol in good faith, expecting that an international agreement negotiated collectively with the United Kingdom and signed by the European Union and the United Kingdom would be fully implemented.<br\/><br\/>The UK's choice to leave the Single Market and the customs union has consequences.  It makes trade between the UK and the European Union more difficult, with more red tape and more paperwork.  The protocol addresses some of those consequences for Northern Ireland.  Of course, there are still challenges with the implementation of the protocol, particularly when it comes to the movement of goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and especially around plant and animal health measures or sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, measures, to use the jargon.  On our side, the European Union continues to engage with the United Kingdom through the joint committee, in good faith, to find pragmatic solutions within the framework of the protocol.  We want to help citizens and businesses in Northern Ireland to adapt and to limit the impact on daily life across the island of Ireland.<br\/><br\/>The Commission has already identified flexibilities and technical solutions, including on the very sensitive SPS measures, medicines, VAT and tariff rate quotas.  On medicines, I stress that the European Union is very sensitive to public health issues, particularly in a pandemic.  I assure the committee that the European Union wants to ensure absolute continuity of the supply of medicines to Northern Ireland.  We cannot do this on our own, however.  If we are to put forward practical, workable solutions, we need the United Kingdom to demonstrate that it is committed to full implementation of the protocol.  In a way, there must be joint endeavour between both sides.  Unfortunately, from our side, there are fundamental gaps in the UK's implementation of the agreement.  The European Union has the tools to deal with these challenges, such as the infringement procedure launched in March due to the UK breaching its obligations under the protocol.  If the UK were to take further unilateral action over the coming weeks, the EU would react firmly to ensure that the UK abides by its obligations under international law.  There comes a point in a relationship when if one is not being fairly treated or treated with respect, there is a need to respond.  I stress again, however, that we will continue engaging constructively with the United Kingdom.<br\/><br\/>The people on this island are aware that the impact of Brexit is already being felt and will continue to be felt for many years to come.  Both the European Union and the United Kingdom have a responsibility to engage in close dialogue to ensure the full and effective implementation of the TCA and the withdrawal agreement but, as my colleague, <font color=\"#202124\">Mr.<\/font>Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi, said recently, trust, which should be at the heart of every relationship, needs to be restored.  To have trust, we have to know that the UK will meet the commitments it made under the arrangements.<br\/><br\/>I am happy to listen to the comments of members of the committee, which is an important committee, and to share with them some of the issues that are still to be resolved.  I believe that with goodwill and a practical approach we can resolve those issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021061500002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Mairead McGuinness"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":950,"content":"<p>I thank the Commissioner for her detailed opening remarks on Brexit.  It was interesting to hear her refer to the backstop.  It seems like a lifetime ago that we were in that space.  It is almost five years since the referendum and we have come a long way, but there is still a long way to go.<\/p> <p>  I should have mentioned at the outset that I wish to congratulate Senator Dooley, who was confirmed at the weekend as interim co-president of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, ALDE, Party following the unfortunate recent death of the party's president, Mr. Hans van Baalen.

She said the EU would react firmly if the UK were to continue down its path, if I can paraphrase it, of taking decisions unilaterally.  We saw recent reports from the excellent RT&Eacute; journalist, Mr. Tony Connelly, in which he said that the EU will take a measured approach or response to any further unilateral moves by the UK to delay implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol.  If the UK again extends the time or delays implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol, what will that measured response or firm reaction from the EU look like?<\/p><p>What can Ireland expect?  We were quite concerned at reports in the past week that there may be potential, as a last resort, to impose checks on goods coming from the Republic of Ireland to mainland Europe should the UK fail to implement the Northern Ireland protocol fully.  I would welcome the Commissioner's comments and remarks on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021061500002#B00300","speaker":"1642","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":952,"content":"<p>I thank the Cathaoirleach for both questions.  As she said, five years later we are still having this conversation because, before the ballots were cast, there was not enough conversation about the practical implications of Brexit.  There certainly was not a focus on the real implications for Northern Ireland and the island of Ireland.<\/p> <p>  To deal with the Chair's second question on rumours and concerns about where checks might potentially take place, I was very happy to hear my colleague, Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi, deny that completely.  There is no interest at the Commission or in the European Union to make the problem an Irish problem because clearly this is a Brexit problem.  It is a decision of the United Kingdom, which it took, in my view, without due consideration of the wider implications.  Since the date of that referendum we have been trying to work towards agreements with the United Kingdom to minimise the disruption and damage.<\/p> <p>  In my view, Brexit is a fragmenting event and there is no upside to it.  I know the UK takes a different view but I certainly do not see any upside.  Even if we look at how we have to restructure to engage with the United Kingdom, there are a plethora of committees now, which are perhaps more bureaucratic than if the UK was a full member, but that is in the past.  I stress to the committee that there is no discussion in the college about the sensitive point raised by the Cathaoirleach that checks could take place elsewhere, the inference being that Ireland would be disadvantaged in terms of access to the Single Market.  I can understand why these discussions are taking place and why people fear this, but I stress very clearly that it is not on the agenda and there is again, and remains, huge sensitivity to the island of Ireland and Ireland as a full member of the European Union.<\/p> <p>  On the Chair's first point regarding a measured response, it is important to reflect on what happened and why we were forced to take legal action.  Imagine being in a room with somebody negotiating a deal, a conversation is had, the meeting ends and the second party goes outside to make a unilateral declaration that it will diverge from the agreement signed up to.  This party has not told you or even passed a note to say this might happen or given the courtesy of a heads-up.  That is very damaging because, when trying to work out problems, people have to be very honest with each other and deal with that in the room in a very honest way.<\/p> <p>  As to the measured response, the legal route is there.  There are other potential avenues that are contained in the trade and co-operation agreement, TCA.  It is not helpful for me to outline what might happen \"if\"'.  It is important for me to stress that we hope that will not happen.  We hope that whatever needs to be done to resolve the complexities around the settling in of the protocol in Northern Ireland will be negotiated around the table as equal partners, respecting each other's very different views but understanding that, when it comes to Northern Ireland, we have a shared responsibility.  Again, all the efforts made from the moment of that referendum in 2016 right through to now are mindful of the unique situation of Northern Ireland.  That was how Michel Barnier dealt with the TCA discussions and how my colleague, Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi, is dealing with the issue now.  He and I talk practically every day and exchange concerns, hopes and fears.  We will do that again this afternoon in college.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021061500002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Mairead McGuinness"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":953,"content":"<p>I thank the Commissioner for a very comprehensive presentation.  I will try to be succinct with a number of points.  Given we are seeing rising tensions in the North, we may yet see an election there and we are moving towards the marching season, does it make sense to look at a negotiated extension of the grace period?  Related to that, and the Commissioner's point about building trust is very valid, what long-term mechanisms should we put in place to ensure trust is built between the various parties?  The fear is that it will be sausages this month and chicken nuggets the next.  There will always be an issue that may be used for political reasons.<\/p> <p>  My second question is on an issue that has come up regularly before this committee - it relates to flour and we heard it yesterday on whiskey and dairy - which is flexibility around rules of origin.  Does the Commissioner have views on that issue?<\/p> <p>  As the Commissioner is aware, the UK and Australia are due to sign a trade deal today, which is the first of the non-rollover trade deals.  What impact will this have on Ireland, North and South, particularly on Irish agriculture?  Does she believe it says something about the kind of trade deals the UK wants to negotiate into the future?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021061500002#C00300","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":954,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for the questions.  We have not heard details about the Australia deal.  It is very much a broad announcement, which, if it has not been made already, will say that they are going to reach a trade agreement.  Of course, the UK is free to do that.  When it comes to the detail, farmers in the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland are already very concerned, especially beef farmers, because if there is an increased quantity of beef coming from Australia, it will displace existing suppliers, including beef farmers on the island on Ireland.  That will impact price.  There are genuine concerns but let us wait until we see the detail of those trade agreements.  It does seem a long way to bring product, but that is a separate issue.<\/p> <p>  On the rules of origin, when I was still a member of the European Parliament and, indeed, in the past five years, I had much representation from the dairy sector, which I am familiar with, and the alcohol sector about this issue.  To be very clear, the rules of origin exist and are as they are.  Brexit is the problem.  Brexit has caused so much disruption, including to this all-island dairy market, which has developed over time because Northern Ireland does not have sufficient processing capacity.  My late father supplied milk that produced Bailey's, so I have a personal interest in this and a real concern about the disruption to supply chains.  This is an issue I know there is a lot representation on.  I still say the rules of origin are as they are and changing them is problematic.  What might be helpful is, if we can get over these difficulties around the broader implementation, in time we could look in a measured way at these issues.  I note that, yesterday, the head of the dairy sector in the North very much supported the protocol while also raising problems.  Frankly, we will continue to deal with problems arising from Brexit for decades because you cannot have been together for decades, as the UK and the European Union were, and unpick without problems.<\/p> <p>  We are all very sensitive to tensions in Northern Ireland.  I am originally from County Louth and live in Meath.  I have had the great pleasure of saying to my children that the past was not a good place but we have come a long way, through many efforts on every side in Northern Ireland and support from the US and the European Union.  We should very much be mindful of that, and we all are, while understanding that Brexit is the problem that has caused all of these tensions to arise again.  Perhaps, when the withdrawal agreement was signed, the UK Government did not take the opportunity of the time between that and Brexit happening to help market players adjust.  The Irish Government did.  Some of the messages for Irish supply chains were extremely difficult, but at least the message was given that they needed to adjust.  In the case of Northern Ireland, that did not happen and it needs to.  That is why we allowed for grace periods and, to the Senator's point, why, if grace periods are to be extended, the best and only way to do that is in discussion and with an agreed solution.  If something is done unilaterally, it just does not help us to move forward because it raises concerns that this may be the way the UK intends to continue.  That is why there is very much a worry at EU level that should that be the path the UK chooses, we have to examine how we deal with it, stressing again that we regard the UK and the European Union as needing to be as close as they were when they were together, even with some of the differences that emerged, because we have to deal with all sorts of issues, not just the ones we talk about today but big global issues.<\/p> <p>  I apologise if I did not answer one of the Senator's points.

As someone who comes from and lives in the North, and has been elected to the Seanad, I am acutely aware of the negative fallout from Brexit, not least in the context of the North having voted against it.<\/p><p> We heard various sectors reaffirming clear support for the Northern protocol at a meeting of this committee as recently as yesterday.  The Commissioner touched on that matter.

It is, as I say, important to reiterate that point.<\/p><p> The issue of engagement has come to the fore recently from the sectors and key stakeholders.  Representatives of the dairy and whiskey sectors were before the committee yesterday.  They feel like they are banging their heads against a wall.  I wonder how damaging the loss of the EU office and the Commission presence in the North has been.  Is there anything we can look at, whether from the perspective of trade and co-operation or a citizens' rights perspective, in order to try to make up some of the lost ground?  We know there was political controversy, the British Government refused the EU's request for an office and all of that.  I do not think that should put an end to us trying to solidify, reaffirm, improve and tweak the level of engagement where it is needed.  I am concerned that sectors are starting to feel that they do not have the same level of weight and breakthrough to the Commission and the EU institutions.  I am also concerned that the clear majority view in support of the protocol is not getting the lift that it warrants.<\/p><p> Perhaps the Commissioner will take the opportunity to explain why the protocol is supported by so many people, the reason it is in place and the reason we need it to remain in place, going forward, if she has not already done so.

There is no need to apologise.  I can assure him I have had my fair share of technical hitches so we are all in the same boat.  The Senator asked me to explain why the protocol is necessary.  I stressed in my opening remarks that, in a way, the issue of Northern Ireland was not given sufficient attention when the decision to call a referendum was taken or during the campaign.  I was still a member of the European Parliament at that time and my office was an open door in the context of representations from Northern Ireland because Northern Ireland had no voice.  There was a real sense at that time that Northern Ireland's position was not getting enough of a hearing.  I tried my very best to offer that.<\/p> <p>  At a wider level, we all know we need to engage more.  The European Parliament, for example, needs to engage with the Northern Ireland Assembly.  We need to have political conversations or chats to ease tensions.  That is hugely important.<\/p> <p>  The Senator said that stakeholders are supportive of the protocol.  It seemed to me that stakeholders who were supportive were a little concerned about expressing that publicly because of fear that it was not the story that was politically acceptable at a higher level in the United Kingdom.  The business community now sees the opportunities of being rightly a part of the UK, with free-market access, and with equally free access to the market of the European Union.  There are considerable opportunities in that regard and that is why we continue to say we need full implementation of the protocol to harness the potential opportunities that arise from this unique situation.  There have, equally, been challenges and that is why if there were a deeper level of engagement, we could sort out those challenges.  Let me be clear, if not blunt, when I say that when one signs something with a counter-party, one expects it to be implemented, not to be torn up.  We are not sure whether the UK is actually committed to implementing it in full and would need clarity from the UK side on that.  I read in opinion pieces, etc., that there is almost a suggestion the problem has been made by Europe because we forced the United Kingdom to sign the protocol.  In fact, we favoured the Theresa May option but the UK and Boris Johnson chose otherwise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021061500002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Mairead McGuinness"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":959,"content":"<p>We are at five minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021061500002#D00300","speaker":"1642"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":960,"content":"<p>I will come back again at the end.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021061500002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Mairead McGuinness"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":961,"content":"<p>I apologise for interrupting but I am conscious of the need to bring everyone in.

It is my great pleasure to congratulate the Commissioner and wish her well.  This is the first public occasion I have had to express that.  From my knowledge as one of her constituents, and as a colleague, I know she will bring huge energy and capacity to the role.  That is clear already.  I echo the Chair's congratulations to our colleague, Senator Dooley, on his European position.  It is always good if we are gaining influence in our respective parties on the Continent.<\/p><p>Brexit is, of course, inherently divisive.  It is divisive in Europe and, ironically and contrary to the intentions at the outset, it is divisive within the UK.  The big anxiety I see, as has been touched on, is about our need to ensure that Ireland does not become collateral damage in a dispute between the UK and the EU around the protocol.  Having said that, the protocol is crucial.  The Commissioner touched on this a moment ago, but the business sector and interest groups in Northern Ireland are beginning to drift away from the politicians in their positions on the protocol.  That was visible during our meeting with representatives of the dairy and whiskey industries yesterday.  They are not <i>ad idem <\/i>with political leadership in the North on their view of the protocol.  Will the Commissioner comment on how she sees the negotiations on the protocol?  We in Ireland have a vested interest in a good trading relationship with the UK.  That is clearly beyond measure and our interest is in a negotiated outcome rather than a conflict.  I am interested to hear what the Commissioner anticipates will happen in that regard.<\/p><p>The veterinary agreement is much talked about, as are the SPS arrangements.  How optimistic is the Commissioner in that regard?  Those are crucial for the livestock business and for trading east-west.  I am interested to hear the Commissioner's response.<\/p><p>I will return to the question about country of origin labelling that arose yesterday.  I do not have to tell the Commissioner because of the constituency she represented when she was a member of the European Parliament how crucial that issue is.  The food processing sector is a major one along the Border, in Meath, where the Commissioner lives, in Louth and in all of those places.  I will not go through the list of processing units but they are all over the place.  They are the only show in town, economically and socially, and are a means of keeping people in the community.  In some places, they are the only job available.  It would, therefore, be disappointing if we did not do something about the question of country of origin labelling in the context of exports.  I would be disappointed if that happened and I invite the Commissioner to come back on that matter.  I was a little disturbed to hear her say that might not be alterable and I hope it will be.<\/p><p>Those are my comments.  It is a great pleasure to talk to the Commissioner.  The country is in safe hands with her.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021061500002#D00600","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":963,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for that endorsement and for his good wishes.  While I live in the constituency of Meath East, I am actually a constituent in Cavan-Monaghan so the Senator and I have a shared territory.<\/p> <p>  I will turn to the points the Senator has made.  Brexit is divisive and I have referred to its fragmenting effect.  When the EU comprised 28 members, none of these problems arose.  Five years later, we are seeing that Brexit was not easy at all.  It is still quite a political story in the United Kingdom.  From the EU side, we have, in a sense, moved on.  We are trying to say that we need to implement what has been agreed and let us get on with our business.  We have a public health crisis, issues that will arise from the recovery, unemployment and all sorts of things with which we need to deal collectively with the United Kingdom.  I agree that the divisiveness does not help but I want to absolutely stress that while there is some bewilderment, to put it mildly, about how the UK is approaching these discussions, we are continuing to talk.  It was interesting that Lord Frost made the point that there was no breakthrough in talks but there was no breakdown.  Perhaps that is progress, in a nutshell.<\/p> <p>  The protocol is crucial because I shudder to think what the implications would be if there were nothing place.  Perhaps some who are concerned about the protocol do not realise that they need to compare the protocol to the situation that would obtain if nothing was agreed.  I think they are comparing it with life before Brexit, which is utopian and unreal.<\/p><p>Perhaps even those in the North who voted for Brexit are now beginning to understand the implications of that vote.  We will continue to negotiate in good faith and we want an agreed solution.  The rules on animal and plant health origin are very important from an Irish point of view because we know what happens when diseases cross borders.  We do say to the UK, and we have said it repeatedly as have others, that we can solve a lot of these problems even with a temporary agreement on sanitary and phytosanitary, not a forced agreement but a temporary agreement.  I am being given the five minute science so I will come back on some of the comments on rules of origin, if I may, towards the end if the Cathaoirleach will give me some time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021061500002#D00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Mairead McGuinness","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":965,"content":"<p>I remind members it is five minutes per member but in that five minutes members must give the Commissioner adequate time to reply to the questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021061500002#E00200","speaker":"1642"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":966,"content":"<p>I congratulate the Commissioner.  This is the first opportunity I have to do so publicly.  I also congratulate my colleague, Senator Dooley, on his elevation.  From the east to the west of the country we are well served in Europe.<\/p> <p>  I will be very brief as a lot of the points have already been raised by my colleagues.  With regard to the protocol, I do have a degree of sympathy for the unionist community in that it has been very badly served by Boris Johnson and his Government.  They are treated differently to any other part of the UK as a result of the protocol and we need to be sensitive to this fact.  The Commissioner, coming from the neck of the wood she does, is well aware of this.  It is important that everyone in Europe is also aware of it.<\/p> <p>  Having said all of this, I can feel the Commissioner's pain, so to speak, on the huge frustration that must exist in the EU about its dealings with the UK Government.  It is absolutely baffling to listen to Boris Johnson speak about a protocol he signed off on and, as the Commissioner outlined in her opening contribution, the UK Parliament signed and sealed the protocol.  Now, it is as if he fell asleep during the entire process and is only waking up today to the ramifications of that agreement.  This is truly frustrating.<\/p> <p>  At the end of her contribution, the Commissioner hinted the EU may have to play tough at some point in this, in whatever shape or form this may take.  I am afraid we might become collateral damage in all of this, and I have no doubt the Commissioner is well aware of this.  Europe might get fed up hanging around dealing with the UK and put the foot down, and we might be the losers in this regard because, potentially, no country will be as affected by the negativity of Brexit as us.  Is this sentiment floating around in Brussels with the rest of the Commissioner's partners in discussions?  Is she hearing this?<\/p> <p>  Other colleagues have made points on country of origin.  It is important that every country shows flexibility on this issue, and this would extend to the EU.  Country of origin was mentioned yesterday several times by representatives from the National Dairy Council and people from the whiskey community.  It is something we need to be aware of and I would like to think Europe would show a degree of flexibility on this also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021061500002#E00300","speaker":"1658"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":967,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for his comments and question.  We need to be straight about this.  There is frustration but equally there is pragmatism.  We have good agreements and we want to implement them.  We are trying to convince our UK colleagues that the best way to do this is at the table.  I believe we can come to this position.  We have had various waves where things get heated in the public space and we have to let them flow and then things settle back down again.  The Senator is right to acknowledge and have a degree of sympathy for the unionist community.  He summed up how perhaps they feel badly served.  It is also important to stress that members of the unionist community supported Brexit.  They did not support the Theresa May option.  They believed Boris Johnson would deliver for them an agreement that would meet their needs.  They find this is not now the case.  We have to understand their sensitivity, and I do.  I absolutely understand.  I hope they will understand that what we are trying to do is solve the problems we have and find really good solutions to some of these problems.<\/p> <p>  I ask that rather than inflame a problem we need to deflate it and sort it.  Perhaps there has been too much focusing on the difficult parts and ignoring the massive opportunities.  Again, I would say the UK Government when it signed the agreement left it on the shelf and did not really interpret it or communicate it and did not put in the preparations needed in Northern Ireland to avoid the very situation we are in today.  This goes back to the very famous line of getting Brexit done.  If we do things in haste we will have regret and this is what we are now seeing.  Certainly there is big regret throughout communities.  We regret in the European Union that what is happening is actually happening.  We do not need this.  We need to work together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021061500002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Mairead McGuinness"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":968,"content":"<p>I congratulate the Commissioner and wish her the very best.  This is the first opportunity I have had and how delighted we are she has found the time to meet us this morning.  I wish Senator Dooley well on his recent appointment.  I would like to get the opinion of the Commissioner on an issue and I invite her to comment on it.  This is the much used phrase about the best of both worlds for Northern Ireland.  One aspect of this is Northern Ireland's relationship with the EU.  In her previous capacity as an MEP, the Commissioner's door was always open to Northern Ireland concerns.  The special select committee played that role in hearing these representations and passing them on, as do many other vehicles in the Oireachtas.<\/p> <p>  Northern Ireland does not rely on Whitehall to fight for it in respect of this one aspect of the best of both worlds.  In the longer term, when east-west relations do not specifically cover the constituency of concern, although we are doing very well at present utilising existing infrastructural consultative mechanisms, is there not a need for more open formalised long-term two-way access for Northern Ireland in this new territory for the EU as well as Northern Ireland?  What is the view of the Commissioner on this?  They are very welcome and they come down to Dublin all the time, but could there be a more direct line?  If not, the Oireachtas really has to look at this in a more than piecemeal way and have a formalised voice for them in the Oireachtas.  We have to work on this even if it requires constitutional reform.  I would like the views of the Commissioner on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021061500002#E00500","speaker":"1667"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":969,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for his good wishes.  I really appreciate them.  The Senator has raised a really important point on how we can engage formally and informally and have effective engagement because we do not have it at present and it is key.  Perhaps the report could deal with some of these issues.  When I was a Member of the European Parliament I dealt with national parliaments through the Conference of Parliamentary Committees for Union Affairs, COSAC, and I was a big supporter of this engagement because sometimes Europe is regarded as remote.<\/p> <p>  The European Parliament and national parliaments need to find a way to engage with Northern Ireland stakeholders that perhaps is not happening at present.  Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi has tried on a number of occasions to reach out with David Frost to stakeholders in Northern Ireland and talk through the problems and solutions.  This invitation was not taken up.  I wonder why this is the case because there is no doubt whatever our differences are, and the committee knows them, the best way to sort them is to talk about them and resolve them.<\/p> <p>  The Senator has hit on a bigger point, which is that in order to get over what has been a deeply fragmenting five years, when Northern Ireland's position is more unstable than it was because of the Brexit vote, which Northern Ireland did not support but being part of the United Kingdom has got to go with it, we need to find deeper ways and long-term engagement in order that we can solve problems before they get difficult.  On a personal level, I was struck, when I was Vice President in the Parliament and my door was open to Northern Ireland stakeholders, that they felt they had no voice at a really critical time.  The committee has a role to play.  I also urge my colleagues in the European Parliament to look at what role they can play and I am sure they will do so because we all know that in politics whatever our differences are the only way to solve them is to talk.<\/p><p>We need to find a way to calm the situation in Northern Ireland.  We are coming up to a sensitive time and, therefore, what we are saying to the UK is that we should sit down and resolve these problems and work together to reduce tensions, to explain why things are the way they are and to find practical ways around particular problems for sectors and reinforce the positives.  I do not know why that is not happening but I think it should.  I would support whatever the committee does in relation to deepening that engagement, whether it is formal, informal or issue specific.<\/p><p> Before Brexit happened, if one talked to the farming community, there was no border.  There is a dairy industry that is all-island and it worked really well.  Brexit disrupted that.  That is a tragedy for in the industry, for farmers and their families and workers.  Politically, we have to find solutions and ways of engaging.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021061500002#E00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Mairead McGuinness","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":971,"content":"<p>I, too, want to be associated with the congratulations to the Commissioner and wish her well at this difficult time.<\/p> <p>  If the UK continues to refuse the alignment with the animal and plant standards, the SPS standards that we have talked about, has any consideration been given to a plan B at EU level?  The Commissioner might share her thoughts on a proposal that emanated yesterday or the day before from the Minister, Deputy Coveney, where he suggested that it might be possible to find a middle ground with some kind of independent monitoring.  What is the Commissioner's view on that or has the College of Commissioners had any thoughts there?<\/p> <p>  It is clear that the relationship between &Scaron;efovi and Lord Frost is, at best, strained.  Is there any role for Michel Barnier to resume some kind of an EU negotiating position?  There is a lot of concern that Lord Frost might trigger Article 16 on checks on the basis of societal difficulties.  While that at one time might have seemed somewhat remote, friends of mine in the North are telling me that they have never seen so many Union Jacks flying so early in the year and it clearly signals that there are societal difficulties there.

Frankly, he is trying to do his best to get agreement with the UK side.  I think he has a good relationship with Lord Frost.  Maybe the commentary afterwards does not say that but the fact that they can still sit down in a room and talk, in my view, is progress.

First, let us try talk and see can we resolve these things without going there.<\/p> <p>  I do not have the details of the proposal by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Effectively, what he is saying is that we have an SPS overarching framework that the UK was part of until 1 January.  Effectively, it is still complying but will diverge.  We are asking that in this very short period they do a temporary deal with us on this, give us that space for them to help their businesses and citizens in Northern Ireland, and take the tension out of these checks.  I would be a little concerned that all we are focusing on in the public discourse are the problems and they are, therefore, becoming bigger than reality.  They are feeding into a political narrative which is saying that it is nasty Europe that is doing this rather than nasty Brexit.  Once we have that understanding, I would repeat with the opportunity of this important committee, we are open to doing a temporary arrangement on SPS to facilitate reducing tensions and allowing business to move on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021061500002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Mairead McGuinness"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":975,"content":"<p>I thank the Commissioner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021061500002#F00500","speaker":"1655"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":976,"content":"<p>I welcome the Commissioner.<\/p> <p>  We had an interesting meeting yesterday where we had representatives from both the whiskey industry and the dairy industry.

It is a great opportunity for me to be able to share some thoughts with him this morning.<\/p> <p>  I will try and deal with the rule of origin in some depth because it was an issue across colleagues.  As the Senator will be aware, the rules of origin exist because it is a way of making sure that our trading partners understand that the products we are producing comply with specific rules.  On the dairy and whiskey sectors, I read the transcripts yesterday.  I have also met them previously and I understand the dilemma.  Let us park that to the wider issue of rules of origin.<\/p> <p>  If there were to be changes, we need to be mindful that that might have other consequences that might not suit us.  Clearly, we have a specific interest in this issue but I would say here, and to the point that Senator Joe O'Reilly raised with me where he was concerned at my remarks, that what I am trying to be is frank and clear that as of now we are not renegotiating the rules of origin but that does not mean that the Senator in his capacity should not keep raising these issues and explaining the sensitivities of them, and see can we find solutions.  What I would see as the priority at the moment is to focus on implementing the TCA and the withdrawal agreement, and then there will be these other issues that arise.  I know it is very sensitive.  The Senator named Lakeland Dairies.  I know this is a real issue because dairy cows and milk flow across that invisible border and Brexit has sundered that to some extent.  Brexit has caused the problems now for us to look at rules of origin.  What I am saying is, and I know Senator Joe O'Reilly was disappointed by my answer, sometimes it is better to be clear and truthful than to be fudging and say we can change these overnight.  It is more complex than that.  The committee has a capacity and a duty to make sure these issues are fully debated and understood.  They may be dealt with in time but the priority now is focusing on implementation.<\/p> <p>  In relation to dialogue, this is a huge point.  I did not get to see the programme last night but I will watch it.  Dialogue is about talking and listening.  In politics, we know that sometimes the listening bit is more important and the silences are better sometimes than the words.  The EU is based on dialogue.  A day has not gone by here or when I was in the parliament that there was not a disagreement about something but we did not walk away and slam the door.  We worked around words, there was give and take, and we sorted things out.<\/p><p>If anything, what Brexit shows me is the dangers posed by a fragmentation of the European Union.  I am talking about the one nation of Great Britain and Northern Ireland wanting to be great, sovereign, free and independent but almost suggesting that the formal and informal contacts that the EU has given us are not as good as being able to stand up on one's own two feet.  I take a very different view but that is maybe because I come from a smaller member state.  Whatever the difficulties that we have had over time with the European Union we have a voice and we can use it for good or ill.<\/p><p> The biggest regrets that I have with Brexit are as follows.  First, the last five years have turned us a little grey if I were to show my true colours.  Second, Brexit has pulled apart the capacity for informal and formal engagement with the United Kingdom but it has made us set up an enormous architecture of a partnership council that is comprised of over 16 specialist committees.  We have replaced one set of bureaucracy, which the UK would refer to, with a completely new set of bureaucracy but dialogue is important and so is listening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021061500002#F00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Mairead McGuinness","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":979,"content":"<p>We have reached the 10.30 a.m. mark and all members have spoken.

She is right that we must focus on implementation and ensuring that people live up to, and abide by, what they signed up to.  Obviously a particular concern for us here is to consider the tensions within Northern Ireland and try our best to ease them and allow people to cool off.  From what we have heard at this committee, there is considerable support for the protocol from business, industry and many citizens in Northern Ireland.  I suggest that the vast majority of people in Northern Ireland support the protocol and understand its importance.<\/p> <p>  As Senator Gallagher has said, it is important that we acknowledge that there is a significant community who have an issue with the protocol.  I am not sure that the veterinary agreement or tinkering around the edges and making adjustments to the protocol will ever satisfy certain groups in Northern Ireland.  I think that is something we will have to work on for the next number of years, particularly as we approach the vote.  Four years post implementation there is a vote on the protocol in Northern Ireland so we must be very mindful of that because the lines have been drawn.<\/p> <p>  The Commissioner can make some closing remarks and I thank her again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021061500002#G00150","speaker":"1642"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":980,"content":"<p>I thank the Cathaoirleach and all of her colleagues.

Clearly, it would be better if there were an office because if one is physically present one can engage and get a sense of what is happening.  We must deal with the reality that the United Kingdom has taken a particular decision and wants to act in a particular way but with that said we must find other ways.  So we have our London and Dublin offices.  We have a Seanad and a Parliament in Ireland that wants deep engagement and I think that the European Parliament should be part of your thoughts for the future.  I say that because, and I was reminded of it recently, John Hume did his best work in the European Parliament.  Northern Ireland was his absolute and full focus but he needed the space of the European Union to find a way to talk peace and build peace.  The sensitivities around that in the European Parliament run deep.  There are many colleagues still in Parliament who remember that time and we should use that to get the European Parliament to be a wider voice, through different structures, in order that people in Northern Ireland have a sense that they will be listened to.
