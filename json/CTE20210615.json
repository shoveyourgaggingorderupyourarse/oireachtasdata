I remind the committee that, apart from me and members of the committee secretariat, all members and witnesses are required to participate remotely and all members are required to participate from within the precincts of the Leinster House complex only.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Stanton and Senators Gavan and Ahearn.<\/p> <p>  Today we will give consideration to the general scheme of the companies (small company administrative rescue process) Bill 2021.  Recently, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Robert Troy, wrote to the Business Committee seeking an exemption from the normal pre-legislative scrutiny requirements in light of the urgency of getting this Bill enacted.  This is the third time the Department has requested an exemption from normal pre-legislative scrutiny requirements from us, and these are not requests to which I agree or ask the committee to agree lightly.  Pre-legislative scrutiny is an essential part of our role as legislators.  Since the beginning of the year our committee has been very busy and has agreed to pre-legislative scrutiny on the corporate enforcement authority Bill and the sale of tickets Bill, since enacted, and we are to complete pre-legislative scrutiny of the competition Bill.<\/p> <p>  The general scheme we will be discussing today provides for a rescue mechanism for small and microbusinesses facing financial and trading difficulties exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic, with the aim of preventing the closure of otherwise viable companies and providing them with the necessary breathing room to continue in operation and trade their way out of present difficulties.  The Minister of State's request to the Business Committee for a waiver of pre-legislative consideration has been passed on to this committee for our observations.  Following today's meeting we are required to communicate these decisions to the Business Committee for it to decide on the application for a waiver.  As the committee will know, we had been scheduled to commence today's meeting at 9.30 a.m. with the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Troy.  Subsequently, however, the Minister of State was unable to attend.  A letter to this effect has been circulated to members explaining his reasons.  In his place, we are delighted to welcome the Minister of State, Deputy English, who indicated that he would be available from 9.45 a.m., hence the later start time for today's meeting.  I am pleased to welcome the Minister of State to brief the committee on the general scheme and on the case for a waiver of pre-legislative scrutiny.<\/p> <p>  Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses regarding references witnesses make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, today's witnesses, as I said, will give their evidence remotely from a place outside of the parliamentary precincts and, as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.<\/p><p> The opening statement of the Minister of State, Deputy English, has been circulated to members, as has a letter to the Business Committee from the Minister of State, Deputy Robert Troy.  To commence our consideration of this matter, I now invite the Minister of State, Deputy Damien English, to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021061500002#A00200","speaker":"1509","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":7,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair for the introduction and for facilitating the time change to allow me to participate in the place of the Minister of State, Deputy Troy.  I thank the committee for the invitation to discuss the forthcoming Bill to amend the Companies Act 2014 and to provide for a small company administrative rescue process.  I am joined online by two officials from my Department, Ms Fiona O&rsquo;Dea and Ms Tara Keane.  They are happy to take any questions if I am unable to answer them.  After today's discussion, we will be happy to engage with the committee over the coming weeks.  We hope to finalise work on the Bill and bring it to Cabinet on 22 June or the following week.  We will then bring the legislation through the Houses and discuss it with the select committee.<\/p><p>The companies (small company administrative rescue process and miscellaneous provisions) Bill is included as a legislative priority on the Government&rsquo;s legislation programme for the summer session.  It delivers on a programme for Government commitment to review the Companies Act to simplify and improve examinership laws in response to the Covid-19 crisis and follows on foot of proposals by the Company Law Review Group, CLRG, in response to the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s request that it examine the issue of corporate rescue specifically for small companies and advise as to how such a process might be put in place.  I know this is an issue the committee has discussed several times and members have sought to find a simplified and less costly process to address the matter.  <\/p><p>On 8 July 2020, the T&aacute;naiste requested that the CLRG examine the issue of rescue for the sector.  Membership of the CLRG, which is a statutory body, is wide and representative of a broad range of stakeholder experts, making it uniquely well-positioned to advise on company law.  It has served us well in this space before.  The CLRG submitted its report in October 2020 and recommended a rescue process for small companies, which would be stand-alone and separate from the examinership process, but which would mirror key elements of the examinership legislation.  Since receipt of that report, the Department has worked closely with the Office of the Attorney General in developing the CLRG&rsquo;s advice from both an operational and policy perspective.  Throughout this process, we have also had strong engagement with the Revenue Commissioners, the Departments of Social Protection and Justice and other relevant stakeholders.  In addition, my Department launched a public consultation earlier this year to inform development of the general scheme.  The Minister of State, Deputy Troy, notified this committee of the consultation and invited it to make submissions.  An overview of all submissions made, the responses to them and the reasoning underpinning those responses is available in a report on the Department&rsquo;s website. <\/p><p>In overall terms, the Department has engaged in a process which has been transparent and accessible and has involved substantial submissions from representative bodies for employers and employees across all sectors and industry professionals in the field of company law and insolvency.  As a consequence, I am pleased to note that the general scheme of the Bill has met with a generally positive response from industry and professionals in the field.  I ask the joint committee, in considering our request for a waiver of pre-legislative scrutiny, to bear in mind the role of the CLRG in developing the Bill and the level of engagement with stakeholders in the public consultation.<\/p><p>As members will know, the primary purpose of the Bill is to provide for a small company administrative rescue process, one that can assist viable<i><\/i>small and micro-size companies to remain in business, as the economy recovers and supports are phased out, and to try to protect as many jobs as possible.  <\/p><p>We know from years of experience that examinership works.  It saves both companies and employment.  It is internationally recognised and is a successful tool for restructuring, in its own right.  However, examinership is overseen by the court from beginning to end.  For this reason, it can be an expensive undertaking and, thus, potentially out of reach for the average small company, whether that be a local restaurant, hairdresser or other similar businesses.  The small company administrative rescue process is designed to reduce those costs insofar as possible and provide access to an affordable and much-needed avenue of rescue and recovery for small companies in difficulty.  It has limited court involvement where creditors are engaged in the process and positively disposed to a rescue plan.  However, the option for court involvement remains, if there is no agreement by the creditors.  This is an important part of the process.  <\/p><p>The Bill replicates key provisions of the examinership model in an administrative context.  While it provides for certain novel concepts, it does so by building on a tried and tested framework, with the benefit of years of experience and jurisprudence.  The proposals are founded on an existing bedrock of well-understood and well-respected law and they deliver an accessible, fair and balanced process for the broad range of stakeholders impacted by corporate rescue. <\/p><p>The introduction of this legislation, or any new legislation, is not without risk.  For this reason, officials in my Department have engaged extensively with the Office of the Attorney General to ensure the process is constitutionally robust and meets the required standards of procedural fairness.  Therefore, the process incorporates robust safeguards, including court oversight, where appropriate.  It strikes a fair balance between the needs of the company and its creditors.<\/p><p>The main provisions of the Bill can be broadly summarised as follows.  The Bill is designed to help small and micro companies, as defined by the Companies Act 2014, which constitute approximately 98% of companies in Ireland.  The rescue process is commenced by resolution of directors, rather than by application to the court.  It is concluded within a shorter period than examinership.  It is overseen and implemented by a qualified insolvency practitioner, to whom we refer in the context of the Bill as &ldquo;process advisor&rdquo;.  The rescue plan can be passed by a majority of creditors.  The Bill provides for the format of cross-class cram-down of debts, designed to reduce costs.  The process does not require an application to court in circumstances where no creditor objects to the plan.  Where creditors do object to the rescue plan, the courts will then have a role in adjudicating the matter, as is currently the case in examinership.  The Bill also incorporates safeguards against, and penalties for, irresponsible or dishonest director behaviour. <\/p><p>On foot of recommendations made by the CLRG in its first phase of work in the area of employees' rights as creditors during a liquidation and taking into consideration the Irish Congress of Trade Unions&rsquo;s, ICTU, minority report to the CLRG report, the Bill also enables the Companies Act 2014 to provide for a number of actions that can be addressed in the short term to improve the quality and circulation of information to employees as creditors.  In that regard, I am also happy to engage with the committee on the overall plan of action that we discussed previously, as it is not fully dealt with in this legislation.  I will also be happy to engage with the committee on its report on this area.<\/p><p>These amendments feature in the plan of action the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, and I published last week.  It contains a range of commitments, including amendments to employment law and company law, to enhance protections and ensure transparency for employees in insolvencies. <\/p><p>As we emerge from a sustained period of lockdown, and as Government supports for businesses are gradually phased out, this is a Bill of the utmost importance and urgency.  We are all aware of the enormous pressure business owners currently face in terms of not only their immediate liquidity, but also the sustainability of their businesses into the future.  This is particularly true of small and micro companies, which employ almost 800,000 workers.  Some 78% of small and micro companies operate in sectors that have been particularly challenged by the pandemic, such as retail, hospitality and the service industry.  The contributions these companies make to our economy cannot be understated.  They will be key to our country&rsquo;s economic recovery, which we want to be jobs led.  It is for this reason that the Government is so committed to providing a genuine, alternative rescue framework for these companies.<\/p><p>This Bill is an integral part of Government&rsquo;s response to the economic impact of the pandemic.  It provides for a rescue framework for small and micro companies, many of which have been significantly challenged by Covid-19.  Our response to the crisis has proven successful in mitigating the immediate impact of the pandemic on these companies, so far.  However, as the economy reopens, we must have an appropriate regulatory response, not simply planned but actually in place and available to small businesses.  It should support fundamentally viable companies to continue to trade and get themselves back on their feet, and to preserve employment.  It is our responsibility to ensure that this essential rescue process is implemented in time to make a difference to these companies.  To that end, I ask the joint committee to approve a waiver of pre-legislative scrutiny, so that we may achieve enactment of this important legislation before the summer recess. <\/p><p>As I said, my officials and I are happy to answer members' questions and provide greater detail on the provisions of the Bill.  We are also available after the meeting to go through any finer points if members want or need more time on this.  We would like to have the support of the committee on the journey of this necessary legislation.  As I said, we hope to bring it through Cabinet next week or the week after in order that we can begin the formal process in the Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021061500002#B00200","speaker":"1505"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

I am not the only person in that position.  At some point we have all referenced the need for examinership \"lite\", or some version of that, so this is good.

I may take the opportunity to follow up if that is in order as well.<\/p><p> Regarding speeding up the process, what is the estimated time saving involved?  How much quicker is it anticipated that it will be in comparison to the current process?  This leads to another question and if it is all right, I will take the two of them together.  It is about the cost of it.  Does the Minister of State have an estimated cost of the process at this point in the proceedings?<\/p><p> Head 52 relates to the costs and remuneration of process advisers.  It indicates that they will use the resources of the company, but they might not exist.  We are talking about small businesses, so we are not talking about places that would be massively overstaffed with administration and backroom staff.  In the event that it is not there or that it is not forthcoming for whatever reason, could that lead to a situation whereby costs will escalate in a way that would not be desirable?  Perhaps the Minister of State will respond to those questions first.  I have a couple of other questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021061500002#B00400","speaker":"1467","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy O'Reilly for her support in principle for the legislation.  I totally accept the concerns about not having pre-legislative scrutiny.  I accept that is a process she would not like to see continue.  I know we will avoid it as much as we possibly can.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the other legislation, I hope to have something for the Deputy in the coming week or two.  As per my commitment, as soon as I have it, I will share it with everybody, and we will tease it out.  I know there has been some engagement with our officials on that piece as well and it can continue because we want to have everybody on board with it is as much as we possibly can.<\/p> <p>  The rough timeline we expect is that once a process adviser is appointed, he or she has up to 49 days to produce a rescue plan.  That is the target.  In terms of how long the process will take thereafter, it depends on the rescue plan and what is put in place in that regard.  My understanding is that there is no official end time on the process, but the aim is to save companies that are viable and can be protected and to put in place a plan, by agreement, within 49 days.<\/p> <p>  It is hard to clarify the exact costs that will be involved.  At the moment we think the costs of examinership are an issue and a barrier to the process.  They are in the region of &euro;80,000 to &euro;120,000 for the normal examinership process.  What we expect for this process is somewhere between &euro;20,000 and &euro;50,000.  Naturally, if there is full agreement and everyone is on board, there is a quick resolution and a plan is put in place quickly, it could be a lot less.  That is roughly what we expect if creditors are in agreement and there is no need to involve the courts in the process.  That is based on experience and getting feedback, but I cannot give any guarantees on that.  What we hope to do is to put in place a cheaper model if everybody plays his or her part to reduce the costs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021061500002#C00200","speaker":"1505"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>That would involve both the co-operation and the staff being available at that point.

Is there any legal mechanism to make sure that wages or moneys owed to the workers &ndash; it is not just about the business owners; it must also be about the people working there &ndash; are protected as part of the rescue process?

I warmly welcome this and believe it is timely and much-needed.  I have no doubt there are many companies which are carrying burdens and that need restructuring but, underlying that, they are viable companies.<\/p> <p>  It goes back to the cost of access.  The reason we have only about one fifth of the access to examinership that there is in the UK is the very high cost in Ireland associated with going to court.  I know the role of the court has been reduced but, on the choice of a requirement for qualification as a liquidator, I would be interested to know why that was required and whether it creates a very high entry barrier for small companies looking to use this procedure.<\/p> <p>  We get the impression that liquidators are a small group of people and they can almost name their price and, as I understand it, their bill is the first that has to be paid from any resolution.  On that element, I would be interested to know why there cannot be a little bit more relaxation in regard to the type of person.  Undoubtedly, they need to be capable of assessing and ensuring that no creditor is unfairly prejudiced, and all the rest of it.<\/p> <p>  Second, I want to understand the threshold for moving ahead with the proposal.  Is it that it includes over half of the creditors by value?  I know that, obviously, one has to have the power, and I think the term used is to \"cram down\", although in a fair way, but we cannot let one hold up the overall.  How is the threshold decided as to when there are enough creditors on board for the process to proceed, albeit that an objection can still be raised?<\/p><p>The speed issue, which Deputy O'Reilly raised, will continue to be a concern.  If this runs on for a long time, it will be more difficult and onerous.  Will the Minister of State indicate where he thinks the quicker process has been achieved?<\/p><p> Many companies, having come through this process, will be short of capital.  There is a risk that viable businesses will become zombie companies in that they cannot get access to new capital.  One of the problems with examinership has traditionally been the lack of finance providers willing to take on companies that have been established as financially viable following restructuring.  How does the Government intend to approach that?  Certain categories of investor get support from the Exchequer in one form or another.  For companies coming through this process, will there be a need to establish access to capital?  Some of the vehicles the Government has put in place may be suited, but in some cases there may be a need for new equity.  Will that be part of this process?  Could the process involve a requirement to have new equity come in and to identify its sources?

It is generally their legacy debts that are the difficulty.  The process of putting the rescue plan in place should deal with ongoing financial costs and highlight where they are part of the plan or access to finance is key to making the plan.  Often, companies in this position have a bright future from a trading point of view if they have time to deal with legacy debts.

We would be willing to review the credit guarantee and proposals brought through the system with the approval of the House of the Oireachtas.  They are working extremely well and de-risk financial providers of those loans, be they credit unions, mainstream banks or others.  They are encouraged to back sustainable businesses because the State and the EU take on some of the risk.<\/p> <p>  The credit guarantees in place for this and next year, which we have extended, should be sufficient but we can track that and monitor any judgments.  The Credit Review Office will deal with refusals of credit.  We can track that as well.  They are measures in place now that were not in place after the last financial crisis and which would have been of great benefit back then.  Structures are in place but we will have an ongoing review of that and track that.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy referred to equity as opposed to borrowing finance.  The SME task force highlighted this as an issue we need to look at to encourage equity stakes in SME communities and microbusinesses.  The budget will look at that but there are no proposed changes linked to this legislation.  The point is well made and I will track that.<\/p> <p>  In this case, the threshold for proceeding with a proposal is a majority of creditors by value.  That is different to an examinership, which is a majority by value and number.  That should result in greater acceptance of the plans. <\/p> <p>  On the necessity to qualify as a liquidator, it is important that the person who will become process adviser has the qualifications to do the job.  The Deputy made the point that it should not be cost prohibitive.  A number of people are qualified to do it and it is linked in the legislation.  Ms Keane may wish to speak on the specific qualifications but my understanding is that the bar is not especially high but not everybody concentrates on this business.  Once this process is in place, we may see a number of companies use it that have not been able to use examinership processes in the past.  More people might make themselves available as process advisers.<\/p> <p>  The question the Deputy will probably ask next is what are the likely numbers.  We do not know.  The Deputy and many others have made the case strongly that this legislation needs to be put in place and we share that view.  We have no idea what the numbers will be like because Government supports, with the backing of the full Houses of the Oireachtas, have kept those businesses alive to this stage.  Only in the recovery stage will we find out what businesses are in a position to continue.

One has to be qualified as a liquidator, which means it is open to members of an accountancy body, qualified solicitors, members of one of the other professional bodies regulated by the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority, IASSA, suitably qualified people from other member states and people with significant experience of insolvency proceedings under a grandfathering provision.  There is a good pool of people from which to choose.  However, I take the Deputy's point that there will be a cost involved.  We felt it was important for the overall robustness of the process that a specialist person be in place to advise the company.  Notwithstanding that this applies to micro and small companies, they may have tricky affairs which need to be considered.  It speaks to the overall robustness and protection of creditors if we ensure someone suitably qualified does that, particularly in circumstances where we have removed court supervision.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the point about overall time saving.  Currently, examinerships can run for up to 150 days, on the basis of temporary amendments being made under the Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Covid-19) Act.  However, they typically last 100 days.  This process is expected to conclude in 70 days, which is subject to getting a rescue plan by day 49 and having a  21-day cooling-off period.

There are two issues.  Leasing, I believe, is dealt with under head 48 in relation to contracts.  There is a process to have a conversation with the landlord.  There are two issues.  Separate from this legislation, we have had an ongoing conversation with the business community on potential legacy debts from rent and arrears.  Since the start of the pandemic, the Government, through the Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, and many others have requested that all landlords and others involved in leasing, be they institutional landlords or private landlords, engage with their tenants to try to find a way through this.  We have put in place a voluntary code of conduct to try to enable this process.  It has been of assistance in many cases.  My Department is doing work on this in conjunction with the Department of Finance to determine whether we need to assist more.  An arbitration model that has worked well in other countries is being suggested by some but, in the majority of leasing contracts here, an arbitration process is already identified.  Therefore, we are not convinced about what the State could add to the process.<\/p> <p>  Under the process in the proposed legislation, there is an opportunity for the process adviser to work with all creditors, engage and put in place a rescue plan, which would involve dealing with rents, leases and ongoing costs.  There is an opportunity to repudiate contracts and to try to deal with this issue.  What the Deputy is talking about is a rescue plan in this regard.  As he knows, various supports have been provided by the State on behalf of the taxpayer to the businesses in question.  We did not stipulate which costs or bills businesses would pay.  That is a decision every business has to make for itself.  In most cases of which we are aware, people have sat down with all their providers of services, including in respect of properties, and worked out a payment plan.  That is what we would encourage in this regard.  Those conversations have gone on.  Admittedly, there are still some cases that are not dealt with.  Naturally, we do not want legacy debts to drag a business down.  We will continue to engage and work on this. <\/p> <p>  The supports announced under the economic recovery plan will assist businesses with their ongoing costs, certainly their wage costs.  The Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, is continuing.  The new business resumption support scheme, BRSS, payment, to be introduced in September, will assist companies that have still not reached a turnover allowing them to pay their bills.  The small business assistance scheme for Covid, SBASC, is in operation and there are various other arrangements.  I accept they are not all sufficient to replace lost turnover and profits but they are certainly of assistance in paying some of the bills.<\/p> <p>  With regard to Revenue, warehousing was mentioned specifically.  As the Deputy knows, the option to warehouse debts in this regard was extended beyond August of this year until the end of this year.  For all of 2022, there will be no interest charged on the warehouse debt but the charge will kick in thereafter, in 2023.  Therefore, one has a full 12 months, after which Revenue will engage on plans for repayment over a suitable period.  Revenue has been asked to engage in a pro-business manner.  It is engaging in this way and has responded quite well over the past year.<\/p> <p>  With regard to this legislation, both the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Protection are excludable in respect of the start of this process.  In most cases, the Revenue Commissioners have engaged in the examinership process and have been supportive of plans but in some cases, based on historical dealings with a company or some of its directors, they may opt not to do so to protect the State.  That is their job.  In general, however, the Revenue Commissioners have been quite supportive of the process.  Our indications are that they and the Department of Social Protection will continue to be supportive under the legislation under discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021061500002#F00200","speaker":"1505"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":49,"content":"<p>The Revenue Commissioners, by default, are included in the rescue plan but they have the option to remove themselves based on confined statutory grounds.

That does not happen here; they do not have that opportunity so we have included the measure as a safeguard to protect moneys owed to the Irish people.  We have drawn the section from the Personal Insolvency Act 2012, which also provides for the Revenue Commissioners to be excludable.  The difference, however, is that we have said they can have the option to exclude themselves only on statutory grounds, as opposed to having a carte blanche to exclude themselves.

I am sure they will all be lovely people but is there anything to prevent them from saying they need two accountants, that they happen to have two such accountants in their firm and that the company with which they are dealing does not have qualified accountants?  All of that is going to add to the cost.  I am conscious of what Deputy Shanahan was saying in that we are talking about small companies.  I understand completely the purpose of the measure but we need to guard against the possibility that the process advisers might insist on bringing in staff, which would add to a bill.<\/p><p>In a large examinership, this is not so onerous but when we are talking about amounts of &euro;10,000 and &euro;15,000 for additional requirements for staff for potentially up to 49 days, that would be burdensome.  If I missed it, I will put my hand up but is there anything to prevent this from happening?  I do not know if this might be by way of a code of practice.  I stress that I do not know these process advisers.  I am sure they are all lovely, fine upstanding people but we could have a situation whereby someone will insist that he or she needs a team of accountants and has them back in his or her own company because at the end of the day, the process advisers work for their company.  If it is not there, consideration should be given to ensuring that this cannot happen unnecessarily.  I understand it is tricky because we must balance that with the fact that the process advisers probably will need some additional help.  However, if they are looking at the person who does a bit of part-time book keeping for the company and saying this person is not good enough and he or she needs a qualified accountant or two or five qualified accountants, we could end up with extra costs when this is trying to avoid that.  The Minister of State's thoughts on that would be very welcome.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021061500002#F01200","speaker":"1467","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":60,"content":"<p>Does Ms Keane want to answer that question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021061500002#G00200","speaker":"1505"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":61,"content":"<p>First, it is up to the company at the beginning to decide whether to appoint the particular process adviser.

They are all from the National Anti-Bullying Research and Resource Centre at DCU.  The witnesses are attending to brief the committee on school bullying and its impact on mental health.  Before I begin, I thank the centre for its invaluable assistance to the committee.  Our seminal meeting with the centre on 5 November had a profound impact, as evidenced by the extensive media coverage seen in recent months.  Our examination followed on from that meeting.  I am speaking on behalf of the committee when I say that it has proved a worthwhile and important piece of work.<\/p> <p>  The format of the meeting is that I will invite Professor O'Higgins Norman to make an opening statement, which will be followed by questions from members of the committee.

We are happy to be able to help the committee in its work on school bullying and mental health.  DCU's anti-bullying centre is located in the DCU Institute of Education and staff at the centre have been doing research and education on bullying for 25 years.  In addition to our research activity, the centre delivers a number of educational resources, including the FUSE programme, which is a nationwide anti-bullying and online safety programme for primary and post-primary schools.<\/p> <p>  As outlined in our various submissions, previous research has consistently shown that being involved in bullying as a target, bully or bystander at school can be associated with a number of mental health problems, including psychosomatic complaints, anxiety, depression and suicidal ideation.  Issues of identity seem to remain at the heart of bullying behaviour.  One report from UNESCO involving 144 countries found that physical appearance was the top reason for being bullied.  Closer to home and in terms of identity, a recent study at our centre found that teachers of religious education had specific concerns about students who were practising Catholics being targeted for bullying more than those who did not practise a religion.<\/p> <p>  It is well established in research that negative childhood experiences have a negative effect on the development of a child, particularly when the bullying is related to identity.  Our research shows that school principals understand and recognise this.  The next step then should not be to go over old ground any longer, but to think critically about how we can prevent bullying.  Our research shows that this is the piece that principals are less sure about.<\/p> <p>  There have been some significant developments at policy level in terms of school bullying, most significant of which was the introduction of the Action Plan on Bullying and the related procedures for primary and post-primary schools as well as Circular 0045\/2013, all of which comprised a landmark in educational policy relating to bullying prevention and intervention in schools.  We suggest that the Action Plan on Bullying be audited to ensure that it continues to be informed by up-to-date research and evidence, is connected to subsequent policies on child protection, well-being and relationships and sexuality education, RSE, and is benchmarked against the recommendations that were recently published by UNESCO's scientific committee on tackling bullying and cyberbullying in schools.  Such a brief audit of the action plan and procedures to ensure that they comply with UNESCO's recommendations will not be overly burdensome, nor will it allow us to be distracted from the continuing task of implementing the action plan and procedures in schools today.  Separately, there is a need to provide further support to assist schools in implementing the requirements of the action plan and procedures while also ensuring that, possibly through the Department's inspectorate, schools continue to prioritise bullying prevention and intervention as part of a whole-of-education approach.<\/p> <p>  Regarding bullying policy, we warn against the dangers of conceptual pluralism where issues like bullying prevention and intervention are conflated with concepts such as well-being and positive school culture, as this may result in a dilution of the focus and efforts required to tackle bullying and cyberbullying fully among children and adolescents in our schools.<\/p><p>Parents and schools are rightly concerned about issues related to cyberbullying and online safety.  Moderation of cyberbullying content and behaviours on social media and online gaming platforms is improving and increasingly relies on proactive artificial intelligence, AI, with the aim of identifying bullying before it is reported by a user.  Published information on bullying content that is detected proactively would be more meaningful if we had more information, such as the overall incidence of bullying involving minors on a given platform and what supports were provided.  To that end, it will be increasingly important to ensure interdepartmental collaboration between the Departments responsible for the action plan and procedures, the online safety and media regulation Bill, as well as the implementation of Coco&rsquo;s law.  Furthermore, in addition to their role in preventing bullying behaviour within schools, school staff need to understand they also have a role under the action plan and procedures regarding bullying that occurs outside of school, including online.  Consequently, mechanisms to support closer collaboration between communities, school communities, social media-gaming platforms and statutory agencies will be required.  This has already started informally, for example, between Dublin City University, Facebook and the Department of Education regarding the roll-out of our FUSE anti-bullying and online safety programme.  The results of our current fieldwork suggest this could also include greater collaboration directly between schools and online platforms in reporting abusive content. <br\/><br\/>Over the past three years, we have translated our research on school bullying and cyberbullying into a programme of resources for schools.  This programme, called FUSE, was made possible with financial support from Facebook, Rethink Ireland and the Department of Education.  At the heart of the FUSE programme is the aim of building capacity in schools to tackle bullying and online safety and to empower children and adolescents to understand their own behaviour, be able to recognise bullying and online safety risks and to be confident in how to report and seek support when they need it.  So far, more than 12,000 students have been registered on the programme across 127 schools in every county.  Evaluations show the majority of those who complete the programme have increased their self-efficacy in noticing, responding and reporting bullying and online safety issues. <br\/><br\/><b><\/b>On the question of what to do next, based on national and international research, we recommend there be an audit of the action plan on bullying and the procedures to ensure they continue to be informed by the latest research and comply with UNESCO&rsquo;s whole-education approach.  We need further fieldwork to understand why some schools are encountering challenges in implementing the existing action plan and procedures.  We need to increase transparency from schools, social media, gaming and other online platforms on how they are handling reports of bullying and cyberbullying.  We need greater awareness raising of the vulnerability of students based on identity.  We need greater involvement from the Department of Education&rsquo;s inspectorate in supporting schools to implement, review and take action on bullying prevention and intervention programmes.  Schools need to have appropriate access to counselling for those negatively affected by bullying.  We also believe schools need to be required to provide specific hours each year to implement an approved programme of resources such as the FUSE programme to teach about bullying prevention within a whole-education approach and alongside social personal and health education, SPHE, relationships and sexuality education, RSE, and well-being frameworks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021061500002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Professor James O'Higgins Norman","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":79,"content":"<p>I thank Professor O'Higgins Norman for his presentation.

We typically talked about whole-school approaches to tackling bullying and cyberbullying.  However, now we are looking at a different type of world, a much more joined-up world, both online and offline.  The idea that a school would be left to deal with an issue like bullying or cyberbullying on its own would not work.  We suggest there is a role for the school, as part of the wider education system and societal system, to be connected in some way with the online safety commissioner or directly with social media companies or gaming companies, which might have a facility to report negative and abusive content that is not picked up by AI.  For example, one suggestion we make is that there be a trusted person in each school to whom children or parents could report if they are concerned about something going on in the school that has made its way online, and there would be a speedy communication line directly to someone who could do something about it, whether that be in the social media company, the gaming platform or at a regulatory level with respect to the online safety commissioner.  There needs to be a formal structure in place for that.<\/p> <p>  We know AI is working to a certain extent when it is used by social media and gaming platforms but we do not have a full picture of how well it is working.  Many of the metrics are collected internally by the private companies and access to those is quite limited from a research point of view.

I thank the witnesses for the two detailed submissions they have made and I have a number of questions.  The witnesses have recommended an audit on the action plan on bullying.  Principals now have a mandate to go forward and allocate staff.  The witnesses have pointed out that only 51% of schools have appointed a specific member of staff to investigate and tackle bullying in schools.  Less than half of schools, 45%, have researched and identified a specific anti-bullying programme to use in the school.  What would this audit look like?<\/p> <p>  My next question is for Dr. Mair&eacute;ad Foody on the statistics.  She mentioned a sample of 900 schools.

To clarify the numbers there, 30 of those schools were primary and we are in our first year of piloting the resources with primary.

I will keep it really short.  I was really struck by what Professor O'Higgins Norman said about image and how research has shown a lot of children get bullied because of image.  Is that because of the colour of a child's skin, for example?  A lot of time people would look and say a child is a member of the Traveller community or that he or she is poor because he or she does not have the top-class runners other children in the class have.  Thus I am wondering about the whole area of image and what was spoken about there.<\/p> <p>  Has there been any research around bullying done on the grounds of a child's ethnicity, culture or race?  It is a similar question.  I refer to research on cultural or racial discrimination with the purpose of identifying whether or not this type of bullying has different effects and impacts than personal bullying.  While it is not nice to speak about, unfortunately this bullying can be carried out by teachers.  It is absolutely necessary we develop studies on bullying.  Will the witnesses speak to the committee about the research to date on racial bullying?  It is not about blaming teachers, or anything of the sort, but unfortunately bullying can come from the adults in the room as well as the children there.<\/p> <p>  Again, I would be interested in hearing more around what was said about image.

Maybe the professor asked me to speak because I am one of the principal investigators on a project we ran recently.  It has just completed at the anti-bullying centre.  We looked at the experience of bullying among the Roma community in Ireland.  There are many other examples where identity or culture might influence a child's likelihood of being a victim of bullying.  The research we conducted, and our findings from that research, actually show it is not that straightforward.  There are a lot of different things we need to consider, especially if we think about ethnic minority groups like the Roma or members of the Traveller community in Ireland.  Classroom composition is important.  How many other members of the Traveller community are in a child's class might also affect whether or not he or she is a victim.  Social networks, having good leadership in the school and all those things influence it so we cannot really say that if a child is a member of one community he or she is more likely to be bullied.  It is not so straightforward.  What we can tell, and what the research is very clear on, is respect for diversity decreases bullying.  If there is a school culture that is positive and that promotes, acknowledges and encourages diversity and difference then there will be less bullying.  That is probably a better way to look at it than to think about who is highest risk and who is going to be a victim.

I have published research in recent years on bullying towards native and immigrant children and the reasons for bullying of native and immigrant children.  We found that, according to the children's thinking, bullying towards migrant children is very much related to contextual factors, to stereotypes and prejudices that come from family, school, teachers and media.  There is a process of learning prejudices and stereotypes concerning migrants which strongly affect bullying towards migrants.  Interestingly, some of the children who were interviewed, who were first- and second-generation immigrant students, reported they experienced forms of discrimination from teachers as well and that sometimes teachers tended to underestimate their family background, and associated their national background with poverty and low skills and low school achievement.

Much of what happens in schools is either a reflection of what is going on in the wider society or that the school system is not set up in a way which reflects the wider society.  If biases exist in the adult world, they are likely to be replicated in the child's world.

Things have changed and it is no surprise people who practise religion, and maybe practise the Catholic religion, are increasingly in the minority, especially young children and teenagers in schools.<\/p> <p>  One of the studies we has done recently has shown a concern among religion teachers about what they are observing among students who are practising Catholics and are being targeted for that, more than a concern about kids who are not practising a religion.  That is coming through now and sits well with international research on that, in that when a particular world view or religion has had a dominant position in society and that changes, it often results in those who adhere to that being targeted and being seen as old-fashioned or out of the mainstream culture.  With bullying, when people are seen to be different, they often stand out and are more likely to be targeted when it comes to bullying.<\/p><p> In terms of addressing that, we need to promote in our schools an idea of the understanding of difference, that difference is the norm, no two people are the same.  All our teacher training, continuing professional development, and curricula across the whole school programme must be linked to the understanding of a human being, where we understand that difference is a good thing and that we appreciate that.  That calls for the need to look at what we teach, the way we teach and who is teaching in our schools, and the assumptions that underline all of that.

Is it the pressures he or she is under at home?  Is it based on differences?  What is her assessment of this?

In terms of research from Ireland, it depends on what one is talking about.  It depends on whether children have family supports, whether they are already vulnerable or being supported.

In particular, my PhD was focused on moral disengagement which is the tendency to justify immoral behaviours.  Children who bully their peers show high levels of moral disengagement.  The tendency to justify immoral conduct is socialised within the peer groups.  We know from the research that in classrooms where there is a high tendency to collectively morally disengage, children bully their peers more - in other words, children tend to justify bullying.  They think it is something that is admissible and tolerated.  They also tend to put the blame on the target for having provoked the bullying.  Morality is one of the components that is associated with bullying perpetration.  There are also some variables related to family functioning.  In dysfunctional families, for instance, in families with low levels of cohesion and communication, children are more likely to bully their peers.  This is also based on some of my research findings.

As we are so far into the topic of bullying, we can really begin to delve into specific items and tease things apart.  I do not intend to go over much of the ground that has been covered already.  I had a look at the UNESCO report, Behind the Numbers: Ending School Violence and Bullying, and I want to talk a little about some of the trends it points out.  It suggests that bullying as a behaviour, in general, is decreasing.  I am interested in asking about that in the context of the quality of our longitudinal data.  School bullying has been a touchstone issue for a decade at least, but our information, if we try to step further back in time than that, is probably of lesser quality.  I want to give the witnesses an opportunity to comment on that.<\/p> <p>  As for the prevalence of different types of bullying, it appears, at least from the UNESCO report, that instances of physical bullying are decreasing.  The report mentions that the number has decreased in almost half of countries and territories.  Could the witnesses comment on the Irish-specific context of this?  It is a recurring theme through this unit of work that a lot of bullying has moved online, has become cyberbullying and now has become image-based bullying because of the pressures of Instagram, etc.<\/p> <p>  I am very interested in Professor O'Higgins Norman's last comment.  Anecdotally, it seems misogyny has now gone to the online space.  It is hidden under the rock of the online space.  I would like some insight from the experts here on those trends we find within bullying.  Are we looking at something that is psychologically based, delivered over the medium of online behaviours?  Are we seeing a move away from the more commonplace, old-style understanding of school bullying?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021061500002#G00700","speaker":"1617"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":134,"content":"<p>Does Dr. Foody want to come in on the data relating to online and offline bullying?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021061500002#G00800","nonspeaker":"Professor James O'Higgins Norman"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":135,"content":"<p>I will try to answer all the questions.  Yes, internationally, the literature shows that we have seen a small reduction in what we might call traditional or offline bullying.  That is probably as a result of the increased awareness that young people as well as adults have of what bullying is, what constitutes bullying and the harms of bullying.  That is definitely in contrast, like the Deputy said, to the literature or research that was conducted earlier, in the past 20 years or so, when we did not even know what bullying was or what we were talking about.  Now it is clear that everyone recognises that there are very severe, long-term negative effects of bullying.  That is one of the reasons.  There are also increased amounts of money and time put into anti-bullying programmes, which are working in some cases.<\/p> <p>  Apart from that, it is important to say that, according to at least the Irish data and a lot of the international data, traditional and offline bullying is still more prevalent than online bullying, so the former is still there and has not gone away.  We just have to look at human nature, and even adults and workplaces, to know that it probably will not go away, but we are looking for it to be at least reduced further with the work we do.<\/p> <p>  On the cyberbullying side of things, Dr. Mazzone might want to comment on some of her work.  Cyberbullying, as I said, is not as prevalent as traditional bullying but its impact can be more severe in some cases.  One incident of cyberbullying might be enough for somebody to feel so isolated and alone that his or her mental health comes under severe pressure, whereas offline bullying might continue for a little more time before that person would need to seek help.  The face of cyberbullying is changing because we have so many different apps, devices, methods and means, including photos and videos, to cyberbully or to harm somebody, so that is an ever-evolving space.  Again, however, in general it is considered less prevalent than offline bullying.  Even on that point, though, it is really important we do not focus too much on these distinctions because young people are usually victims in both spaces or bullying in both spaces and are often in both spaces at the same time.  They might be online and offline talking to their friends at the exact same time, so even trying to distinguish between how prevalent bullying is in one area or one space as opposed to another is kind of futile.  We have these prevalence rates in order that we can look at the impact of our interventions, but it is really important we just think about victimisation, whatever its shape, and the impact of it, whether it happens online, offline or both.  We are just concerned with young people's experiences.<\/p> <p>  I do not know whether anyone else wants to speak about prevalence or anything else.

In addition, there is qualitative research showing that children tend to trivialise bullying.  Oftentimes they do not react when bullying happens because they are used to a certain type of language, which is offensive and harmful to some targeted children.  My point is that bullying can take subtle forms.  Of course it is a good and an encouraging result that instances of physical forms of bullying are tending to decrease thanks to the whole education approach but, at the same time, we need to address and raise awareness of subtle forms of bullying.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021061500002#G01000","nonspeaker":"Dr. Angela Mazzone"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":137,"content":"<p>I will preface it by saying I do not think there is a level of bullying we should accept within our society.

Following on from what Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh asked about where Ireland stands relative to other countries, a question Dr. Mazzone answered pretty comprehensively, what do we know, if anything, about the shape of our school system?  Much is made, for example, about school patronage and the fact that the majority of school patronage is in Catholic hands, as it were, even though society has changed and there is a need for more diversity in the future.  I think everybody agrees about that, but some sought to put in issue the question of whether faith-based patronage is a part of the problem in the context of bullying.  I hope the Christian tradition in particular would be a culture that would seek to counter bullying.  I have asked about that in the past.  Last week, Professor Hymel referred in passing to the decline of faith as perhaps a contributor to the problem of moral disengagement, which is a phrase used by either Dr. Mazzone or Dr. Keating.

The literature is quite divided.  One of the things we know from the most recent literature is that we have to be very careful when we ask children to be responsible for stopping the bullying themselves.  We do not want them to feel that they have an extra pressure, in that they are already victims and, now, it is also on them to stop the bullying.  That is a big ask for young kids.  There is also this idea that, &ldquo;Oh, they are resilient&rdquo;.  There are certainly things we can do to develop resilience but not every child would be resilient in the same scenario or in the same way, so we also have to be careful about how we use that term.<\/p> <p>  If we want to get them to a place where they can deal with bullying, we need to talk about telling and reporting, and about ways they can identify when it is happening, being a good bystander and all of these other things that will also influence bullying rates and attitudes for other children as well.  It is things we can do with all the kids, not just victims, and that we work on things like empathy, being good bystanders and making sure they have the capacity to report and tell when it is happening to them.<\/p> <p>  On the other point about parents, in addition to what Dr. Mazzone said, namely, that we do the same thing, we also need to be a good role models as parents.  We need to ask our children to be empathetic online and offline and make sure they are responsible digital citizens.  Therefore, whatever way, shape or form that takes, we are recognising that if we see something online that we do not like, we feel a sense of responsibility for dealing with that as well.  That could be one way that parents could mediate or try to influence cyberbullying, by talking to their kids about it and taking responsible actions, even if they are not the victim or the bully.  I hope that answers the question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021061500002#J00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mair&eacute;ad Foody"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":158,"content":"<p>Yes, it does.

They do wonderful work and it is appreciated and valued.  My apologies, I had to come off the call for a short period to go to another meeting, but I feel I have a very good sense of this and I have, of course, read the submissions.<\/p> <p>  I have a few general questions, and a lot of that is based on some of the findings we have heard and received from other witnesses in regard to this very important issue.  I will go into them quickly and put them all together, and the witnesses can then respond.<\/p> <p>  We have heard that the 2003 anti-bullying policy needs to be completely updated.  An interesting comment was made at last week's meeting that we need to change the language around that, and instead of saying \"anti-bullying\", we need to couch it in very positive and proactive terms.  I thought that was a very good point and I would be interested to hear the witnesses&rsquo; views.<\/p> <p>  It would seem that a problem with that policy is that it is more or less saying to schools they need to have a policy but is not very clear what those policies should be.  I had not realised until this meeting that only 51% of schools had actually complied.  I am quite surprised to hear that.<\/p> <p>  There were differing views as to whether there should be a database in regard to school bullying incidents and the type of incidents, and whether tracking these incidents and how they are dealt with should be done on a national basis.  I would be interested to hear the witnesses&rsquo; views.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the question of a roadmap, it has been very clear from the witnesses we have heard that we need to have a very clear roadmap.  There seem to be a lot of very good tools that are being used in different schools but it is a case of never the twain shall meet.  Many very good practices are being carried out and, for example, the ETB schools have a very specific policy.  A number of schools are also doing restorative practice.  I have spoken to a few principals about that and it certainly seems to be excellent in terms of dealing with the perpetrators, as well as the victims, and, of course, the bystanders.<\/p> <p>  I want to mention three other areas.  In the context of appointing an online safety commissioner, Senator Mullen spoke about cyberbullying.  There is certainly a belief that an online safety commissioner would play a very important role in that area.<\/p> <p>  Particularly since Covid, there has been a bigger conversation about education, what the importance of education is and a possible steer away from having just academic learning towards having a well-rounded, holistic young person at the end of that, who is enabled to have a broader lifestyle and broader life skills.  It even goes back to what Professor O'Higgins Norman was saying about being kind, just taking that moment to think about being kind and showing respect.<\/p><p> Finally, what is the role of the parent in collaboration with the school in dealing with bullying activity?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021061500002#J01000","speaker":"1689","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":162,"content":"<p>I will address some of those points and some of my colleagues might like to pitch in.  On anti-bullying language, there is much disagreement internationally in this field.  By calling it \"anti-bullying\", it is making a clear statement against bullying, which drives the work in that direction, but that is defining it negatively.  There is much debate on that and there are good points on both sides.  The bottom line is about trying to create an atmosphere and a reality where people do not experience bullying in schools or online.<\/p> <p>  The figure of 51% of schools relates to those that have implemented a local programme to tackle bullying.  All the schools in our research have policies in place, that is, they have all taken their lead from the national action plan on bullying and implemented a local policy.  The next step was to implement an anti-bullying programme in their schools and only about one half of schools had reported they were able to do that.  I personally believe there should be a database on which we track the level of bullying in the country, which goes back to a question one of the other members raised earlier.  Having good-quality data allows us to make informed decisions about the initiatives we use and how effective they are, so I very much support beginning to do that and building those data.<\/p> <p>  On the roadmap, the international research suggests there is not a one-size-fits-all programme or approach to tackling bullying.  Schools need to be able to draw down on resources of use to them, depending on what they are dealing with locally.  A programme such as the FUSE programme we offer, for example, provides schools with a programme of resources and an approach, and they are then able to adapt that and use it locally.  The effectiveness of saying to every school that it must do a particular programme at such a time in such a way is not always proven.  The one-size-fits-all approach is something I am cautious about.<\/p> <p>  The online safety commissioner is really important, although the role still needs to be worked out.  It is my understanding it will not be possible to make individual complaints or reports through the commissioner&rsquo;s office, which will be disappointing for people looking for somewhere to go when they feel there is nowhere else for them to go and they have tried everything else in regard to reporting the problem or seeking help with online safety issues.<\/p> <p>  As for a well-rounded education, Dr. Keating will talk about how the overall curriculums, including the social, personal and health education, SPHE, curriculum and so on, sit alongside the anti-bullying work we do.  The role of the parent is the key, going back to Senator Mullen's point.  We need to help parents such that they will feel strong and confident and have a purpose to the way in which they educate their children about bullying, both offline and online, and be able to do that in a consistent and confident way.<\/p> <p>  I might hand over to Dr. Foody to comment further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021061500002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Professor James O'Higgins Norman"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":163,"content":"<p>To follow up on the point about principals and the national action plan, that was research we conducted at the centre in which we assessed the work of principals in Ireland.  There were more than 900 respondents, so while it was not every principal, it was a good sample.  As Professor O'Higgins Norman said, that figure of 51% we talked about meant that 51% had not appointed a specific member of staff to deal with bullying cases in their school, but there were many very positive findings from the study.  Almost every school, or 99% of them, has a policy and all the principals recognised the impact of bullying on school attendance, academic achievement and mental health.  We are cautious in regard to being negative about the work that needs to be done on the procedures because principals are used to them and there is much good stuff in there.<\/p> <p>  The main finding from the work was that principals had not identified a specific anti-bullying programme.  That study and other Irish studies, including one by Corcoran and McGuckin in 2014, have found that what principals in Ireland wanted above all was support in resourcing and finding materials related to bullying and to be told by the Department what intervention they should run and what steps they should take.  They are seeking more support.  They are doing everything in their power in terms of their policies.  Our results show that perhaps assigning a specific member of staff might help.<\/p> <p>  On the point about tracking, that is a good idea and it is one place principals could start if they were given support with somehow being able to assess the level of bullying in their own school confidentially in order that they would not be afraid those data would be available or would influence their attendance rates, for example.  They should also be given support in specific areas, if they need it, for it to be reduced, and that is something the FUSE programme could fit into.<\/p> <p>  A number of member raised this research.  To clarify, it related to 900 principals from primary and post-primary - mainly the former - and covered both  DEIS and non-DEIS schools.

One question I have asked every guest before the committee in recent weeks relates to how to educate parents and get into their minds.  A steady stream at all the meetings suggests that often the parents who need to be got to are the ones who will not listen, attend meetings, inform themselves, communicate with the school or get involved in it.<\/p><p>The million dollar question is how to get those parents involved.  How should we communicate with them?  How can we get a commitment from them?  How can we inform them of the dangers of social media?  Dr. Foody spoke about parents' sense of responsibility.  Everyone who brings a child into the world has a responsibility to do their best for that child.  Many parents are not doing their best for their children while allowing them on some of the terrible social media platforms that are meant for adults.  Children as young as nine, ten, 11 and 12 are using them.  They are not just using them after school, but sometimes up to 2 a.m. or 3 a.m.  Parents are allowing their children on these dangerous social media platforms until that hour of the morning unsupervised.

This would comply with the existing oversight management which is outlined in the Department of Education procedures for schools.  It would highlight to schools what they are doing well.  We do not want to come across as telling schools precisely what they should be doing.  Schools need to understand what great work they are already doing and how to build on that work.  They should assess their policy annually and include every staff member, the caretaker, the school secretary and anyone who may potentially witness bullying behaviours in the school.  They need to be aware and have a voice so they know what to do.  If those data were centralised, it could feed into annual reports highlighting areas where schools are struggling and areas in which schools are succeeding.

How could an online safety commissioner be empowered to tackle cyberbullying?  Are social media companies doing enough to tackle bullying on their platforms?  This has been the subject of major debate at the committee in recent weeks.  I believe the policies of social media companies are not strong enough.  I believe the Government is not doing enough to tackle these social media companies and should be doing more.  I have heard some absolute horror stories, some of which have resulted in suicide by youngsters, some of them in their teens because of ongoing online bullying.  Somebody needs to take this by the scruff of the neck.  I hope that the proposed online safety commissioner will be given the power to do that.<\/p> <p>  Investment by social media companies here in Ireland contributes a considerable amount.  However, we should not be afraid to take them on, given that they are causing such harm.  Social media can be very positive, but there is also much negativity about it.  I feel sorry for some kids growing up.  When I was going to school, both primary and secondary, bullying happened within the school.

Some of them are extremely small and are providing apps that kids can download very quickly to their phones without their parents realising the full implications of them.  It also refers to enormous corporations, such as Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and so on.  In recent years I have seen greater engagement by some of those and not so much by others in trying to deal with online safety.  Any of the companies we have worked with are very anxious to try to address these problems.  They often look to us for solutions, help and advice.<br\/><br\/>I think things are getting better.  Everyone agrees that more needs to be done.  We also need to recognise that the behaviour that makes its way onto these platforms is human behaviour that exists without the platforms.  I am not so sure we can say the platforms cause it.  For example, some of the research that looks at gaming shows that there is very little in online games that causes or produces negative behaviour, but the way people behave in those games, the way they speak to one another and the way they relate to one another can be really horrible at times.  This comes back to being a human behaviour that needs to be addressed.  Whether it is expressed on social media or elsewhere, it is a problem.<br\/><br\/>The online safety commissioner's role must be to make it as easy as possible for people to have some place to go if they have a problem.  As I said earlier, at the moment there is considerable development in artificial intelligence, AI, to address some of these issues.  However, AI can only do so much.  Education and regulation are the way forward.  People need to feel they have some kind of recourse to the online safety commissioner when everything else fails.  Before that, we need to have education and have people using these facilities in a different way from how they have been using them.  <br\/><br\/><b><\/b>The Chairman also asked what we would do if we had a magic wand.  Regarding resources for schools, as someone said earlier, time is getting squeezed out of our schools.  Every day there is increasingly less time to think and to do things that are really meaningful because teachers, parents and everyone in the school are under so much pressure.  If we had a way to give schools a bit of time, maybe cover for substitutes to allow teachers to take up continuing professional development and making time available in that way, it would be really important.

That is where the life skills take place, the decision making, feelings and emotions and how to manage and regulate them and how pupils learn to cope with scenarios they may face.  It also includes media education.  It is very challenging for teachers to deliver meaningful lessons in a 30 minute slot.  There can be a tendency, as research has shown, that where classes run over time in other subject areas, SPHE is often the subject that gets missed out on.  The review of primary and post-primary has included significant redevelopments in valuing SPHE.  This is clear in this year's revised version of the well-being programme for junior cycle and the National Council for Curriculum Assessment, NCCA, draft primary school framework in 2020.

I genuinely do not believe this is required and I do not intend to accept these amendments.<\/p> <p>  Section 48 deals with the establishment and operation of the register of relevant public land.  That is there already.  The Deputy is just seeking to rename that to a public register of relevant public land.  I do not consider the amendment to be required, although I remain to be convinced.  I am happy if Deputy &Oacute; Broin wishes to come back for some particular reason.  It is not the title of the register that will determine that it will be a publicly available register but rather the provisions that are already in section 48(5), which provides that, \"The Register shall be published and made available for inspection by the Agency on its website.\"<\/p><p>It will be a public register and that is important.  The LDA has already commenced work on the register, as we all know.  A prototype is available on its website but more work is required.  The development of the register is a priority and it has to be, as I have said to the LDA.  It is important that there is full public oversight.  I assure all Deputies, particularly the Deputies who tabled this amendment, that a register will be publicly available for use by all and at all times.  I completely agree that the register is a vital tool for the LDA and the Government to identify all relevant public lands; that is, lands owned by relevant public bodies in areas with populations greater than 10,000, as we understand.  I think we are all clear on that.  The register will detail land such owned by the Office of Public Works, OPW, Departments, local authorities and all other State bodies, including commercial State bodies.<\/p><p> The register will be used to identify public lands.  If they are not sold, they will have an affordability requirement attached to them under the legislation, which is really important too.  This will ensure that regardless of whether the land is being developed by the LDA or another developer, there will be a requirement to provide 50% affordable housing, at least in certain areas.  We will deal with other changes to that next week.  I intend to increase that further - above 50% - in other areas.  The register will be used by the LDA to report to the Government on the use of public land.  We really need that.  We need to ensure there is full visibility and full oversight.  In order to ensure the register is as complete as possible, public bodies will be required to co-operate with the LDA, and the LDA will be able to request information from such bodies in terms of all relevant public lands they have.  Unless Deputy &Oacute; Broin believes we have missed something, I am happy to listen.  It is important that we focus on what the register does as opposed to what it is named, and I think we have been incredibly clear on that in section 48.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 141 is purely a technical amendment and corrects an editing error in section 48(3) by replacing the word \"on\" with \"in\".  The phrase \"entered on the Register\" has been changed to \"entered in the Register\".  This amendment does not in any way change the intent of the provision and simply corrects a drafting error.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021061500002#A01000","speaker":"1561","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":204,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response.

That is important because one cannot have a situation where elected members of local authorities are under a legal obligation to co-operate with the LDA.  Of course co-operation is a good thing but members of local authorities must not be legally obliged to do so because there are times when they may, within their rights, decide on a different course of action, and the correct one, from the one being proposed by the LDA.  Members of local authorities must explicitly be exempt from this rather than what is in the Minister's amendment, which leaves it unspecified.

These amendments are technical in nature and provide for the inclusion of a subsidiary designated activity company, DAC, in an number of places in section 50.  We had a series of these earlier in the Bill and this followed feedback I received from both Government and Opposition Members on Second Stage.  The section deals with reports to the Government relating to certain lands and provides that the LDA must report on relevant public land and land owned by the agency.  It was always the intention of this legislation when it was being drafted that the reference to the LDA would also refer to subsidiary DACs but to avoid any doubt at all and taking on board the input and feedback from members, I am moving these amendments to clarify that the LDA must also report on any land owned by a subsidiary DAC.  These amendments are being inserted to provide that particular clarity.<\/p> <p>  I want to make a couple of point on amendments Nos. 145 and 151 on development plans.  I take the point that is being raised.  The LDA will seek planning permission for its proposed developments via the appropriate procedures under planning and development Acts in a similar way to any other planning applicant.  In making decisions on proposed LDA developments, the planning authority or the board is required to determine that these planning applications are in accordance with the provisions of relevant development plans, local area plans, or strategic development zones, SDZs, that are in force.  I know there have been some issues around SHD, which expires this year as members will know.<\/p> <p>  A number of LDA developments have been through the planning system to date.  As members may know, Shanganagh Castle in Dublin and St. Kevin's Hospital site in Cork had to take into account the provisions of the county development plans.  All planning authorities provide access to pre-application consultations under this.  Having said that, I understand the point that is being made that it might not be any harm if we were a bit more prescriptive in fully stating that it is subject to the development plans themselves and to other plans.  If Deputies are agreeable, I will endeavour to come back on this on Report Stage.  I want to check those two amendments out in particular.  I will do that and I will come back to Deputies.<\/p> <p>  I take the point that Deputy Paul Donnelly is making and I have been a councillor myself as well.  Councillors are important.  They have a reserved function to vote on and put together their own county development and local area plans.  That is something I have always been a firm supporter of.  If there is something we can insert to make it abundantly clear that this is the case, I am happy to look at it.  I want to check that there are no unintended consequences.  I do not believe there will be any but if it is acceptable I will take those two amendments away and come back on them specifically on Report Stage.  The Deputy will reserve the right to reintroduce them if he is not happy with what we are coming back with.<\/p> <p>  Is amendment No. 152 in this grouping as well?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021061500002#C01600","speaker":"1561"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":236,"content":"<p>Yes, as are Nos. 153 and 154.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021061500002#C01700","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":237,"content":"<p>I will not be accepting amendments Nos. 152, 153 or 154.  I know what Deputies &Oacute; Broin and Gould are referring to in the housing needs demands assessment, HNDA, but the wording there might even be problematic because it might be too prescriptive.  We are doing that.  I would be afraid that if we put that specific wording in, like we have the HNDA rolled out to all our local authorities, that phrase is not consistent with the phrase in amendment No. 152 and could well cause us a problem.  I know what the Deputies are trying to achieve and I do not have an issue with that but it might cause difficulties.<\/p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 153 and 154 would just put further requirements on the LDA that are above and beyond what any other agency does.  We discussed at length at a previous hearing how the LDA will be fully answerable to the committee.  It will also have Comptroller and Auditor General oversight and it will have to report to whoever the Minister is at that given time.  This would be providing another layer of reports that have to be laid as well as seeking to put additional provisions in place.<\/p><p>I am satisfied the provisions in the section are robust enough when it comes to laying any report before the Oireachtas or the Government.  The Oireachtas committee can use the report and call witnesses in that regard, if it so wishes.  The report, prepared by the LDA under this section, is to enable the Government to decide on the use of public lands.  It is what the section relates to.  It is not appropriate that the agency would prepare this report for the Houses of the Oireachtas as it would not have any decision-making powers for the use of relevant public lands and, if required, the disposal of such lands through it.<\/p><p> It is fully appropriate for a report to be furnished to the Government so it can make the appropriate decisions.  It would be laid before the Oireachtas once the report has been submitted to the Government.  Any decisions that arise from this on the use of public lands must be made by the Government following the report and they will also be laid before the Oireachtas.<\/p><p> I have dealt with amendment No. 152 so I believe that covers all the amendments in the group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021061500002#C01800","speaker":"1561","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":239,"content":"<p>I welcomed the Minister's previous amendments that clarify the standing of the subsidiary designated activity companies and I welcome these amendments from him as well.

I reserve the right to reintroduce them.<\/p> <p>  I accept the Minister's point about the wording, \"housing needs assessment\", and this has been overtaken by the housing need and demand assessment.  Will he consider the inclusion of that as well if he is tabling a Report Stage amendment on this?  It will be such a key tool for determining the local authorities' housing plans.  For the first time we will have an empirical evidence base indicating not only how many homes we need within a local authority over five years but we could have the information down to local electoral area and or in even finer detail.  We will know how many of them should be one-bedroom, two-bedroom, three-bedroom of four-bedroom properties.  It would be wholly inappropriate if the LDA in its plans to develop public land was not obliged to take into account that evidence base in the same way we expect local authorities, etc., to do so.  Will the Minister give us a quick update on whether the LDA toolkit for local authorities will be ready by the end of the year?  There has been some good progress on that.  I am happy to withdraw those three amendments and reserve the right to reintroduce them.<\/p> <p>  That leaves the final two amendments in the group.  The functions that the LDA will be given are a little different from other State agencies and more similar to the National Asset Management Agency.  This agency will have control, albeit subject to Government approval, to very large tracts of public land.  Having an additional layer of scrutiny with a report to be sent to the Oireachtas committee would be sensible.  We often complain that simply laying something before the Houses of the Oireachtas or putting it on a website does not bring it to the attention of a busy committee.  Therefore, I will press that amendment.<\/p> <p>  Likewise, having a timeframe for laying the report is important.  The Government must make its decisions but we would like it to do so in a timely fashion.

This provision, as drafted, is to provide that the LDA can take possession of a site it is acquiring under Part 7 in advance of the land being vested in it.

It is on this basis that I move the amendment today, to provide that the LDA may take early possession of a site it is acquiring under Part 7 but will not have to pay compensation.

There is a view that local authorities are delaying the delivery of social and affordable housing.  Prior to the publication of the Affordable Housing Bill and this Bill, it could have been argued that it was not possible for local authorities to build the kind of public housing on public lands which I believe these Bills will now allow local authorities to do.  Therefore, the full toolbox for councillors is now present in terms of having mixed income and tenure and well planned communities.<\/p> <p>  The decision to remove the power of disposal from local authority members will not be required.  It is often the intransigence of officials to bring forward proposals that is the real delay.  We have talked about amendments to this Bill in terms of targets for local authorities.

I have said that where section 118 of the 2000 Act is enforced, in other words, where a local area plan has been put in place by local authority the lands subject to that section could not be disposed of without disposal by councillors.  I am open to another mechanism that the Minister may have to do that, but even in places that have a higher population than small town centres we need to protect the right of councillors in their desire to develop land without that being taken from them without their approval.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021061500002#G03500","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":344,"content":"<p>I will speak to amendment No. 189.

On a general point, it is important to remember that the vast majority of both social and affordable homes will continue to be delivered by local authorities.  That is why we are tooling them up to do that.  That is why we gave them the largest housing budget in the history of the State.  We will continue to drive that on by giving them additional resources, which I announced last week, around the project management area, quantity surveying experience and beefing up their housing delivery teams.  The LDA will deliver in excess of that.  It will supplement, not supplant.  We must be clear on that and reinforce it.<\/p> <p>  There is no question that a big bad commercial entity is going to come in and gobble up council land that has been identified for housing.  That is not the case at all.  If anything, the Government is trying to get councils to deliver that more quickly.  I brought in the single-stage approval process to be able to push that on.  We are looking to amend that further to get councils back doing what they were good at.  They have started to do that, even leaving Covid aside, by building their own developments.  They will deliver direct-build affordable housing as well.  Members have seen many of the sites I visited with Government colleagues recently.  That is the context of this debate.<\/p> <p>  We are looking here at the instances in which it would be appropriate for the LDA to develop that land.  We have seen in Shanganagh Castle, for argument's sake, that is can be done in partnership with the local authority.  That will happen with the LDA on some of the larger sites when cost rental and other housing is being delivered.  I have seen that happen.  I wanted to make those general points first before dealing with the amendments because they are relevant to what the LDA is about.  Some previous amendments at this committee were proposed because people did not want the LDA to be involved in residential development at all, which is baffling.  If we have State-owned land that is non-local authority land, which is the bulk of what the LDA is going to work with, this Government and I want to see those lands put to productive use to deliver affordable housing, social housing and cost-rental housing for people at scale.  We must do this.  We all know of sites throughout the country, for example in our regional cities, that have been sat on by State bodies and have not been used.  In some instances, council sites that have been identified for housing have been run into the ground for 20 years because of indeterminate arguments, going back and forth.  We are in the middle of a housing crisis, which means we must deliver more homes.  We must do things differently to make sure we get that supply up.<\/p> <p>  In relation to the specific amendments before the committee, Deputy Duncan Smith is not here to move amendment No. 185.<\/p> <p>  I cannot accept amendments Nos. 186 and 187 because they seek to provide in section 55 that the LDA would require the consent of the Oireachtas to dispose of land rather than by ministerial consent, as is currently drafted.  It is not appropriate that the Oireachtas would replace the obligations of Ministers in this provision.  I do not think any future Minister would agree with this.  We can imagine the potential additional delays in getting homes developed.  We have seen that at local authority level.  The last thing I want is to see that happening with a new agency.  The Minister with responsibility for housing and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will be the shareholders of the LDA.  There is no provision for any other shareholder.  It is wholly appropriate that the Ministers, as shareholders and as Ministers of the Government, rather than the Oireachtas, would have to consent to the disposal of land by a commercial State body.  The ministerial consent requirements are consistent with the existing procedures under Department of Public Expenditure and Reform circulars for the disposal of State assists.  They are consistent with all other State agencies, as well as the ministerial consent which is required under the State Property Act.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 187 seeks to introduce a further amendment to section 55.  It proposes that land which was previously acquired from a local authority and is being disposed of by the LDA \"shall be offered for purchase to the local authority at the prevailing market price or the price paid to the local authority at original acquisition, whichever is the lower\".  I cannot accept this amendment because it does not serve any purpose, in that a local authority would offer land for sale to the LDA after it had already decided to dispose of the land.  The LDA will only acquire such land where it considers the land is suitable for development under the legislation.  I do not envisage a scenario where a local authority would want to have first refusal to purchase back land it had decided to dispose of.  If one were to think about it this way, we have ensured through this Bill that other State agencies will have to offer land to the LDA first.  That is the position in relation to disposal of lands.<\/p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 188 and 189, as tabled by Deputies McAuliffe and Higgins, seek to amend section 56, which relates to arrangements regarding the disposal of land by a local authority to the LDA, to provide that it will only apply to land zoned for housing.  Amendment No. 189 looks at larger urban areas.  I am giving these amendments close consideration.  At this stage, I am not in a position to accept them but I am looking at whether section 183 of the 2001 Act may only apply if it is land that is not designated or zoned for housing.  It would apply in that instance.  I see this as an extremely rare scenario.  Land zoned for housing that has not been used by a local authority - we do not envisage that being the case &ndash; would not be subject to section 183.  I will work through some of these suggestions, taking account of the feedback received from Opposition and Government Deputies, and indeed our colleagues in local government, to see whether we can fine-tune this some more.<\/p> <p>  There is a very good reason for this.  Members of the Oireachtas, in opposition or in government, cannot continue to countenance the adding of further delay upon delay on specific sites that are there.  We must do things differently to deliver at least 33,000 homes a year, both public and private, which is what the ESRI based its research that I commissioned on.  That is what we must achieve, but we are way off that figure.  That is why we need the LDA to develop and manage State-owned land that is not being used productively.  I reiterate that the local authorities will still be the main deliverer and provider of social and affordable housing, so much so that I gave approval last week for local authorities to acquire more lands.  I changed the way the recoupment of costs for land purchased by local authorities is done.  I held four housing summits last week with all chief executive officers across the country.  I advised them and issued a letter in that regard.  They are aware that when local authorities are short on land banks, which many of them are, and after the next few years they will be short because of what they are doing, they are to get back out and acquire land.  We need that.  I asking them to acquire land in order that they can build public homes on public land and build affordable homes on affordable land.  If we say to local authorities that we want them to buy more land, and the Government gives them the funds to do that and asks them to do it, as sure as hell they are not going to be taking it away on the other side.  We want the LDA to develop and provide homes on land that has not been used productively.  I wanted to give this context because it is important.  There are aspects of this that I am looking at and will come back to on Report Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021061500002#H00300","speaker":"1561"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":348,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister's commitment that he will return to this section on Report Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021061500002#H00400","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":349,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for taking on board my views, those of Deputy Higgins and other members of the committee who have raised this issue, and those of members of our party who are not members of the committee.

The fundamental disagreement here is that I do not believe one or two Ministers should have the authority to decide whether considerable tracts of public land should be sold, including to private actors.<\/p><p>One of the great values of the section 183 process in local authorities, to which I will come in a moment, is that there is a level of democratic accountability and scrutiny of both the substance of the decision and the decision itself.  Land being transferred from a local authority to the LDA, which the LDA could then decide to sell on all or a portion of to a private interest with the approval of one or two Ministers by way of a phone call or email, is not an appropriate way to deal with what is possibly one of our most valuable public assets.  I will, therefore, be pressing the amendment.<\/p><p> I will speak briefly to amendments Nos. 188 and 189, in the context of having tabled a formal opposition to section 56.  That formal opposition to section 56 has been requested by the Association of Irish Local Government.  In some senses this is one of the most negative elements of this legislation, even if one were in favour of a single centralised State agency to displace councils and develop housing, which is what I believe this will become.  The Minister claims otherwise but we take a different view on where this will go and that is fair enough.  Section 183 has two functions and it is important that the public and other interested parties listening in understand them.<\/p><p> First, there is a transparency function.  When a local authority is considering transferring any piece of land for residential or commercial development, from a small ransom strip to a large piece of land, the director of development has to publish a report stipulating the purpose of the transfer of the land and the financial return to the local authority.  If that financial return is lower than the market value, the manager must outline the reasons for that.  There are many cases where that might be done because it would improve economic opportunity, create jobs or provide a community dividend, etc.  That public, transparent process is the first function of section 183, which would be lost if section 56 of this Bill goes through.<\/p><p> The second aspect of section 183 is that the full body of elected members then has to vote on that process.  Therefore, what section 56 of this legislation proposes to do is remove all the transparency and accountability and all the mechanisms by which local authorities outline what to do with what is essentially public land, which belongs to the taxpayers and the wider community.  It would deny elected members a vote.  I do not accept the contention that that is being doing to speed anything up.  Let us look at some of the lands in question.  Shanganagh Castle, for example, was sold by the Department of Justice to D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council almost 20 years ago.  The delay in that project was not because the councillors were in any way divided over the development of that land, as Deputy Boyd Barrett will tell us.  He knows better than the rest of us because it is his constituency.  Councillors had been screaming at the Departments responsible for the environment and housing for years to fund the site.  They put what they wanted to see into the local area plan by unanimous vote, which is remarkable but positive.  The Minister's predecessor, Eoghan Murphy, refused to fund it.  The delay of 20 years in Shanganagh is due to central government not providing the funds.<\/p><p> St. Teresa's Gardens is the same.  Dublin city councillors are agreed on what they want on that site and there is no difficulty in getting councillors to support it.  The difficulty is that, before elected members have even been asked if they want to transfer it to the LDA, it is already up on the LDA's website.  The great tragedy of that is that it will split the cost-rental housing from the social housing.  Dublin City Council will buy back the rented social housing if this project goes to the LDA but the LDA will retain the cost-rental housing.  Then, in 30 or 40 years when the principal loans raised to build those apartments are paid down, it will be the LDA that benefits from the revenue surplus, not Dublin City Council, to which it would be hugely beneficial for recycling back into the maintenance of already underfunded stock.  And so on and so on.  It is never, in my experience, councillors who delay the development of sites.  It is central government not providing the funding.<\/p><p> The Minister is on record saying he wants to reassert the role of local authorities in the delivery of social and affordable homes.  That is great rhetoric but how he puts his money where his mouth is by giving local authorities the money to deliver that.  Oscar Traynor Road is a perfect example.  By a large majority, councillors have said they want 40% social, 40% affordable cost-rental and 20% affordable sale, not unlike D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council did.  Yet, all they are getting from Department officials, according to a report that went to Dublin city councillors, are delays and hurdles.  Let me be very clear: I fully accept their intentions but I do not understand why Deputies McAuliffe and Higgins would seek to amend this section.  It should be scrapped.  It has no place in this Bill.  It undermines local authorities' transparency and accountability and we will be pressing our opposition to this section. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021061500002#H00600","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":352,"content":"<p>I am more concerned about amendment No. 186 after hearing the Minister's response than I was before.  I am also concerned about section 56, which I am formally opposing as well.  There is a significant gap between what the Minister is saying and what the legislation allows for and there is a significant gap between what he is saying and what is actually happening in practice.  The legislation allows for public land and local authority land to be acquired by the Land Development Agency.  Then, if the Land Development Agency does not use that land it can sell it on to a developer or an investment fund purely with ministerial consent.  These sorts of schemes are already happening.  In that situation, there will potentially be private delivery of homes on what was public land and then the council or the State will step back in to take up a long-term lease, which would mean paying an exorbitant cost for 20 years to 25 years.  It is win-win for the investment fund or developer that ends up getting the public land and it comes at a huge cost to the public, the State and local authorities.  That is what is happening now and that is what the Bill allows for.  If our amendments are not accepted and this section is not deleted, that is exactly what is going to happen.  It does not matter what the Minister says about the LDA supplementing, not supplanting, local authorities because the Bill allows the LDA to supplant what local authorities are doing.<\/p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Broin is correct that the biggest obstacle to local authorities building social homes is the Department and the Government not providing funding and approval for schemes.  The recent report from the ESRI was damning in that regard.  It stated that the excuses being made about funding not being available are just not true.  It looked at the most conservative financing model it could come up with in terms of what could be drawn down and borrowed at historically low interest rates and, on that basis, it projected that we could easily double the amount of capital spending on social homes to deliver twice the amount of housing.  It was scathing of the current expenditure on private sector subsidies to deliver social housing.  I urge the Minister to read that report in full, if he has not done so.  If he has done so, I urge him to implement it in full and scrap the provisions in the Bill that would allow public land to be sold on to private developers and investment funds.  That is what it allows.  If the Minister is genuinely against that happening, he should amend the Bill to stop it.  It is as simple as that.  Why have these provisions in the Bill if not to keep the door open for that to happen?  That is the critical thing.  With more than 8,000 people living in emergency accommodation and more than 120,000 households on housing waiting lists or in insecure HAP tenancies, we simply cannot afford to continue with this lack of delivery of social and affordable homes.  One sure way of delaying the delivery of the houses we need is to sell off public land to private developers or investment funds that can then sit on it until prices increase or engage in a slow delivery that suits the full market prices they are trying to achieve.  I am now more concerned than ever about this section. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021061500002#J00200","speaker":"1550"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":353,"content":"<p>For clarity, Deputy Duncan Smith is not present so he will not be able to press amendment No. 185.

It is the dirty little secret behind the Land Development Agency.  The agency should be about gathering up land that is being sat on by private developers and speculators, or land being held by Departments or State agencies other than local authorities, and ensuring that land is developed for public and genuinely affordable housing.  Instead, we have an agency that is creating the opportunity to sell off public land to investment funds, speculators and private developers.  These are the very people who are responsible for the current housing and homelessness crisis.  There is simply no justification whatsoever for disposing of public land or involving private finance, speculators, developers or investment funds with the public land bank.  In fact, they threaten to undermine any attempt to deliver the public and affordable housing that some of us in opposition have been pointing out for a decade is needed to address this crisis.  This is NAMA part 2, to put it simply.  We warned about NAMA originally.

If the Government had simply provided the local authority, which had signalled its desire to build public housing on that land, with the funds to do so we would have public and affordable housing on the Shanganagh Castle site now.  The funding was not forthcoming because the Government always had a plan, of which the LDA is the culmination, to open up that public land bank, that particular site that was publicly-owned, to private finance and private developers.  The consequence of that is we do not know whether the affordable housing will be affordable.  There has also been a chronic delay in actually delivering anything and a sod being turned on that site.  Why is that?  It is because the Government has involved private financiers in the equation and they must make a profit.  The Government has been trying to square the circle of how to deliver affordable housing on public land and make a profit for private financiers and, of course, it is a very difficult circle to square.

It is very clear in this Bill that regardless of who owns the land there is an obligation to build affordable housing on it.  Thus if anything, it is the exact opposite of what Deputy Boyd Barrett and Deputy Cian O'Callaghan have said.  I ask the Minister to clarify, because it is important for the record of the committee, that the purpose of the Bill is to assign the obligation to have affordability on it, rather than allowing a mechanism to make it unaffordable.  It is not a correct for Deputy Cian O'Callaghan to conclude that the Bill will allow land to be sold and then for it to be on the open market to be developed and speculated on.  He is leaving out the most important obligation in the Bill, namely, the permanent obligation, regardless of who owns the land, that only affordable housing may be built on it.  It is really important.  I do not think the Deputy made the point disingenuously, but it is an important thing to clarify that the obligation is permanently assigned to the land regardless of ownership.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021061500002#K01700","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":372,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

We have a site in Mulhuddart in Dublin 15 called Churchfields which has been delayed for a good number of years on the basis that there is no funding coming from central government and there is no affordable housing.  That was delayed for year after year.  We were crying out for housing to be developed on that land and there is space for more than 1,000 units.<\/p> <p>  Also, I ask the Minister if on the one hand the Bill is allowing land to be transferred to the LDA while at the same time asking the councils to buy more land?

We had a clear example there of some of the best in sound bite politics and misrepresentations of the real situation.  That is just a fact.  Throwing out phrases like \"dirty little secret\" and that type of stuff is not correct, at the end of the day.  I reiterate that where local authorities have decided to dispose of land, they, like other bodies, including commercial bodies, must give first refusal to the LDA before selling to the market.  It is only in these circumstances that section 183 of the Local Government Act would not apply as it is moving land from one public body to another.  Deputy McAuliffe's point is absolute.  Deputy Cian O'Callaghan may want to clarify what he said but the reality of it is we have already seen, very recently, schemes that have been funded by my Department, through the serviced sites fund, voted down by the Deputy's party, the Social Democrats, and voted by down by Sinn F&eacute;in, Deputies &Oacute; Broin and Paul Donnelly's party.  That is the proof of the pudding.  That is 1,200 homes gone.  Of those, 238 were to be social, 238 affordable and 150 cost-rental.  They are all gone.<\/p><p>People will have to make up their minds as to whether they really want unproductively used State-owned lands to remain in that condition with State bodies sitting on them.  I do not want that, and neither does the Government.  The Bill will ensure that it does not happen.  Saying that this measure would be a mechanism to sell off public land to investment funds, developers, speculators and so on - I am quoting - is a sound bite that might play well with some elements of the media and keep people disaffected, but we are concerned with delivering solutions.  Parties are opposing these mechanisms.  They actually opposed the LDA building any homes at all.  Deputies &Oacute; Broin and O'Callaghan went even further and opposed the LDA even planning to build for houses by saying they did not want the master plan.  Let us get real.<\/p><p> I will consider Report Stage amendments to see whether there can be further changes in this regard, but I firmly believe that we must get on with building affordable and social homes on State-owned lands.  I will table amendments to increase the affordable ratio on those lands further.  I put it to the Deputies who argue against it to set out what they will do.  Will they vote against homes for working people being built on State-owned lands as their parties have done in respect of council-owned lands?<\/p><p> We all want the State to use its land appropriately and to deliver social and affordable housing.  Some Deputies are not crazy about affordable housing and do not believe in real homeownership, but this Government does.  We want to give people a chance to own their own homes at an affordable rate and we have voted accordingly for it.  That is why definitions of \"affordability\" are contained in the Affordable Housing Bill, which is a Bill I hope the Members opposite will support.<\/p><p> I will conclude on my next point because I know time is short, but some serious charges have been made about what the LDA will do.  Deputies &Oacute; Broin, O'Callaghan and Boyd Barrett, people for whom I have personal regard, know better than that.  They do not believe what they are saying, nor should they because they are misrepresenting the facts.  I will not accept their amendments.<\/p><p> I thank my Government colleagues in respect of amendments Nos. 188 and 189.

My point is that who delivers homes matters.  If public land is sold to a private developer or investment fund - I did not use the word \"speculator\"; the Minister used it, although he is right that land could also be sold to speculators - and a certain percentage is to be affordable or social, we know from what is happening now that the affordable housing will be at a higher price, in particular because the private sector has to borrow at a higher cost.  That is a fact.  I looked at one planning application recently where the financing costs were 14% of the total.  That would not be the case with public delivery.  Since the cost is higher, the affordable purchase price - or the rent if the property is cost rental - will be more expensive.  As such, it matters who delivers these affordable homes.  It also matters in the case of social housing.  If public lands owned by a local authority are acquired by the LDA and sold on to a private developer, the local authority or the State could end up leasing the social homes built on them back at an expensive rate.  The local authority building housing directly would be a much better use of resources, as the ESRI pointed out.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the proposal for 1,200 homes that was voted through in respect of lands in Donabate, I do not agree with the majority of those homes being sold at full market price when they are on public lands.

We are engaging with stakeholders who made written submissions on the general scheme.  This is the second instalment of our engagement on this matter.  We had a previous engagement about four weeks ago with a number of other witnesses.  I thank Deputy Carroll MacNeill for chairing that session in my absence.  She is our in-house expert on the topics involved and I thank her for stepping into the breach.  She is also the Vice Chairman of the committee and has a particular expertise and interest in the matter.<\/p> <p>  Today's witnesses are appearing virtually before the committee from outside the Leinster House precincts.  As per the current fashion, we are holding remote sessions and that is working well on a practical level but there are some limitations.  I welcome the witnesses to the meeting.  We are joined by Mr. Liam Herrick of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties. ICCL.  Mr. Herrick is welcome.  His organisation is becoming familiar to the committee and I thank him for his continued input.  We are also joined by Ms Gemma McLoughlin-Burke, also from the ICCL.  I thank Ms McLoughlin-Burke for attending.  She is a procedural rights fellow at the ICCL.  We are also joined by Mr. Kevin Condon, a principal officer from the civil legislation unit in the Department of Justice.  The Department's representatives regularly attend and participate in our meetings.  I thank all involved for being here.<\/p> <p>  I invite witnesses and members to make sure they unmute their devices when they are addressing the committee so that we can capture the sound.  I ask members and witnesses to mute their devices while not contributing to avoid picking up background noise or feedback.  I also ask that they use the raise hand function when they wish to contribute.<\/p> <p>  Before I invite the witnesses to deliver their opening statements, I advise them of the following regarding parliamentary privilege.  All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of a person or entity.  Therefore, if statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.<\/p><p>For witnesses attending remotely outside of the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present in the committee room would, and I ask them to be mindful of that.<\/p><p> Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside of the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  For members who are participating remotely, I offer the usual advice about keeping their devices on mute until they speak.  They might have their cameras switched on unless they need to turn them off and be mindful that we are in public session.  There is the procedural privilege requirement that because of the constitutional requirement as interpreted by the Houses of the Oireachtas that members must be physically present within the confines of the place, namely, Leinster House, a member cannot participate from outside Leinster House in this session or, indeed, any similar sessions.<\/p><p> Finally, I remind members that the clock is as always against us.  We have two hours for the session.  That is a decent period but if we run up against the clock, we have a strict cut-off point because of Covid limitations.

Once the opening statements have been delivered, I will call on members of the committee to put their questions or comments to the witnesses and the meeting.  Depending on the time, there may be an opportunity for a second such round.  Effectively, we will have opening statements from the witnesses, we will have questions and comments from members, and we might do one or two rounds depending on time.  As I said, the duration of the meeting is limited.<\/p><p> I will move on to the witnesses.  I will begin with Mr. Herrick, who has been with us before and who is very welcome back.  I am delighted to have him with us again.

I thank the committee members for inviting us to be with the committee today.  As the Chairman has already indicated, I am joined by my colleague, Ms McLoughlin-Burke, who is procedural rights fellow with the ICCL.<\/p> <p>  As members of the committee will know, the ICCL is an independent human rights organisation which has played an active role in public discourse on matters of law, policy and human rights since its foundation in 1976.  In particular, our perspective is to ensure that Irish law and practice is compliant and meets the standards of the constitutional rights and the rights set out in international human rights law.  Our founders include the late Kader Asmal, professor of law at Trinity College Dublin, the late Mr. Justice Donal Barrington, a member of the Supreme Court, and Mary Robinson, former President of Ireland and UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, and the administration of justice has been a particular priority issue of the ICCL in its work.  In 2007, we published a report, Justice Matters, which was a comprehensive analysis of the issues of independence and accountability with regard to the Irish judicial system and we have made a number of submissions on the question of judicial reform over recent decades.<\/p> <p>  The judicial appointments process in Ireland has been a point of contention and controversy in recent years and the ICCL believes that a deficit in formality and transparency in the system has impacted on public confidence in the Judiciary.  In that context, we strongly welcome the proposals in the proposed Bill to introduce clear and transparent criteria by which appointments would be made, and we share the Government's stated objective of promoting diversity and ensuring that the Judiciary is one which is truly representative of the people of Ireland.  Although the ICCL recognises that the proposed Bill marks a significant improvement on the preceding appointment process, we are concerned that some of the provisions fall short of international best practice.  In preparing our submission on the proposed Bill, we relied on and referred to international standards derived from a number of treaties, including international human rights treaties, the European Convention on Human Rights and the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights.<\/p> <p>  Sorry, I believe there might be somebody speaking.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021061500002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Herrick"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":425,"content":"<p>I wonder if all of those not currently contributing could mute their microphones.

We have also relied on the UN basic principles on the independence of the Judiciary, the Council of Europe recommendations on the independence and efficiency and the role of judges, the European Charter on the statute for judges and the International Principles on the Independence and Accountability of Judges, Lawyers and Prosecutors.  There is a wide range of international standards from which to draw and which can inform the legislation.<\/p> <p>  On the question of independence and who should constitute the appointing or nominating body, the current proposals recommend that the Chief Justice, two members of the Judicial Council and the president of the court in which the vacancy arises will form part of the commission.  In line with international best practice, the ICCL recommends that the three suggested judicial members of the Commission should be elected by their peers in order to ensure the strongest possible transparency and independence.<\/p> <p>  The Judiciary must be representative of the society over which it adjudicates.  All appointments should take into account the fundamental importance of ensuring diversity and appropriate representation in the Judiciary.  This should be reflected in the criteria for appointment to all judicial posts.  Broadly speaking, we welcome the approach that is taken in the proposed Bill in this regard.  We recognise, however, that as the Judiciary is drawn from the senior members of both legal professions, it will not be possible to address the objective of achieving diversity without looking at the question of diversity among the senior reaches of the Bar and the solicitors' profession.<\/p> <p>  The process must be transparent.  The introduction of clear objective criteria based on merit is welcome.  However, the number of recommendations by the commission to the Government should be reduced, in our view, to three for one nomination and five and eight, accordingly.  We believe that we should minimise the discretion of Government in the process to the greatest extent possible to achieve the strongest level of public confidence.  We also believe that there is no justification for a separate process for the appointment of senior officers of the court - the Chief Justice and the presidents of the superior courts.  A separate system for such senior appointments which is more heavily politically dominated, and has a role, for example, for the Attorney General as a voting member, risks undermining the benefit of the general appointment process.<\/p> <p>  In order for the appointment process to maintain public confidence, there must also be some level of accountability.  Where there are welcome provisions here about a report back to the Oireachtas subsequent to appointments, we believe that where the Government decides to deviate from what is recommended by the Judicial Appointments Commission it should have to give reasons.  We are clearly recommending that the recommendations of the commission should include a ranking of candidates as well as a smaller number which will greatly enhance independence.  It should be noted by the committee that the proposed approach would, in fact, retain a discretion for Government to circumvent the Judicial Appointments Commission completely.  Bearing that in mind, it is very important that we strength the process of the commission.<\/p> <p>  The ICCL sees the proposed Bill as a radical and hugely welcome opportunity to improve the judicial appointment system process in Ireland.  If approached correctly, these changes can have the potential to enhance public confidence in both the Judiciary and the rule of law.  We make eight recommendations in our detailed submission which we believe can further enhance the approach being taken and we look forward to engaging with the committee and any questions the members might have on our submission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021061500002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Herrick"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":427,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Herrick for his concise and targeted opening.

The judicial appointments commission Bill is currently at an advanced stage of drafting.  The Government approved and published the general scheme of the Bill in December.  It was forwarded to a number of key stakeholders at that time, including the Judiciary and the legal professions, and a number of submissions were received.  I might focus on a number of principles that underpin the provisions in the general scheme.<\/p> <p>  There was broad acceptance of the need to update the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board arrangements, which were put in place via legislation introduced more than 25 years ago to deal with first-time appointment of judges.  There was also a recognition that the involvement of lay persons in the process should be increased, expanding the experience and knowledge brought to the process of selection.<\/p><p> There was a need to expand the remit of the advisory body to include promotions, or elevations, of serving judges, which now is addressed under an informal process for the appointment of serving judges.  The Judicial Appointments Advisory Board has no role in this.  In the programme for Government brought forward last year, it was determined that the process of appointing judges for the future should remain under the leadership and guidance of the Chief Justice, and a substantial judicial input in the process is advisable.  To support the new arrangements, the Government agreed that a small dedicated resource be established through an office under the supervision of the commission.  An important further principle, to which the previous speaker referred, was that merit will become the defining criterion for the selection of judges.  This should be expressed in statute, with regard to other key objectives, which the general scheme sets out.  It was also understood that the commission should be enabled to develop statements of judicial skills and attributes, as well as selection procedures, having regard to particular criteria.  This structured approach would allow the commission to further develop the requirements for judicial recommendation and selection.  A further point was that the constitutional position relating to the Government's function of appointing judges be maintained.<\/p><p> Regarding consultations, a public consultation process was conducted in 2014 focusing on questions relating to the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board process, independence of the Judiciary and related matters.  The outcome of those consultations is still informing the fabric of the scheme and the earlier forerunner Bill.<\/p><p> The Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, which was established on foot of the Court and Court Officers Act 1995, was a landmark development at the time, introducing a new, independent element to the judicial appointments process.  Article 35.1 of the Constitution provides that judges are appointed by the President.  Under Article 13.9, such power is exercisable and performable only on the advice of the Government.<\/p><p> As members will be aware, a key element underpinning the 2017 Bill, which remains in the general scheme, is the composition of the commission.  A significant change in this scheme compared with the previous Bill is that the Chief Justice will be the chairperson of the new commission and that there will be an equal number of laypersons and judges.  The Attorney General will also be a member.  The board has been chaired since its inception by the Chief Justice of the day and this ensures that the selection process is rigorous and meets the need for a strong, independent Judiciary.  I am sure we will go on to look more closely at the composition of the commission and members may have questions about that.  The lay contribution of the board is an important consideration.  The scheme makes reference to a number of areas of experience and knowledge that it is anticipated lay members appointed to the commission will have.<\/p><p> A key aspect of this Bill is that all judicial positions are covered.  The Bill replicates the 2017 Bill approach whereby all persons who wish to be considered for appointment to judicial office, including serving judges, will be required to apply to the commission.  At this time, the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board deals only with first-time judicial appointments.  For the elevation of serving judges from one court to another, there is no system at all in statute other than the constitutional process.  It would appear that it is no longer sustainable that there is no statutory process in place to address some of the most important appointments to any office in the State.  There is general acceptance that these arrangements should be updated in the manner envisaged in the planned Bill, in the interests of good governance, transparency and accountability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021061500002#B00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Condon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":430,"content":"<p>Before I call on members, I will start the ball rolling.  My first question is for the ICCL but Mr. Condon should feel free to answer if he wishes.  It strikes me that one of the deficits in the arrangements we have had for the past 25 years, since the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board was created, is that it appears to act as a sort of Garda vetting mechanism rather than an actual selection vehicle.  People have to go through the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board and get out the far side to be available for selection but it does not appear to have a role in prioritising, weighting or ranking candidates.  Am I right in saying that?  Within the confines of the constitutional framework, is that something that can be addressed outside of a referendum or would we need to go one step further and change the Constitution?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021061500002#C00200","speaker":"1583"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":431,"content":"<p>The Chairman summarised our perspective very clearly.  The Bill should be trying to achieve a shift from a system of vetting, in which candidates are simply excluded if they are unsuitable, to one in which candidates are actively selected and recommended.

Our preference is that the recommendation of the commission include a ranking of candidates in order of preference.  We note that some of the other experts who have been before the committee have also suggested an obligation to actively engage with candidates, including through interviews and so on.  That is an interesting recommendation but we are broadly coming from the same perspective.  We should be moving towards a more active selection and recommendation process.

It should be possible, however, to establish conventions and norms whereby the vast majority of appointments, if not all, are done through the process.

The 1995 Act sets out reasonably minimal criteria for that.  Nevertheless, however, it brought the involvement of three laypeople into what was a board of ten people at the time.  That board, of course, changed to 11 people when the Court of Appeal was established in 2014.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman will be aware, of course, that there was some question of having a lay majority within the 2017 Bill.  The provisions of the Bill set out a wide range of criteria that Government believes laypeople can bring to the process, whether it is experience of the courts, arbitration and mediation or administration and business.  I believe a wide range of perspectives are required to be captured on a board.  To be clear, the board has nine members.  It is actually an equality of laypersons and judges because there will be four judges and the Attorney General.  There will not, therefore, be a majority of laypersons but an equal number of laypersons and judges.<\/p> <p>  It is fairly consistent, for want of a better way of putting it, with nearby jurisdictions, which have strong and positive lay involvement.

It does not have a lay majority, which was proposed the last time around.  It introduces the Judicial Council as a source of nominees into the Judicial Appointments Commission.  That change alone to the Chief Justice chairing means there are a network of consequential amendments in the Bill, which would probably be a bit too detailed to go into.  They are there, however.  A lot of change is required.<\/p> <p>  On top of that, we have been looking at a number of other issues.  I believe I am free to say that since the scheme was passed, like any drafting process, a number of things were required to be fleshed out.

However, the Attorney General would very much be the Government of the day's person on the board.  That, to me, reflects a problem.  If we think about it, that means the Attorney General will be there from the very beginning of the process right through to being at the Cabinet meeting at the very end of the process.

In that context, the Attorney General has been retained.  He has been retained on the commission with no vote, however.

Would he acknowledge that is an important part of the judicial appointments process?  Remarks have been made about bad habits of the past and things like that.  There is substantial evidence to support the notion that we have an excellent Judiciary that is functional, that abides by the rules of law and that delivers fairness, on the whole.  I am not saying that every judge is wonderful.  As a practitioner, I can say they are not.  Overall, however, we have a corpus of judges who are good, reliable and fair.<\/p><p> Mr. Herrick spoke about giving reasons for deviation from the recommendations of the commission.  In general, I think there is an absolute basis for that but, in practice, there is a real difficulty.  Ranking candidates is all very well but asking the Government to publicly explain why it has chosen one candidate over another will create substantial problems from the point of view, in particular, of the unsuccessful candidate because it results in an official declaration of what the Government sees as the inadequacy of a candidate which could be damaging to that person professionally.  In the whole process of the appointment of judges, the confidentiality of applicants is paramount because many practitioners who are qualified and who would make excellent judges would never apply if they thought applications, particularly unsuccessful applications, were going to be made public because it would massively damage them within their profession and in the context of their ability to continue in their profession.<\/p><p> Deputy Martin Kenny referred to promotion from lower to higher courts and Mr. Condon has spoken about merit as a criterion.  All of that makes sense but I wonder is that not a tremendously subjective criterion?  There are many fine legal practitioners, solicitors and barristers who turn out not to be very good judges.  While an element of knowledge and experience in the litigation process is extremely important, I wonder can any of our guests tell us what constitutes the definitive criteria for what makes a good judge?  That is a difficult thing on which to settle.  In the past, there has always been a practice not to promote judges from the District Court to the Circuit Court or from the Circuit Court to the High Court because there was a danger that it would incentivise a particular judge to behave in a certain way.  If a judge is focused on promotion rather than doing the right thing or rendering the right decision, it potentially compromises that individual in his or her ability to do the job as opposed to climbing the ladder.  I wonder if our guests have anything to say about that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021061500002#D01400","speaker":"1685","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":453,"content":"<p>On the first question asked by the Senator, it is clear that the proposed approach retains an absolute discretion for the Government to make appointments to the bench without any reference to the Judicial Appointments Commission nominations.  It is for the committee and the Oireachtas, ultimately, to decide whether that is constitutionally mandated or not.  There is nothing in our submission that is in any way critical of the quality of the existing Judiciary; far from it.  It is absolutely the case that we have had the benefit in our constitutional history of a strong, independent Judiciary that has acted and exercised its functions with great honour.  That does not mean we should be complacent, however.  We need to be mindful of taking this opportunity to have the most robust and strongest process possible to anticipate all the potential changes that might happen in the future.  In that regard, I think there is nothing inconsistent in saying we have a strong, independent Judiciary now but we can have stronger processes in the future.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Martin Kenny raised the role of the Attorney General in his contribution and that touches on this matter.  There are clear concerns about the Attorney General having any role in the process.  To a large extent, the approach that is proposed by the Government addresses many of those concerns in the general appointment process by the Attorney General having a non-voting role.  However, we are presented with a significant difficulty when we have a separate senior appointment process for the Chief Justice and the presidents of the superior courts.  In those cases, the Attorney General not only retains a role but has a significant voting role as one of three.  That is probably the greatest weakness in the proposed Bill as it is currently presented.<\/p> <p>  With regard to reasons for deviation, Senator Ward made good points about the requirement for confidentiality.  It would be interesting to explore whether it is possible to balance what we are trying to achieve in terms of accountability with the confidentiality of applicants.  There are two different ways in which the Government may deviate from what is recommended by the commission.  One is to deviate from it in terms of the ranking of candidates which we propose.  A second method of deviation is to circumvent the proposed list entirely.  It is essential that there is some requirement on the Government to explain itself when it takes the latter course and possibly to work out whether it can achieve the ranking of candidates while balancing principles of confidentiality for unsuccessful candidates.<\/p> <p>  The Senator also asked about judicial training and the specific skills that are required of judges.  We must look at the Judicial Council Act and the proposed judicial appointments commission Bill in tandem.  The requirements in place under the Judicial Council Act in terms of ongoing training of the Judiciary will be a great resource to strengthen our Judiciary and allowing it to keep up with contemporary developments.  I do not think that objective will be achieved through the Judicial Appointment Commission Bill alone, it must be considered in tandem with the Judicial Council Act.  We are supportive of what is in the Judicial Council Act.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021061500002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Herrick"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":454,"content":"<p>I thank our guests.  Much of what I was going to say has already been covered.  I agree with Deputy Martin Kenny that if the independence of the commission is so important for the Government, I find it hard to see how that sits with the inclusion of the Attorney General, who is a member of the Cabinet and has been appointed by the Government of the day, in the decision-making process.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Herrick stated in his report that the knowledge requirements are inadequate.  I am glad to hear Senator Ward has experienced great judges over the years but, while most of the judges with whom I have dealt over the years were well trained, a few have been inappropriate or inadequately trained.  Should a practitioner have spent a year or two in criminal law before he or she starts to run trials?  Should a practitioner have similar experience in family law before he or she starts to hear family law cases?  I accept the point about ongoing training but just because someone has been a qualified solicitor or barrister for ten years does not necessarily mean that he or she has any idea what is going on in, for example, the criminal courts.  Does Mr. Herrick have any views on what specific training should be required?  One would not go into the commercial court without a knowledge of commercial law.  I heard what Mr. Condon said about a background in business and commerce but we should be exploring the possibility of appointing someone with a background in consumer protection, the Private Residential Tenancies Board, the equality commission, or a former prison governor who would have a great understanding of the people who are regularly attending before, for example, the District Court and the Circuit Court.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021061500002#E00300","speaker":"1488"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":455,"content":"<p>The last question was addressed to Mr. Herrick if he would like to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021061500002#E00400","speaker":"1583"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":456,"content":"<p>With the Chairman's grace, I will refer the question about the qualifications of judges to my colleague, Ms McLoughlin-Burke.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021061500002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Herrick"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":457,"content":"<p>In relation to-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021061500002#E00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Gemma McLoughlin-Burke"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":458,"content":"<p>Is Ms McLoughlin-Burke on mute?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021061500002#E00700","speaker":"1583"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":459,"content":"<p>I should no longer be muted.

I have one specific question to put to Mr. Condon regarding the scheme of the proposed Bill, which has been worrying me since the last occasions we discussed the general scheme.  It concerns head 9, which deals with the composition of the commission and which effectively states that there will be nine members of the commission. Subhead (1)(b) of head 9 contains the phrase \"a Court President being one of the President of the Court of Appeal, the President of the High Court, the President of the Circuit court or the President of the District Court, to be determined in accordance with subhead (2)\".  Subhead (2) states \"The member referred to in subhead (1)(b) shall, for the purpose of the determination of a recommendation by the Commission in respect of a judicial vacancy or vacancies in a court, [be] the President of that Court.\"  What we have there is a rotating membership to be shared among the presidents of courts.  One problem with this is that the commission has business other than simply considering candidates.  It has to make annual reports, lay down procedures, set out criteria of this various kinds and adopt statements and the like.  I have a major problem with saying that, for instance, the position will be occupied on a kind of rotating basis depending on the recommendatory business that is going on when there is other day-to-day business which has to be carried out by the commission, such as preparing reports for Government or Oireachtas committees, handling its relationship with the chief executive and making decisions on finance, recruitment, etc..  It is not clear how that particular head works if, for example, we cannot say at any one point that Mr. Justice Michael McDowell either is or is not a member of the commission for the purposes of all those ancillary matters.  That is a point I wanted to draw to Mr. Condon's attention.  More work needs to be done to remedy the position in this regard.  I ask Mr. Condon to come back to me on that point.<\/p> <p>  I echo what Senator Ward said.  When in government, one of the aspects of appointing members of the Judiciary is that it is not always based simply on the individual merits of an individual.  For example, one might decide that the Supreme Court needs to be made more liberal or more conservative, more pro-European or less pro-European, more pro-personal injuries awards being high or pro-personal injuries awards being low or whatever.  In the context of issues on that nature, a diversity of approach and philosophy is something which a properly appointing Government may consider to be a hugely important issue.  If there are three or four people in a row who all have the same view and the Government is of the view that the court is beginning to go in a particular direction and it is not happy with that, it is its democratic function to correct the position by making its own decisions.  We have a simplistic view of merit that one person is better than another on the basis of merit, but we also must have not simply the crude rationale of, say, having people who are representative of the community demographically or whatever else.  In addition, the Government has a very clear duty to ensure that the Supreme Court has a philosophical balance to it which the Government would want to ensure is maintained.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Condon and Mr. Herrick might grapple with another point I wish to raise.  The Attorney General is a constitutional officer.  He or she is the adviser to the Government on all matters of law.<\/p><p>It is quite possible for an Attorney General to look at the slate of candidates putting themselves forward for selection and come to the view that a judge-dominated commission is knocking on the head some kinds of people that maybe should have a look in.  One of the problems with the 2017 legislation was there was a bit of intellectual confusion as to whether the Government should know who was applying for jobs.  There was a huge problem with this issue.  The then Minister, Deputy Flanagan, did his best to rescue, from the extremes of Shane Ross's approach to the matter, some degree of common sense that the Government should know, by one means or another, what kind of people are being rejected.  If liberals are being rejected by the Judiciary on a consistent basis, somebody should be in a position to tell the Government that it seems to be replicating itself and that \"judgeitis\" has descended on the process.  Somebody should be in a position to report to the Government what kind of people are failing to get onto the shortlist.<\/p><p> The Attorney General has an important role of being the canary in the coalmine and being in a position to tell the Government, for example, that there are five really good solicitors or barristers who are constantly being turned down or that others are being preferred, and that he or she is worried about it.  The only way the Cabinet will be made aware of this is if the Attorney General has some sight of what is happening at the commission.  There is some merit to the Attorney General having this role and I throw that out there for consideration.<\/p><p> There is another point that arose in the context of the 2017 legislation.  Very frequently, when it is decided to appoint the President of the Court of Appeal to the Supreme Court or something of that nature, there are consequential knock-on vacancies in the Court of Appeal and the High Court.  One of the problems pointed out to the Minister at the time, Deputy Flanagan, was that there was a very clunky process whereby where a vacancy arises in this way, the entire process has to be started again to go hunting for somebody to fill that vacancy.  What happened when I was around was that three such appointments were made on the same day in a promotional appointment chain.  This is no longer possible because we have to start again and go back to each layer of the cake and conduct interviews for vacancies that arise.  There has to be some flexibility when a vacancy is created.  I really believe there should be a standing invitation to judges to state whether they want to be, for example, on the Court of Appeal.  Those that want to be should be considered as candidates semi-permanently and, likewise, other solicitors and barristers.<\/p><p> I am unhappy with the idea that the legal profession, which often sees an awful lot more of their colleagues than judges do and see how they really think and hear what they really say over cups of coffee, or over a drink for that matter, and how their brains actually function, very frequently are in a very good position to advise whatever commission we have that Joe or Josephine Bloggs is a bit ropey.  It is a mistake, therefore, to knock out some input from the people who see these colleagues on a daily basis.  The people who have been receiving rude letters from their solicitor or barrister colleagues for 20 years can say that a person is a bit of a header.  A judge might not realise this but it is a very valuable input.  Having served on the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, I know that the input from members of the Law Society and the Bar Council was sometimes very important in sounding a warning bell about somebody who looked brilliant on paper to the effect that there was a problem and that the individual in question was not as good as he or she sounded or looked.  There are discretionary issues such as this.<\/p><p> I throw these ideas out for consideration.  I am particularly worried about head 9.  I cannot understand how the council can have only nine members and that four of them will be rotating all the time.  If the council is supposed to have a continuous corporate existence and is to make decisions about annual reports, hiring extra staff, accepting the recommendations of the chief executive and all the rest of it, who will be a member on a day-to-day basis of the commission?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021061500002#F01100","speaker":"1669","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":473,"content":"<p>I thank Senator McDowell for his comments and his insights from his various roles.

The Senator will note from our submission that we do not recommend the Attorney General be excluded from participation in the commission.  We do think the provision that he or she be a non-voting member addresses some of the concerns.  There is a separate question, of course, about the potential appointment of an Attorney General as a member of the Judiciary and whether there should be an exclusion, which is a separate question.<\/p> <p>  The Senator set out very clearly a political and philosophical perspective on the potential role of the Government in the process.  He spoke about the concepts of correcting what might be the philosophical or ideological balance on the court.  I understand this point of view but we could easily counter it.  They are subjective concepts that can also be interpreted as an excess of political input in the process.  Overall, we clearly recommend a curtailment of discretion but a retention of some discretion.  With regard to how this balance is achieved, broadly speaking the approach taken strikes the balance quite well, when it is combined with accountability on the part of the Government once it has made decisions and has responsibility for the commission and how it exercises its functions.<\/p> <p>  The Senator made the point that it is essential the Government has sight of all persons who apply.  We understand the proposed scheme retains the provision that the Government will have sight of all applicants, which would be an important safeguard against what the Senator has suggested, that the commission tends to go in a particular direction.<\/p> <p>  On the question of whether the Government might have to start again, a chain is a very important practical concern.  Our understanding, and Mr. Condon might correct me on this, is that the scheme allows for the Government to anticipate a vacancy arising so it can act before the vacancy manifests, which I imagine would happen, for example, when a judge is going to reach retirement age or where the term of office of a senior officeholder expires.<\/p><p>The scenario outlined by the Senator might not be quite as grim as he depicted.  It might be possible for the Government to act in advance and put the appointment chains in motion before the vacancy would arise.<\/p><p> The point about the legal profession is well made.  It might be possible to address that in how the criteria for lay members might be set by the Public Appointments Service, for example, and whether there would be requirements for legal professional expertise within those criteria.  We note the comments made by the Bar Council and the Law Society in that regard but, overall, we think the balance is quite well struck as it is.<\/p><p> When we speak of diversity it relates to the profound problem of a lack of representativeness in the legal professions.  This was manifested as recently as yesterday with appointments to the inner Bar, for example, where, in the solicitors' profession, five women were appointed as opposed to nine men, and, on the Bar side, it was five women as opposed to 20 men.  There are problems with diversity even when it comes to the question of gender, not to mention, as matters stand, other questions of diversity.  It is appropriate that this proposed Bill would be used to try to address the issue, but it will not be possible to do so without also looking deeper into the processes and structures within the professions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021061500002#G00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Herrick","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":480,"content":"<p>It is lovely to see Mr. Herrick and I thank him for coming in.  On his final point, gender imbalance on the courts has been substantially remedied by political intervention since 2011.  That is notwithstanding what he said about the professions - a point well made, particularly when we look at the proportion of women becoming senior counsels every year.  However, there was political intervention to rebalance that in the courts.  The big concern with a judicially dominated structure, such as the one we are talking about, is the threat of judicial self-selection.  At our previous meeting, we talked about the great Australian judge, Michael Kirby, who was the first openly gay judge and who said he would never have been selected by his peers at that time.

These were specifically: UN basic principles on the independence of the Judiciary; the Council of Europe recommendation on the independence, efficiency and the role of judges, the European Charter on the statute for judges; and the principles on the independence and accountability of judges set out by the International Commission of Jurists, a well-regarded international non-governmental organisation.  We drew from those, so when we talk about best practice we are talking about existing standards.  To give examples, the UN basic principles refer to standards applying to the promotion and careers of judges, as well as their appointments being better dealt with by a selection body, at least half the membership of which should comprise members of the judiciary.  There is also reference in some of the standards to a preference for the judicial members of such a body to be elected by their peers.  That is where we are drawing it from.  As the Deputy knows, any recommendations we bring before the committee on any matter will be grounded on, and derived from, international standards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021061500002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Herrick"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":484,"content":"<p>Okay.  I want to go back to Mr. Herrick on some of that.  Those UN principles date from 1985 and 1999, but what Mr. Herrick does not include is a much more significant document, which is the Mount Scopus International Standards of Judicial Independence.  All the leading political scientists and legal theorists came together to draw up those standards, which specifically acknowledge the role of governments in circumstances where there are judicial selection boards.  I can send that to Mr. Herrick.  It is so important.  For example, the standards state: \"The recent trend of establishing judicial selection boards or commissions ... should be viewed favourably [of course we have that], provided that a proper balance is maintained in the composition of such boards [by] branches of [the] government\".<\/p> <p>  The UN standards, and all the others to which Mr. Herrick referred, particularly those of the Council of Europe, which deals with so many European career judge systems, are entirely different from, and not comparable with, the common law model.  The frame of reference is very different, especially when one looks at the judicial selection systems in Latin America and Russia, all of which are covered by UN standards.  These are very different democracies that have very different standards, completely different career models for judges and a very different role for politics.  In many cases, they are absent a constitutional democracy.  They must be set carefully against a real comparative analysis, which, of course, relates to advanced common law democracies and constitutional democracies.

My questions are as follows, if that is helpful.  Leaving the issue of standards aside, there is a question of independence regarding how interviews and promotions are conducted.

For example, and this is something that can be worked out in the eventual Bill, who is it thought should be interviewing prospective judges?  Will it be sitting judges of the courts in which they practice?  Who will it be and how would one go through a process in order to maintain, as my colleague Senator Ward noted, the independence of judges, against a selection process where there may very well be personality clashes and in the context of which a whole range of other things may arise?  How do we protect the independence of both the legal profession and judicial members in those circumstances?<\/p> <p>  The ranking situation is quite interesting because two totally different types of candidate can come through, with different practice backgrounds and very different skills.  If it was a question of ranking me against the Chair, for example, it is obvious that we are completely different people and are not necessarily comparable.  How does Mr. Herrick conceive of ranking people with very different skill sets and experiences?  Senator McDowell alluded to trying to achieve an overall balance on the court.

As we previously stated on more than one occasion, the ICCL is very clear that we have immense regard for the quality of the judges who sit on our courts now and for those who have sat on them over the years.  We do not think there is any incompatibility between believing that we get good results, by and large, from the current system but also wanting to improve and strengthen the system for the future.<\/p><p> On the specific question about how the judicial membership might be composed and how the questions and so on would be conducted, Senator McDowell has already asked questions about how the body corporate would be constituted.  I understand from Mr. Condon that it will be addressed in the Bill.  Our suggestion is that all the judicial members nominated by the Judicial Council and those acting on behalf of the appropriate court would be elected by all members of the Judiciary.  The thinking behind that is it would strengthen the authority and legitimacy of the idea of these people acting on behalf of all judges.  It would also avoid a potential danger - not one that we believe is manifest - of having a clique of the senior members of the Judiciary that would dominate the judicial input and that would not represent the Judiciary as a whole.  That is our suggestion on that point.<\/p><p> On the question of ranking, we are talking about a selection process.  No matter how it is constructed, it will involve choices and preferences.  There are two elements to what we suggest.  The first is ranking, which strengthens independence, and the other is reducing the number of names that goes to the Government.  The two should be seen as going hand in hand.  Both would make a contribution towards strengthening, and of course either could be done separately from the other.  Both would have the effect of strengthening the independence of the process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021061500002#H01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Herrick","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":493,"content":"<p>May I come in again?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021061500002#J00200","speaker":"1480"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":494,"content":"<p>Yes, although I want to allow Mr. Condon in again.

For example, we are mandating that it would take into account considerations of diversity, which, of course, cannot be considered just in terms of isolation of individual appointments and must be done in the round.  Similarly, we would have thought it possible under the current proposals for the commission to also take into account wider questions of balance as well.<\/p> <p>  It is probably difficult to make an overall assessment of the proposed approach until we see what procedures are ultimately agreed by the procedures committee.

Mr. Herrick has mentioned the international conventions, which are very important.  As far possible, we have attempted to have regard to international conventions and best practice.  The two that loom the largest are the Group of States against Corruption, GRECO, recommendations and the European Commission's view of our legislation.  It is important to say this scheme and the new Bill probably move much closer to what GRECO and the European Commission would like to see in one very important area, which is the composition of the commission itself.  That is important.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Herrick made a point about the election of judges.  I am not 100% sure about how that would be developed except that some of the nuts and bolts of the provisions are not absolutely finalised.  Looking at two Judicial Council nominees, there is a process within the council on how those members would be put forward.  That may involve some element of what Mr. Herrick is referring to.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Carroll MacNeill asked who will conduct interviews.  These are significant questions in how the eventual Bill will pan out.  There is provision for criteria and statements of qualification and procedures.  Some of the elements that those statements and approaches must have regard to include independence of the Judiciary.  There are some benchmarks around the concept of judicial independence where regard would be had when those statements on procedures and skills are produced.  I guess it will be members of the judicial commission who will conduct those interviews.  It seems a logical conclusion from the provisions as they have been developed to date.  We may have to wait to see what the commission produces.  It is required that after 12 months it should produce detailed documentation as to how the procedures are to be managed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021061500002#J00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Condon"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":498,"content":"<p>Deputy Carroll MacNeill made the interesting observation that while international comparisons are very useful and can be very informative, they have to be comparable.

I can give a practical example of the interview point.  There may be a very conservative Judiciary and a particularly difficult President of the High Court, for example.  Mr. Herrick may have been briefing counsel to try to advance civil liberties and the elements are constantly bashing up against each other.  The best senior counsels may be trying to advance civil liberties but there might be a clash between a person and the President of the High Court, who may then interview that person for a position on the High Court.  We must design systems for the worst in people and not the best.  We must try to protect the system against a nefarious influence, such as in that hypothetical example.<\/p><p>There was a point made on the retention of discretion.  The Government has absolute discretion from a constitutional point of view, and that is a necessary position for the read across under Article 13.9 of the Constitution about advising the President generally.  The practice with the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board has meant that there is absolute constitutional discretion but there is also the concept of political discretion.  As Mr. Herrick mentioned, this is the established convention, as it were.  The established convention is that the Government always - or with only one exception - has appointed judges from the list of recommended candidates from the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.  That exception was Mr. Justice Frank Clarke, who became Chief Justice.  Where it was not done, it had to be published in <i>Iris Oifgi&uacute;il<\/i>.  He is the only exception I am aware of.  There is a political convention as well as one relating to the overall constitutional point.<\/p><p>What is the discretion within that, given that this is already the case and the Government has never deviated from it?  If the point is that the Government is retaining sufficient discretion, how is that moving at all?

One might equally point to the worst possible scenario in a politically dominated system, where an excellent lawyer who has been particularly critical of the State or represented persons that a particular Government might have a particular distaste for.  That is at least, I suggest, as great a danger as the scenario the Deputy outlined.<\/p><p>Currently, we have a system that is largely lacking in transparency and we are talking about replacing it with a model which will have checks and balances because there will be multiple actors and constituencies represented on the primary decision-making body.  There will be accountability, in the model we propose at least, whereby there will be reasons given.<\/p><p> On the second question, to say that recent Governments have abided by a convention may very well be true but that convention has been a system whereby the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board gives to Government a very long list of potential names for each particular post.  That still affords the Government very broad discretion.  The Government has abided by the convention but the convention has very broad discretion built into it.  This leaves open the risk of either political appointments or the perception of political appointments.

We have already had a good and comprehensive engagement.  There are 25 minutes remaining.  We will have to wrap up then but we may not require that time.  I will begin the second round of the questions.  There will be some latitude because we have covered many points.  We will not stray too far from the agenda but we can touch on wider topics.  My question is for both witnesses.  I am interested in hearing their responses.<\/p> <p>  The general scheme relates to judicial appointments and how people get  on the Bench.  We have had some discussion on how people will move from a lower Bench to a higher Bench, as it were.  Aside from the appointment process, I do not think judicial regulation, conduct, management or sanction, if appropriate, come within the scope of the proposed Bill, but I am not sure whether that exists, what format it takes or what process is in place.  There are two scenarios where that can unfold.  One is what has been  documented considerably certainly last year but also occasionally in the past where there has been what was considered to be judicial conduct off the Bench which was considered at times to be not appropriate or the subject of public comment, which certainly did not help anyone's cause.  There has been significant comment on that.  I hesitate to use the term \"judicial misconduct\" but there can be scenarios of problematic conduct by individuals on the Bench.  I do not mean decisions being made which a Government, a politician or even the public may agree or disagree with.  I mean standards of behaviour which, in other contexts, might be seen as workplace bullying.  It is very much the exception rather than the rule because the vast majority of academics, all the reports and even practitioners would say that they all perform impeccably.  Such issues can arise, however.  There are behaviours off the Bench which can be problematic but there are also such behaviours on the Bench.  I do not mean in terms of which side a particular judge comes down on but more how they execute that function.  It may be the case in any role when one is elevated at a certain point and is not answerable to anyone that bad habits or certain modes of behaviour can creep in which go unchecked for long periods and, in an even worse scenario, be exacerbated.  I am not sure whether there is anything in place to temper that.  I do not know, for example, whether there is a complaints process or any mode of regulation or mitigation.  If not, should there be and what might that look like?  Mr. Herrick might respond first and then Mr. Condon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021061500002#K01000","speaker":"1583"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":511,"content":"<p>The matters to which the Chairman refers are dealt with now by the Judicial Council and its conduct committee.

On behalf of the committee, I am delighted to extend a warm welcome to our witnesses from the Office of the Ombudsman for Children, Dr. Niall Muldoon, Ombudsman for Children and Ms Nuala Ward, director of investigations.<\/p> <p>  On behalf of the committee, I thank Dr. Muldoon for his report, No End in Site: An investigation into the living conditions of children on a local authority halting site, which was published in May 2021.  The report is hard to read, especially when one hears the testimony of the children about their living conditions.  <\/p> <p>  The committee is concerned that if Traveller community accommodation is not addressed satisfactorily then Traveller health, education and employment will also suffer.  The committee has received letters from primary school principals about the difficulties faced by Traveller children that has been made worse by Covid-19.<\/p> <p>  We can see from the report that poor accommodation is having a detrimental effect on Traveller education.  If Traveller community children today do not get a chance of an education, then another generation will suffer the same fate as many of their parents.  The committee is very interested in the ombudsman's report, his recommendations and his plans to look for six-month and 12-month updates from local authorities, which is particularly important.  The committee is looking at the role of local authorities in the provision of housing, particularly halting sites for Travellers.  The report, in terms of the halting sites, will be of great help to the committee.<\/p> <p>  I suggest that Dr. Muldoon makes an opening statement that lasts between five and ten minutes.  Then each member will have the opportunity to ask questions and they will have about five minutes for questions and answers.  However, members may come in a second and third time, as appropriate.<\/p> <p>  I invite Dr. Niall Muldoon, Ombudsman for Children, to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021061500002#A00575","speaker":"1575"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":527,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to appear and discuss my report, No End in Site.<\/p> <p>  As members of the committee are aware, the Ombudsman for Children&rsquo;s Office, OCO, is an independent statutory body, which was established under the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002.  As the OCO has two core statutory functions, namely, to promote the rights and welfare of children under 18 years of age, and to examine and investigate complaints made by, or on behalf of, children about the administrative actions of public bodies, schools or voluntary hospitals that have, or may have had, an adverse effect on a child.<\/p> <p>  The report was initiated because a Traveller visibility group and the local Traveller women&rsquo;s network came together and contacted the office in 2018 about conditions at a local authority-run halting site where 66 children and their families were living.  Eleven families then came forward and made complaints about the following: a persistent problem with a high rate of childhood illness caused by living conditions; a lack of safe play areas for children; the fact that housing applications were not being progressed; rodent infestation; inadequate sanitation; extreme overcrowding; safety concerns about access to a site; illegal dumping nearby; inconsistent and inadequate waste disposal; and inadequate heating systems and unsafe electrical works. <\/p> <p>  The OCO met families and visited the site on three occasions.  In total, approximately 140 people were using toilets and washing facilities that had been designed for 40 people, which the residents say has led to stress, tension and, at times, conflict.<\/p><p>During our investigation, the HSE director of public health nursing told us that the children living on this halting site suffer from skin conditions and respiratory problems at a much higher rate than the local or general population.  The chief fire officer told us that there are frequent call-outs to the site.  We met with 17 children who told us that they feel different to their peers due to the standard of conditions on the site.  One 12-year-old girl said, &quot;walking up to school you see all the rats ... they would be running up and down the walls of the trailer&rdquo;.  A 14-year-old girl said, &ldquo;people ask why I&rsquo;m dirty, but I&rsquo;d be ashamed to say.  I don&rsquo;t want to say it was from walking out of the site&rdquo;.<br\/><br\/>The conditions we found on the halting site in question were deplorable.  To think that children in Ireland in 2021 are living like this is utterly shocking.  Under no circumstances can this be accepted or allowed to continue.  Our investigation acknowledged the hard work done by the local authority and the difficult circumstances in which its staff sometimes found themselves.  Ultimately, however, we found that the local authority failed to consider the best interests of children, did not maintain the site and housing applications were not processed or were incomplete.  This meant that some families may have missed out on homes and may have remained on the list longer than they needed to.<br\/><br\/>The local authority also did not account for the disadvantage experienced by Travellers.  We made a series of recommendations and we called for these to be overseen from the top, by the CEO, to ensure that the changes happened.  Our recommendations seek to improve conditions for children living on the site in the short term, and to bring about long-lasting systemic change in how Travellers are treated by the local authority.  This was a long and difficult investigation for the families involved, the Traveller advocacy groups and the local authority in question.  The paralysis in the system cannot continue.  I very much welcome the commitments made by the local authority to implement these recommendations and, in particular, the expressed commitment by the CEO to ensure that the necessary actions occur.  I will be seeking regular updates from the local authority on the progress it has made in implementing our recommendations and how the lives of children have improved.<br\/><br\/>On 27 May, an editorial piece in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>stated that this report &quot;shines a light on a grave problem that too many arms of the State wish to ignore&quot;.  That is the big issue for our office now.  It is not the follow up of this report, but the fact that so many other sites have come to light and that nearly every local authority could be held to account in the same manner as the one in this case.  In light of that, we have taken a number of steps, including writing to An Taoiseach and all leaders of political parties, because we believe the time has come to, once and for all, eradicate the racism and discrimination in our local authority planning system that allows children to grow up in standards that were abolished for the rest of the Irish population more than 50 years ago.<br\/><br\/>On 26 May of this year, the Taoiseach stated in the D&aacute;il:<\/p><blockquote>\tMy understanding ... is there have been lots of different initiatives and plans produced over time but they have not brought a resolution.  The consequence of that failure to get a resolution to a lot of the issues is children living in absolutely unacceptable conditions in terms of health, hygiene, quality of life and so forth.  It is absolutely unacceptable and the local authority will have to move decisively now in response to the ombudsman&rsquo;s report. <\/blockquote><p>I have called on each political leader to instruct their representatives on local authorities throughout the country to vote for progress on Traveller accommodation.  No excuses should be accepted for blocking progress in the provision of Traveller accommodation or for failing to fully utilise the ring-fenced funds.  I have also asked the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to be much more proactive in the monitoring of spending in this area.  It is the only budget that is routinely not spent and the Minister must see to it that such underspends are not allowed to happen and if they do, there must be a serious oversight and audit of the workings of that local authority.<br\/><br\/>I urge all members here on this committee to back that call so that this group of citizens and rights holders can begin to benefit from proper, safe and secure housing for the first time in many generations or perhaps for the first time ever.  We are also planning to hold a seminar in July and invite all the relevant staff in local authorities.  We believe that there is a window of opportunity to change the narrative in this area away from one of blame and accusation, and redirect it to properly focusing on the accommodation services we are providing to the children of our nation.  I thank the committee again for its invitation and for members' time.  My colleague, Ms Ward, and I are happy to take questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021061500002#A00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Muldoon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":529,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Muldoon for his submission, which was very much to the point in dealing with a very serious issue.

I have studied this report very carefully and, even though I have been around a long time in politics - 35 years in total - I am very shocked by it.  I spent 22 years as a county councillor before I became a Seanad&oacute;ir.  I had a reasonable amount of involvement with the Travelling community in Kerry, and especially in my home town, with 99% of it being extremely positive.  Clearly, there are serious issues highlighted by Dr. Muldoon in this report that we, as a committee, will address seriously and bring forward.  I will not hog the meeting, but I will make a few points and I have one or two questions.  Unfortunately, this meeting clashes with the children's committee meeting, which relates to the burials, a very sensitive and important matter, and I will have to leave early to attend that.  That meeting starts at 1 p.m. in private session.<\/p> <p>  What is shocking is the health situation of the whole community in that halting site and, in particular, the health of the children.  I need not go over all the details - they are horrific.  I will target one health issues that is probably the most overlooked, which is the psychological health of those children and the sense of shame they have when they go to school.  When they go out into the wider community, they have a sense of shame about the way they are dressed and their lack of sanitation, because they do not have an opportunity to wash and so on.  I was a teacher, as was my wife, in a special school for the Travelling community for many years.  We would be familiar with that issue but not to the extent that it is highlighted in the report.  I can see that this is clearly something which must be addressed.<\/p> <p>  Another issue is the that of the tragedies which, naturally, come to mind when one reads this report.  I refer to sites where there have been serious fire incidences and terrible tragedies.  All the ingredients seem to be here, and it was just by the luck of God that no catastrophe occurred at this site in the context of the electrics.  The list of issues includes things like no working smoke detectors, badly fitted stoves, the electrical system being overloaded, etc.  It is a complete fire hazard.  They are the two issue I would focus on - the psychological health of children in particular and the fire hazard.<\/p> <p>  On a more critical note, Dr. Muldoon pointed out that this halting site was originally established to house 12 bays.  Before long, it seems there were multiples of that number at the site.  He does not go into detail as to how that situation arose.  I presume it happened incrementally.  Was it not being monitored by the council?  Were the residents, in any way, culpable of inviting or accepting, perhaps, relatives and friends on to the site?  We need to look at that a bit more because it is a critical point - that site was never intended for that number of people.  I know the circumstances that pertained to people who came in and probably felt aggrieved by the housing allocation system and the housing priorities of that council, and so on.  However, this must be highlighted.  Perhaps the council are to blame, or other agencies, for how it developed.  I want to know over what length of time this developed.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the points noted by Dr. Muldoon that council staff and outside contractors were reluctant to go onto the site, that they were, perhaps, even in fear and that garda&iacute; had to be used as moderators or mediators once or twice.  That was regrettable but I am sure there were two sides to the story.<\/p><p>Why was that situation allowed to develop?  I presume these people were coming in to do good work, to fix the electrics and do the plumbing.  Why should there have been resistance to them on-site?  Is there something we are not getting there?<\/p><p> I agree with Dr. Muldoon that it is a disgrace that certain local authorities will not even use the ring-fenced budget they get for Traveller accommodation.  Under no other heading or programme would a county council be returning money, and they would be screaming for more on every single issue.  As a committee, we discussed this in private today.  We are awaiting reports from all of the various local authorities to justify their position on that, and we will be working on it ourselves.  I engaged with the chief executive officer of Kerry County Council, Moira Morrell, and her senior housing staff in preparation for this meeting, and they presented me with a very comprehensive report, which I will not go into now but which I will be happy to lay before the Chairman and the committee.  Not to be parochial, Kerry seems to be doing more than its share, or at least an equal share, and I am proud to be able to say that.<\/p><p> I know Dr. Muldoon and Ms Ward investigated this one issue in great detail, and well done to them both.  Do they think this is typical?  Is this standard procedure?  Can we imply and take forward from this report that this type of thing is going on all over the country, in the cities of Dublin, Galway and Cork, and in our rural towns and communities as well?  Perhaps there is a much bigger scandal to be gone into.  Again, I welcome both witnesses and I congratulate them.  I regret that I have to go to an equally important meeting but I will carefully study their responses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021061500002#B00300","speaker":"1694","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":532,"content":"<p>I point out that Ms Nuala Ward is attending, not Ms Helena Collins.

I want to comment on a couple of points.  He has hit the nail on the head in that this concerns the psychological health of the children as much as the physical health.  I note from the last open meeting we had that a witness, Bridget Kelly from the National Traveller Women's Forum, said that infant Traveller children are 3.5 times more likely to die in the first year.  When we see conditions like this, we can see why.  We have been told that respiratory conditions are an issue right from the start so, again, they are being set up for long-term health issues.<\/p> <p>  When we talk about the psychological side, as a nation that is one of the top nations in Europe financially and is trying to be one of the leaders of the world in many ways, we try to teach our children to be confident, to be strong, to stand up for things and to learn about life in a safe and stepwise manner.  However, all that these children are hearing all of the time is negative, abuse, racism and put-downs.  Again, the accommodation where they start is important.  Maslow's hierarchy of needs refers to the need for shelter and for a first safe, secure place.  If people do not have that, they do not feel safe, they do not feel secure, they do not feel that is where they can retreat and be comfortable, safe and warm.  Everything else falls apart from there, and it becomes much more difficult to thrive and survive in the way that we want our children to do.  I agree that that really is a starting point.  If we can get safe, strong, affordable accommodation for this population, as is their right, then we would change enormously their projection into the future and, as was said, the impact on education and employment.<\/p> <p>  The fire risk is clear.  Unfortunately, in my first year as Ombudsman for Children, I attended one of the wakes for the children in Carrickmines.  It was horrific.  To think that could still possibly happen anywhere in the country, after all the work that has been put into it, is scary.  Hopefully, it will never happen again, but we seem to be creating conditions that could allow that to happen.<\/p> <p>  Is this typical?  One of the things we can do in our office is to carry out systemic investigations, for example, if one case leads to something that might change systems.  In this situation, we felt it was better to do a strong job on an individual authority and take the lessons from there.  The committee will have seen already the feedback to this report, and it probably struck us even more than we expected.  There are probably examples in every local authority area and there are various different elements.  Whether it is the overcrowding, the hygiene or the poor administration of housing applications, it is probably happening all over the country.  As to whether it is typical, it is certainly not an outlier, I would say, from what I can understand and the feedback I have got from different organisations.  That said, this is why we want to use this investigation as an opportunity to change, and as a starting point for local authorities.  We worked very hard with that local authority to say that we are not trying to hammer it but that we are trying to find a way to make things different and to change things.  That is why we will stay engaged over the next six to 12 months, and longer if necessary.<\/p> <p>  I will pass over to Ms Ward to talk about how the population increased from ten bays to 40, and also about the outside staff as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021061500002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Muldoon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":534,"content":"<p>This site opened up in 1989 and there was no formal means of allocating the bays to anybody.  It is very important to put the historical context on this.  Over time, families grew and nieces and nephews, children, sons and daughters moved into the site, like any other village or townland in Ireland.  What we were really concerned about is that, because the chronic overcrowding had been going on for so long, we would have expected a robust method of allocating social housing or other sites to people who live there as a very straightforward means of addressing overcrowding, but that is not what we found.  That was a very serious concern to us.  As the committee knows, overcrowding is a key contributor to all the other issues that Dr. Muldoon has identified in regard to the health and well-being of children.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the contractors, this is a critical point.  Information was given to us that, for example, there was one electrical contractor who was unable to gain access to the site.  When we looked deeply at that, looked at the minutes and cross-examined everything, we realised it was just one individual on the site who was causing the difficulties.  All the other people on the site were extremely upset that they suffered the consequences because of this one individual.  They were querying why garda&iacute; were not called and why something was not done in regard to that one individual&rsquo;s behaviour that impacted on everyone else.  When committee members read through the fine detail of the report, they will see that.<\/p> <p>  That is why Dr. Muldoon mentioned the paralysis.

As can be seen from our report, that did not happen.  The legislative basis for the Traveller accommodation plan was to address the discrimination that Travellers experience in relation to meeting accommodation needs in Ireland.  The failure to meet the basic minimum legislation requirements in this regard is a key contributor for why this overcrowding was left year on, year on, and its impact on children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021061500002#C00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Nuala Ward","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":538,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Muldoon and Ms Ward.  I sat on a local authority in Galway for a very short period.  One of the most shocking things to me was the treatment of Traveller communities by local authorities.  Some of the things in this report do not come as a surprise to most people who have been active in their communities or have been councillors.  It is one of the greatest shames in some ways.  Galway City Council routinely returns funding year after year.  The local Traveller consultative committee did not sit for a number of years either.  Even if Traveller accommodation plans are put in place, to what extent are they really consultative if one fails to bring everybody together?  At private meetings we have discussed the various things that might be part of Traveller culture, such as horses.  If we are really looking at accommodating the Traveller community we must also look at accommodating the lifestyles of Travellers.  The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child is not only about provision of housing, as the witnesses rightly point out is the bedrock of Maslow's hierarchy of needs but it is also about the provision of adequate housing.  I would argue that means it has to be a home and that it has to be something that reflects the culture of that particular section of society.  In all those things local authorities across the country are failing.  Hearing the words of children is what really brings it home to adults.  There is no excuse for not going into a site and addressing issues on the basis of one or two adults who are difficult because children have rights in our Constitution quite apart from adults.  One can be quite sure that they were not the ones creating the difficulty for the Garda or the local authority to come in and sort out the problems.  On the one hand, I do not want to be too hard on local authorities but I do think it is important.  As a public representative, we have a huge challenge that unelected people are making decisions a lot of the time.  We have one of the weakest local governments in Europe and that also has to be addressed.  There are problems around councillors voting against accommodation and an awful lot of political parties are involved in doing that before anyone puts up their hand and says it is the Government, it is not.  Everyone has to take responsibility for that, particularly the largest parties who wield a lot of power in those local authorities.  I do not want to be overly political in that sense but everyone needs to step up.<\/p> <p>  First, is enough done to change the behaviour of the local authorities or is it valuable to do this kind of reporting on other sites across the country?  I know of places in Galway, for instance, where there are rats.  It is not the fault of the local population.  They have been crying out for housing.  <\/p> <p>  Second, do the witnesses believe that prioritisation of vulnerable children is happening when social housing is being allocated?  Third, transitory sites do not seem to be happening around the country.  The sites that are supposedly there for transient families moving from place to place become permanent sites without all the facilities there for the children to get to school and so on.  There is an opportunity now.  There are a couple of Ministers who deal with this area.  There is the children's Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, and also the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien, who is in the Department of Social Protection.  They have been stepping up to the plate but this is a failure over decades and it continues to be a failure because of the operations of local authorities.  <\/p> <p>   Ms Ward explained well how somewhere that has ten bays moves to 40 bays.  We cannot go shutting things down.  Where do the families move on to?  There must be somewhere for families to move on.  One cannot simply come in with the strong arm of the law and leave children with nothing if there is no provision of social housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021061500002#D00200","speaker":"1693"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":539,"content":"<p>I appreciate the Senator's remarks.  A key thing for me is this opportunity to change things from now on.  That is why we wrote to the political leaders.  The Senator is right that the local councillors are the ones who have to start stepping up but they have to be whipped, if one likes, as they would in the D&aacute;il.  There has to be a statement from the top that says that they need to vote in favour of Traveller accommodation for the next five years or whatever it might be until we get this problem sorted.  We need to start stepping up and doing our duty which is legislated for - it is a statutory obligation in many cases.  The Traveller review from 2019 suggests a pause on the section 8 element of the Act, and that maybe something we do for five years, but the key is start pushing from the top so there is no room for manoeuvre at local councillor level and they have to follow the rules which allow for Traveller accommodation.  It will not solve everything completely but it will made a huge inroad to what is a relatively small number of people on the social housing list waiting to be moved on.<\/p> <p>  Like so many things, if one unblocks one element one starts to free up all the other areas.  The transitory sites are only being filled up because there are not enough proper sites and there are not enough opportunities for social housing.  As Ms Ward touched on, what I found shocking was the administration of social housing.  We had 11 families, that is all.  It took two and a half years to get the files together around social housing for those 11 families.  The administration is very poor.  If they were sorted out, clean, clear, we know one family was there 13 years and had not been moved on to social housing.  These sorts of things would not happen in the general population.  We need to ensure the proper administration is in place so that when there is an opportunity to move on a family it is taken and used.  There are many lazy myths put out by local authorities and councillors that people have been offered X, Y and Z and are not taking it.  In reality, when we investigated the 11 families, some who had been there over 13 years waiting, only eight offers were made.  Two were taken up and the others were refused, appropriately, because they were in different areas or whatever.  Eight offers in 13 years is not exactly moving fast or providing a way to unblock the dam.  One can see how overcrowding would happen there.<\/p> <p>  I will pass over to Ms Ward to talk about the allocation to vulnerable children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021061500002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Muldoon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":540,"content":"<p>The allocation was a serious issue for us as part of this investigation.

This area had a particular priority because of Travellers but, more importantly, it had a strong priority if there was severe overcrowding, which was causing a health and safety risk.  We also had a number of children who had learning difficulties and such on the site.  They ticked so many boxes in terms of priority and yet that was not reflected in the records we saw.

The ombudsman's report is a milestone from the point of view of where we are at in terms of Traveller accommodation.  These reports have been coming out for years.  We have had health and safety reports on that site, going back to 2011, in which the environmental officer said it was not fit for human habitation.<\/p> <p>  We cannot let this moment go, from the point of view of where the OCO established the scenario in all its difficulties, from the local authority to councillors and to society in general.  Some ten years ago, in Cork County Council, the local authority brought a proposal to extend the bays there but the councillors did not support that.  In many ways, that came from pressure from the community not to expand the bay there.  The witnesses' information to the committee will be important in respect of how we proceed in terms of Traveller accommodation.<\/p> <p>  Should section 24 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2002, which prohibits nomadism, be repealed?  Is the ombudsman suggesting it should be repealed and if that is the case, how should it be done?  The provision of the network of transient halting sites in each local authority area is exempted under the Planning and Development Act 2000.  Is that part of the witnesses' recommendation or are they focusing on this site and other sites?<\/p> <p>  The amendment to Part 8 in the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016 has to be amended to prevent political interference with Traveller-specific developments.  That is crucial.  I listened closely when Dr. Muldoon said he had called for the leaders to instruct or put a whip on their councillors to say they had to support Traveller accommodation.<\/p> <p>  I am also interested in the OCO's meeting with local authority staff, which is hoped to be a target for July.  That will be important in moving along.  I was on Dublin City Council from 2004 and without casting aspersions on any individual, it was difficult to get the Traveller accommodation unit there to do the work one wanted it to do.  We have a site in Dublin South Central's Labre Park.  Planning for the site started off approximately five years ago and barrier upon barrier has been erected continuously to prevent that site from being developed.  Cl&uacute;id had the authority to build on the site and put plans forward.<\/p> <p>  I welcome this report and it could be a game changer from the point of view of making a start, because one is talking about a site which only accommodated ten families and now has up to 40 families.  Where were those people supposed to go, if they were not getting accommodation anywhere else?  The only option they had was to stay on the site or live on the side of the road and then there would have been ructions about that as well, from the point of view of society.<\/p> <p>  The key thing is it came from the Ombudsman for Children, in terms of the conditions in which children were living on the site.  I hope we, as a committee, can represent Dr. Muldoon's report and try to develop that as a national strategy with regard to housing.<\/p> <p>  Would the ombudsman support the setting up of a national Traveller accommodation authority to implement the recommendations of the Traveller accommodation expert group?  It will be important the Traveller community is part of that authority, to proceed with sites all over the country.  We are only talking about a small part of the population.  Surely, if we can develop, through the local authorities, good, well-run and well-looked after bays, people would accept those as part of our communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021061500002#E00500","speaker":"1569"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":542,"content":"<p>I am not an expert on the planning laws and various elements of it.  When Deputy Joan Collins asked whether section 24 of the 2002 Act should be repealed, I cannot comment.  I am afraid I would not know enough about it.  I am aware of the Part 8 provision through the 2019 review.  I listen to the people and experts who know.  A review group was put in place by a group of experts.  It was accepted by the then Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy English.  It involved the NGOs and advocacy groups and they support the concept of suspending the Part 8 provision.  I can see the benefit of that, for a period of time.<\/p> <p>  That concept of political influence is part of local authority, but we have seen the impact in terms of blocking up and stunting the growth of many generations of Travellers, not just over five or six years.  There are three generations living on the site we investigated.  Again, 11 families came to us and they all want to be moved into social housing.  If they were given the opportunity to move, one would change out one third of the total number of people nearly immediately.<\/p> <p>  There is an opportunity to be taken here.  I will not suggest exactly what could happen but there is an expert review report in place which is only two years old and has been supported by all the advocate groups and NGOs.  With regard to national Traveller accommodation authority, the Deputy called this a milestone report.  I would hope this is a milestone report but in order for it to be so, we probably need to give a year for the local authorities to start showing they might change or do things differently, the Government to back them, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to come in stronger and challenge anybody who underspends and the system to be done differently.<\/p> <p>  If that is not working after 12 months, perhaps there is an opportunity for a new authority to be considered, that is, an independent authority which creates a focus on the children of the Traveller communities.  If we get it right for the children, everything else will follow.  That is the mantra we go with all the time.<\/p> <p>  We have to look at Covid-19.  In the past 14 or 15 months, the Government has acted with great wisdom in many cases, in brushing aside much bureaucracy which was not needed.  Can we do that in this situation?  The last set of witnesses before the committee two weeks ago talked about 2,000 families living in severe, dangerous situations.  Perhaps we can find a route to solving their problems, over the next four to five years, through adjusting things such as suspending some parts of the Act, giving more power to the CEOs or whatever way it needs to be done.  I am not quite sure exactly how it will pan out.  However, if the political will is there to do that, as there has been through Covid-19, to move things forward and emphasise the importance of the individual and families, there is a great opportunity here.  I hope this will be a milestone for all local authorities.<\/p> <p>  I will let Ms Ward answer on the meeting of the local authorities and what we are hoping from that point of view.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021061500002#E00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Muldoon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":543,"content":"<p>We are very much looking forward to this meeting with the local authorities.<\/p><p>We met representatives of various NGOs a couple of weeks ago because they are obviously also critical stakeholders.

It is really welcome that some of the local authorities have taken time to reflect.  It has been very powerful in fairness to the children who came forward.  The voices of the children seemed to have resonated with all the adults who have decision-making and policy-making powers.  We very much welcome that and we will reach out to them to see what more we can do.  <\/p><p> Hopefully the webinar will involve an open discussion.  We will share our findings and what those in the local authority told us.

Reading the report when it first came out brought me right back to Carrickmines and brought me back to my childhood.  I am now a 31-year-old mother.  I can only speak of the experience of the halting site where I was born and reared.  That halting site opened in 1967.  At the moment, its redevelopment is not even being looked at.  I was part of a big project for the redevelopment of the site.  Many of the children spoke about playing in the mud.  I was that young child, not having a safe place to play.  It just goes from generation to generation.  Dr. Muldoon rightly said that it will be the first time in history that there will be appropriate and safe accommodation for Traveller children.<\/p> <p>  While the focus of this report is on one halting site, I would like to thank Anne Burke, Breda O'Donoghue and others in the Traveller Visibility Group Cork for their help and the work they have done with that particular halting site.  I also thank Ms Ward and Dr. Muldoon for all the hard work they put into this report.  <\/p> <p>  Reading it again was very tough but its contents were very true.  I hope that something will change as a result of this report.  Ten people from within our community lost their lives and the local authority was not held accountable, nor was the State.  We do not want that in future for our young children going to school.  I was that young child going to school in the freezing cold, not having heating in the house.  Many Travellers live in caravans and trailers.  That is people's choice of home and it is a home.  People are looking for facilities.  <\/p> <p>  Two weeks ago, I spoke about Labre Park halting site where there was an outbreak of hepatitis A.  Many children ended up in hospital over the Christmas period and throughout January.  There was a small outbreak of coronavirus on the site at the same time.  How can it be acceptable for children from the Traveller community to get hepatitis A in this day and age and nobody is held to account for that?<\/p> <p>  One side of it is accommodation and the other side is education.  Children are being failed and Travellers, who are adults now, have been failed by the system but there are no consequences for it.  Nobody is held to account.  Nobody is saying that these children's lives matter.  I have a little girl who is 20 months old.  She is now in safe appropriate accommodation.  I am trying my hardest as a mother with really bad anxiety to get her past the age of two.  Every mother in the Traveller community fears their kids being under the age of two because we know there is still a danger of not being able to survive until they are over the age of two.<\/p> <p>  I could speak all day about the inequality.  Even on a Christmas Day people living in trailers come looking for water.  None of this is acceptable.  I have lived through this.  Most importantly, young children today are still living through it, not getting the right access to education.  They have the shame of going into school while not having the appropriate uniform and being labelled for that even though it is not their fault or their parents' fault.  It is down to the accommodation they are living in and the area surrounding it.<\/p> <p>  If the witnesses were to name their top three recommendations, what would they be?  Who should be held accountable?  Would this happen if this were children in the general population?  This is why we have child protection.  I am also a youth worker.  This is why we focus on the rights of the child and child protection.  Who should be held responsible for these failures that Travellers have had to live through for decades upon decades?<\/p> <p>  I stay in Labre Park for three days a week when I am actually feeling good and when I come up.  When my nephews, nieces and other children on the site fall, they are automatically brought to Our Lady's Hospital.  Their parents are questioned by social workers.  The mothers and fathers are terrified that their kids will be taken from them due to injuries and infections that are down to the living conditions at the sites and not getting the proper supports they need from local authorities.  <\/p> <p>  If this were to happen in the general population, who would be held accountable?  What would Dr. Muldoon recommend to the committee as the way forward?  Does the Ombudsman for Children intend to do any more of these reports?  I would support that.  The Irish Traveller Movement and Pavee Point, the National Traveller Women's Forum and other local NGOs would support the Ombudsman for Children to carry out more of these reports.  I am hoping this one is serious enough that the Government will take some action.  Who would be held accountable if it happened to a child in the general population?  That is one question the committee needs answered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021061500002#F00200","speaker":"1657"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":546,"content":"<p>This question is very important for the Senator.  The experience and passion she has for it are very clear.  She knows better than I do.  I come to it as an outsider trying to learn.  She asked who is held accountable.  We have a statutory obligation to look at the public services provided to children.  Where they fail, we hold them accountable.  Who is accountable?  It is the body or individual that is statutorily obliged, in this case the local authority and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  Those are the two that are accountable.  We send our reports to them.<\/p> <p>  We engaged with the local authority and we sent our reports to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and also the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  As the latter now has responsibility for diversity and integration, we feel there is also a role for him.  The Ministers are clearly accountable.  In addition, if the Senator asks who is the boss of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, it is the Taoiseach and the Government.  That is where the accountability is and that is why I have been engaging with them as much as with the local authorities.<\/p> <p>  We feel that we get more done if we engage with organisations and try to find a way to make things work and change things from the inside, rather than to use a stick, so to speak.  That is why we have a follow-up.  We could have finished this two years ago but we would not have had the support of the local authority when we did.<\/p><p>We engaged with it and asked how we could get this right.  We got the local authority on board to support us and to accept the recommendations.  We have a follow-up at six months and 12 months.  If there is a failure or I am not satisfied after 12 months, I have the option under the legislation to write a special report to the Oireachtas and ask it to take over from there.  That has not had to happen yet and I hope it will not happen in this case, but it is an option that is always available to us.  That is where the accountability lies.<\/p><p> As regards the recommendations, they are like children - we cannot choose one over the other, as I am sure the Senator knows as a mother.  We only make recommendations that are crucial.  We make important recommendations and I would hate to think that if we identified the top three recommendations, the local authority would sit back and not bother with the rest of them.  There is a statutory obligation to provide housing, so we have asked the local authority to audit the files for the 11 families with which we were engaged and to ensure those families have not been in any way failed in terms of the way their applications were administered.  We have also asked the local authority to look at all the family applications relating to the site and to create a timeline plan for provision of accommodation up to 2024.<\/p><p> Those are the recommendations that stand out for me but I would not say one is more important than another because it is also important to have sewerage, water and a playground.  Children have a right to play and I keep reminding many public authorities that play is not an add-on luxury; it is where children escape, have fun and leave everything behind them.  It is also where they learn how to climb, jump, take turns and escape real life.  It is crucial that they have a play area.  A simple thing such as a footpath to the nearest housing estate to allow them to get to school safely and cleanly is also important.  That is why I would hate to choose one recommendation over another.  They are all crucial.<\/p><p> On the question regarding investigations, we hope there will not be any more investigations but our job is to accept any complaint that is submitted and to consider it individually.  In the context of engagement with the local authority, as Ms Ward addressed, what I would like to do and may do after the meeting is to invite the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, to join us at that meeting.  That might make for a much more rounded meeting at which we can try to engage that so that everybody is talking together and there is no miscommunication.  That may be a way of preventing further investigations.  However, if people come to us, we will look at each case individually and see what happens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021061500002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Muldoon","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":548,"content":"<p>I echo the comments of Dr. Muldoon in respect of the recommendations.

There is St. Joseph's, which is a halting site that has been there for more than 20 years.  Half the site is in use but the other half is decommissioned.  The same is happening in St. Mary's.  We lost St. Mary's and St. Christopher's and they have not been replaced in terms of accommodation.  As regards St. Margaret's, I do not know how many people I met regarding plans to expand that site in Ballymun but it still has not happened.  That has been going on for well over five years.  That is how seriously accommodation is taken by the local authorities.  On the Ratoath Road, the Gavin family is living with no water.  There are 14 men, women and children with no water in a Covid situation.  In fairness, they are being supplied with water by Fingal County Council, the local authority.  However, it is just unacceptable.  They had water but it was disconnected and they have not been linked up subsequently.  It is an absolute scandal.  That is what I have experienced in my area.<\/p> <p>  What penalties have the local authorities suffered in consequence for this?  We certainly need an overview of all of it.  There should be a group to oversee it, such as a national Traveller group, which would include our guests and many others.  That needs to be put in place because if the problem is so widespread in my area, I hate to think what it is like in other areas.  The report is so damning that one could probably identify many places where there are similar problems.<\/p> <p>  Many Traveller children in Finglas and Ballymun are in DEIS schools.  Education and getting people up to a high standard are so important.  <\/p> <p>The number of people from the local Traveller community who are coming to me seeking housing is very worrying.  Many of them are now being forced into getting HAP or going into local authority housing.  We are talking about Travellers being nomads and having their own culture, yet this is happening on a big scale.  The community is breaking down in many ways.  We should not allow that to happen.  If people want to stay in their community, we have to try to keep them in that community.  In the context of the mental health of these children and other members of the Traveller community in general, it is very important that we keep them within their own communities and we provide accommodation.<\/p> <p>  I have seen so many reports through the years and dealt with so many different issues.  It is actions that are really needed.  We need to push local authorities and change the mindset of many in local authorities, as well as local people and politicians, who are blocking progress, which is unacceptable.  I do no know what the ombudsman can do in terms of pushing this issue.  How does one push it?  Does one have to get onto a committee, as suggested, to oversee this issue?  Do we have to start identifying problems place by place or county by county?  Do we look at each place and figure out the way in which local authorities are dealing with the Traveller community in general?  Is that the best way to do it?

He has identified several areas where he believes the same issues are arising.  I cannot argue with that.  That is why we hope this will be a trigger event rather than a one-off report.  It should be the start of something.  It is not our role to follow through at the level proposed by the Deputy in terms of getting involved with the authorities or accommodation.<\/p><p>Our job is to present this report to the Oireachtas and to make sure that the political and governmental systems takes over.  That is why we are pushing this with the political leaders.  As mentioned by Deputy Ellis, action is needed to change the mindset of the local people and the politicians.  The best way to do that is to have success, that is, to successfully move Travellers into the right systems, the right housing and the right safe, secure accommodation for the Travellers, which integrates well with wherever they need to be and provides for that nomadic lifestyle the Deputy spoke about.  Whether the local authority with which we are engaged is to create a successful template that others can only or it is the first of many in a national initiative that is fine, but as previously stated by the former rapporteur for child protection, Dr. Geoffrey Shannon, in regard to Ireland, we have some of the best legislation, policies and procedures but we suffer from implementation disorder.  As I see it, the legislation is strong and clear but the politicians are ignoring it.  They are bypassing it.  They are using the one piece, the veto under section 8, that allows the planning to be blocked.  This is providing an opportunity for people to block progress.  We need to look at that.  The mindset will be changed if we can get a successful move in the right direction for a number of areas and start using them as examples.  That will really make a difference.  <\/p><p> The Deputy mentioned the DEIS schools.  A great many schools are working hard to provide opportunities for these children.  I have met many young Traveller children, in particular the girls, who are bright as buttons and as sharp as can be.  They told me of restricted timetables and teachers telling them that nothing much is expected of them because they will leave school when they are 12.  These children have ambitions that are not being fulfilled.  They want to be doctors, lawyers, nurses and so on.  The mindset of people around them stifles them as well.  If we can make progress on accommodation, all of the other areas will start to grow as well and all of the opportunities will begin to broaden out in front of those children.  We will be pushing hard for this particular investigation to be successful and for the recommendations to be fulfilled, which we hope Members of the Oireachtas can then use to drive forward overall change for the next five years.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021061500002#G00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Muldoon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":554,"content":"<p>Given the hour, I will try to be brief.  I join in the welcome to Dr. Muldoon and Ms Ward.  I also welcome the report, No End in Site.  Our aim and aspiration is to have action now on this matter and for this parliamentary term to be remembered as the term in which the question of Traveller accommodation was properly taken on.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Muldoon mentioned that he will engage in follow-up meetings.  I understand his remarks on the importance of implementation.  I agree that the process should be consultative and that we should try to coax people towards achieving results using the carrot rather than the stick until such time as the stick is required.  Should the need for the stick arise - we pray that will not be the case - Dr. Muldoon will bring a report to the Oireachtas.  I should, perhaps, know the answer to the following question, but what is the limit of the statutory obligations or powers of the Ombudsman for Children?  If a report is presented to the Oireachtas, does this then become a discretionary matter for the Oireachtas?  Does the Oireachtas have anything more than a moral obligation to act on Dr. Muldoon's findings?  I ask Dr. Muldoon to outline the law around that as I am sure people watching online might also like to know that.  <\/p> <p>  The case has been well made by so many.  All children must have play areas.  This is fundamental to their development and growth.  They must have proper housing, healthy housing conditions and housing that is no different to that of anybody else.  These things should be a given in this century in light of the level of resources available.  It has to be our ambition and aim to achieve a set of actions that bring this about.  I wish Dr. Muldoon and Ms Ward well in their coaxing process.  I would welcome a response on where they can go with the stick if the carrot fails.  Were the public to bring pressure on the various elected representatives that would have an implication too, but that is probably not likely in the short term and so we do need to deal with it this way.  <\/p> <p>  I welcome the report.  We need to ensure it is implemented.  If there is any way that we can fit into the process, including by way of direct engagement, we should do so.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021061500002#H00200","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":555,"content":"<p>I thank Senator O'Reilly.  On the limit of our statutory obligations, we can make recommendations.  The essence of the role of an ombudsman around the world is to create moral suasion.  That is the essence of how we work.  The reason we do not go for binding recommendations is that as soon as we do that type of an investigation, people lawyer up and it becomes a different type of process and we do not get the change that we have seen.  As I said, we engaged for three years with this local authority.  The final year of the engagement was about progress being made internally without anybody having to know about it and conversations that led to these recommendations being accepted.<\/p> <p>  As I mentioned, the Ombudsman for Children was set up in 2002 and it commenced operations in 2004.  We have not yet had to do this but if we find ourselves in a situation where we need to do it, we will write to the Secretary General or the Minister of the Department - in this case the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage - advising it that we intend to bring a report to the Oireachtas.  That tends to focus the mind.  As far as I know, that has happened only once under my predecessor.  Departments then tend to follow through and help to create satisfaction on our part.  That would be my intention.  Ultimately, if we end up bringing a report to the Oireachtas there will be a moral, but not statutory, obligation on the Oireachtas to finish implementing the recommendations.  I would expect that if it gets to the stage where a Minister is being told by an ombudsman that the nation and the house of Government are not happy with the way in which recommendations are being followed through, that would be a strong argument for getting it done.  As I said, that is very much a final solution. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021061500002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Muldoon"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":556,"content":"<p>As there are no further contributions from members, I would like to make a brief contribution.  It is a privilege to have been asked by the Chairperson to chair this meeting in her stead.  It has been a very useful meeting.  The report, in its detail, is very stark and important.  Unfortunately, there are many cases of similar type throughout the country.  We do not need to do much study to know that.  Most of us know that already.  The testimony of members today points to this not being a one-off situation, unfortunately.<\/p> <p>  There is another matter of concern.  The report looks at the Traveller issue not only from the point of view of accommodation but in regard to children because children are the remit of the Ombudsman for Children.  The report is a wake-up call for us too.  We know how much early childhood experiences influence people's later life experiences in terms of health, education opportunities and so on.  The report highlights, from the prism of a child, the impact of lack of action in this area.  I can assure Dr. Muldoon that the committee will look carefully at the recommendations in the context of its report, which has a wider remit across the Traveller experience in our society.<\/p><p> I have a question regarding Part 8.  I believe it presents a barrier and we should be honest enough to admit that societal attitudes create that barrier because where accommodation for Travellers is proposed, pressure is often brought to bear on politicians.  I have argued for a long time that that issue should be dealt with and have asked whether Part 8 should perhaps be suspended.  Two suggestions have been made, one of which relates to handing the responsibility to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for the short term, whether five years or whatever, or permanently, as was done in other cases.  People would be allowed to make observations and the board would then make a decision in line with Government policy.  The other idea was to have a dedicated national accommodation authority, although one problem with that, and I would be interested in hearing our guests' views, is it could take some time before that could be set up.<\/p><p> I thought the clarification Dr. Muldoon gave was very useful.  He seems to be saying that, as is the case in all ombudsman Acts, the ultimate power he has is to report to the Oireachtas.  He is throwing the baton to us, to the Oireachtas as a whole and to this committee specifically, which has been charged by the Oireachtas to examine how Travellers should be treated as full and equal citizens in our community.  Dr. Muldoon might confirm that that is where responsibility ultimately goes, that the buck stops here in the Oireachtas and that we should call to account the Government and all its agencies to deal with this issue once and for all, and ensure that no more children will ever grow up in the conditions outlined in his report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021061500002#H00400","speaker":"1575","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623711600,"counter":558,"content":"<p>As the Vice Chairman noted, the issue is very stark.  We did not set ourselves up as experts in Traveller accommodation and legislation.  We have learned about it through three years of investigation and through experts coming together to create that report in 2019.  One recommendation related to the suspension of Part 8.  While I can see difficulties with doing that, something radical has to happen.  We have to change the legislation in some way or other.  On the An Bord Plean&aacute;la suggestion, I could not comment on whether that is a better option.  From our point of view, it is about creating movement because the paralysis of the system is allowed through Part 8.<\/p> <p>  People are crowded.  If a site starts off with ten bays, it can end up with 20 caravans.  The key is to get people onto another site or into social housing.  If a plan is made to build social housing or to generate a new site and that is blocked, it may end up that the 20 caravans becomes 30, and there is a paralysis of the system.  Something needs to be shaken up and that means being radical and suspending or changing something.  I am not going to say clearly what the political route should be but there is an option in front of the Oireachtas with a really well thought-out report, and the decision has to be made quickly.  We need to start making it happen.<\/p> <p>  When I launched the report, I likened the issue to the tenements.  In Dublin, one can go on a tour of a tenement, which shows that living in those conditions in the early 1900s was almost better than some of the sites the committee has discussed.  We eradicated that from our general population 50 years ago and we would not allow it to happen now, yet every politician in the D&aacute;il is standing over that if they allow their local government politicians to continue to use Part 8 in that way and to allow the influence to come forward.  Those children deserve the right to live in a safe, secure and comfortable home in the way in which they want to live.  They have a right to play, health and education, and those rights need to start from proper accommodation.<\/p> <p>  As for whether I have passed the baton to the Oireachtas, I believe that is what should happen.  I hope all we need to do is talk to the committee, and members can make the difference in pushing forward with their colleagues and as a committee with its report.  I hate to think I would end up coming back with a special report, but if we did that, it would definitely be a matter of handing the matter back to the Oireachtas to take control and do something about it.<\/p> <p>  I hope it will not get to that stage.  I would love to think that in 12 months, we will have a report indicating I am satisfied with the progress made and we can see real differences for the children on that site.  I will keep my fingers crossed in that regard and we will work as hard as we can with the local authority to ensure that happens.  I hope the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the Taoiseach will, as was indicated, put forward opportunities for those local authorities to make a difference.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021061500002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Muldoon"},{"type":"speech","time":1623711600,"counter":559,"content":"<p>Dr. Muldoon is saying quite clearly that the time for talk is over and the time for action is here.

On behalf of the committee, I thank Dr. Muldoon and Ms Ward for attending.  It is a pity the meeting had to be held virtually.
