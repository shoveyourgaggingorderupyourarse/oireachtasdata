Of course,\u00a0my Department\u00a0remains extremely vigilant in monitoring the current market and emerging trends, particularly as we approach the peak period for Irish milk production.<\/p>  <p>  The average milk price paid to Irish dairy farmers in 2018 was 34 cent per litre, which was higher than the average price paid across the EU of 33 cent per litre.

This represented a value of &euro;110 million to the Irish economy, according to Bord Bia. This growth trend has continued into 2019, with live exports of cattle totalling 163,000 up to the 28th April &ndash; a 28% increase on the same period in 2018.<\/p>  <p>  My\u00a0decision in 2017 to reduce the veterinary inspection fee payable on live exports of calves less than three months of age from &euro;4.80 to &euro;1.20 has brought greater equity to the inspection fee regime.

According to the most recent Bord Bia figures for 2019, calf exports already stand at 123,000 head, with consignments to the Netherlands and Spain accounting for 50% and 31% of this trade, respectively.<\/p>  <p>  This increase in trade is also apparent with regard to the export of non-calves (weanlings, stores and finished cattle), which are approximately 23% up on last year, according to Bord Bia&rsquo;s most recent statistics.<\/p>  <p>  My Department continues to prioritise efforts to deepen existing markets and gain access to new third country markets.<\/p>  <p>  Just this week, my Department hosted a visit by a Turkish technical team, including officials from the Ministry of Agriculture and ESK (the Turkish Meat and Milk Board). The objective of the visit was to conduct an on-site fact-finding mission to evaluate the technical aspects of live animal and germinal product exports from Ireland to Turkey. This is yet another welcome development as we seek to re-establish our live trade with Turkey. The visit by Turkish officials follows on from my March meeting with my Turkish counterpart, Dr Bekir Pakdemirli, Minister for Agriculture and Forestry.<\/p>  <p>  I also welcome the progress made on live exports to Algeria arising from the technical meetings between my Department and Bord Bia and their counterparts in Algiers last week. The Algerian authorities have agreed in principle to move from a joint breeding, slaughter and fattening certificate to 3 separate certificates. In addition, there is agreement for the maximum age of breeding animals to be raised from 36 to 42 months. My technical experts will now move quickly to oversee the changes to the health certificates for live exports so that they can be forwarded to our Algerian colleagues for their imprimatur prior to the commencement of the revised trade conditions.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to other third country markets:<\/p>  <p>- A number of consignments of cattle have left for Libya in recent weeks, the most recent on the 3rd of May, carrying approximately 2,400 head.<\/p>  <p>- In April, my Department reached agreement with the Egyptian authorities on three proposed health certificates for the export of fattening, slaughter and breeding cattle.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>- I met with the Kazakh Ambassador in late March to discuss new health certification for the trade of live animals to Kazakhstan. Progress was made in relation to opening the Kazakh market.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to animal welfare, my Department maintains robust oversight of live trade, through a comprehensive legislative framework, and in my recent meetings with exporters, I have stressed the importance of high animal welfare standards.

My\u00a0Department continues to provide significant supports to the sector under the Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme, the Tillage Capital Investment Scheme under TAMS II, the EU Protein Aid Scheme and the fodder production incentive measure introduced in 2018.<\/p>  <p>- The Tillage TAMS scheme supports tillage farmers adoption of more efficient and sustainable practices by supporting the purchase of items such as GPS guidance and cover crop establishment equipment.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>- My Department also provides a high quality official crop seed certification scheme to the industry.<\/p>  <p>- The &euro;3m coupled Protein Aid Scheme has encouraged the production of beans and peas, which reduces our dependence on imported protein feeds, while giving growers the option to adapt more sustainable crop rotations. In spring 2018 I announced the continuation of the Protein Aid Scheme for 2019 and I envisage it remaining for the period of the current CAP.<\/p>  <p>  The Strategy for the development of the Organic Food Sector, which was launched by my colleague Minister of State Andrew Doyle, recognises the opportunities that exist for the Irish Organic Food Sector and provides clear direction for the development of the Sector up to 2025. It aligns the strategic growth plans of the Organic Sector with the broader Food Wise 2025 Strategy for food and drink.<\/p>  <p>  The overall strategic objective is to develop a consumer-led viable Organic Food Sector in Ireland enhancing the sustainability credentials of Irish food which will produce a wide range of organic products to meet increasing domestic and export market opportunities. To this end, this Strategy sets measurable strategic objectives for each sub-sector and incorporates actions considered essential to further support the industry&rsquo;s development and achieve growth targets.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of dairy, in 2018, Ireland exported dairy products to approximately 140 countries totalling over &euro;4.5 billion worth of produce, an increase of over 5% by volume compared to 2017 and another year of strong performance by the Irish dairy sector.<\/p>  <p>  My Department, in conjunction with other stakeholders, including the Irish dairy companies and agencies such as Bord Bia, are playing a key role in building the market for Irish dairy with intensive Ministerial trade mission programmes and other promotional work. I am delighted to acknowledge that Kerrygold has achieved over &euro;1 billion in annual sales globally.<\/p>  <p>  According to the CSO, Ireland exported almost &euro;3.9 billion worth of meat with a volume of over 1 million tonnes in 2018. My officials continue to work towards opening and enhancing access to as many markets as possible. This is a key part of our response to the challenges and uncertainty posed by Brexit, and in line with the market development theme of the Food Wise 2025 strategy. As you are aware, Irish food products are stocked in all major retailers across the globe.<\/p>  <p>  Preparations for a new agrifood strategy to 2030 are underway. Its development will involve an analysis of a range of cross-cutting themes and the various sub-sectors of the agrifood industry; a formal public consultation; and the establishment of a committee to develop the strategy.<\/p>  <p>  Without pre-empting the work of the new committee and the eventual content of the 2030 strategy, it is clear that consideration will have to be given to the production systems of animal and plant products from our livestock, cereal and horticulture sectors as well as customer and consumer demands.<\/p>  <p>  Quality Assurance plays a fundamental role in promoting food and horticulture and provides the platform for consumer promotion of product quality. Bord Bia operates a series of quality assurance schemes for the food industry. The schemes are built on best practice in farming and processing, current legislation, relevant industry guidelines and international standards - and are accredited to the ISO17065\/2012. They are reflected in the high level of trust placed by consumers in QA labels.<\/p>  <p>  As I stated earlier, premium quality is the cornerstone of all Irish agrifood products and\u00a0the measures I have outlined will serve to maintain and enhance our enviable reputation throughout the world into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900055#WRB01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Areas of Natural Constraint Scheme Appeals","counter":59,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900055#WRB01700"},{"type":"question","counter":60,"qnumday":30,"qnumall":"[19048\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900055#WRB01800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the position regarding the appeals process for the ANC scheme with reference to appeals by farmers in County Wexford; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1354","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":61,"content":"<p>Under the current Rural Development Regulation (and subsequent amendments under the Omnibus Regulation) Member States\u00a0 were required to change the approach to the designation of land under the Areas of Natural Constraints Scheme.\u00a0 Previously my Department had been identifying eligible areas using a range of socio economic indicators such as family farm income, population density, percentage of working population engaged in agriculture, and stocking density. \u00a0From 2019, eligible areas must instead be designated using a defined list of bio-physical criteria such as slope, soil texture, soil rooting depth, soil moisture and drainage.<\/p>  <p>  Further to the completion of the redesignation process, my Department wrote to all farmers holding ANC lands advising them of the status of these lands under the 2019 ANC scheme and advised of their right to appeal this position.\u00a0 The\u00a0appeals process, overseen by an independently chaired Appeals Committee, is in place for any farmer who wishes to further appeal the status of a particular townland in the 2019 ANC scheme.\u00a0 Where a farmer notified my Department of their wish to make such an appeal,\u00a0they have been provided with the relevant information in relation to the data underpinning the status of the townland in order that an appeal can be based on full\u00a0information.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has received and replied to Notifications of Appeal in respect of 759 individual townlands, of which 266 were in County Wexford.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To date, full appeals in respect of some 160 townlands have been made to the Appeals Committee, of which 38 are in County Wexford.<\/p>  <p>  The Independent Appeal Committee has commenced work on processing the appeals received.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900055#WRB01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Livestock Issues","counter":62,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900055#WRB02000"},{"type":"question","counter":63,"qnumday":31,"qnumall":"[20057\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900055#WRB02100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the reason farmers are not paid for the fifth quarter, that is, remaining pieces of an animal carcass which are not being used for meat production.","asker":"1244","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":64,"content":"<p>I\u00a0am very conscious of the role played by livestock farming in sustaining the rural economy and rural communities across Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware of the current challenges facing beef farmers in particular, with a sustained period of low prices, following on from additional costs last year arising from the unprecedented weather events, and with significant Brexit uncertainty still overhanging the sector.<\/p>  <p>  However, as Minister,\u00a0I cannot intervene directly in any commodity price, including in relation to meat offals.

Those arrangements permitted these individuals to be rehired post-retirement for a period of 1 year until they reached the age of eligibility for the State Pension (Contributory).

Enactment of the legislation had no effect on those public servants who retired at 65 prior to the 26 December 2018 and who availed of a one year contract under the interim arrangements.

At primary level this relates mainly to the recruitment of substitute teachers and at post primary to the recruitment of teachers of particular subjects such as STEM, modern foreign languages, Irish and Home Economics.<\/p>  <p>  In response to these difficulties, the Teacher Supply Steering Group, which is chaired by the Secretary General of my Department, was established in March 2018.<\/p>  <p>  The Steering Group is considering the issues that relate to teacher supply under four policy headings: initial teacher education policy, provision, funding and support; data\/research requirements; policies and arrangements for schools and teachers that impact on teacher mobility\/supply; and promotion of the teaching profession. It is supported in its work by the Teacher Supply Implementation Group and a number of working groups that are looking at specific policy areas. In undertaking its task, the Steering Group is cognisant of the requirement that all persons wishing to teach in recognised schools must meet the professional registration standards and criteria set by the Teaching Council, which is the professional regulatory body for the teaching profession.<\/p>  <p>  The Steering Group is overseeing the Action Plan for Teacher Supply, which I published in November 2018. Several of the actions are aimed at supporting Irish teachers who are considering returning to Ireland to take up teaching positions, including:<\/p>  <p>  - The commencement of a new teacher sharing scheme for post-primary schools in the 2019\/20 school year, as set out in my Department&rsquo;s Circular 0015\/2019.  This scheme will support young teachers in obtaining full time employment and enhance curricular choices in post primary schools.<\/p>  <p>  - The development of an online teacher recruitment portal is being explored.<\/p>  <p>  - The use of digital technology by schools to facilitate interviewing applicants, for teaching posts, is also being explored, particularly in the case of qualified applicants resident outside the State.<\/p>  <p>  - The Teaching Council is developing more streamlined processes for the registration of teachers, including those originally from Ireland, who qualified in jurisdictions outside the State.<\/p>  <p>  - In December 2018, a national campaign to promote the teaching profession was launched across a number of platforms, including radio and digital media, supported by a new dedicated webpage www.gov.ie\/teachingtransforms. This website provides useful information about teaching as a career in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to salary on return from teaching abroad, the position is that qualified teachers who work in schools outside the State may, on appointment to a teaching post in a recognised school in the Republic of Ireland, qualify for the award of incremental credit for the purposes of progression on the incremental salary scale under the terms of the schemes as outlined in my Department&rsquo;s circulars 10\/01, 29\/07 and 29\/10.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that I intend to visit the United Arab Emirates in the coming months to meet with Irish teachers working there to ascertain how they can be best supported to return to Ireland to  work as teachers here.

The number of SNAs employed in a school depends on the allocation given to the school by the NCSE, based on its assessment of the special educational needs of pupils in the school. <\/p><p>My Department has no control over the allocation process to schools and is not in a position to influence the allocation process in light of the fact that the NCSE is an independent statutory body.  In considering applications for SNA support for individual pupils, the NCSE take account of the pupils' needs and consider the resources available to the school to identify whether additionality is needed or whether the school might reasonably be expected to meet the needs of the pupils from its current level of resources.  SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource and allocations to all schools can change from year to year as children with care needs leave the school, as new children with care needs enrol in a school and as children develop more independent living skills and their care needs diminish over time.<\/p><p>In respect of job security, the supplementary assignment arrangements for Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) were established on foot of proposals brought forward by the Labour Relations Commission when the Haddington Road Agreement was being agreed. These supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs continue to operate under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018 - 2020 , and both unions representing SNAs, namely SIPTU and F&Oacute;RSA, have signed up to that agreement. As set out in the LRC proposals, the supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs only apply to current SNAs who are notified that they are to be made redundant. Accordingly, the purpose of these arrangements is to facilitate eligible SNAs who are being made redundant by one employer in filling SNA vacancies that may become available in another school \/ ETB.<\/p><p>  Once an SNA with a minimum of one year's service (service in a substitute capacity i.e. covering for maternity leave, sick leave, career breaks, job-sharing etc. does not count) is notified by his\/her employer that s\/he is to be made redundant then s\/he shall be deemed to be a member of a supplementary assignment panel for SNAs. The detailed supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs for the 2018\/2019 school year are set out in Departmental Circular 0034\/2018 which issued on 17 May 2017 and which is available on the Department's website at the following address:<\/p><p><i><\/i><\/p><p>  The operation of this panel is described and outlined in Circular 0034\/2018 and it is designed to be as flexible as possible which enables all eligible SNAs, who have the requisite Panel Form 1 completed by their former employer, to apply for any SNA position that is advertised by a school or an ETB with no sectorial, diocesan or geographical limitations imposed. Every eligible SNA will remain on the panel for two years with a view to getting further employment. If they are not successful over that period of time in obtaining a further SNA position then they will be eligible for a redundancy payment. Furthermore, an SNA may opt out of this supplementary assignment panel at any point in time triggering the processing of his\/her redundancy payment in line with the terms set out in the SNA redundancy scheme (DES Circular 58\/06) or any revision of same that is applicable at that time.<\/p><p>With regard to the contractual position in respect of the working hours of SNAs, this is outlined in their contracts of employment which were agreed with the school management authorities and the relevant Trade Unions representing SNAs (IMPACT and SIPTU) prior to their introduction in 2005.  The agreement reached between the parties found expression in the two circular letters issued in 2005 detailing the contracts of employment for SNAs.<\/p><p><b>Links to the SNA Contracts of Employment are as follows:<\/b>Department of Education and Skills Circular SNA 12\/05 (Post-Primary)<\/p><p><i><\/i><\/p><p>Department of Education and Skills Circular SNA 15\/05 (Primary)<\/p><p><i> <\/i><\/p><p>The contracts were designed to be deliberately flexible to cater for the totally different spectrum of working hours across all the various schools, including primary, post-primary and special schools.  No set hours were agreed but instead full-time SNAs are expected to work for the normal school hours in the school that they are working in, and in addition to be available for a period of time before and after school, in order to help with the reception and dispersal of children, and the preparation and tidying up of classrooms etc.  These times should be agreed locally by the school management and will vary from school to school depending on the requirements of the school.  SNAs who are employed in a part-time capacity are paid a pro-rata amount dependent upon their level of hours of employment. Part-time SNAs are paid on the agreed divisor rate for pay purposes for part-time SNAs which is 32 hours. I should point out that this divisor was also agreed with both the Management Authorities and the Trade Unions (IMPACT and SIPTU) that represent SNAs.<\/p><p>Furthermore, the contract of employment for SNAs in the post primary sector specifically requires that SNAs in the post primary sector are required to work the month of June.<\/p><p>In addition, all SNAs were required to be available for a number of days at the start and finish of each school term not exceeding 12 in total.

The Deputy will appreciate that a lead in timeframe is needed to ensure that the necessary staff resources, processes, IT system, expert panels, codes of practice and regulations will be in place so that the Decision Support Service will have the capacity to be up and running effectively. There are many complex strands to this preparatory work, including the involvement of multiple organisations. <\/p>  <p>  A high-level Steering Group comprised of senior officials from the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Health, the Mental Health Commission and the Courts Service, together with the Director of the Decision Support Service, is overseeing the establishment and commissioning of the Decision Support Service and this work is ongoing.  The 2019 Revised Estimates Volume provides for an allocation of &euro;3.5 million in the Justice and Equality Vote for the establishment of the Decision Support Service. <\/p>  <p>  A number of provisions of the 2015 Act were commenced in October 2016 in order to progress the setting up of the Decision Support Service. The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 (Commencement of Certain Provisions) Order 2016 (S.I.

The Minister for Health, under the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 (Commencement of Certain Provisions) (No. 2) Order 2016 (S.I. No. 517 of 2016), brought some provisions of Part 8 of the Act into operation on 17 October 2016.

The commenced provisions provide for the establishment by the Minister for Health of a multi-disciplinary group to make recommendations to the Director of the Decision Support Service in relation to codes of practice on advance healthcare directives. In anticipation of the completion of that process, the Minister for Health commenced the remainder of section 91 on 17 December 2018 (S.I.

The Lists are subject to twice-yearly review which is predicated on a formalised and evidence-based process and involves consideration of the research undertaken by the Skills and Labour Market Research Unit (Solas), the Expert Group of Future Skills Needs (EGFSN), the National Skills Council, and input by relevant Government Departments in addition to the public consultation phase.

In order to have an occupation removed from the Ineligible List, there would need to be a clear demonstration that recruitment difficulties are solely due to shortages across the EEA and not to other factors such as salary and\/or employment conditions.  Organisations in the sector would need to provide the necessary evidence to substantiate their claims. Following completion of the most recent review, the role of Healthcare Assistant was not proposed for amendment at this time.    The views of the lead policy Government Department for the sector, in this case, the Department of Health, are an important part of the decision-making process.  Officials of that Department have advised the sector of the need for further evidence, demonstrating genuine efforts to recruit across the EEA.

There are currently no proposals to extend automatic eligibility for medical cards to survivors who have accessed Caranua. However, in certain circumstances the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card even though an applicant exceeds the income threshold, when he\/she faces difficult circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness. Furthermore, awards made by Caranua are disregarded in the income assessment for a medical card.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900057#WRD05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nursing Homes Support Scheme Administration","counter":223,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900057#WRD05300"},{"type":"question","counter":224,"qnumday":88,"qnumall":"[20183\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900057#WRD05400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding the publication and implementation of the pricing review for high dependency, specialist care needs of persons requiring nursing home care.","asker":"1278","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":225,"content":"<p>The Nursing Homes Support Scheme (NHSS), commonly referred to as Fair Deal, is a system of financial support for people who require long-term residential care.

The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.<\/p>  <p>  The Report of the NHSS Review published in 2015 identified a number of issues for more detailed consideration, including a review of the pricing mechanism used by the NTPF, with a view to:<\/p>  <p>  - Ensuring value for money and economy, with the lowest possible administrative costs for clients and the State and administrative burden for providers;<\/p>  <p>  - Increasing the transparency of the pricing mechanism so that existing and potential investors can make as informed decisions as possible; and<\/p>  <p>  - Ensuring that there is adequate residential capacity for those residents with more complex needs.<\/p>  <p>  A Steering Group was established to oversee and manage the pricing review. The Steering Group is chaired by the NTPF and includes representatives from the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER). As part of its work on the review the NTPF sought various inputs including external expertise and stakeholder engagement to inform the review. These inputs are being considered in detail. It is recognised that any change to any part of the Scheme must be considered in terms of the short- and long-term impact on the viability of the Scheme and accessibility of long-term residential care in general. It is therefore important that the relevant issues are considered thoroughly. <\/p>  <p>  I understand that the NTPF has now completed its report and is under final consideration by the Steering Group.

This equates to a cut of approximately 5% to the overall CAP budget, representing a cut of 3.9% to Pillar 1, Direct Payments and 15% to Pillar 2, Rural Development.  At least 5% of Rural Development funds are to be ring-fenced for LEADER.  <\/p>  <p>  I have been very firm in my view that I do not accept the proposed 5% cut to the CAP budget post-2020, and there is strong consensus on this issue amongst my Member State colleagues.  I have been strongly advocating for the CAP budget to be restored to current levels for the EU 27 for the next programming period, and I will continue to work towards achieving this objective until agreement on the MFF post 2020 proposals has been reached.  In addition, my colleague Minister Michael Ring, whose Department has overall responsibility for the LEADER programme, continues to strongly defend the LEADER budget as the MFF post-2020 negotiations progress.  The retention of an adequate budget for the CAP post-2020 is a key priority for Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The negotiations on the EU's Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for the period 2021-2027 are ongoing, and are running in parallel with the negotiations on the CAP post-2020.

A decision on the MFF proposals is not expected to be reached until Autumn 2019 at the earliest.  <\/p>  <p>  With regard to the co-financing rates, the total allocation for the LEADER 2014&ndash;2020 Programme is &euro;250 million.

The remaining 37.2% (&euro;93 million) in matching funding is provided by the Exchequer. <\/p>  <p>  Under the current EU Regulations, the maximum permitted contribution to LEADER expenditure from the EAFRD is 80%. The European Commission has proposed to leave this percentage unchanged under the proposals published for the 2021-2027 period.  <\/p>  <p>  Until the MFF proposals are agreed, it will not be clear what the precise financial implications for the CAP and the Rural Development Programme will be.

Avoiding a no-deal Brexit continues to be the Government&rsquo;s overriding policy priority.<\/p>  <p>  I have held a number of discussions with Commissioner Hogan regarding the potential impact of a disorderly Brexit on the sector. I have stressed the need for the Commission to be ready to deploy a range of measures to mitigate the potential impacts on agrifood and fisheries, including through traditional market supports and exceptional aid under the CAP's Single Common Market Organisation regulation (Regulation (EU) No 1308\/2013), as well increased flexibility under State Aid regulations.  <\/p>  <p>  However, it is also important to acknowledge that the past few months have been very difficult for beef farmers in particular, following a difficult year in 2018 due to weather conditions.

It underlines the agrifood sector&rsquo;s unique and special position within the Irish economy and provides an enabling strategy that will allow the sector to develop.   <\/p>  <p>  Food Wise includes more than 400 specific recommendations, spread across the cross-cutting themes of sustainability, innovation, human capital, market development and competitiveness, as well as specific sectorial recommendations.  <\/p>  <p>  If these recommendations are implemented, the expert committee that drew up the Food Wise 2025 Strategy believed that significant value growth projections are achievable by 2025, including increasing the value of agrifood exports by 85% to &euro;19 billion. <\/p>  <p>  In July 2018, I launched the third annual progress report of Food Wise 2025: Steps to Success 2018. This showed that by 2017 exports had increased by 15.9% compared to the baseline.<\/p>  <p>  As of Q4 2018, of the 375 detailed actions in Food Wise which were due to commence by 2018 or are on-going actions; 79% have been achieved or substantial action has been undertaken and a further 21% have commenced and are progressing well. This represents a 6% increase in target achieved over Q3 2018. <\/p>  <p>  Market Development was identified as one of the key five cross-cutting themes in Food Wise 2025. It highlights the need to ensure that Irish products are targeted at the right markets and the right segments within these markets. The global evolving market environment presents enormous potential opportunities for the agrifood sector. <\/p>  <p>  As part of the Department&rsquo;s Action Plan on intensifying international market access, a new online international market access tool was developed. This portal provides information across some of the major export sectors of dairy, meat, seafood and live animals.  <\/p>  <p>  I have also led a series of agrifood trade missions to key existing and emerging markets; my Department's agricultural attach&eacute; network in key Embassies has been increased and I have provided significant additional resources to Bord Bia's marketing and promotion efforts.<\/p>  <p>  Preparations for a new agrifood strategy to 2030 are underway. Its development will involve an analysis of a range of cross-cutting themes and the various sub-sectors of the agrifood industry, a formal public consultation and the establishment of a committee to develop the strategy.<\/p>  <p>  Without pre-empting the work of the new committee and the eventual content of the 2030 strategy, it is clear that the cross-cutting themes contained in Food Wise (environmental sustainability, market development, competitiveness, innovation, and human capital) will continue to be highly relevant. It is likely that environmental sustainability, and in particular, the contribution that agriculture can make to climate action, will need significant consideration and prominence.<\/p>  <p>  In this regard, my Department is currently developing a climate roadmap for the agrifood sector to ensure that the future development of the agriculture and land-use sector, including forestry, will be built upon and contribute fairly to Ireland&rsquo;s climate targets. This will form a key element of the 2030 strategy. In parallel, my Department is also working on the development of Ireland&rsquo;s CAP Strategic Plan, which in line with the EU Commission&rsquo;s proposals, will recognise that greater environmental and climate ambition is required. These important strategic and policy developments at national and European levels, as well as others in areas such as international trade and the bioeconomy, will inform the 2030 strategy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900059#WRF04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Greenhouse Gas Emissions","counter":364,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900059#WRF04500"},{"type":"question","counter":365,"qnumday":134,"qnumall":"[20291\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900059#WRF04600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the extent to which he can encourage mitigation action in respect of greenhouse gases with the minimum impact on agriculture production; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":366,"content":"<p>The long term vision for the agricultural sector is an approach to carbon neutrality which does not compromise capacity for sustainable food production.

Key features of this policy include setting Total Allowable Catches (TACs) and quotas to deliver maximum sustainable yield (MSY) by 2015, where possible, and in all cases by 2020 as well as a discards ban (Landing Obligation) that was phased in over the period 2015 to 2019. <\/p>  <p>  Setting fishing levels on the basis of Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) is an essential aspect of the policy. Fishing opportunities are agreed on an annual basis at the EU Fisheries Council of Ministers on the basis of a proposal produced by the European Commission that is informed by the best available scientific advice. The Common Fisheries Policy specifically calls for the progressive restoration and maintenance of populations of fish stocks above biomass levels capable of producing MSY.  To achieve this, the FMSY exploitation rate shall be achieved for all stocks by 2020 at the latest. This should ultimately lead to healthy fish stocks, higher quotas for both Irish and EU fishermen and lead to more sustainable fishing patterns.<\/p>  <p>  Scientific information on the state of the fisheries exploited by the Irish fleet is compiled by the Marine Institute and is published in the Stock Book each year. The most recent Stock Book, 2018, contains 74 stocks that are subject to the scientific advice of the Marine Institute. From the 74 stocks, 32 are assessed as being sustainably fished in 2018. This number has grown every year since 2013. This in turn leads to the number of stocks being over fished declining from 22 in 2014 to 16 in 2018.<\/p>  <p>  The 2018 December Fisheries Council, at which quotas for 2019 were agreed, showed a rebuilding of many stocks. I was pleased that the scientific advice supported large increases in a number of stocks of importance such as Haddock (+20%), Hake (+28%) and Megrims (+47%) in the Celtic Sea. The overall increase of 30% in whitefish quota will provide improved fishing opportunities for whitefish fishermen all around our coasts. This shows that the many years of intensive, industry led conservation measures are paying off.<\/p>  <p>  Provided we can successfully navigate the potential difficulties arising from Brexit, in cooperation with our EU27 partners, I am confident that we will be able to ensure the continued economic viability of our fishing fleet and fish processors, thereby supporting the families and communities that depend on a vibrant fishing industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900059#WRF05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agrifood Sector","counter":374,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900059#WRF05500"},{"type":"question","counter":375,"qnumday":137,"qnumall":"[20294\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900059#WRF05600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the extent to which the market for venison remains viable here and abroad; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1285"},{"type":"question","counter":376,"qnumday":143,"qnumall":"[20300\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900059#WRF05700","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the extent to which the prospects for the lamb trade remain positive for the foreseeable future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":377,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 137 and 143 together.<\/p>  <p>  Deer farming in Ireland is an alternative enterprise which is dependent on the dynamics of supply and demand which affect all agricultural production systems. In 1996, there were approximately 500 deer farms with 20,000 deer in Ireland, but numbers have declined sharply since that time. <\/p>  <p>  Today, there are only a small number of farmers in Ireland actively supplying deer for meat production, which cater primarily to specialised niche markets. The sector is reliant upon producers and companies ensuring that a market exists for their product, an objective which Bord Bia assists in by identifying and developing potential market outlets.<\/p>  <p>  There was some recent growth in game (venison) market during 2016, for example, with around 764 deer slaughtered for this market, but this declined to 271 deer for 2017, with 133 deer slaughtered so far in 2018.<\/p>  <p>  Growth in the past was achieved as a result of improved distribution for game meats, especially in supermarkets. Game and exotic meats historically occupy a premium, niche segment of the meat market. Whilst there are opportunities to compete with the larger premium segment of the red meat\/poultry categories, it is important to note that demand is seasonal, with the greatest concentration of retail shelf space dedicated to game in the Winter\/Christmas period. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has approved one factory for the slaughter of deer in Ireland, and two game-handling plants. There may also be outlets for processing of venison in Local Authority approved plants, but this would be a matter for the Local Authority concerned.<\/p>  <p>  There is no reliance on wild deer in the sector currently.    <\/p>  <p>  In terms of lamb trade,  while sheepmeat export volumes were down by 4% in 2018 compared to 2017, exports by values were up 2% to &euro;315m.  Factory gate prices were also higher than in 2017. The medium term prospects for the lamb sector both at national, EU and global level suggest that market prospected are generally good.  <\/p>  <p>  Meat consumption overall is expected to increase globally by 15% in the next decade due to population increases.

I am advised by IFI that restocking is a complex matter that is carefully considered in the context of the protection of existing wild stocks.   In relation to potential restocking of salmon, there are significant genetic and ecological concerns when the progeny of wild salmon reared in a hatchery environment are released back into the wild as each of Ireland&rsquo;s more than 140 salmon rivers has its own genetically unique stock of salmon. For this reason each salmon stock is managed individually based on the conservation limit established for each river. Ireland&rsquo;s salmon management measures are considered best in class internationally <\/p>  <p>  Re-stocking with hatchery reared fish can be detrimental to the genetic integrity of individual stocks and negatively impact their long term sustainability. IFI follows the guidelines of the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation (NASCO) with regard to applying the precautionary approach to any proposed re-stocking of hatchery reared Atlantic salmon into the wild.<\/p>  <p>  Internationally re-stocking in not considered an appropriate solution in management measures for wild Atlantic salmon. IFI&rsquo;s advice for enhancement of salmon populations nationally is to continue with single stock salmon management to achieve individual river spawning targets while also supporting habitat enhancement and removal of artificial barriers to migration rather than artificial re-stock enhancements which have potentially detrimental genetic impacts. <\/p>  <p>  National policy is that management measurements for wild brown trout should be generally directed towards conservation, with return of captured fish, and towards habitat-management\/enhancement measures designed to increase carrying capacity and restore depleted wild brown trout stocks.<\/p>  <p>  IFI have confirmed that a series of genetic studies on Irish brown trout populations has revealed that there is enormous genetic diversity within and among brown trout populations. Research has shown that stocking with hatchery reared brown trout makes no significant contribution to those fisheries where they have been introduced. In addition, it has been shown that restocking of non-native salmonids can be detrimental to the freshwater pearl mussel, a protected species included in Annex II and V of the EU Habitats Directive.<\/p>  <p>  &ldquo;IFI has supplied hatchery reared fish to angling clubs around the country.

This funding increased to &euro;18m in 2019. <\/p>  <p>  Tusla&rsquo;s Family Resource Centre Programme provides the financial support which typically covers the employment of two to three members of staff and some overhead costs for each FRC.  120 Family Resource Centres (FRCs), 2 support networks and the Family Resource Centre National Forum (FRCNF) were supported under the Family Resource Centre Programme, in 2018.<\/p>  <p>  Other Tusla services provided funding of &euro;2,728,871 to FRCs to support their work. <\/p>  <p>  The funding provided by Tusla to each of the FRCs in 2018 will be sent to the Deputy directly. <\/p>  <p>  Tusla is engaging directly with Family Resource Centres, support networks and the FRCNF regarding their funding levels for 2019. I recently announced how the additional &euro;1.5m for 2019 is to be used to support the sustainability of existing Family Resource Centres (FRCs) and to enable a number of FRCs to engage additional family support workers.<\/p>  <p>  A number of FRCs also receive funding from other sources within my Department.<\/p>  <p>  Many Family Resource Centres provide Early Learning and Care (ELC) and School Aged Childcare (SAC) to children. My Department, through a Funding Agreement, provides a range of supports through capitation payments and other programmes. The complete list of FRCs which received this funding in 2018 is currently being compiled by my officials, and a full list will be provided to the Deputy directly. Funding in 2019 will be based on the level of ELC\/SAC provision in each centre.<\/p>  <p>  The Trim Family Resource Centre in County Meath received funding of &euro;34,692.90 under the 2018 Quality and Capacity Building Initiative (QCBI) Innovation Fund, which is administered by Tusla, on behalf of my Department. This funding supported a project, which enabled young people to re-engage with education and\/or training and employment, to develop life skills that foster good relations, build confidence and resilience. Funding has not been provided for this project under the QCBI in 2019.<\/p>  <p>  In 2018, the Youth Affairs Unit in my Department provided funding of &euro;89,203 to the Northside Family Resource Centre in Ballynanty, Limerick, for the \"Follow Your Dream\" youth project. The same level of funding will be provided to the Northside FRC for this project in 2019. <\/p>  <p>  My Department also provided funding under the Capacity Building Grant for the National LGBTI+ Strategy to three Family Resource Centres in 2018. Ballymun Child and Family Resource Centre in Dublin received &euro;1,400, Greystones Family Resource Centre in Co. Wicklow received &euro;2,500, and Northside Family Resource Centre in Ballynanty, Limerick, received &euro;3,770.40 under this funding stream. Funding amounts for 2019 have not yet been determined.<\/p>  <p>  I should inform that Deputy that the funding from my Department represents only a portion of the total funding available to FRCs nationally. FRCs draw on various sources of funding provided by other Government Departments and Agencies. I am informed by Tusla that, in 2018, FRCs received in excess of &euro;40m when all funding sources were considered.  <\/p>  <p>  I recognise and value the very positive impact of the work of the Family Resource Centres in supporting families and local communities.  The Centres provide a holistic service of child, family and community support and advocacy to all children and families in their community. This universal accessibility allows for early identification of need, provision of appropriate interventions, and timely referrals to appropriate services for more intensive and targeted work as required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900060#WRG03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cr&egrave;che Facilities Provision","counter":425,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900060#WRG03200"},{"type":"question","counter":426,"qnumday":156,"qnumall":"[20274\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900060#WRG03300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the steps she will take to ensure the continuation of a cr&egrave;che (details supplied) which parents and staff have been informed is due to cease operation in August 2019; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1432","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":427,"content":"<p>Thank you for your question in relation to the closure of this cr&egrave;che due to take place in August. <\/p>  <p>  While my Department funds a wide range of initiatives to support the quality, affordability and accessibility of early learning and care services, it does not operate or direct Early Learning and Care services. <\/p>  <p>  The service referred to by the Deputy is an independent community-based organisation, and given this context, there are limits to the actions my department can take in situations like this one, where the board of management of a cr&egrave;che have chosen to close. <\/p>  <p>  Although the Department cannot directly intervene in the decisions of individual organisations, a range of supports are available through local City\/County Childcare Committees funded by the DCYA and through Pobal&rsquo;s Case Management service.

This approach is expected to significantly benefit many people, particularly women, whose work history includes an extended period of time outside the paid workplace, while raising families or in a caring role.  The TCA will ensure that the totality of a person&rsquo;s social insurance contributions - as opposed to the timing of them - determines their final pension outcome.  The HomeCaring Periods can be claimed for any year in which they occurred - they are not limited to years since 1994.<\/p>  <p>  People whose pensions were decided under the 2000-2012 ratebands were subject to a significantly more generous regime than those who qualified before or afterwards, as a Yearly Average of only 20 contributions per year (out of a maximum of 52) could attract a 98% pension.  The effect of those changes, as it impacted upon those new pensioners since 2012, will be familiar to anyone who followed the debate on this matter over the last 6 years.  If pre-2012 pensioners were also allowed avail of HomeCaring Credits, their arrangements, as a group, would continue to be significantly more generous than those of post-2012 pensioners.  There would also be a very significant cost which would be expected to be of the order of several hundred millions of euros each year.  This in turn could significantly impact funds for future pension increases with consequential implications for pensioner poverty.  <\/p>  <p>  For those with insufficient contributions to meet the requirements for the full rate State pension (contributory), they may qualify for a means tested State pension (non-contributory), the maximum personal rate for which is &euro;237 (over 95% of the maximum rate of the contributory pension).  This rate of payment does not include rent allowance, household benefits or fuel allowance.  Alternatively, if their spouse is a State pensioner and they have significant household means, their most beneficial payment may be an Increase for a Qualified Adult, based on their personal means, and amounting up to 90% of a full contributory pension.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900061#WRH00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","counter":472,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900061#WRH00600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Loan Scheme","counter":471,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900061#WRH00500"},{"type":"question","counter":472,"qnumday":171,"qnumall":"[20218\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900061#WRH00600","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if there is discretion in the administration of the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme that would allow for the inclusion of a property that is slightly larger than the size guidelines highlighted in the criteria; and if other criteria are met by an applicant, if discretion can be used in relation to the size of the property.","asker":"1250","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":473,"content":"<p>The Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan scheme is administered by the local authorities, in accordance with the Housing (Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan) Regulations 2018.
