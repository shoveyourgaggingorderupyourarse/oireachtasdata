or training they will receive the maximum weekly rate of payment of &euro;203.\u00a0 This includes the &euro;5 weekly increase applied\u00a0from last week, which I secured as part of Budget 2019. \u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  There are a number of measures in place to assist young people into employment or training.\u00a0 In 2013 the EU adopted a Council Recommendation to member states on a Youth Guarantee.\u00a0 Under the Youth Guarantee process case officers engage with unemployed young people, on a monthly basis, to prepare and implement personal progression plans for employment.<\/p>  <p>  Where young people do not find work quickly, additional supports are offered through places on employment and training schemes, which are closely aligned to the needs of the labour market.\u00a0 I also recently launched the Youth Employment Support Scheme (YESS) which is a work experience scheme targeted exclusively at young jobseekers facing barriers to employment.\u00a0 Participants receive a payment of &euro;229.20 per week. <\/p>  <p>  These policies have been effective in reducing both youth and long-term unemployment.\u00a0 For example, the most recent data shows that Irish youth unemployment has fallen from a peak of 31.2% in 2012 to 13.4% in\u00a0March 2019.\u00a0 Irish youth unemployment has fallen from well above the EU average in 2012 of 23% to below the current EU figure

accommodate demographic ageing, all EU countries have undertaken, or have scheduled, reforms to their State pension age.\u00a0 In Ireland, legislation that progressively increases the Irish State pension age to 68 in 2028 has already been enacted.\u00a0 However, it is recognised that over the longer term, increasing life expectancy may continue to outpace the increase in pension age.<\/p>  <p>  A policy which sees Ireland linking the State pension age with life expectancy is a\u00a0measure for Member States advocated at EU level and has also been recommended by the OECD.\u00a0 This change will provide greater certainty and sufficient &lsquo;lead in&rsquo; time to allow individuals plan, both personally and financially, for their retirement.\u00a0 It may also assist workers and

allowance scheme was an element of the household benefits package (HHB).\u00a0 The decision to discontinue the telephone allowance was estimated to provide annual savings of &euro;48 million at that time.\u00a0 These savings meant that my Department was able to retain the other valuable elements of the household benefits package such as the electricity and gas allowance and the television licence.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The cost of the telephone allowance scheme had risen significantly each year, as the number of eligible customers grew.\u00a0 At the end of September 2013 before it was discontinued, there were almost 396,000 receiving the telephone allowance compared to approximately 316,000 people in 2007.\u00a0 This was an increase of 25%, or an average increase of nearly 4% per annum.<\/p>  <p>  The value of the telephone allowance before it was discontinued was &euro;9.50 per month (equivalent to &euro;114 per annum).\u00a0 Therefore, the cost of restoring the allowance at this level in 2019 might be estimated at approximately &euro;52 million per annum, although the precise figure would depend on a number of factors.<\/p>  <p>  While the telephone allowance was an important measure for vulnerable persons, the nature of the market has been transformed in recent years with deregulation, mobile services and bundled services including television, broadband and telephone.\u00a0 It makes the former notion of an allowance covering handset rental, standing charges and a number of calls somewhat outdated, when similar assistance can be achieved by increasing the rate of core payments, which benefit people regardless of whether they have a landline or not, and which can be spent by the recipients either on their landline-related costs, or on\u00a0an alternative good or service\u00a0of their own choosing.<\/p>  <p>  Any decision to restore the telephone allowance would require additional funding for the HHB scheme and would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Separately, the new telephone support allowance (TSA) which was announced in Budget 2018 is a weekly payment of &euro;2.50.\u00a0 The TSA is not the same as the Telephone Allowance that was part of the HHB package, and has different qualifying criteria to the HHB Package.\u00a0 Approximately 129,000 customers are in receipt of the TSA payment.\u00a0 The estimated full year cost of the scheme is over &euro;16 million.<\/p>  <p>  The primary objective of the TSA is to allow the most vulnerable people at risk of isolation, including the elderly and those with disabilities, access to personal alarms or phones for security.\u00a0 The risk of social isolation is clearly higher for those living alone than those who live with other people,\u00a0especially where they have\u00a0limited personal resources.\u00a0 Therefore the criteria for the allowance were framed in order to direct the limited resources available to my Department in as targeted a manner as possible.\u00a0 Accordingly, to receive the allowance a customer of\u00a0my department\u00a0must be in receipt of a qualifying payment and also in receipt of the Living Alone Allowance and the Fuel Allowance.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  People who live alone would be considered among those most at risk of social exclusion, and this payment, along with the Living Alone Allowance, are also in part recognition of the greater challenges facing some of those living alone, in avoiding poverty.\u00a0 The deprivation rate of\u00a0couples over 65 is less than half that recorded among those over that age who live alone, and while there are people living alone who have significant personal resources, this allowance is only paid to those who satisfy the means test of Fuel Allowance to ensure it is targeted at those most in need.<\/p>  <p>  While the schemes operated by my Department are constantly reviewed, any decision to extend the scheme\u00a0to people who are not in receipt of the Living Alone Allowance would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations.<\/p>  <p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the

Court and decisions have to be formally written up to quasi-judicial standards.\u00a0 Other factors that influence appeals processing times include the quality of the initial decision &ndash; in this respect the Department has changed the decisions process in respect of medical schemes, in order to provide more information to the claimant.\u00a0 I am advised by my Department that this will help to reduce the number of appeals over time.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, a number of new Appeals Officers have joined the Appeals Office over the past 12-18 months, to replace staff leaving on retirement.\u00a0 Given the complexity of the appeals process it takes some time for new staff to be trained up and develop expertise and this has led to somewhat longer processing times during this period.\u00a0 The Chief Appeals Officer has advised me that appeal processing times continue to be a priority for her Office.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, where a claimant has been refused a social welfare payment, regardless of the scheme involved, and is appealing that decision, if their means are insufficient to meet their needs it is open to them to apply for supplementary welfare allowance in the interim.<\/p>  <p>  If their application for supplementary welfare allowance is refused, they can also appeal that decision.\u00a0\u00a0The supplementary welfare allowance appeal will be prioritised for attention within the Appeals Office as soon as the appeal file and submission is received from my Department.<\/p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040400040#WRB00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State

self-directed pension schemes; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1227","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":81,"content":"<p>The transposition of the IORP\u00a0II\u00a0Directive will result in significant improvements to the regulation and governance of funded occupational pension schemes in Ireland.\u00a0\u00a0While the Directive provides for the possibility of derogation from specific Articles for smaller schemes, I believe that members of smaller schemes should get the same protections and oversight as members of large schemes.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The value of investments held in many schemes fell substantially during the financial crisis.\u00a0 This highlighted the need for stricter regulation and greater protections, especially for small schemes investing in riskier unregulated markets.<\/p>  <p>  Concerns in relation to this sector are particularly around the protection of the consumer and the money they have invested, the riskiness of investments, the charges that apply, and the standard of governance.\u00a0 Accordingly, the Government has decided that the provisions of the Directive should apply to all funded occupational pension schemes.\u00a0\u00a0Money saved for pension purposes should be properly protected to ensure that people have adequate income for their retirement years.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Under the Directive the underlying principle for capital investment is for schemes to invest in\u00a0 accordance with the 'prudent person' rule and other specific rules set out.\u00a0 It is recognised that there should be an appropriate level of investment freedom for schemes within prudent limits and this is reflected in the rules.\u00a0 Assets must be predominantly invested on regulated markets, i.e., at least 50%.\u00a0 This allows adequate scope for investment in instruments with a long-term economic profile and non-listed undertakings such as property and infrastructure.\u00a0 In this regard, the application of the Directive is prospective, not retrospective.\u00a0 This means that existing investments and borrowings can remain in place.\u00a0 After transposition all single member schemes, including Small Self-Administered Schemes, who are the only schemes currently allowed to borrow, will not be allowed to enter into new borrowing arrangements, except for short term and liquidity purposes.\u00a0 All of their future investments will have to be made in accordance with the investment rules in the Directive.<\/p>  <p>  While small self-administered pension schemes may continue to invest in the Irish economy, including property and SMEs, the assets of the scheme must be properly diversified to avoid excessive reliance on any particular asset and thereby minimise risk in the portfolio as a whole.<\/p>  <p>  Such diversification has been proven to reduce investment risk.\u00a0\u00a0This approach\u00a0will enhance consumer protection so that pension savers have adequate income for their retirement years.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Pension Authority advises that there are approx. 100,000 single member schemes and that c. 98% of these schemes are already compliant with the investment rules of the IORP II Directive.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Officials in my Department, supported by the Pensions Authority, are managing the transposition process of the IORP II Directive.\u00a0 This is a substantial Directive and my Department is working towards transposition into Irish law as early as possible in 2019.\u00a0 Once that is done, and to ensure that schemes are informed of their obligations under the Directive, the Pensions Authority will also undertake a communication campaign on the implementation of the Directive.\u00a0 The Authority will engage and consult with industry stakeholders and trustees on implementation of the new regulatory regime and related codes of practice.\u00a0 The emphasis of this engagement will be on providing sufficient support, time and information in order for industry and trustees to plan for and make the changes needed.<\/p>  <p>  I\u00a0hope this clarifies the matter for the

This would amount to a reopening of the Withdrawal Agreement, and, as the European Council made clear on 21 March, the Withdrawal Agreement is not for renegotiation.<\/p>  <p>  The Withdrawal Agreement is a carefully balanced and inter-connected legal text. The citizens&rsquo; rights provisions in the Withdrawal Agreement rely on the general rules providing for the governance of the Agreement and the structures underpinning its applicability and enforceability.  <\/p>  <p>  Equally, the Agreement contains other provisions, outside of &lsquo;Part 2,&rsquo; that are relevant to the protection of other rights of citizens &ndash; for example, on personal data protection, the orderly completion of judicial cooperation procedures in criminal\/civil matters, and the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland. Carving out certain provisions, as part of the ring-fencing exercise proposed by Mr Costa, would, therefore, risk the unequal treatment of certain categories of EU and UK citizens.  <\/p>  <p>  However, the rights of EU citizens in the UK, and UK nationals in the EU, remain a priority for the EU, as they have throughout the negotiations. In the event of a no deal scenario, the rights of British nationals residing in the Union will be addressed by each Member State, depending on its national law.  In this context, like Ireland, EU Member States have taken the necessary measures to regularise the position of UK nationals resident in their countries, and to provide them with legal certainty for the longer term.  The Commission has also proposed a number of unilateral contingency measures specifically to address citizens' rights, for example, by agreeing, on a reciprocal basis, that UK citizens will be exempt from the need to have a short-term visa to visit EU countries.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to Ireland, the rights of UK nationals in Ireland, and Irish nationals in the UK, are dealt with under the Common Travel Area. The Common Travel Area is a long-standing arrangement between the UK and Ireland which means Irish citizens can move freely to live, work, and study in the UK on the same basis as UK citizens and vice versa.  Both the Irish and UK Governments have committed to the maintenance of the Common Travel Area, and the associated rights and entitlements of Irish and British citizens under this longstanding reciprocal arrangement, in any circumstance. To that end, both Governments have committed to undertaking all the work necessary, including through legislative provision to ensure that the Common Travel Area rights and privileges are protected. Ireland has completed its internal procedures, including with the enactment of the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Act 2019, and I understand that the UK has done likewise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040400041#WRC02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Conflicts","counter":121,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040400041#WRC02300"},{"type":"question","counter":122,"qnumday":53,"qnumall":"[15774\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040400041#WRC02400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he has made representations to his Nigerian counterparts concerning the killing of approximately 120 Christians in the Middle Belt region of the country in March 2019; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1347","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":123,"content":"<p>I am deeply concerned by the tragic events that took place recently in the Middle Belt region of Nigeria.

These benefits in kind can include living or other accommodation, entertainment, domestic or other services, or other benefits or facilities of whatever nature. The charge is limited to the amount of the expense incurred by the body corporate in providing the benefit. <\/p>  <p>  Section 118 (3)(a) provides for a specific exemption from the charge to tax in respect of living accommodation provided by a body corporate to an employee, if the employee is required by the terms of the employment to live there so that s\/he can perform his or her duties properly. However, for the exemption to apply, the accommodation must be provided in accordance with a practice which, before 30 July 1948, commonly prevailed in trades of the class in question in relation to employees of the class in question. Moreover, the exemption does not apply where the employee is a director of the employing body in question, or of another body corporate which controls, or which is controlled by, the employing body. There is no set list of trades or professions which are eligible for this exemption, rather, it is a requirement of the exemption that the employer can prove eligibility if requested by Revenue.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to Questions 15723\/19, 15724\/19, 15725\/19 and 15738\/19, I am advised by Revenue that where an employee is in receipt of a benefit from an employer which is not a taxable benefit, the employer is not required to report the details.

Article 11.1 of this Covenant recognises the right of everyone to an adequate standard of living for himself and his family, including adequate food, clothing and housing, and to the continuous improvement of living conditions. <\/p>  <p>  Given the important implications which developments in the property market can have for the economy, my Department actively monitors developments in this sector on an ongoing basis, and published a paper on Institutional Investment in the Housing Market in February this year.  The paper is based on CSO data up to 2017, the latest year available. <\/p>  <p>  While there may be a perception that institutional investors are purchasing large amounts of housing stock, the data show that their activity has been limited in the context of the overall housing market.  In 2017 &mdash; the latest year for which we have data &ndash; firms in this category were net purchasers of just 1 per cent of residential sales, or just over 500 units. Furthermore, from 2010 to 2017, net purchases by Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), real estate funds and private equity firms were less than 0.01 per cent of available units, or just 380 units.<\/p>  <p>  On a national level, institutional investors remain a small minority of landlords.  However, such investors do play an increasingly important role in the private rented sector.<\/p>  <p>  Institutional investment in apartments is likely to be the driving force behind a significant recent increase in the number of apartment units granted planning permission in Dublin. In the first nine months of 2018, 57 per cent of units that were granted planning permission in Dublin were apartments, or just over 4,000 units. As a comparison, in the three year period between 2015 and 2017 the same amount were completed nationally. <\/p>  <p>  Increased apartment building is a very positive development, both in terms of boosting overall supply and in relation to the National Planning Framework, which specifically targets more compact growth.<\/p>  <p>  Recognising the importance of investment in the property sector, tax rules have been introduced to facilitate collective investment and to ensure that tax is imposed on funds deriving value from Irish property. For example, the function of the Real Estate Investment Trusts (REIT) framework is not<\/p>  <p>  to provide an overall tax exemption but rather to facilitate collective investment in rental property by removing a double layer of taxation which would otherwise apply on property investment via a corporate vehicle. REITs are required to distribute 85% of their property profits each year and Dividend Withholding Tax is collected on the distributions.  In Finance Act 2016, Irish Real Estate Fund (IREF) provisions were introduced for certain investment funds deriving 25% or more of their value from Irish real estate assets, imposing a Dividend Withholding Tax on distributions to non-resident investors.<\/p>  <p>  However, as Rebuilding Ireland makes clear, such investment can only be one aspect of a multi-pronged response to addressing current issues in the market.  This is why the Government has provided record funding for social and affordable housing, to improve housing infrastructure and to address homelessness. Such funding has been accompanied by a range of regulatory and policy changes that facilitate increased supply of both owner occupier and rental housing, and policy measures to help contain rental price inflation such as Rent Pressure Zones.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040400042#WRD01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insurance Costs","counter":150,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040400042#WRD01600"},{"type":"question","counter":151,"qnumday":65,"qnumall":"[15950\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040400042#WRD01700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"when he expects to progress legislative changes on insurance as part of the Consumer Insurance Contracts Bill 2017; the reason the legislative changes are not being drafted as a new Bill in its own right; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":152,"content":"<p>My Department is currently working on developing legislative changes on insurance as part of the Consumer Insurance Contracts Bill 2017.

Among these, Recommendation 1 requires the Central Statistics Office to consider the feasibility of collecting price information on the cost of insurance to businesses with this exercise to commence by the end of Q2 2018, with the CSO to report to my Department with the outcome of its review, and if it considers such an index feasible, make appropriate proposals.  <\/p>  <p>  The Central Statistics Office (CSO) submitted its report to the Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG) in January 2019 in this regard.  In that report, the CSO identified seven potential methods of collecting price information on liability insurance.  These data collection options were assessed against four criteria: (i) statistical quality, (ii) burden on respondents, (iii) meeting user needs, and (iv) cost.  After analysing each of the options, the CSO found that four options were unfeasible and two further options, while technically feasible, would be extremely difficult to implement in practice.  However, the CSO signalled to the CIWG that it will further examine a method that may be feasible.  I understand that this method would use a commercially available technology solution to automatically price a high volume of representative profiles, i.e., customer profile such as an office-based company with 20 employees, good safety standards and no claims history, etc.  The price quotations for these profiles would be tracked over time to estimate the overall change in premiums.  <\/p>  <p>  By way of update to the Deputy, this further examination is currently under way, and it is expected that the CSO will provide the CIWG with a final determination on feasibility during the summer months of this year.

Primary legislation was necessary in order to bring that change into effect.  It was made clear at the time that until such legislation was enacted, the compulsory retirement age of 65, which applied to the vast majority of this cohort, remained in effect and pre-2004 public servants reaching that age would be required to retire.<\/p>  <p>  I made special interim arrangements for the cohort of public servants who reached their compulsory retirement age of 65 after the Government Decision because, while they would be aware of the Government&rsquo;s decision, they would be unable to avail of it.  Those arrangements, clearly conveyed to all concerned, permitted these individuals to be rehired post-retirement for a period of 1 year until they reached the age of eligibility for the State Pension (Contributory).  Without that special arrangement, they would have been required to cease working on reaching the age of 65.<\/p>  <p>  The Public Service Superannuation (Age of Retirement) Act 2018 was enacted on 26 December 2018. Under the Act, any relevant public servant who had not already reached their compulsory retirement age of 65 before that date has a new compulsory retirement age of 70.  Enactment of the legislation had no effect on those public servants who retired at 65 prior to the 26 December 2018 and who availed of a one year contract under the interim arrangements.  The terms of their contracts continue to apply and they will cease working when they reach the age of 66.<\/p>  <p>  Section 3 of the 2018 Act also provides that I, as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, within three months of the passing of the Act, would prepare and lay before the Oireachtas a report on the public servants who were forced to retire between 6 December 2017 and the commencement of the Act, due to reaching the age of 65 years, and on potential remedies to assist this cohort of worker.  This Report was laid before the Oireachtas on 26 March 2019 and is publicly available on the Oireachtas and Department of Public Expenditure and Reform websites.<\/p>  <p>  Whenever legislation is enacted to implement a change in policy, there has to be a dividing line between those who are affected by the change and those who are not.  There are always people who will not benefit because they miss the deadline by a matter of days or weeks.  Having considered all of the issues in the Report, I am satisfied that the interim arrangements were an appropriate temporary policy response at the time of the Government Decision pending enactment of the legislation.  The terms of those arrangements were clear, unambiguous and made known to those who availed of them.  Accordingly, as set out in the report, I do not propose to make any changes to those terms, whether by legislative change or otherwise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040400042#WRD03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":174,"content":"<p>Question No. 72 answered with Question No. 69.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":175,"content":"<p>Question No. 73 answered with Question No. 71.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Broadband Plan","counter":176,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040400043#WRE00400"},{"type":"question","counter":177,"qnumday":74,"qnumall":"[15947\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040400043#WRE00500","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the level of involvement his Department has in undergoing a due diligence on the tender for the national broadband plan as confirmed by the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment;

There will be some additional discretion for Member States in configuring the measures available, within parameters laid down in Council Regulations. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The proposals outline significant changes to the direct payments system including:-<\/p>  <p>  - Replacing the current Basic Payment Scheme with the Basic Income Support for Sustainability (BISS) payment;<\/p>  <p>  - The capping of direct payments &ndash; this involves a graduated reduction of payments over &euro;60,000 per annum.\u00a0 A 100% reduction is to be applied to the amount of the payment exceeding &euro;100,000, at least 75% to payments between &euro;90,000 and &euro;100,000, at least 50% to payments between &euro;75,000 and &euro;90,000, and at least 25% to payments between &euro;60,000 and &euro;75,000.\u00a0 Member States will be required to subtract the salaries of the farmer including taxes and social contributions, before applying capping.\u00a0 The cost of regular and unpaid labour should also be taken into account.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  - The Complementary Redistribution of Income Support for Sustainability (CRISS) - the funding released from capping is to be used for the mandatory redistributive income support i.e. moving support from large to small\/medium farms.\u00a0 This is a mandatory requirement for Member States.\u00a0 Redistribution is not limited to the funding released by capping and it will be up to the Member State to set out what funding it intends to use and to who the additional funds will be made available.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  - A complementary income support for Young Farmers (CISYF) which can be funded through surplus funds from capping.\u00a0 The CISYF is a top-up scheme for young farmers and is optional for Member States.\u00a0 However, in overall terms, at least 2% of all funding must be spent on young farmers either by the top-up mechanism or through a lump sum of up to &euro;100,000.<\/p>  <p>  - The introduction of Eco-schemes for the environment under Pillar I.\u00a0 This is a new requirement under the CAP legislative proposals.\u00a0 Member States are obliged to offer at least one eco- scheme, which would be\u00a0optional for farmers.\u00a0 The eco-scheme can be applied for on an annual basis.\u00a0 Member States must draft a list of practices that are beneficial for agriculture and the environment.\u00a0 Payments are only provided in cases where the beneficiary goes beyond certain conditions and requirements.<\/p>  <p>  - Continued convergence, where beneficiaries of direct payments must receive 75% of the average planned unit amount by 2026.<\/p>  <p>  - Optional lump sum for small farmers.<\/p>  <p>  - Coupled support continues and is available for more sectors including non-food fuel replacement.\u00a0 The available funding proposed for coupled support is reduced to 10% or 12% if this includes protein crops.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is a strong proponent of evidence-based policy making, and I can confirm that work is currently underway to analyse the impact of the various elements of direct payments in the draft regulations.\u00a0Preliminary modelling exercises have been carried out and the results of these analyses are currently being reviewed and revised to take account of the most recently available data.<\/p>  <p>  These direct payment measures (BISS, CRISS, CISYF and Eco-Schemes) are inextricably linked to each other.

This is likely to continue until the regulations are fully developed, at which time detailed analyses will be completed to fully address the impact on farmers in Ireland of CAP 2020. This methodology is congruent with the requirement for each Member State to prepare a Strategic Plan addressing all aspects of CAP expenditure and, consequently, all of these analyses remain at a drafting stage until the Regulations are resolved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040400059#WRV01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bovine Disease Controls","counter":651,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040400059#WRV02200"},{"type":"question","counter":652,"qnumday":276,"qnumall":"[15941\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040400059#WRV02300","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 224 of 27 March 2019, if there are circumstances by which the commence after date can be deferred for a short period (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1365","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":653,"content":"<p>The herd owner in question has a high risk herd and is due to complete a post-derestriction check test scheduled on 7th April 2019.

It is obvious in built up areas that smoky fuels are not welcome, but in the countryside there is no reason in the world why fossil fuels cannot continue to be burned. Recent mixed messages are being sent out by the Government and many of the suppliers of solid fuels are having real trouble with regard to stocks and knowing what the market is going to be for the future.

Following a public consultation process, it was further extended in 2012, and now applies in 26 urban areas nationwide. The ban has proved very effective in reducing particulate matter and sulphur dioxide levels and has had the effect of significantly improving public health. Research indicates, for example, that the ban has resulted in over 350 fewer annual deaths in Dublin alone. <\/p><p>In light of its significant health and environmental benefits, it had been announced by a number of previous Ministers that the ban would be extended to the entire territory of the State. However, as the Deputy may be aware from recent press reports, a number of coal firms have indicated that they would legally challenge this decision. <\/p><p>I have discussed this issue with the Attorney General, my Department is now working to finalise a legally robust plan which will improve air quality by reducing particulate matter in the air.<\/p><p>However, pending the completion of this work I am aware of the need to provide clarity now to the public and to the trade to enable them adequately plan for purchases of stock for the 2019\/20 heating season. I can confirm therefore that the current ban on bituminous coal will not be extended nationwide for the 2019\/20 heating season.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040400060#WRW01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Air Pollution","counter":682,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040400060#WRW01700"},{"type":"question","counter":683,"qnumday":286,"qnumall":"[15812\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040400060#WRW01800","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if consideration has been given to introducing a certification system for wood, which could ensure that only suitable wood is sold for burning.","asker":"1250","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":684,"content":"<p>All smoke, including smoke from wood burning, contains a range of toxic pollutants including fine particulate matter (PM2.5) that impact on health.  <\/p>  <p>  There can be a big variation in the quality of wood sold in Ireland. Purchasing cheap low quality wood as a home heating fuel may prove to be a false economy as much of the energy is needed to burn off excess moisture in the wood rather than providing heat output to the consumer. The resulting reduced combustion temperature can, therefore, result in the increased generation and release of toxic and carcinogenic air pollutants including Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) as well as dioxins which are promoted by the high chlorine levels in the fuel. While there are no statutory regulations for biomass quality, a voluntary Wood Fuel Quality Assurance scheme is in place. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to air pollution more generally, recent scientific evidence indicates that it is more damaging at lower concentrations than was previously understood.

This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment and a State led intervention.  <\/p>  <p>  The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector. In 2012, less than 700,000, or 30% of all 2.4 million Irish premises had access to high speed broadband. Today, 74% of premises can access high speed broadband. <\/p>  <p>  The aim of the NBP is to provide every premises with access to a high speed broadband service on a future proofed basis. While the NBP sets the minimum download speed at 30 megabits per second, the NBP recognises that higher speeds and quality of service are likely to be required as the digital society develops and progresses. This is supported by data from the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) whose Quarter 4 2018 Key Data report noted that subscriptions to a fibre service stood at 90,500, a 128% increase when compared with the same period the previous year. The increase in subscriptions is considered to be likely as a result of the recent network build of fibre across the country by the telecoms sector, with further fibre investments announced.<\/p>  <p>  There can be a range of reasons why businesses may choose not to switch to a fibre broadband service at the point of it becoming available, including, for example, the length of time remaining on their current contract.

Their ECCE place was split over two years, e.g. a child may have availed of three days ECCE provision in year one and two days in year two. In order to facilitate this, in the cases where the child would have been overage for ECCE in the latter year, an overage exemption was granted.\u00a0<\/p><p>Overage Exemptions currently provided by the Department are governed by three guiding principles as follows:<\/p><p>&middot; A Letter of Recommendation supplied from a specialist (NB: Not a GP\/Public Health Nurse)<\/p><p>&middot; The child not reaching 6 years of age during the exemption year to comply with the school starting age (as per Educational Welfare Act, 2000)<\/p><p>&middot; ECCE Allocation taken -i.e. if a child has already availed of the full two years they will not be eligible. \u00a0<\/p><p>In\u00a0 the case of the child named, the application was declined on the basis that their\u00a0ECCE entitlement will have been utilised in full by the end of June.<\/p><p>It is important to note that<s><\/s>this provision of an overage exemption by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs (DCYA) for the ECCE programme was never intended as a mechanism to delay a child&rsquo;s entry to primary education before the age of 6 years which is the statutory requirement or to address any issue of non-availability of a school place.\u00a0<\/p><p>It should also be noted that the application process for an exemption from the upper age limit for the ECCE programme was introduced within a context where: <\/p><p>&middot; The ECCE programme was for one year only; and<\/p><p>&middot; The Access and Inclusions Model (AIM) did not exist. <\/p><p>Given the extension of the ECCE programme in 2016\/2017, the further extension of the programme to two full years from September 2018, and the introduction of AIM in June 2016, the rationale underpinning the policy intent of the system of overage exemption came under review as the initial premise for the provision of an exemption might have been considered to be no longer valid, i.e. an overage exemption as originally designed allowed for a child to avail of one programme year of ECCE over two years, whereas the standard provision is now a full two programme years. \u00a0<\/p><p>Therefore, the overage exemption process has recently been the subject of a consultation process and report by the National Disability Authority (NDA). Officials from the Department\u00a0 are now considering policy options following on from the recent publication of this report. The new policy will consider the future of the system of exemptions and how best to support parents and children in the important transition from pre-school to primary school. It is worth stressing that the only rationale underpinning these considerations is what is in the best interests of the child.\u00a0<\/p><p>The current system will continue until such time as any new policy proposals are in place. <\/p><p>A key finding of the NDA report, which was\u00a0 published recently, is that generally it is in children's best interest to enrol in primary school with their peers and to transition to becoming a teenager with their peers.<\/p><p>The report also seeks to ensure that schools offer all the assistance necessary to meet the child's needs, with the assistance of the National Council for Special Education (NCSE). <\/p><p>My Department will be happy to assist the family, if requested, to make contact with the NCSE to ensure that adequate preparations are in place for the child to start school in September 2019. The family should make immediate contact with their local school to make sure it has appropriate arrangements in place to support this child from September 2019.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040400062#WRY01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Illegal Adoptions","counter":752,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040400062#WRY01300"},{"type":"question","counter":753,"qnumday":311,"qnumall":"[15803\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040400062#WRY01400","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"when the final report on illegal birth registrations will be published; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1316","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":754,"content":"<p>I had expected that the final report of the review of a sample of adoption records being overseen by the Independent Reviewer Marion Reynolds would be submitted to me by Easter.
