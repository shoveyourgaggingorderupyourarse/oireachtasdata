He is joined today by Ms Ruth Foley, deputy director of audit at the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Deering.<\/p> <p>  The first item is the minutes of the meetings of 30 May 2019 and 13 June 2019.  Are the minutes agreed?  Agreed.  We will hold over last week's minutes until next week, when we will have had an opportunity to review them.<\/p> <p>  As there are no items arising that are not on our agenda, we will proceed to No. 3, which is correspondence received since the last meeting.  There are three categories of correspondence.  The first category is A, briefing documents and opening statements for today's meeting.  Correspondence Nos. 2273A and 2276A from Mr. Jim Breslin, Secretary General of the Department of Health, are the briefing documents and opening statement for today&rsquo;s meeting.  We will note and publish these.  Nos. 2272A, and 2275A from Mr. Paul Reid, director general of the HSE, are the briefing documents and opening statement for today&rsquo;s meeting.  We will note and publish these.<\/p> <p>  The next category is B, correspondence from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers and follow-up to meetings of the committee and other items for publishing.  Some items have been held over from previous occasions.  No. 2161B is from Mr. Paul O'Toole, chief executive of the Higher Education Authority, dated 10 May.  We have held this over three times so far, on 30 May, 13 June and 20 June.  It is in regard to the review of the relationship between Cork Institute of Technology and certain named companies and entities which was undertaken by Mazars.  We have already noted and published this.  Deputy Kelly indicated he might have some observations.  I suggest we note and publish this and move on.

Also held over from last week's meetings is No. 2231B from Mr. John McKeon, Secretary General of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, dated 7 June, and providing an update to an inquiry the committee made in regard to a protected disclosure regarding St. Munchin's community centre, Limerick.  We had received anonymous correspondence in regard to this matter.  Mr. McKeon advises that an investigation of the issues raised was undertaken by the Department under the Protected Disclosures Act 2014.  The alleged issues related to funding provided by the Department under the job initiative scheme.<\/p><p>The Department concluded its examination of the issues raised and a number of areas for minor improvement were identified, including governance, purchasing control and attendance records.  This was accepted by the management of St. Munchin's.  The Department has liaised with and met those involved in the job initiative scheme to discuss these issues.  We will note and publish the correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<br\/><br\/>The next item is No. 2244B<b>, <\/b>correspondence, dated 11 June 2019, received<b><\/b>from Mr. Cr&oacute;nan Goodman, private secretary to the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality, in response to an inquiry from the secretariat about the Irish Prison Service.  The information was requested to feed into our periodic report and has to do with a procurement issue.  It is being considered as part of our consideration of the periodic report.  Is it agreed that we note and publish the correspondence?  Agreed.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>The next item is No. 2246B correspondence, dated 11 June 2019, from the Department of Justice and Equality  in response to an inquiry made by the committee about the operation of CCTV systems by local authorities.  We had previously received responses from the Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Department is now forwarding a response from the County and City Management Association, CCMA.  The Department advised in December 2018 that 28 of the 31 local authorities had undertaken the role of data controller for specific community schemes.  The CCMA's response highlights an important distinction between local authority CCTV systems which are utilised for the purpose of exercising law enforcement powers and community-based CCTV schemes that typically are operated for the purpose of securing public order and safety in public places.  Essentially, there are three items of correspondence, the first of which contains subsections (1) to (4), inclusive.  The second is the actual response from the CCMA in October submitted to the Department which it has made available to us.  I ask those with an interest in this matter to note that we are putting this correspondence on our website.  Is it agreed that it be noted and published?  Agreed.  I highlight that of all the local authorities, only one - Laois County Council - operated a CCTV system for the purpose of exercising law enforcement power or a community-based CCTV system for the purpose of securing public safety without Pobal CCTV grant funding or grant funding under the Department scheme. <br\/><br\/>The next item is No. 2254B, correspondence, dated 17 June 2019, received from Mr. Peter Wood of the Irish Prison Service, providing further details requested by the secretariat of the breakdown for non-compliant procurement in the 2017 appropriation account of the Irish Prison Service.  We will note and publish this correspondence and incorporate it into our next periodic report as being relevant.  We will ask for specific details of non-compliant procurement.  In the case of many of the reasons given, those supplying the particular service were the only ones in a position to do so.  The equipment was installed and in the interests of consistency people wanted to deal with the same supplier.  It was a significant issue.  In other cases, people were awaiting finalisation of a centralised tender arrangement with the Office of Government Procurement, but in the meantime they proceeded with contracts at local level.  <br\/><br\/><b><\/b>The next item is No. 2262B, correspondence, dated 20 June 2019, received from the Secretary General&rsquo;s office in the Department of Finance, advising that the Department is working on its responses to the 16 items on which information was requested by the committee following its meeting on 30 May.  It is expected that we will receive a full reply in the first week of July.  We will note the correspondence and await the full response.<br\/><br\/>The next item is No. 2265B, correspondence, dated 20 June 2019, received from Ms Mary Donohoe, Office of the Director General, Environmental Protection Agency, providing further information requested by the committee on the availability of data for water testing.  The EPA advises that Irish drinking water is at low risk of containing illicit and legal drugs because the majority of wastewater discharges in Ireland occur in estuaries which discharge into the sea and are, therefore, downstream of drinking water abstraction points.  This environmental issue will be of concern to many.  I want to read one or two sentences from Ms Donohoe's letter.  The issue was raised by Deputy O'Connell.  The response deals only with drinking water.  Ms Donohoe states: &quot;Irish Water has a comprehensive annual drinking water monitoring programme...&quot;  Essentially, if there is a problem, it has to notify the EPA.  She further states:<\/p><blockquote>The associated annual monitoring reports can be accessed on the EPA&rsquo;s website ... Irish drinking water is at low risk of containing Illicit and\/or legal drugs because the majority of wastewater discharges ... occur in the estuarine ... and are therefore downstream of drinking water abstractions and, hence, are not included in the routine drinking water monitoring programme.  Therefore, EPA does not hold any data in relation to specific illicit and\/or legal drugs in Irish water supplies.<\/blockquote><p>We will ask for the issue to be clarified in respect of bathing water because if illicit and\/or legal drugs are discharged into estuaries which dischargin into the sea, it may have implications for the quality of bathing water.  We accept that the EPA is stating it may not affect drinking water, but we would like the matter to be clarified.  If it is not checking for it in bathing water, we will suggest it consider doing so.  We will ask for a response on the monitoring programme for bathing water.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>The next item is No. 2266B, correspondence, dated 20 June 2019, received from Ms Dee Forbes, director general of RT&Eacute;, enclosing further information on the ongoing review of contracts.  RT&Eacute; states it will continue the review into the second half of 2019 in a sequenced manner.  I know that Deputy Cullinane will want to speak about this item.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019062700002#B00500","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1561622400,"counter":10,"content":"<p>Yes.  It is welcome that there is a process in place to meet staff members on individual contracts.  There seems to be some movement in that regard.  I have spoken to some staff members who may have their contracts reviewed and be put on normal contracts.  That shows that there was a problem.  Even the response from Ms Forbes in which she states it is a complex matter is a massive step forward from where we were when it was said there was no issue.  There is an issue and I understand it is complex to deal with it.  Ms Forbes is right that everybody's circumstances are different.  She states the process of discussing individual contracts will continue into the second half of the year.  Can we note the correspondence to which we might come back after the summer recess?  Having regard to a number of other issues, including a couple of unintended programmes or coverage of events that led to greater losses for RT&Eacute;, we should keep an eye on the matter.  We could consider inviting RT&Eacute; representatives to come back before the committee at the latter end of the year.  I ask that we include it in our work programme for discussion.  I know that they do not have to come before us, but they could do so voluntarily.  On the issue of individual contracts, we need to keep an eye on the matter.  Given that RT&Eacute; has stated it will continue the review over the summer months, we might write to it when we come back after the summer recess.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019062700002#C00200","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1561622400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Is it agreed that we ask for information from RT&Eacute; at the end of September?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019062700002#C00300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1561622400,"counter":12,"content":"<p>That is fair.

One such piece of information was the exit surveys that are done if somebody leaves the Garda.  We wondered whether there had emerged among Garda stations a pattern of reasons for leaving.  In one station, anecdotally at least, there seemed to be a suggestion of bullying and similar issues.  While we cannot say that was the case, we asked for a flavour of what was coming up in the exit surveys.  We do not want individuals' names or other details.

I propose with the individual&rsquo;s permission that we forward the matter to the appropriate sectoral committee for any action it deems appropriate.  It relates to climate change policy which arose at our meeting on the cost of the State purchasing carbon credits from other countries.  However, this is a policy issue and we will pass it on to the relevant committee.<\/p> <p>  No. 2251C from Deputy Kate O'Connell, dated 14 June 2019, was also held over from the last meeting.  The Deputy requests further details regarding information provided by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in relation to Tusla at the meeting on 13 June.  The secretariat has included this request in the follow-up information requested from the Department.  We note the Deputy's request and look forward to receiving the information.<\/p> <p>  No. 2252C is from Wind Aware Ireland, WAI, dated 14 June 2019 regarding renewable energy and emissions targets.  While I made some comments recently on information provided to the committee regarding costs related to carbon emissions, this is ultimately a policy matter.  The letter raises more queries than that.  WAI has contacted the committee before.  It produced a document some time ago on the cost of wind energy in Ireland report.  We received a copy of it and decided that it was not a matter for the committee but more for the respective sectoral committee.  WAI has now come back expressing confusion as to why the Committee of Public Accounts was debating the issue having indicated on 7 February 2018 that it had no oversight in the area.  It asks that if we are examining the issue of the cost of meeting EU targets that WAI be included in our discussion.  The reason it arose the last day was that officials from the Department were before the committee and we were dealing with the cost of purchase credits.  It is not our policy area but we are looking at the financial aspects.  I can understand WAI's point as we said we would not discuss it but that cost issue arose as part of the departmental vote.  The letter stated that we may have confused the issue in relation to emission targets and that they are a good idea but that renewable targets are useless unless they are linked to emission reductions.  We will note that correspondence.  It is an issue that will be debated further, and I believe a special committee will be established on climate change.  When that happens it will be in its direct remit.  Financial matters in relation to all these issues will continue to arise at this committee, but not policy issues.<\/p> <p>  No. 2260C from an individual dated 18 June 2019 is further correspondence in relation to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.  This relates to the use of test cases where there are a number of similar cases in the appeals office and where there are a number of workers engaged with the same employer who have individually submitted an appeal.  They often look to make a sample decision on a number of cases, probably to see if there a systematic issue involved.<\/p><p>Perhaps it is a way for them to build up their knowledge so they can deal with the cases more straightforwardly and on an individual basis.

This will be of interest to members but the recommendations are ultimately policy matters.  While the committee will forward this directly to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government for any action it may deem appropriate, we note that IBEC's correspondence states:<\/p><blockquote>The collection of commercial rates must be improved [IBEC has included charts showing the collection rate] ... The revaluation process must be scrutinised including timelines and costs, with a view to expediting the process.  The work of the Valuation Office and the Valuation Tribunal must be examined.  Finally, we are calling for a full review of local government finance, including examination of replacing the commercial and domestic property taxes with a site or land value tax.<\/blockquote> <p>This is clearly a Government policy issue.  The committee will, however, follow up on one aspect.  The Valuation Office has been before the committee previously and it was included in our periodic report.  We were very unhappy with the office's slow progress in doing its first valuation and even at this point, which is 15 years after the legislation was passed, it has not even got to some counties.  The committee will write to the Valuation Office to ask for a full update on its work programme and which counties have been revalued.  We will also ask for a summary of the outcome with regard to the percentages of rate payers who have experienced an increase or decrease or no significant change.  The Valuation Office has those figures and has been quoting them extensively.  We would like to see those figures on a county by county basis.  We particularly want to find out if some counties have been revalued a second time while some counties have not been revalued a first time.  The committee will want a detailed explanation and a detailed timetable.  That issue was covered in an earlier periodic report and it is now incumbent on the committee to follow up our own previous periodic report.  We shall not, however, get into the policy of the matter.

The Local Government (Rates) Bill 2018 was before the select committee yesterday.  The Minister brought forward a series of amendments.  The Chairman has touched on the Valuation Office.  We have had the Valuation Office in before this committee.  Some of the particular points we raised covered the tardiness in fulfilling that process and the impact this has on businesses.  I put this point to senior officials yesterday.  The assistant secretary pointed out that in the last number of years we have gone from a situation where there were perhaps a couple of hundred cases on appeal with the Valuation Office to a situation where there are now more than 1,000 businesses appealing valuations.  I have asked officials what is the cumulative figure.  I do not know if the Comptroller and Auditor General knows the figure - or if it is the Tax Appeals Commission - on what is the cumulative figure, with regard to net worth, for more than 1,000 businesses that have appeals currently with the Valuation Office.  Obviously there is a serious issue with the Valuation Office in conducting the business in the first place and now the fact that there are more than 1,000 cases on appeal.<\/p> <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il brought forward proposals at the select committee providing for an inability to pay clause for the Bill, which will be on Report and Final Stages next Wednesday, 3 July.  This is in the context of the revaluation process whereby - due to the Valuation Office's tardiness - a business might get hit with a significant increase in one fell swoop.  A person could be hit with that cost in the following year.  Fianna F&aacute;il's proposal sought to stagger that cost over a course of payments.  Both of those amendments were rejected on Committee Stage yesterday and I want this on the record.  IBEC has put forward its position paper on the rates to this committee this morning.  We are in a situation - as the committee has dealt with previously - where &euro;1.5 billion was raised off commercial rates.  This has increased by 14% over the past decade and is the main contributor to the funding of local government, yet the Local Government (Rates) Bill 2018, which will go on to Report Stage next Wednesday will not deal with the significant issues of businesses facing an inability to pay outside of the greater Dublin area.  This is a serious issue.  Perhaps the Comptroller and Auditor General has this figure.  I have asked the senior officials in the Department about this also.  The Valuation Office has in excess of 1,000 appeals on its books.  The Valuation Office could not give me a timeline for how quickly the cases would be taken off the books or for how long on average the businesses are waiting for a valuation on appeal to be dealt with.  This is a serious issue also for this committee because the Valuation Office was before the committee for a whole day.  It did not deal with the valuations, and as a result of yesterday's meeting we can see that it is not dealing with the appeals in a timely fashion either.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019062700002#F00600","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speech","time":1561622400,"counter":75,"content":"<p>For clarification purposes the Comptroller and Auditor General might be able to help us on this.

Having had a fresh look at that schedule, if members want to raise it at a subsequent meeting, then they should feel free to do so.<\/p> <p>  I shall now turn to statement of accounts received since the last meeting.  There are four items. The Marine Institute is a clear audit opinion.  The National University of Ireland, Maynooth is a clear audit opinion.  Attention is drawn by the Comptroller and Auditor General to the recognition of a deferred pension funding asset, standard for universities, which is a provision of &euro;750,000 in the university statement of comprehensive income and expenditure on impairment of a loan to a loss-making subsidiary company set up to commercialise intellectual property and to provide consultancy and training services.  I will ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to comment on this shortly.  Fishery Harbour Centres accounts present a clear audited opinion.   The Credit Union Fund accounts are in with a clear audit opinion.  I invite the Comptroller and Auditor General to comment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019062700002#F01300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1561622400,"counter":82,"content":"<p>On the National University of Ireland, Maynooth situation, the financial statements recognise that effectively a loan will not be paid back by their subsidiary.

The audit of the 2018 appropriation account is ongoing.  The Department's gross expenditure for that year was approximately &euro;14.8 billion.  The majority of that, &euro;14.6 billion, was paid to the HSE, spread across 17 subheads in the appropriation account.  Supplementary spending provisions were made during 2017 in respect of seven of the HSE subheads, totalling &euro;195 million.  Receipts to the Vote in 2017 totalled &euro;459 million, almost the same as in 2016.  Those receipts comprised mainly &euro;278 million received from the UK under a bilateral agreement on reimbursement for treatment provided under EU regulations, and receipts of just over &euro;167 million from the proceeds of excise duties on tobacco products.  The surplus liable for surrender to the Exchequer at end 2017 was just under &euro;2.4 million.<\/p> <p>  I turn to the HSE financial statements, which relate to the calendar year 2018.  They are prepared on an accruals basis.  Unusually, they include both a revenue or recurrent income and expenditure account, and a separate capital income and expenditure account.  The law provides for the Minister for Health to specify the accounting standards and framework to be applied by the HSE in the preparation of its financial statements.  The basis for the framework applied is financial reporting standard, FRS, 102, but the Minister has formally directed that a number of exceptions to that standard should be applied.  Such directions have been duly applied since the HSE was established in 2005, and those applying in 2018 are listed in note 1 to the financial statements.<\/p> <p>  I have drawn attention in my audit report to a new direction of the Minister for the 2018 financial statements, in relation to accounting for a liability arising from a legal settlement with medical consultants agreed during 2018.  At the end of 2018, the liability is estimated to be around &euro;198 million.  In accordance with the accounting standards specified by the Minister, the HSE has not recognised this liability in its financial statements.  Because the HSE had made a provision in 2008 of &euro;68 million in expectation of a pay-out on foot of the consultants' claim, that had to be reversed in the 2018 financial statements.<\/p> <p>  My audit opinion was not modified in respect of this matter because the financial statements conform to the standards statutorily specified.  However, I have drawn attention to the ministerial direction, because it represents a substantial change in the HSE's accounting practice that might not otherwise be readily identified by users of the financial statements, in particular for the period 2018 to 2020, during which the settlement payments will be made.<\/p> <p>  The HSE's recurrent income in 2018 was just over &euro;16 billion, which is an increase of approximately &euro;932 million, or 6.2% on 2017.  The majority of that, &euro;15.2 billion, is Exchequer funding from the Department of Health's vote.  The remaining income comprises retained superannuation and pension levy deductions from staff salaries, totalling just under &euro;420 million, and patient fee income of approximately &euro;406 million.  Recurrent expenditure by the HSE in 2018 was &euro;16.1 billion, representing an increase of approximately &euro;877 million, or 5.8% on 2017.  As shown in figure 1, which is now on the screen, the majority of this spend was across four main areas in 2018.<\/p> <p>  At the end of 2018, the HSE reported a net operating deficit of just over &euro;85 million.  In accordance with the Health Act 2004, the deficit has been carried forward and will be met from the funding provided from the Department of Health's vote for 2019.<\/p> <p>  My report on the audit also draws attention to a continuing material level of HSE non-compliance with procurement rules.  I have repeatedly reported on, and drawn attention to, the matter.  While the HSE acknowledges the problem, it is still not in a position to quantify the value of its expenditure on goods and services where public procurement procedures were not complied with.<\/p> <p>  Each year, we examine samples of procurements at a number of HSE locations to test whether there has been an appropriate competitive process.  For the past five years, the estimated percentage of non-compliant procurement found in the sample has fluctuated between 14% and 49% by value.  Because there is not a single procurement database in the HSE, the results are specific to procurement practice at the sampled locations, and cannot be extrapolated to the HSE as a whole.  I need here to make a correction to the record.  In my audit report for the 2018 financial statements, I refer to the audit sample testing at five locations indicating a level of procurement non-compliance of 30% by value.  In preparing for this meeting, my team discovered a calculation error.  The correct non-compliance rate for the 2018 sample was, in fact, 23% by value.  However, I am satisfied that this does not alter the conclusion I drew in my report.  I regret that a figure that was materially incorrect was given in the report.  Our long-standing policy in such circumstances is always to correct the record of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann at the earliest available opportunity.<\/p> <p>  I will turn now to chapter 16.  As Members will be aware, public hospitals treat both public and private patients.  Although the bulk of the HSE's income is from voted funds, it depends on receiving significant fee income related to treatment of private patients.  On the other hand, to ensure equitable access by individuals to hospital services, the HSE seeks to limit private treatment activity in acute public hospitals to 20%.  Medical consultants' contracts provide for them to carry out varying levels of private activity.<\/p> <p>  Chapter 16 considers how the HSE controls the level of private activity in public hospitals, and assesses how the HSE measures performance in that regard at the national level, in individual hospitals and for medical consultants.  Measurement of public and private activity in acute hospitals is based on the hospital inpatient enquiry, HIPE, system, which monitors inpatient and day case activity only.  Emergency department and outpatient attendances are not within the scope of the measurement.  As a result, the measure is not well defined.  In addition, many public acute hospitals and individual consultants may have limited control over their private activity levels.  For example, the majority of patients admitted as inpatients to many hospitals enter from the emergency department, or are maternity admissions, and elective admissions must be treated in order of clinical priority.<\/p> <p>  The percentage of public inpatient activity carried out varies significantly from hospital to hospital, as indicated in figures 16.4 and 16.5 in the chapter.  However, it is difficult to draw meaningful conclusions from that, since public and private activity targets have not been set at an individual hospital level.<\/p><p>Varying rates of health insurance among catchment populations may be a significant factor in that regard.  There are significant variations in the conditions of employment applying to medical consultants in respect of the private activity they undertake.  Contracts allows for rates from zero to 30%.  However, the HSE was unable to provide outturn data in this regard because it does not monitor or collate information about private treatment levels at an individual consultant level.<\/p><p> The overall conclusion of the chapter is that there are significant weaknesses in the performance measures used by the HSE to monitor public private activity levels within the acute hospitals system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019062700002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1561622400,"counter":105,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy.

As Accounting Officer for the Department of Health's Vote 38, I am pleased to be here to deal with the 2017 annual report and appropriations accounts of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The other item on today's agenda, the 2018  financial statements of the HSE, will be addressed in the first instance by Mr. Reid, as the accountable person for those accounts.  Since 2015, under the provisions of the Health Service Executive (Financial Matters) Act 2014, funding of the HSE is provided from the Vote of the Minister for Health, that is, Vote 38.  Accordingly, in 2017, the Department was responsible for a budget of &euro;14.341 billion for the salaries and expenses of the office of the Minister and certain other services administered by that office, including grants to the HSE and to a range of other research, consultative, regulatory and advisory bodies.  The budget includes the additional &euro;195 million provided by Government in 2017 to the health Vote by way of a Supplementary Estimate.<\/p> <p>  I will now set out the main points of the 2017 Vote 38 accounts.  Funding is allocated to the Department in respect of its own costs and in respect of grants to a range of bodies under the aegis of the Department, including the HSE, the Mental Health Commission, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI, and the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA.  The Department's role is to support the Minister in providing strategic leadership for the health service and to ensure Government policies are translated into actions and implemented effectively.  We support the Minister and Ministers of State in their implementation of Government policy and in discharging their governmental, parliamentary and departmental duties.<\/p> <p>  Much of the public debate tends to be on weaknesses in our health services.  Identifying measures to address those issues, in association with our colleagues in the HSE, undoubtedly demands continuing work on the part of the staff of the Department.  The Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy defines this reform agenda, which is ambitious in scope and intended progressively to improve the accessibility and quality of services over a ten-year period.  The Department has established a Sl&aacute;intecare programme office and is working closely with the HSE, other Departments and a range of stakeholders to implement reforms.<\/p> <p>  More generally, the Department seeks to frame policies and legislation to promote health.  Under the Healthy Ireland umbrella, we work cross-sectorally to achieve this objective.  Life expectancy in Ireland in 2017 was 82.2 years, which was 1.3 years above the EU 28 average.  It has increased by 3.2 years between 2005 and 2017.  We also work internationally with EU colleagues and the World Health Organization, WHO, on health issues.  Currently, considerable work is under way with the EU and the United Kingdom to address the health challenges caused by Brexit and to ensure that North-South and east-west co-operation on health matters is maintained.  In addition, we support the Minister and Ministers of State in their work, including their legislative priorities and their public and parliamentary accountability.  For example, in 2018, the Department processed almost 11,500 parliamentary questions, representing 23% of all parliamentary questions tabled to Ministers across government.<\/p> <p>  The 2017 gross provision, current and capital, for Vote 38 was &euro;14.801 billion.  The 2017 outturn was almost &euro;14.798 billion and there was an overall surplus of &euro;2.3 million.  This was after accounting for a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;195 million.  Of the 2017 gross provision for current expenditure, &euro;204 million was provided to the Department-related subheads in respect of its own costs and in respect of grants to agencies under the aegis of the Department, other than the HSE.  The 2017 outturn for these subheads was &euro;189 million, giving an underspend of &euro;15 million.  There was &euro;14.040 billion of the 2017 gross provision for current expenditure provided to HSE-related subheads.  The 2017 outturn for these subheads was &euro;14.052 billion, giving an overspend of &euro;12 million.  The overspend primarily related to funding the existing level of service in both acute and community services and pension costs.  This overspend was met from savings elsewhere in the Vote.  The 2017 provision for capital expenditure was &euro;557 million and the 2017 outturn was &euro;557 million.  The 2017 appropriations-in-aid to the health Vote was &euro;1 million short of profile, at &euro;459 million.  The end-year net outturn for current and capital spending was &euro;14.339 billion, against a net provision of &euro;14.341 billion, resulting in a saving to the Exchequer of the aforementioned &euro;2.3 million.<\/p> <p>  While I am here in the context of the appropriation accounts for 2017, I am conscious that the committee has expressed concerns in respect of the accounting treatment of the consultant pay arrears in the HSE's annual financial statements for 2018.  I assure members that there is nothing untoward about this, and there were very good reasons that the Department considered it to be the most appropriate course of action.  This was a purely technical solution to address the specific characteristics of the consultant settlement.  As the committee will be aware, consultants took a High Court case regarding their dispute on the non-implementation of pay increases under the 2008 consultant contract.  Those increases were not implemented over the intervening period due to the financial emergency.  Had the State lost that court case, the reinstatement of increases with full retrospection would have required an immediate payout running to hundreds of millions of euro.  Instead, the State negotiated a settlement in June 2018 that capped the historic element at less than 55% and achieved an agreement to pay this out over two subsequent years, in 2019 and 2020.  This involves additional once-off payments, which were estimated at &euro;73 million in 2019 and &euro;109 million in 2020, in respect of the historic element of the settlement.  Payment of the increases due from the date of settlement to the end of December 2018 was also deferred to 2019.  The ongoing cost of the settlement was estimated at &euro;62 million on an annual basis.  Agreement for payment over the two years, 2019 and 2020, represented a very substantive benefit to the State of the settlement agreement as, in the event of a court award, the State could have been faced with a requirement for immediate payment of higher salaries and pensions and very significant arrears.<\/p> <p>  Under section 36 of the Health Act 2004, the HSE prepares its financial statements in accordance with standards specified by the Minister.  These, for the most part, reflect financial reporting standards.  However, several exceptions have been made through specific policy directions, including in respect of future pension liabilities, liabilities under the clinical indemnity scheme, depreciation and capital grants.  In light of the specific characteristics associated with the consultant settlement, it was decided to direct the HSE to apply a \"receipts and payments\" convention so that recognition of the expenditure arising from the agreement would be appropriately matched with future funding from the Department of Health Vote.  The reason for this approach was to acknowledge the special and unique characteristics of the settlement which, from a State budgetary perspective, was successfully spread over a subsequent two-year period.<\/p> <p>  The substance of the agreement upon which the cases were settled informed the approach taken.  Had the full liability been recorded in the HSE's 2018 accounts, regardless of the fact that payment was not due until 2019 and 2020, the deficit arising would, under health legislation, have been required to be offset against 2019 funding.  This would have reduced the funding available for the delivery of health services in 2019 since, under the settlement, some &euro;109 million in once-off payments do not fall due for payment until 2020 and the funding for them will not be provided until then.  This additional direction for 2018, in respect of the non-recognition of that liability, is time bound and will only apply until 2020.  Different options were considered by the Department and the HSE to address the issue on a transparent basis.  The direction that issued to the HSE was incorporated in the finalised annual financial statements approved by the HSE directorate.<\/p> <p>  I am happy to take any questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019062700002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Breslin"},{"type":"speech","time":1561622400,"counter":107,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Breslin.

The senior management colleagues joining me today are Ms Anne O'Connor, deputy director general of operations; Mr. Stephen Mulvany, chief financial officer; Mr. Joe Ryan, national director of national services; and Ms Mair&eacute;ad Dolan, assistant chief financial officer.<\/p><p>We have submitted information and documentation to the committee in advance of this meeting and I will therefore confine my opening remarks to the following issues.<br\/><br\/>The first is the financial outturn for 2018.  The HSE's annual financial statements record a final audited revenue income and expenditure deficit of &euro;85.1 million.  Further detail is set out in the finance briefing paper provided to the committee in advance of this meeting, including around the movement in provisions and how this figure can be related to the final HSE published quarterly performance report for 2018.  The 2018 final position is arrived at after dealing with the &euro;140 million first charge for 2017 and after receipt of a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;625 million, the application of which has also been detailed.  The annual financial statement also records a &euro;16 million surplus on the capital account, which will be available to progress capital projects in 2019.<br\/><br\/>The most significant areas of financial pressure reflected in the year-end position relate to the pensions and demand-led areas, including the primary care reimbursement service.  Costs in these areas are generally driven by policy, legislative entitlements and demographic factors and, as such, they are not amenable to normal financial management controls.  Separately, our operational service areas experienced significant difficulty in reducing costs to meet savings targets, controlling staffing levels and responding to demand within budget.  Disability services were the area of greatest financial pressure within community services.  This pressure largely related to the costs of providing residential care to people with an intellectual disability, with the evolving needs of existing clients as they age and the demand for new places exceeding our funded capacity.  We also experienced similar pressures within our acute hospital services where activity was ahead of planned and funded levels, with a very high proportion of total activity arriving via our accident and emergency departments.<br\/><br\/>With respect to financial management for 2019, the HSE's first priority for implementing its 2019 national service plan, NSP, is to maximise the safety of the services it can deliver within the available budget.  Thereafter the priority, consistent with the Sl&aacute;intecare programme, is to deliver on the activity, access, improvement and other targets set out in the NSP, albeit this must be done within the affordable staffing level and without exceeding the overall budget.  Delivering these priorities will require a significantly enhanced focus on financial management.  This includes better controls on the management of agency, overtime and overall staffing levels and pay costs.  Senior managers will be supported and held to account in this regard.  The HSE&rsquo;s financial position for the year to date until March 2019 shows a revenue deficit of &euro;82.7 million, which represents 2.2% of the available budget.  Of this, &euro;44.8 million is in respect of greater than expected expenditure on operational service areas, which includes &euro;17.6 million on community services, mostly in respect of services for people with a disability, and &euro;28.4 million in respect of acute hospital services.<br\/><br\/>In cases where deficits appear in operational service areas, the relevant national director, community healthcare organisation chief officer or hospital group chief executive has been directed to identify and put in place additional measures to enable delivery of an overall financial break-even by year end.  This has been supported by a series of additional interim controls around agency, overtime and staffing, although all 2018 and 2019 developments approved and funded by the Department of Health are proceeding.<br\/><br\/>There is also a deficit of &euro;38 million in pensions and demand-led areas.  Options to limit deficits in these areas are being explored, albeit they are primarily driven by legislation, policy and demographic factors and, as mentioned, are therefore not generally amenable to normal management control efforts.  It is noted that if the effect of the 2018 first charge were to be reflected in the March results above, it would increase the overall March year to date variance by &euro;20.5 million to &euro;103.2 million, the change being predominantly within the pensions and demand-led areas.  The overall 2018 annual financial statement process came to an end on 13 May and the full first charge will be reflected in the monthly accounts from May onwards.  The necessary focus on delivering financial break-even reflects the HSE's legal obligation.  It will also benefit service users, patients and their families as it is consistent with the need to build trust and confidence in the organisation.  This is necessary so that additional investment in our public health and social care services over and above the cost of standing still can be secured over the next five to ten years.  This will facilitate the vision set out in the Sl&aacute;intecare report to be realised.<br\/><br\/>The next matter is procurement.  The scale and complexity of the HSE's overall procurement activity are such that it will take a sustained effort and continuing investment over a number of years in order to ensure high levels of compliance and this is a key focus for the HSE.  The HSE incurs procurable expenditure in excess of &euro;2.2 billion annually.  The HSE continues to progress a transformational programme of reform of its procurement function to improve compliance with public procurement regulations and increase the usage of contracts awarded by the HSE and the Office of Government Procurement.  It has been highlighted and acknowledged at previous meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts that it will take a number of years to fully address procurement compliance issues.  Health business services, HBS, procurement has been engaged in a major transformational change programme and the HBS strategy for 2017 to 2019 continues this strategic and operational transformation of health sector procurement.  With regard to procurement reform and, in particular, non-health procurable expenditure, the HBS function works closely with the Office of Government Procurement.  This collaborative effort with the OGP is achieving value for money and contributing to an increase in overall procurement compliance and the development of the overall procurement reform program.<br\/><br\/>With regard to chapter 16 of the Comptroller and Auditor General Report for 2017, the HSE is undertaking extensive work in embedding the consultant contract compliance framework.  The framework seeks to support improved reporting, monitoring and overall consultant contract compliance.  The elements of compliance with public-private mix will be reported on a monthly basis and compliance with work plan and off-site practice will be reported on an annual basis.  In line with the performance and accountability framework, monthly performance meetings are held within existing structures and a key element includes improving consultant contract compliance.  Actions to address the areas of individual consultant non-compliance in terms of hours worked, off-site practice and public-private mix are progressed at local level.  A programme of internal audit has commenced and a number of hospitals are being scheduled, with Cappagh National Orthopaedic Hospital being the first, followed by Tallaght University Hospital and Naas General Hospital.  Further sites will be scheduled for audit in the coming weeks.  Overall summary rates of compliance for public-private mix are below the limit of 20% for private practice.  The percentage for acute hospitals inpatients is 12.5% and it is 14.5% for day cases.<br\/><br\/>With regard to outsourcing home support services, voluntary organisations have been engaged with and contributed significantly to the provision and ongoing development of the health and social care services in Ireland over many generations.  The term &quot;voluntary&quot; is often used when referring to section 38 and section 39 agencies.  Sections 38 and 39 of the Health Act 2004 legally underpin the provision of services by non-statutory providers on behalf of the HSE - section 38 - and the provision of services similar or ancillary to a service that the HSE may provide - section 39.  The HSE has a continuing reliance on voluntary agencies to deliver services across the domains of acute care, social care, mental health and primary care supports and services.  The HSE funds approximately 2,279 organisations, including 16 large voluntary hospitals via a contract or service arrangement process that is legally binding.  This also includes funding for many smaller organisations such as local meals on wheels groups, which provide services through unpaid volunteers.<br\/><br\/>The HSE acknowledges that voluntary organisations largely funded by the State need to operate within defined policy and regulatory frameworks, including HIQA, charities regulation and company law, as well as public pay policy.  We also have a responsibility to optimise value for money and to ensure that health resources are maximised to benefit the citizen.  In line with Sl&aacute;intecare, health service reform also includes voluntary organisations funded by the HSE.  Voluntary agencies that provide home support services have made significant progress in reforming their services.<font color=\"#004080\"> <\/font>These organisations are significant partners in the provision of home support, particularly in the greater Dublin area and the mid west.  These voluntary agencies have transitioned from a position where they were supported by the HSE through block grant arrangements to the current tender model of service provision.  This reform has improved the quality of home support, providing a model of service delivery that is more responsive to demand and more consistent across community healthcare organisations.  Streamlining of home support services has resulted in a single application and assessment process.  There is also clearer financial and activity reporting, which provides for greater accountability and transparency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019062700002#K00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1561622400,"counter":110,"content":"<p>The lead speaker today is Deputy Jonathan O'Brien, who will have 20 minutes.

This had direct implications for the capital plan where initially a &euro;25 million contribution was sought.

Why has it taken from February to June to deal with the issues that have arisen?  There is a bit of confusion.  Only last Thursday in the D&aacute;il, the Minister for Finance said there would be no cuts or projects delayed in any Department due to the issues with the national broadband plan or the overrun with the national children&rsquo;s hospital costs.  He stated:<\/p><blockquote>...as a result of the decisions made on broadband, and in dealing with the national children's hospital, I will not change other projects.

Obviously, the challenge for us in the HSE overall is to look at how we can get more predictable in terms of our outturn towards the year end.

I have been around the country in the past number of weeks in a lot of hospitals and community organisations and have seen at first hand the great and very inspiring work done by our teams and staff at front-line level.  It is highly respected by me, to state the obvious.  I am very aware of the acute pressures they are under and of the pressures on our community overall.  What we are setting out to do is look at the budgets allocated across each area to ensure any available funds we have are focused on patients and patient services.  A process is ongoing where the chief financial officer and I are meeting with all the group CEOs of the acutes, all the chief community officers and all the national directors.  We have been doing that over the past five weeks or so.  It is looking out at the spend to date, where the pressures on each of the services are, the forecasted outturn if we continue in a certain run rate and the level of controls we can put on areas within our control.

There are no cuts planned in terms of budget and delivery this year.  We plan to deliver the actual services set out in the national services plan and to outturn with the budget we have been allocated.  I feel the need to say that because I know there is a perception.  No cuts are planned.  It is setting out to deliver against the budget we have been allocated.  In doing that, we want to ensure this is the right approach from a patient perspective and for those who use our services whereby we are directing our funds to where they are needed.  That is an approach we have been going on.  On the Deputy's specific question on the monthly profiles and accounts, it is nothing hugely new in terms of what we are setting out to do.  However, we are breaking down the budget by each hospital group and hospital manager, by each community organisation, etc., and setting out the profile for the year end so that everyone has clear oversight.  It is so that we can be more predictable about the outturn and, equally, from a patient perspective that we are injecting the funds and directing them into patient-focused areas.  I will look at other areas of budget that are not patient focused where we can make savings and direct those to where we have the big pressure points.  My perspective on controls is that it is good financial management on this one.  It is right for the public and for the patients who use our services.  They will benefit from it.  It will give us a level of predictability and it will give me a case, as Director General of the HSE, to make to Government on where we want to invest for the future as set out in Sl&aacute;intecare.  I want us to strengthen financial predictability in the HSE, determine the forecasted future investment needed and to ensure future investment when we succeed in getting it is directed into a new way of delivering services.  That involves the monthly controls and the focus we are putting in.<\/p><p>I have to say again for the record that I have had great engagement with all the hospital groups and managers.

The reality is the cuts to services come when the budget is allocated initially at the start of the year when the service plan is being drafted.  The HSE has to cut several areas to meet the budget allocation given.  Mr. Reid may say there will be no cuts to services throughout the year based on the budget the HSE has been given.  However, I would challenge anyone who would claim that the budget the HSE gets to deliver adequate services to the community is not hampered by the budget given by the Department.

I would like to bring another matter home to Mr. Reid in Galway city.  The committee has received correspondence from a consultant.  It is unusual for consultants to go out on a limb, but this consultant has done so repeatedly.  I will outline some figures which show that in the end the cost to the Exchequer is greater.  The aforementioned consultant states there is a \"catastrophic\" - his word, not mine -  waiting list of 2,000 patients which has been accumulating since the shortfall in infrastructure and that the situation is becoming unbearable for the patients who are on the waiting list and clinically worsening.  I will not read the entirety of what he had to say, but Mr. Reid can have a copy of the letter, if he so wishes.  <\/p> <p>  The hospital serves a region of almost 1 million people.  Why do I mention that?  Mr. Breslin spoke about answering parliamentary questions, which he does very efficiently, but some of them are redirected to various groups on the ground, including Saolta.  I cannot make head nor tail of what they are telling me on this issue.  Briefly, two operating theatres have ceased to exist.  While the Government is talking about a rainy day fund, as a result of rain pouring in on two theatres in Galway, they were closed in 2017.  We are now in 2019 and no modular theatres have been put in place.  This is about infrastructure, decision making and accountability in the Department of Health.  The Minister responded on 5 March that he understood the position of Saolta, but the reality was different.  In a nutshell, it involved the procurement of two modular theatres.  The procurement process was stopped when it was discovered very late in the process that planning permission was needed.  That led to the aforementioned letter.

They can then go through that with the consultant to see whether that is wrong.  The consultant might be able to come up with satisfactory reasons, including accuracy.

I have no problem whatsoever with Mr. Reid and the HSE ensuring that health spending is contained.  That is one of Mr. Reid's and the HSE's core functions and it should be.  I have no problem, therefore, with that.  I certainly accept that he has come into this job to ensure that he plays his part in making sure that patients get the best healthcare.  I again have no difficulty with that.  However, I tabled a parliamentary question to seek information on the outpatient waiting times across all specialties over five years.  That was to get a sense of where the pressure points are in University Hospital Waterford and to see if solutions were being put in place to reduce the waiting times.  In fact, the waiting times have all gone up where the pressure points are.<\/p> <p>  I will give some examples.  In dermatology, almost 5,000 patients were waiting to see a consultant.  Of those, 1,576 were waiting for one to two years and 665 for two to three years.  Turning to orthopaedics, which has been a problem for many years, 1,267 patients were waiting for one to two years and 959 between two and three years.  There was a major problem as well with the ear, nose and throat department waiting lists, where 2,805 patients were waiting between one and two years and 1,500 between two and three years.  Urology and dermatology similarly have problems and have done so consistently for the last five or six years.  <\/p> <p>  One of my functions as an Oireachtas Member, along with other local Oireachtas Members, is meeting regularly with the hospital group hospital managers.  We have a good relationship with them.  They point out to us where the pressure points are and unless capacity is increased in these areas the wait times are not going to go down.  Mr. Reid has just written to all hospital managers to state, essentially, that they should come in on budget.  Is there flexibility with that demand?  I refer to a situation where extra funding is needed to reduce waiting times in areas where there are obvious pressures and where large numbers of people have been waiting for two, three or even four years.  Is there flexibility in that case for the HSE to accept that is fair enough and allow the extra resources to be committed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019062700002#T00700","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1561622400,"counter":399,"content":"<p>I will touch briefly on some of the comments Deputy Cullinane has made and I will answer his specific question.  He mentioned that there has been an extra budget allocation for the past five or six years and the situation with waiting times has not got much better.  I do not disagree with the Deputy but that is factual.  The issue of waiting times is a priority for me in working with the system.  Directing extra funds at the problem has not actually addressed the issue.  I think that is a challenge for all of us.  I know Deputy Cullinane was involved in the development of Sl&aacute;intecare, as was the whole Oireachtas.  The challenge for all of us is that extra money has been put in for the last five or six years but that has not worked.  We have to do something different and I am committed to doing that.  I want us to look at the health system, where we fund it and how we address the service needs of the patients we are serving in a much better and different way.  Sl&aacute;intecare does set out a road map for doing that.  However, we have to start utilising our budgets in a different way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019062700002#T00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid"},{"type":"speech","time":1561622400,"counter":400,"content":"<p>There also has to be an examination of where the money goes.  I always look at things logically.  There will be different situations in different hospitals.  They will all have different needs, different geography, different capacity and different levels of expertise in different specialties.  They all have their unique characteristics.  One thing that we can logically do regarding waiting times, in Waterford and other hospitals, is to look at where the pressure points have been over a number of years.  It will then be possible to identify where the problems lie.  Solutions then have to be found and, in some of these cases, there are.<\/p> <p>  That brings me to the capital plan.  I think Mr. Reid had discussions on this earlier with Deputy Jonathan O'Brien.  A number of business cases have been made by the hospitals groups to go the hospital management to solve some of the problems.  I am trying to explore how that process works from conception to completion when a business case is made.  I have had some discussions with Mr. Breslin and Mr. Reid's predecessor in the past on, for example, a second cath lab in Waterford and a new mortuary.  The mortuary was in the capital schedule since 2013.  The money was only freed up and made available this year.  <\/p> <p>  Sometimes the hospitals and the hospital groups do their jobs, identify the business cases and go to the HSE.  Then we have to wait for years.  In the meantime, the waiting times go up.  I talked about ophthalmology.  There is also a business case for a new eye clinic in University Hospital Waterford.  I also spoke about orthopaedics and there is a business case for a new centre of excellence for orthopaedics which will involve moving some of the services from Kilcreene Orthopaedic Hospital in Kilkenny into University Hospital Waterford.  Deputy Jonathan O'Brien talked about cancer care earlier.  Six of the eight hospitals have robotic technologies that can be more precise in surgeries and as a result deliver better outcomes while cutting waiting times.  University Hospital Waterford is not one of those hospitals.  It is a cancer centre but it does not have that robotic technology.  The consultants there have sought it and they have developed business cases.<\/p> <p>  My question concerns how this process works.  That is the frustrating part for us as public representatives and that is where we come under pressure.  I refer to situations where business cases are developed to address obvious needs but they go through a long complicated process that sometimes takes years before change is delivered.  The mortuary in Waterford is a case in point.  Will Mr. Reid talk me through how that process regarding capital funding works from conception to delivery?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019062700002#T00900","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1561622400,"counter":401,"content":"<p>I did want to come back to the question that Deputy Cullinane posed the last time.  I apologise for not addressing it.  He asked me whether there was a mandate for managers, hospital groups and clinicians that see a need to spend extra funds for particular demands to go ahead and do it.  The answer is \"No\".  We work with a budget.  We are putting a monthly process in place, however, where we will be working closely with all the hospital managers groups and community.  That will allow us to be able to predict where there are extra demands and where we might be able to find some capacity.  I think that is good practice and we may be able to reallocate some funds for particular items.  I think that will be welcomed when we are talking closely.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the second issue, the Deputy addressed pressure points in the system where people have some good ideas.  I have been in University Hospital Waterford, University Hospital Galway, Mullingar Regional Hospital, St. Luke's General Hospital Kilkenny, Beaumont Hospital and many others.  I have seen some really good ideas and innovation at a local level.  There is some good innovation in emergency departments and in interactions between acute hospitals and community organisations.  There is also some good innovation and engagement involving general practitioners, GPs, and accident and emergency departments.  There are, therefore, many good local initiatives under way.  For me, this is not about waiting for a big bang initiative from Sl&aacute;intecare.  We need to implement these bottom-up initiatives and support them.  That is happening.

My specific question, however, was on capital projects and the perception that they can take a lifetime from conception to delivery.  It is almost like turning a big oil tanker around.

For example, there is a national maternity strategy, which was begun by the previous Government but published by the current Government.  I am 100% behind the strategy, given that it is one of the best strategies I have seen for any section in healthcare.  Just &euro;5 million is needed for the planning and design of a new maternity hospital in Limerick.  My children, my brother and I were born in the current hospital.  It is not fit for purpose.  Three years after the plan was published, the &euro;5 million is still being profiled and is not available.<\/p><p> This is our guests' opportunity.  I ask them not to give the answers they gave previously because I do not accept them.  They should be aware that we will return to whatever they state.  This is their one opportunity to be open and honest with the public.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019062700002#U06000","speaker":"1349","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1561622400,"counter":466,"content":"<p>We can give only the information we have on the day the Deputy asks the question.  When he asked the question on the previous occasion, we had the information that in 2019, &euro;75 million of the &euro;100 million excess cost on the children's hospital would be borne by the Exchequer and &euro;25 million by held capital.  That did not have a negative effect on the timing of projects but the question in our minds at that stage was what the split would be for 2020.  As of last Tuesday, the Government has put aside a reserve of &euro;200 million, which indicates there will be sufficient Exchequer money to meet the additional costs of the children's hospital without impact on other projects.<\/p> <p>  That may be immediately misinterpreted that we have so much capital that everything can be done at once.

There is a series of contracts.  If we go back, the 1997 contract might have variations whereby one person is not entitled to any private practice, in which case the private practice is 0%, while somebody else is entitled to private practice in public hospitals based on the percentage of beds designated as private in the hospital, which differs in various hospitals.  We could have hospitals with percentages of 15% or 25%.  Rolling forward, many people moved from the 1997 contract to the 2008 contract but at present there are still approximately 300 people working off the old 1997 contract.  In the 2008 contract there are perhaps three or four variations.  Again, there is a contract that is public only and consultants are not entitled to get private income; there is a contract under which people can do private practice but only in the hospital; and there is another contract that allows people to do private practice off site.  All of these affect the actual monitoring of activity.  Under the 2008 contract, if people are allowed to do private practice in a public hospital, it is at 20% of total activity, so for every four patients a consultant has, he or she can have one private patient and this is monitored.

Hospital consultants have made much commentary lately on pay restoration.  As Mr. Breslin will be aware, many consultants have left the system, which has been a challenge.  I refer to the brain drain due to the recession.  I am quite concerned by the increase in claims against the State and increase in locum use.  Is there any data to suggest that there is a correlation between the increase in litigation when one has a more fluid workforce rather than the standard?

It is generally based on multidisciplinary teams that develop a relationship over time and perform in a way where they know what the skills within the team are.  Undoubtedly, if the Deputy is asking what is the preference, it is to have permanent staff working in a continuous relationship with their colleagues.

I cannot see why we would fail to try to address that.  If the solution is permanent consultant staff who are happy to be paid, it seems an obvious course of action.<\/p> <p>  Finally, there are orphan drugs.  Mr. Reid mentioned the cost of the PCRS and so on.  In terms of a re-evaluating point for drugs that have been approved such as Orkambi, Spinraza and some of the more expensive drugs, I accept Spinraza has only been approved.  Those are merely two examples off the top of my head.  Is there any scope in the future, especially with drugs that did not necessarily meet the criteria of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics, NCPE, for re-evaluating the provision these drugs?

It is one with a significant cost.<\/p> <p>  On the assessment of them over time because, as the Deputy knows well, new drugs come on board, there is an ongoing assessment of the total spend we make through the PCRS and what other drugs are coming on stream that might help us mitigate some of those costs.

The framework we have in place now, where they make a return each year with their compliance statements, requires the boards of these organisations to review their procurement practices and make a declaration in that regard.  It is quite a binary test, in other words, one is either compliant or non-compliant, and there is no such thing as being substantially compliant.  This means the numbers in terms of compliance are quite low.  However, in monitoring the compliance from the point at which we did the review, we believe there have been significant improvements, first, in terms of the boards' own awareness of public procurement rules and understanding of what the obligations are in terms of spending public money, and, second, the control systems they are putting in place.<\/p> <p>  In terms of what HSE is doing about it, our own HBS, or health business services, procurement service is engaging with all of the section 38s affected, and it is running seminars and training sessions with them in terms of bringing their staff up to speed around procurement.  We have also made available to them the PAS procurement system, which shows all of the contracts that are in place for both the HSE and the Office of Government Procurement around the kind of goods and services they procure.<\/p> <p>  While the numbers look quite startling and most would be non-compliant, we believe they are on a journey towards being compliant.  Indicative of that would be that the number of organisations that have declared themselves compliant since the review has gone down, and they are saying they are non-compliant.  While that might seem perverse, it is simply becasue they have a heightened awareness of what it means to be compliant or not.  We think that is a journey towards actually improving over time.  As we establish the contract management support units, CMSUs, that will assist them in this regard. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019062700002#PP00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe Ryan"},{"type":"speech","time":1561622400,"counter":693,"content":"<p>I love the language.

I made an inquiry and got a nice response back from the general manager of disability services in the relevant area.  It was suggested to me that the individual, who is a single person, was being held in Mulroy Park, Carrigart, County Donegal.  The matter was subject to a court case lately on foot of an attempt to have the person relocated to the person's home county to be near the family.  It was suggested to me that the rent being paid for the property in Carrigart, County Donegal was &euro;600,000 per annum.  I made the person repeat it about 50 times to me because as a former auctioneer it struck me as being on the scale of the Miesian Plaza as opposed to Carrigart, County Donegal.  The response that came back was that the HSE does not rent the property, as referenced by me.  It went on to say that it had sourced Inspire Wellbeing.  What I would like to know is whether it is the case that we are resourcing a section 39 organisation to the extent that it can afford to pay rent of &euro;600,000 per year to look after one person, or is the information false?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019062700002#QQ00800","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1561622400,"counter":729,"content":"<p>I do not know.

It is about infrastructure.  As the witnesses are aware, in the north-west area the Daughters of Wisdom built Cregg House in 1965 and provide care to those with severe to profound intellectual disability.  They carried out a tremendous service over the years.  More recently, it evolved into the HSE providing the service and the HSE agreed to lease the property until 2020.  Cregg House is now for sale on the open market for what I consider to be a very modest guide price, which is not to say that it could not go much higher, depending on what the open market dictates.  From local knowledge and having been an auctioneer and valuer, for the HSE to replicate what is on that site would cost between &euro;25 million and &euro;50 million.  I do not expect the HSE to declare an interest to all the other competitors who may perhaps be interested in buying this property but from a common-sense perspective the HSE nationally should examine future needs.  We are de-segregating residential settings to community settings but from my experience in the constituency one size does not fit all.  Some people still need a campus setting.  I would hate the HSE and the State to lose the opportunity to buy something which would cost infinitely more if it was seeking to provide it.  I do not expect the HSE witnesses to put anything on the record today but perhaps somebody would come back to me in private or at another time and give an indication to me one way or another.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019062700002#QQ01600","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1561622400,"counter":737,"content":"<p>It is a beautiful site and a beautiful part of the world.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019062700002#QQ01700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Breslin"},{"type":"speech","time":1561622400,"counter":738,"content":"<p>To be frank, if it is not bought by a section 39 organisation, a charity, the HSE or a service provider, Mr. Breslin can chalk it down that it will be bought by a housing developer that will want to capitalise on the Rosses Point view.

It is the law and the health Acts allow this, but the Comptroller and Auditor General would not have highlighted if he did not feel it merited highlighting.  Changing the deficit from the year from &euro;283 million down to &euro;86 million is a very substantial change in the bottom line for the year's activities.  It might not seem big in the context of the &euro;15 billion health budget, but is significant when we look at the bottom line and the surplus.  That is why people would be concerned about that, so I ask the witnesses to send us the note on both those things.<\/p> <p>  I will move on to the State Claims Agency and I will work from some of the accounts in front of us.  There is a short note there on page nine.  First, the National Treasury Management Agency will be appearing before this committee next week, and a large part of that meeting will focus on the State Claims Agency and medical negligence.  We need the most senior people from the witnesses' sides, whoever they are, to be here for that.  I am talking to the HSE and the Department today, and to the NTMA next week, because we feel the demarcation lines are part of the problem, in that they make it nobody's problem.  The Department sends things off to the HSE and what comes back is nothing to do with it and is outside its control.  The State Claims Agency is trying to gather information, but is not on the front line where the accidents are occurring, so those boundaries are not ultimately helpful.  Because the HSE passes it over there is not enough ownership of the problem.  It receives a bill every so often and sends the State Claims Agency a cheque for a few hundred million euro each year.  I know that does come out of the HSE's budget, but the HSE might feel the pain of the payments more if they were being managed internally to a greater extent.  There has not been enough learning here. We are asking this now, because the meeting next week would not be useful without the HSE's liaison people with the State Claims Agency.  I will leave that to the witnesses, but we want to gave a productive meeting.  We started our work on the State Claims Agency a year ago, and we said we would come back to it after its financial statements, which we will have next week.  We want to look at the State Claims Agency and medical negligence is the biggest element of that, and that comes under the witnesses' Department, so I am flagging that.<\/p> <p>  The HSE's accounts show that the outstanding balance for medical negligence is &euro;2.792 billion, which is a phenomenal amount.  During the year, the HSE paid out &euro;318 million.  What was the value of the new claims that came in?  I know the State Claims Agency makes its judgment on how much cases are going to be worth, and in the HSE's accounts it only shows what was paid out, but there is no reference to that figure.  Who knows that figure?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019062700002#TT01900","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1561622400,"counter":838,"content":"<p>What figure?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019062700002#TT02000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Mulvany"},{"type":"speech","time":1561622400,"counter":839,"content":"<p>The accounts show the charge to the statement of revenue and income and expenditure was &euro;318.7 million in 2018.

A letter was released recently under a freedom of information request to the HSE.  The letter was to Ms O'Connor from Greg Dempsey of the Department of Health on the 2019 HSE national service plan.  It was dated 20 December 2018.  This is presumably on the website - I got a copy of it there.  The letter refers to amendments to the service plan that the Department has requested the HSE to make.  The first point was that the Department requested that the funding for the State Claims Agency be reduced by &euro;20 million while the nursing home support scheme and the fair deal scheme would be increased by the same amount.  Can someone from the Department of Health explain why the Department asked that question, given that we know the cost of claims are going up every year?  I came here years ago and we were at &euro;1.5 billion.  The figure has been going up by several hundred million euro every year.  The figure is now almost &euro;3 billion.  Why would the Department issue a letter on that basis?  The heading refers to amendments required in advance of formal approval of the national service plan 2019.  I have given the date.  The letter was released under the freedom of information process.  It is a public document.  The letter requested that the funding for the State Claims Agency be reduced by &euro;20 million when in fact the Department knows that payments are going in the opposite direction.

Is it the case that the provision of those services had been predicated heretofore on the assumption of receipt of a large Supplementary Estimate?  Had we not received the corporation tax bonanza, the Oireachtas might not have been able to allocate those additional moneys.  I agree with Mr. Reid that the HSE needs to live within its budget, though others might disagree, but I am wondering what would happen to the delivery of services if the executive were obliged to adhere to its Estimate.  The silence from the witnesses suggests they might be thinking, \"Perish the thought\".  That gives rise to the question of whether we are being presented with genuine Estimates and if there is always an expectation of a back door to additional funding.  It is not good for the HSE or the Department of Health to seek more money every year.<\/p> <p>  On a related matter, it came up in correspondence to the committee last week that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is now involved in a budgetary oversight group or committee.

In addition, an arrangement is in place whereby the Department of Health gives a memorandum to Government on a quarterly basis outlining the financial management for the health sector.

The former CEO said he was not aware of the issue until he saw a report of the court case on television either on the day of the meeting or the previous day.  On page 178, there is a paragraph on risk management which states that as a result of the issues identified by the Scally report in the area of risk management, the HSE established a working group, which is detailed in the section.  It states that the group's mandate is to prepare proposals in regard to risk management in the HSE for consideration by the incoming board risk committee.  It appears the HSE's risk register did not pick up on this issue in advance.  Who can speak about improvements to the HSE risk register?  What will be the next issue to arise?  The CervicalCheck issue did not appear on the risk register because once that case was lodged, it was passed over to the State Claims Agency on the basis that the HSE was finished with the matter and would send a cheque to the State Claims Agency when it had a figure for costs.  The reason for having a risk register is to learn from past mistakes and prevent future issues arising.  That was a by-product in this case.  If the CervicalCheck cases has been managed internally to some extent, there would have been a greater awareness of the issues long before they became public.  They should have been on the HSE's risk register before the High Court case.  That is an observation.  Can anyone comment on that?  The witnesses get the point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019062700002#WW03100","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1561622400,"counter":950,"content":"<p>I will let the HSE talk to the risk register and what has been developed.  The only thing I would say about that point is that in my view the issue around disclosure in CervicalCheck and the introduction of an audit, the purpose of which, at a point, would have yielded information and then a decision as to whether that should be disclosed - ultimately a decision to disclose it and then not to actually do so - was a risk before ever a claim would be lodged.  If one was doing proper risk management across a screening programme, that is an area where one would identify a risk and put it on one's risk register.  Whatever about at the top level of the HSE, within the screening service it should have been on the risk register before ever a court case was taken and we ended up where we were.  It is a big ask for the health service to have the foresight to actually see risks before it sees claims but that is the ask.  It is to look through the business it is involved in and ask where the vulnerabilities and weaknesses are and what could go wrong, and to proactively manage those so that it does not have claims.  I hear the point the Chairman is making.  When the claim then comes in, one gets a warning sign very quickly and if it is not on one's risk register, one gets it on to one's risk register.  Properly managing risk within a healthcare environment requires one to identify risk much earlier than when a claim is lodged.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019062700002#XX00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Breslin"},{"type":"speech","time":1561622400,"counter":951,"content":"<p>I agree with that.

There was a time when once the risk register was done, people moved on.  We have been working with national directors and their teams to use risk registers more as a working document in terms of proactive management of situations as they are arising.

Perhaps the overtime rate on a Sunday for the HSE home help staff is a higher cost.  We have been talking about older people.  This will impact on older people with dementia, for example, who are used to a particular person coming in to them.  Now on a Saturday or Sunday there will be agency people.

I do not have a whole lot to say at this stage regarding opening comments.<\/p> <p>  The Bill is fairly straightforward.  Obviously the Programme for Partnership Government includes a commitment to take measures to reduce the gender pay gap and  promote wage transparency by requiring companies of 50 or more employees to complete a wage survey.  This commitment is being implemented by means of action 1.23 of the National Strategy for Women and Girls 2017-2020 on which the Government is to promote wage transparency by requiring companies of 50 or more employees to complete a wage survey periodically and report the results.<\/p> <p>  The main provisions of the Bill are as follows.  The Minister will have the power to make regulations to require public and private employers to publish information setting out the differences between the mean and median hourly remuneration of male and female employees.  The reporting will be done on a phased basis beginning with employers of more than 250 employees, then employers of more than 150 employees and then to employees of more than 50 employees.  This will apply to both full-time and part-time employees in relation to bonus payments and benefits-in-kind.  The Bill requires an employer to include a narrative setting out the reasons for the gender pay in the firm and the measures, if any, being taken to address that gap.  The Bill also provides for a number of enforcement mechanisms.  An employee will be able to make a complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission will be able to apply to the Circuit Court to require an employer to comply with the regulations where it has reason to believe that an employer has failed to comply.  I shall raise a number of issues as we go through the Bill and I will further consider them for Report Stage.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2019062700002#A00900","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"speech","time":1561590000,"counter":1079,"content":"<p>I congratulate the Acting Chairman on his new additional responsibilities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2019062700002#A01100","speaker":"1255"},{"type":"speech","time":1561590000,"counter":1080,"content":"<p>The Deputy comments on my every move.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2019062700002#A01200","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speech","time":1561590000,"counter":1081,"content":"<p>When does the Minister of State expect the legislation to be commenced?

I also suggest that we change the size of companies to which these regulations apply, the time at which they apply, and the number of scales and timescales.  Also, I want to ensure that the legislation applies to legal partnerships and multidisciplinary practices, to ensure that the attached employer narrative is mandatory, and to ensure that where people are not complying and not publishing the information that employers could, potentially, face fines or have their names published in a report by International Research and Exchange, IREX.

There is one aspect that I may consider further and possibly table a Report Stage amendment, namely, whether differences in bonus pay should be reported on a per hour basis rather than as a difference in the total bonus pay.  The argument would be that if staff in a particular category or department in a firm get a bonus of, say, 2% of their pay then a woman who works part-time, therefore, by reason of this earns less than a full-time employee and will automatically have lower bonus pay.  I will have to consider this further.<\/p> <p>  Section 20A(6) provides for the publication of gender pay gap information by each Department, scheduled offices, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces.

A person who fails to comply with a Circuit Court order is in contempt of that court.  This represents enforcement by civil means rather than by the creation of an offence.  For example, if we were to create a summary offence with a maximum fine of &euro;5,000 is there a danger that some employer would be happy to ignore the regulation and accept the fine?  With some large companies this would be a small issue.  To prevent this from happening the Bill provides that a court order can be sought requiring the person to comply.  If he or she fails to comply then he or she is in contempt of court.  I wish to consider further whether this mechanism can be improved.<\/p><p>A key issue would be what power a court would have to deal with a person who persists in his or her contempt.  In the light of further consideration on this point, I may bring forward a Report Stage amendment.<br\/><br\/>Section 85D allows for an employee to make a complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission of non-compliance with reporting regulations by his or her employer.  The director general of the Workplace Relations Commission will investigate the complaint if satisfied that there is a <i>prima facie <\/i>case or if, on investigation, the director general or an adjudication officer finds in favour of the complainant he or she may make an order requiring the employer to take a specified course of action in order to comply.  This is the only remedy that may be ordered, for example compensation may not be awarded as it is not an appropriate remedy in this situation.  Enforcement of WRC orders is through the District Court.  The idea is that if an employer is in breach of the regulations, for example the employer has not published the gender pay gap information, apart from proceedings by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC under section 85C, an employee of the employer concerned can take proceedings in the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.  Since the Workplace Relations Commission is a rightly very accessible and low cost way to take a complaint this has to be a protection for the employer and for this reason the director general or an adjudication officer will only investigate a complaint if he or she is satisfied that there is a <i>prima facie <\/i>case.  As I have stated, enforcement orders under the section will be through the District Court and the same issue arises at section 85C.  For this reason I may return to this on Report Stage along with section 85C and I will table an amendment if necessary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2019062700002#A02800","speaker":"1277","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1561590000,"counter":1099,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1561590000,"counter":1100,"content":"<p>SECTION 4<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1561590000,"counter":1101,"content":"<p>Question proposed: \"That section 4 stand part of the Bill.\"<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1561590000,"counter":1102,"content":"<p>This is a purely technical section.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2019062700002#B00400","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1561590000,"counter":1103,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1561590000,"counter":1104,"content":"<p>Sections 5 to 7, inclusive, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1561590000,"counter":1105,"content":"<p>Title agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1561590000,"counter":1106,"content":"<p>Bill reported without amendment.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1561590000,"counter":1107,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy David Stanton and his officials for attending this morning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2019062700002#B00800","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Message to D\u00e1il","time":1561590000,"counter":1108,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2019062700002#B00900"},{"type":"speech","time":1561590000,"counter":1109,"content":"<p>In accordance with Standing Order 90, the following message will be sent to the D&aacute;il:<\/p><blockquote>The Select Committee on Justice and Equality has completed its consideration of the<b><\/b>Gender Pay Gap Information Bill 2019 and has made no amendments thereto.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2019062700002#B01000","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1561590000,"counter":1110,"content":"<p>The select committee adjourned at 9.15 a.m. sine die.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
