The relationship between Ireland and Austria has deep roots in history.  The Irishman Fearghal was Bishop of Salzburg in the eighth century and died there in 784.  The Irish monk Colm&aacute;n was martyred at Stockerau near Vienna in 1012 and for centuries was venerated as Austria's national saint.  In 1155, Irish monks founded the Schottenstift Abbey which still exists in the centre of Vienna.<\/p><p>Austria also gave refuge to a number of Wild Geese, and names like O'Donnell, Lacy, Kavanagh and Laudon have their place in Austrian military history.  Maximilian O'Donnell saved the life of Emperor Franz Josef from an assassination attempt in 1853 and received the title of Count of the Emperor.  The longest serving Prime Minister under Emperor Franz Josef was Eduard Taaffe, a descendant of an Irish exile.<\/p><p>We have also enjoyed shared academic and literary links, from Wittgenstein in Dublin to Oliver St. John Gogarty's time in Vienna.  Professor Erwin Schrodinger of the Dublin Institute of Advanced Studies lived for longer in Dublin than in any other city.

Page 112 of the Housing For All document talks about extending planning exemptions to 2025 to complement Town Centre First objectives, \"We will review and extend the regulations that exempt certain vacant commercial premises, such as 'over the shop' type spaces, from requiring planning permission for change of use\".  It puts the timeline of quarter 4 of this year beside the objective.<\/p> <p>I have been raising this issue since my election to the Seanad.  It was one of the very first issues I raised on the floor of the Seanad.  The changes that were introduced by the Minister of State's predecessor with the same portfolio, the Minister of State, Deputy English, in February 2018 to exempt certain classes of commercial premises from the requirement to seek panning permission if the building was to be utilised for residential use was a very welcome move.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator John Cummins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=JohnCummins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=20\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The aim of the exemption was to add much-needed housing stock while also maximising the use of vacant and underutilised spaces. I have seen evidence of it working in my own city of Waterford where more than 20 housing units have been delivered via this planning exemption.  Many more, however, could, and should, have been delivered with the use of this exemption if it had been extended to former pubs.  I do not believe it was ever the intention of the Minister of State or his officials to exclude former pubs from the planning exemption but the issue lies in the fact that pubs are not a particular class of building covered by the exemption.  Pubs, in fact, do not have a particular class, to my knowledge. <\/p><p>While I understand that some local authorities have been using a liberal approach to the regulations, there is no doubt that an issue will arise down the line if and when the owner tries to sell the building as they were not be in compliance.<\/p><p>Article 6 of the planning and development regulations, 2001 to 2019, exempts certain changes of use, including change of use from use as a public house to use as a shop.  Article 10(6) permits a change of use from a shop to a residential use.  However, I understand that to avail of this particular exemption, it has to be considered that the premises was in use as a shop for a period of 12 months, which is counter-intuitive and would again add to delays when we are trying to speed up delivery here.   Logic suggests that someone should be able to go from a pub directly to residential use without establishing that intermediate retail use.<\/p><p>As the Minister of State will be aware, Waterford has been to the forefront in bringing derelict and vacant properties back into use under the repair and leasing scheme. Some 50% of all repair and leasing units in the country have been delivered in my own county and I compliment the team at Waterford City and County Council and the owners of properties who have engaged with the scheme to bring these properties back into use.  <\/p><p>This exemption needs to be extended to pubs because I have examples in the past 12 months alone of people who have been looking to deliver units under the repair and leasing scheme to Waterford City and County Council and have been stuck in a planning process of six, eight or nine months while attracting large development contributions for bringing back a pub into residential use.  The owner of the shop, however, on the other corner of the street directly facing that former pub can deliver its four units without the need to go to the planning process.  I know that this is something that the Minister of State is looking at and that as a Government we are committed to doing more in this space to bring former derelict and underutilised spaces back into use but I ask him to expedite the extension of this exemption to pubs without delay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021102000002#A00700","speaker":"1647","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634722200,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this important issue and I acknowledge his work in this area because he has been consistently bringing this matter to the forefront of our Department since his election to the Seanad.<\/p> <p>By way of background, the Planning and Development (Amendment) (No.2) Regulations 2018 which came into operation on 8 February 2018, provide for an exemption from the requirement to obtain planning permission in respect of a change of use of certain vacant commercial premises, including vacant areas above ground floor premises, to residential use.  This measure was aimed at facilitating the productive reuse of qualifying vacant commercial buildings as homes, while also facilitating urban renewal and the bringing on stream of increased housing supply. <\/p> <p>The 2018 regulations were due to lapse on 31 December 2021 but this deadline was extended to February 2022 arising from a Covid-related extension of planning timelines last year.  The Government and I recognised that to resolve the housing crisis, we need to give consideration to every viable and sustainable option at our disposal, including converting existing vacant commercial premises to residential use.  Current measures to facilitate this include, as mentioned by the Senator, the repair and leasing scheme, which was introduced to assist property owners in bringing vacant properties back into use for social housing purposes, and the buy and renew scheme, which supports local authorities in purchasing and renewing housing units in need of repair which can then be made available for social housing use. <\/p> <p>The recently published Housing for All - a New Housing Plan for Ireland includes a further number of new measures to help revitalise towns.  These include a new local authority-led programme to help local authorities buy or compulsorily purchase 2,500 vacant homes in their areas, which can then be sold on the open market, with a view to ensuring those homes do not remain vacant.  The cro&iacute; c&oacute;naithe (towns) fund will be delivered by local authorities for the provision of serviced sites for housing to attract people to build their homes and to support the refurbishment of vacant properties, enabling people to live in small towns and villages in a sustainable way. <\/p> <p>Housing for All further commits to reviewing and extending the 2018 regulations that exempt certain vacant commercial premises from the requirement to obtain planning permission for change of use to residential purposes to the end of 2025.  This review is currently under way in my Department and will be completed by the end of the year.  This review is looking at a number of potential amendments, including the provision of an exemption for the conversion or pubs to residential use, which could be made to the current regulations.  <\/p> <p>A notable feature in recent years, as the Senator mentioned, is the number of pubs that have closed, particularly in rural towns and villages, which is impacting on their vibrancy.  While the idea of exempting the conversion of pubs to residential use may initially seem positive, we are taking a few considerations into account in this regard, including the size, location, the zoning of pubs and what exemption thresholds might be applied in this regard.  My Department is currently working on a detailed review of this proposal with a view to feeding into the draft regulations, which it is intended to submit to the Oireachtas for approval shortly. <\/p> <p>It should be noted, however, that under section 262(4) of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, legislative proposals on exempted development require the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas before they can be signed into law. <\/p> <p>Once again, I acknowledge the Senator for raising this important issue.  We will be in a position to bring forward draft legislative proposals, including the extending of the timeline, and scope, as alluded to in his contribution, of the current 2018 regulations, to the Oireachtas shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021102000002#B00200","speaker":"1595"},{"type":"speech","time":1634722200,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State and I welcome him to the Chamber, as always.

I am looking for an update on when works will commence on the 1916 commemorative centre in Moore Street and on the regeneration of the street market.  The Minister of State knows that Moore Street is at the heart of our capital city.  It is a street where there has been market and street trading for generations, dating back to the 18th century.  Fruit and vegetable traders are on the street, as well as shops and traders who live and trade on the street.<\/p> <p>Over recent decades the street has deteriorated.  It has been terribly neglected by the State and the city council to the point where there are very few owner-traders left on the street.  Buckley's and Troy's are the only shop owners on the street, and street traders have been neglected for years and left without public lighting, running water and access to electricity.  It is absolutely disgraceful how Dublin City Council has treated street traders.  Those people have kept the street alive. <\/p> <p>The street is also the birthplace of our Republic.  Back on 24 April 1916, P&aacute;draig Pearse, James Connolly and Joseph Plunkett led their soldiers to the GPO.  For five days they battled with the British to assert our independence.  They evacuated the GPO through Henry Street and Henry Place, onto Moore Lane and into Moore Street.  The last meeting place and headquarters of the 1916 Rising was at 14-17 Moore Street.  It was in 15 Moore Street that nurse Elizabeth O'Farrell made the surrender.  <\/p> <p>That site has been designated as a national monument for a very long time.  Since I was first elected in 2004, no more than all of the relatives and those who trade on the street, I have worked for years with the State to try to regenerate the street and commemorate our history.  I brought all of the reports on Moore Street with me today.  What I have here is only a fraction of them.  I could go on.  There is a report on the Moore Street battlefield site, an architectural report, a securing history report and a citizens plan.  There are nearly more reports than there were volunteers in the GPO.  The State needs to step up to the plate. <\/p> <p>There are two final reports.  I chaired the Moore Street expert group on Dublin City Council before I was appointed to the Seanad.  We made strong recommendations to create a vibrant and diverse market that speaks to the future as well as respecting our past.  In May this year, I was delighted to be the Fianna F&aacute;il representative, along with my colleague, Councillor Eimear McCormack, on the Minister's advisory group.  We produced a third securing history report which makes strong recommendations for the national monument and street market. <\/p> <p>It is unreasonable for us to expect anybody to respect the street when the State is not respecting history and street traders.  I hope the Minister of State can give us some good news today regarding a commencement date for the work on the national monument at 14-17 Moore Street and a commemorative centre.  A great vision document has been produced by the Irish Heritage Trust.  I hope the Minister of State will be able to advise the House today on a commencement date for that.  I also hope he will be able to advise us on when Dublin City Council will get its act together and regenerate the street market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021102000002#C00200","speaker":"1656"},{"type":"speech","time":1634722200,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Fitzpatrick for her very important Commencement matter.

Across the country, homes, schools, community buildings, farms and businesses are crying out to generate their own solar energy but, unfortunately, the restrictive planning framework for solar generation has undermined progress in this regard.  Planning regulations currently require planning permission for all but the smallest of solar panel installations on homes or businesses which are exempt.  This has had a major chilling effect in rolling out solar energy generation.  The problem is even worse for schools and community groups because there is no exemption, even for smaller installations, on their buildings.  This means that planning permission is required for all solar installations on educational or community buildings.  As a result, schools and community groups are locked out and cannot share the benefits of renewables.  In the rare circumstances where schools decide to plough ahead, they are at a disadvantage because the requirement to obtain planning permission adds &euro;5,000 to &euro;7,000 to the cost of installing solar panels.<\/p> <p>Before I go on, I want to make it very clear that I am not against strong planning regulation.  In fact, I am in favour of greater democratisation of the planning system and more curbs on the ability of vested interests to manipulate that system to their own benefit.  I also very strongly oppose any attempts being made by this Government to undermine the public's ability to engage with the planning process.  If there was ever a case for less red tape in the planning system, then surely putting in place rooftop solar arrays on primary schools in the middle of a climate crisis is it.<\/p> <p>For the past two years, there have been nothing excuses and delays.  Successive Governments have committed to updating the regulations.  There were specific commitments in the Climate Action Plan 2019, including a commitment for the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to complete a review of the regulations in the fourth quarter of 2019.  In 2020, the Department was still conducting that review and it is still doing so in 2021.  What is the status of the review?<\/p> <p>A new roadblock was then thrown up.  I refer to the supposed need for a review of the potential for glare and glint to impact on aircraft around airports.  This is news as Dublin Airport has just opened its own solar farm.  At this stage, it is farcical that schools are not able to put up solar panels without planning permission.  In response to a parliamentary question tabled in June, the Minister of State indicated that the tendering process for this research had not been completed, let alone the research itself.  When is the research on glint and glare going to be completed?<\/p> <p>In January we were told that we would get interim planning regulations which would at least allow for greater solar installations, excluding installations in the vicinity of airports to allow for detailed analysis of the potential for airport exclusion zones to be finalised.  In April we were told that the revised regulations for solar panel exemptions would be submitted to the Oireachtas for approval shortly.  In June it was claimed that a strategic environmental assessment was needed and that interim regulations would instead be put in place in the fourth quarter.  However, the full strategic environmental assessment process only started in earnest in September and an associated public consultation will only commence in November.  The result of this is that the interim regulations are now set to be completed in early 2022.<\/p> <p>Why is it that Ireland suffers these difficulties when other European countries do not?  It does not bode well for the climate action we are going to have to take.  Can we hear when we will be done, once and for all, with the excuses and delays?

To provide some background, under the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, all development, unless specifically exempted under the Act or associated regulations, requires planning permission.  Various exemptions from the requirement to obtain planning permission are set out in the Act and regulations and these exemptions are subject to compliance with general restrictions on exemptions set out in the Act and regulations.  Included among the planning exemptions are those applying to the installation of solar infrastructure on a variety of building types including houses, business premises and industrial and agricultural buildings, to which specific conditions are attached.  My Department, in the context of the climate action plan and in consultation with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, has undertaken a review of the existing solar panel planning exemptions set out in the regulations, with a particular focus on facilitating increased self-generation of electricity and in recognition of the limitations of the current exemptions.  This review is now complete.  Substantial changes to the current planning exemption thresholds for solar panels are proposed, in addition to the introduction of new classes of solar panel planning exemptions relating to their use in apartments and in educational, community and religious buildings.<\/p> <p>In light of the need to appropriately address aviation safety concerns arising from the glint and glare impacts of solar panels and the easing of the solar panel planning exemption thresholds, my Department is in the process of commissioning the development of detailed aviation safeguarding maps which will identify and delineate specific but limited areas in the vicinity of airports and aerodromes, referred to as exclusion zones, within which the exemptions will not apply.  Project scoping feedback has been received from interested parties through the draft request for tender process and has been considered by my Department in the development of the final tender documentation.  My Department intends to publish the call for tender imminently.<\/p> <p>While this work is ongoing, my Department has advanced interim regulations, adopting a temporary, albeit more stringent, approach incorporating initial defined exclusion zones around airports and aerodromes.  These interim regulations, allowing for increased solar panel planning exemptions, will cover the vast majority of the land area of the country, only excluding those limited exclusion zones around airports and aerodromes.<\/p> <p>The draft interim regulations have been reviewed under the strategic environmental assessment, SEA, directive, 2001\/42\/EC, and it is considered that they are likely to have significant effects on the environment, thereby necessitating the undertaking of a full SEA on the draft proposals.  The Senator referred to this in the context of the need for a robust planning system.  The completion of the SEA screening stage has been delayed by a further requirement for completion of screening for appropriate assessment, AA, under the habitats directive, by my Department's ecological assessment unit.  Once this AA screening process is complete, a formal SEA process will commence with scoping of the SEA.  Following the latter, the SEA environmental report will be published alongside draft interim regulations for a period of public consultation of not less than four weeks.  This public consultation is expected to commence in December.  Written submissions or observations will be taken into consideration before finalisation of the draft interim regulations in the first quarter of 2022.<\/p> <p>As required under planning legislation, the proposed exempted development regulations must be laid in draft form before the Houses of the Oireachtas and receive a positive resolution from both Houses before they can be made and the SEA process concluded.  Accordingly, the process for finalising the interim solar panel planning exemptions as referred to above, with interim exclusion zones around airports and aerodromes and allowing for the vast majority of the country to be covered by the exemptions, is now expected to be completed in early 2022.<\/p> <p>Work on the development of the aviation safeguarding maps for airports and aerodromes is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2022.  The final supplementary set of regulations, which will delineate the final exclusion areas around airports and aerodromes in which the exemptions will not apply, will be prepared thereafter and, subject to environmental reporting considerations, will subsequently be laid in draft form before the Houses of the Oireachtas for approval.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021102000002#D00200","speaker":"1595"},{"type":"speech","time":1634722200,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for outlining all of the roadblocks that are in place and for saying there is a deadline of early 2022.

I am sharing time on this with Senator Kyne, who comes from the same type of area as I do, as does the Cathaoirleach.  There was a huge fire in Killarney during the summer.  Fires pose great problems for many people and many farmers.  A fire on commonage, in forestry or on any land can be started by fishers, campers, hillwalkers or various people who can be lackadaisical in throwing away cigarette butts or starting a campfire for a picnic and failing to put it out properly, with the result that commonage, land or forestry in many cases can be burned.  This leads to the destruction of habitats.  The penalties are in place because of the destruction of habitats.  This is most unfair.  A fire can be started on one farm and spread to the next farm.  All farmers are penalised.  Commonage holders are also penalised.  The result is that their farm payments are reduced.  The penalty is that no payment is made on the burnt land.  There is also a penalty on the payment for the farmer's remaining land.  Many farmers have appealed these decisions and where evidence was provided that the farmer did not start the fire the Department removed the penalty on the remaining lands but still issued no payment on the burnt land.  This is very unfair if a person is not responsible.<\/p> <p>Farmers must always appeal in these circumstances.  They should not have to do this.  Only the person found to have been responsible for starting the fire should be penalised.  There should not be any penalty imposed on any other farmer, landowner or recipient of farm payments.  This is a big issue.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service has a huge part to play in this.  I expect a very positive reply from the Minister of State.  If not, I ask him to bring it back to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  This is creating great hardship for many farmers.  In some cases there is a lot of money involved.  Every year brings its own story.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021102000002#E00200","speaker":"1636"},{"type":"speech","time":1634722200,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.

Depending on conditions and at certain times of the year, fires can spread if started maliciously or accidentally by another individual.  They can spread &ndash; pardon the pun &ndash; like wildfire across commonages, protected areas and forestry.  In the Connemara area I have seen the aftermath of such destruction.  I have seen fires that have taken place.  Depending on the conditions and the time of year, they can run wild.

I concur with their sentiments.  Notwithstanding this, I am stepping in for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine so I will read the response from him.  I will raise with him the very valid issues the Senators have raised.<\/p> <p>The basic payment scheme is a critical income support paid to farmers.  It is fully funded by the EU and is subject to EU regulations.  Applicants under the basic payment scheme are allocated payment entitlements and are paid annually on the basis of the number of entitlements held, with the requirement to have an eligible hectare of agricultural land for each payment entitlement.  I am sure the Senators are very well aware of this.<\/p> <p>It is specified in the 2021 basic payment scheme terms and conditions that land burned during the closed season of 1 March to 31 August in any given year is not eligible for the purpose of payment under the basic payment scheme.  Where land has been burned, it is not in a state suitable for an agricultural activity such as grazing or cultivation and, therefore, it is not eligible, except where controlled burning is carried out in accordance with all relevant legislative requirements.  Burning of land between 1 March and 31 August in any year is prohibited by law under section 40 of the Wildlife Act 1976, as amended by the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2000.  We are all aware of the loss of wildlife habitats and biodiversity caused by fires, as well as the risk to human life and property.<\/p> <p>As required under EU regulations, all applications under the basic payment scheme are subject to robust administrative checks prior to payment.  Only valid applications under the basic payment scheme that fully comply with the requirements of the EU legislation are paid.  The main element of these administrative checks is an area of assessment which is achieved by using the land parcel identification system.  These administrative checks are critical in ensuring the Department meets the rigorous audit requirements at EU and national level.  Failure to undertake these administrative checks can result in severe financial penalties for the Department.<\/p> <p>As part of these required administrative checks, the Department actively investigates incidents of illegal burning using the most up-to-date technology and satellite imagery.  Land declared as eligible on a basic payment scheme application that has subsequently been identified as burned during the closed season may give rise to an overclaim.  Such an overclaim will result in a reduction in the eligible area.  In addition, as required under the EU regulations, administrative penalties are applied where the area overclaimed is greater than 3% of the area declared.  The administrative penalty applied is 1.5 times the difference in hectares between the area declared and area determined, or the number of entitlements held, if lower.  The penalty will not exceed 100% of the amount based on the area declared.<\/p> <p>Where an overclaim occurs, departmental officials write to the affected applicants setting out the options available to them, including the right to seek a review.  Each review is carefully considered individually based on the individual facts of each case.  Should applicants disagree with the Department's decision on any review, they have a further right of appeal to the independent Agriculture Appeals Office.  All the circumstances are taken into account when considering an appeal.<\/p> <p>The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine has raised this matter directly with the Minister of State, Deputy Heydon, and he has advised that farmers should appeal any decision taken regarding the basic payment scheme when fires occur through no fault of the applicant.  His Department will examine potential ways to bring these farmers back into the scheme.  It should be noted that the land is only ineligible in the year the burning took place.  It does not affect the land eligibility in subsequent years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021102000002#E00400","speaker":"1595"},{"type":"speech","time":1634722200,"counter":30,"content":"<p>What the Minister of State is saying is that if a fire takes place between 1 March and 31 August the farmer loses money unless the appeal is successful.  Even at that, the farmer will have to go through the rigours of the appeal process.  These appeals should be fast and simple.  They should not be complicated.  Farmers who are not responsible for the fires should be fully recompensed immediately.  This is the view of all farmers.  As the Minister of State well knows, there can be great hardship.  Farmers have commitments such as bank payments.  There is huge hardship in some cases.  I ask the Minister of State to bring back to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine our argument that the appeals process should be easy and determined quickly.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paddy Burke:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=1866\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1866&amp;amp;pid=PaddyBurke&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=20\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The only person who should be responsible at the end of the day is the person who caused the fire.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021102000002#E00500","speaker":"1636","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634722200,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I thank Senators Kyne and Burke again for raising the matter.

I understand there should not be any delays in that regard, especially if those farmers have not committed any wrongdoing to cause the fire.

We must encourage people, particularly women, to make bone health a priority.  A recent survey carried out by GPs found that 92% of those who suffer from osteoporosis were surprised with their diagnosis, and that the diagnosis came only after a fracture.  Therefore, it is important that people, particularly women over 65, take the opportunity to have a DEXA scan.  Early diagnosis is important.  I suffer from osteoporosis.  I discovered it when I was 30 after a car accident.  I was not particularly surprised because my mother and grandmother also had osteoporosis.  It can be dealt with through diet and exercise, and, if needed, medication.  There is a good Irish website that provides this information.  We should send that message out today.<\/p><p>I was at a three-and-a-half-hour meeting last night with farmers from Kildare and west Wicklow in the mart in Kilcullen.  It was part of a consultation process that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, has engaged in around the country.  Such consultation is really good.  It is happening in 26 places.  I was concerned, however, about much of the information I gained.  Most of it was not new to me because I have ongoing interaction with farmers in Kildare, just as many Members have such interaction with farmers in their own constituencies.  The Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, that is coming down the line seems to be overly bureaucratic.  We need the schemes to be simplified.  Convergence is a particularly difficult issue for our farmers, and we need to engage more with the Minister on this.<\/p><p>There is a Bloomberg News article in this morning's <i>Irish Independent<\/i>that claims curbs on fertiliser exports are to worsen the global price shock.  It is quite scary to read that considering the current scarcity and price of food.  We need to have a debate in this House on where we are going with the CAP.  We absolutely need simplification.  We need to be concerned about the eco schemes, whereby 25% of what farmers can get under the CAP will be tied in with ecological measures.  My concern is that schemes coming down the line will not be accessible to farmers.<\/p><p>The final point I want to raise relates to the debate on dyslexia we had last week.  It was an excellent debate.  We all spoke about how difficult it is for young people with dyslexia and how important it is to have early intervention and diagnosis.  Several people contacted me after the debate.  One was a parent whose daughter has been diagnosed with dyslexia.  The daughter is in fifth class and will be going into sixth next year.  The school paid for an assessment and then there was a private assessment.  Now the family is told the girl must go to a neurological paediatrician to get the adaptive technology.  This is absolutely ridiculous.  A child going into sixth class needs to be prepared for secondary school, yet there are obstacles in the form of costs and delays in getting the required assessment.  If we really want to make a difference, we must make sure that we cut out some of the bureaucracy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021102000002#G00800","speaker":"1689"},{"type":"speech","time":1634722200,"counter":42,"content":"<p>I wish to take up Senator O'Loughlin's point on the roadshow of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue.

It is a difficult area.  <\/p><p>Project Ireland 2040 was recently launched.  I would like to see a debate on that matter in the near future.  The last phase of the National Development Plan 2018-2027 including many positives, including 26,000 social homes to be created by the Land Development Agency; the creation of the urban and rural regeneration funds; the climate action fund for which &euro;77 million was provided; 526 completed school building projects delivered with more than 48,000 school places; the start of the national broadband plan, which is hugely important, considering where we have gone since with Covid-19 and remote working, which has come into its own, the programme of investment in our cultural institutions such as the National Concert Hall, Crawford Art Gallery, the National Gallery of Ireland and the Abbey Theatre; more than &euro;46 million for support of capital and equipment programmes; new wastewater and water treatment plants; flood relief schemes; phase 1 of National Rehabilitation Hospital; and new primary care centres, to name a few. <\/p><p>However, the updated national development plan, which was published recently, has created a certain level of confusion regarding road projects, which has been much highlighted.  It is important to get clarity on those because, for example, the Galway city ring road has been a much talked about road project.  The planning application has been delayed a number of times and is due for decision again towards the end of November.  On the other hand, the western rail corridor, which has a great deal of support, although not universal, and which many people would welcome, was not included in the plan.  It is, however, included as part of the national rail review.  As somebody commented, certainly on the road and rail projects, that there was an attempt to please everybody and it has created a certain level of confusion, so we need clarity on those projects.  They are too important to left in limbo.  I hope both of the projects I mentioned can be progressed.

On reflection and to be fair to all concerned, Ministers need time to come to this House and need to prepare to come to this House so I will not proceed with moving an amendment to the Order of Business today.  It is my intention to do so tomorrow if we do not have a favourable response.  It relates to the scoliosis situation and the 172 children  lists.  I ask anyone to look at the current RT&Eacute; feed in regard to scoliosis, which quotes extensively what the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste have to say.  Many members may have seen the issue discussed on RT&Eacute;'s \"Prime Time\" programme last night, yet again the T&aacute;naiste, Dr. Leo Varadkar, talked about his concerns stating \"The Government severely regrets that children are experiencing long delays.\"  The Taoiseach, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, says the delays in treatment are not about a lack of resources but reflect on a systemic failure.  The reality is I brought a Commencement Matter yesterday and it was more than disappointing, as it did not address the issues.  The Minister of State at the Department of Health took the matter.  I then took the time to come to the anteroom in the Seanad yesterday evening to meet directly with the Minister for Health, though not by appointment.  I handed him the reply and I asked him to take it for a bit of reading for last night.  I expressed my view that it was a disgrace and that whoever wrote it should not have been asked.  No Minister should have been asked to take that reply from the Department of Health in here because it simply did not address the issues in regard to scoliosis.<\/p> <p>This is all coming about as a result of the people from the Scoliosis Advocacy Network contacting me and I am sure many other Senators and, more importantly, a very engaging interview on RT&Eacute;'s \"Today with Claire Byrne\" programme.  The issues are now so serious we can have no further delays.  Out of respect for the procedures of the House and timing, I am not going to proceed with the proposal to amend the Order of Business today.  After all it is only a proposal, but I ask the Leader to use her good office to make contact with the Minister for Health, and see if we can have him in the House if not tomorrow - and quite frankly it is that serious and that is what the parents are demanding and want - certainly on our return from the recess.  I am conscious there is a recess and that is an issue. However, it is critical and I do not doubt that every Member shares my concerns and is supportive of the families and guardians of these 172 children who need medical intervention.  They do not care if it is public or private and they do not care if the State is buying the treatment in.  They are children.  Many of us have children and we would not want our children suffering from scoliosis and the agony these children have to endure. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021102000002#H00200","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speech","time":1634722200,"counter":45,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.

However, it is coming under sustained, ongoing and serious threat from the importation of non-native honey bees.  They are less frugal, more aggressive, prone to swarming and they have an adverse impact on biodiversity and ecosystems with the resulting introgression and cross-breeding of the Apis mellifera mellifera.<\/p> <p>We are one of the last strongholds of this pure native bee.  It is under serious threat.  Last year, we reported a documented 327% increase in the importation into this country of non-native honey bee queens.  After more than ten years of campaigning, the Native Irish Honey Bee Society will be pleased.  This is a step in the right direction.  The society is not, however, getting carried away.  Complacency will not set in.  It is not going away.  It is going to stick at this under it gets a permanent satisfying result.  I acknowledge the work of its wonderful chairperson, Ms Aoife Nic Giolla Coda, secretary ,Loretta Neary and so many others engaged in that volunteerism.  They do this at their own expense, as they are committed to this cause.  I thank the Climate Bar Association, an independent expert body, which has reached the conclusion that to amend the law in this way is not repugnant to EU law.  I am also grateful the cross-party support which this Bill enjoys.  This is where the future lies.  If leave to introduced is granted, Members will see on the Bill when it is published shortly thereafter the names of colleagues, who come from each and every political grouping in this Chamber and that is the way forward.  With that in mind I anticipate my proposal will be seconded by Senator Erin McGeehan, who is representative of the cross-party approach that we are taking to this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021102000002#H00400","speaker":"1667"},{"type":"speech","time":1634722200,"counter":47,"content":"<p>I listened with interest to some of my colleagues speaking about the roadshow that Deputy McConalogue is currently undertaking.

I raise it again because anybody who watched the BBC's \"Spotlight\" investigative report last night will have been deeply disturbed by the fact Ireland, as an island, is being used to smuggle puppies into Britain from its ports.  This is enabling criminal gangs to make millions of euro and depriving Revenue of millions of euro in tax and it is down to a complete lack of enforcement of the existing laws.  While we need better co-operation between the authorities North and South, there is a raft of animal welfare laws in this country and they are just not being enforced.  That is not good enough.  There are fake microchip numbers, fake dog-breeding numbers and fake seller numbers on websites.  Illegal adverts are reported daily by animal welfare organisations but, as yet, even though the regulations have been in place since 2020, not one enforcement case has been taken against an illegal advert on online platforms.  It is not good enough.  The Minister needs to answer the case.<\/p><p>In June of this year, on my request, Dogs Trust appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Its representatives outlined how simple it would be to fix this.  There could be a pre-verification system and a national database including the microchip, the dog-breeding licence number and the online sales licence number.  That advert would not be able to be posted until it was pre-verified, which would save the welfare organisations all the work of having to manage these sites.  Equally, a microchip system could be put in place just like the system for cars.  After a number is entered, the system would identify the breed and age of the dog and the name of the person to whom it is registered.  This is not rocket science.<\/p><p>The programme for Government promised to strengthen guidelines and dog-breeding regulations but that is not forthcoming.  In light of last night's television programme, there is an anomaly in the Animal Health and Welfare Act, which the Dublin Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, DSPCA, one of the authorities that, unfortunately, has to seize these puppies at the ports, has outlined.  It will come before the Oireachtas committee in November to outline the anomaly.  When it seizes these puppies, it cannot rehome them within five days, as it could if it had seized them under the Control of Dogs Act.  Instead, it has to hold on to the dogs for up to 18 months while the legal proceedings happen.  That is bad for both the dog and the animal welfare organisation.<\/p><p>I would welcome the Minister coming before the House.  The Leader might write to him inviting him to appear in order that we can have a debate on animal welfare and the lack of enforcement.  I cannot get an answer from him, so perhaps this House can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021102000002#H00500","speaker":"1635","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634722200,"counter":49,"content":"<p>I will support the proposed Order of Business.  I raise the changes in restrictions that will operate from Friday and the very unfair treatment of the live entertainment and music sector in comparison with nightclubs.  It beggars belief that patrons will be able to dance in nightclubs but will have to remain seated at music gigs.  Musicians and artists have suffered particularly badly over the course of the pandemic, having to reschedule shows and losing huge sums from doing so.  It is a really unfair anomaly and it shows there was a lack of thought, with the proposals for the sector almost having been written on the back of a packet of cigarettes.  I ask that the Government reconsider the restrictions requiring people to sit down during live music shows because it is particularly unfair on a sector that has suffered a great deal during the pandemic.<\/p><p>The second issue I raise relates to the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, apartments in Finglas, which was reported in <i>The Business Post<\/i>on Sunday last by Killian Woods.  For more than ten years, 26 apartments have lain empty.  This underlines the need for not just a vacant lands tax but a vacant homes tax.  Habitable residential houses and apartments have been lying empty for ten years and an arm of the State is sitting on empty property while children grow up in hotels just down the road.<\/p><p>There is an contradiction between how NAMA approaches this issue and the so-called Government commitment to home ownership.  As can be seen in the marketing material for this Prospect Hill site, the agency is selling it directly to investors rather than owner-occupiers or individual people and is touting its potential rental income of more than &euro;1 million a year.  It is a great disappointment and a missed opportunity that an arm of the State, controlled by the Government, is selling on a group of apartments to investors and trying to trap people into long-term rental while, at the same time, that same State and Government are not giving renters tenancy and security of tenure.  We need a wider debate on how NAMA has operated in the housing market and how it sees itself as a purely commercial vehicle rather than an organisation that has responsibility for a social good, that is, the provision of land and housing for people who live in this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021102000002#J00200","speaker":"1672"},{"type":"speech","time":1634722200,"counter":50,"content":"<p>I draw attention to the horrific abuse of adults with intellectual disabilities that occurred at the Ard Gr&eacute;ine Court facility, Donegal.  On Friday last, <i>The Irish Times<\/i>ran another piece on the issue after it finally received a copy of the unpublished report into the matter, the Brandon report.  We now know that approximately 108 incidents of devastating abuse were experienced by at least 18 residents of this facility, many of them non-verbal, over a period of about 13 years.  It is shocking.  The HSE management had full knowledge of this abuse, yet refused to supply the Minister for Health with a report on the abuse when it was requested.  One of the most shocking aspects of this revelation is that none of the family members of those who had experienced the abuse were informed until December 2018.  In some cases, this was more than a decade after the abuse had occurred.<\/p><p>The Brandon report is just one example of the horrendous abuse and neglect of adults at risk in Ireland that has been revealed in recent months.  Sexual abuse is not the only issue.  &quot;RT&Eacute; Investigates: Care in Covid&quot; highlighted that the neglect of adults in nursing homes during the pandemic violated their dignity and contributed to deaths.  This all comes under the umbrella of adult safeguarding.  We are in desperate need of adult safeguarding legislation that will enforce the mandatory reporting of abuse in order that those who hide or cover up abuse will become legally culpable for it.  We are also in need of an adult safeguarding body to monitor adult safeguarding, with powers to investigate abuse.<\/p><p>In 2017, the then Senator Colette Kelleher of the Civil Engagement Group introduced the Adult Safeguarding Bill in the Seanad and mandatory reporting was at its core.  There was positive engagement on the Bill from many in the House and we in the Civil Engagement Group welcomed the cross-party support we received.  I again raise this issue, however, to emphasise the urgency regarding adult safeguarding.  I worry the Government does not share my sense of urgency.  Since Colette's Bill was referred to the Law Reform Commission, no significant progress has been made to protect adults at risk.  It is shocking.  The commission's report is not due until next year.  No interim steps have been taken to protect adults at risk of abuse.<\/p><p>I call on the Government to take action on this immediately and to request an interim report from the Law Reform Commission.  We simply cannot afford to wait until next year.  The HSE management that covered up the abuse in Donegal was repeatedly advised that what it was doing would be seen as complicity in the abuse.  We in this Legislature are now at the point where we too are guilty of complicity in this abuse.  Again and again, we have received shocking reports of the abuse of adults at risk occurring throughout this island and still we have not taken any concrete legislative steps towards stopping it.  I hope other Senators share my sense of urgency regarding the issue.  We must end our complicity in the pain and suffering of so many people.

I wrote to Limerick City and County Council and explained the situation.  I received a reply yesterday evening which stated that, due to funding constraints, housing maintenance is not currently in a position to upgrade bathrooms but that it may be in a position to contribute to upgrade works in early 2022.  The council went on to state that if the tenant could supply a new toilet, cistern, shower tray and wash-hand basin, then housing maintenance could ring-fence funding to complete the works.  I would love to have an explanation for that.  Can you imagine a private landlord writing back to a tenant and telling them if they supplied half the equipment, then he or she would do the job?

That is simply a fact.  It is a fact which does not have to fill us with dread because while chemical nitrogen helps grass grow, so does naturally fixed nitrogen, but without the damage.  Clover is a really effective and natural nitrogen-fixing machine.<\/p> <p>I have seen some of the work, enthusiasm and results.  Teagasc is doing work on clover at Moorepark and Solohead Farm, while in Johnstown Castle, it has carried out years of research on multispecies swards, to see if adding in herbs can make the grazing even better, the carbon sequestration more effective and improve the soil microbial activity.<\/p> <p>Yes, a multispecies sward is managed differently to a monoculture sward.  In some ways, it might be more challenging, but in other ways it is easier.  I certainly believe it is worth a try.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Pippa Hackett:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=0000\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=0000&amp;amp;pid=PippaHackett&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=20\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I certainly believe it is worth a try, not just for the potential savings in fertiliser costs, but also for the satisfaction we can all derive from healthy soils and from feeding our animals and land in a way which works for them and us and for the climate challenges ahead.

I have raised this issue in the House previously.  Much of that antisocial behaviour and, in particular, that lawlessness is directed towards people who are not Irish.  That is a particular aspect that we need to address.  Yesterday, I had the privilege of meeting two Slovak-born men who were recognised by the Slovakian Government for their contribution to society.  One of them, Joe Veselsky, a resident of Booterstown, is 103 years of age today.  I congratulate him.  He came to Ireland in 1949, having been part of the Czech resistance and lost members of his family in Auschwitz.  Tomi Reichental was also recognised.  He came to Ireland in 1959, having survived the Holocaust in Bergen-Belsen.  It strikes me that many of the people we are talking about are the modern counterparts of these men.  They are people who have come to Ireland and made their home here and who are contributing at every level of our society.  I hope that, 60 years from now, we will be able to recognise the modern counterparts of these men who have come here from Brazil and other countries that are very far away and very different from Ireland, who have made their homes here and who have made themselves part of our communities and contributed to our society not only economically but culturally and in all the other aspects of a functioning society.  They are doing that and there are people in Ireland who do not understand the value they bring to our society.  As part of our consideration of lawlessness, public disorder, antisocial behaviour and all of the other aspects of behaviour in society, we must consider that these people are also part of our society.  As a Legislature and, more importantly, as a community and a society, we must reach out to welcome them and to acknowledge the contribution they make.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021102000002#M00200","speaker":"1685"},{"type":"speech","time":1634722200,"counter":67,"content":"<p>I too support colleagues in calling for a debate on antisocial behaviour.

Everything the Government is doing in bringing forward measures is meant to protect people, people's lives and industries.  The comments made in emails such as those we have received are also made by some public representatives.

I do not recall us having such a debate previously.  I would like to discuss the funding of projects under the rural regeneration and development fund.  There was good news yesterday for a number of projects that received extra funding.  There were two such projects in County Tipperary.  A project in Thurles got an extra &euro;500,000 on top of the &euro;3 million it has received to develop a permanent structure for a farmers' market.  That is a really good project for the centre of the town.  <\/p> <p>There is a problem with the rural regeneration and development fund that we need to work to solve.  In the latest round of applications, a contingency of approximately 25% was allowed for to take into account the changes in material and development costs to get projects from start to finish.  In previous rounds, there was only a contingency of 5%.  Some of those projects are only starting now but what they will now cost to complete is far greater than the funding sought from the Department, even with that 5% contingency funding.  I ask for a debate with the Minister to discuss increasing the contingency funding to 25% for those applications made in previous rounds, which is what new applications are to receive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021102000002#M00400","speaker":"1629"},{"type":"speech","time":1634722200,"counter":69,"content":"<p>I stand in solidarity with the Leader's remarks and support her in them.  Last Sunday, Daniel Murray published an article in the <i>Business Post <\/i>with the headline &quot;Government to defer legislating for international surrogacy services&quot;.  I appreciate that there is momentum and that hard work is going on behind the scenes.  I probably know more than most about just how much is going on and how many meetings and so on are taking place.  The Ministers from the Departments of Justice, Health and Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth have met five times in the past year to move this along, because it is within those three Departments that needs and issues have arisen.  However, headlines like that and the repeated delays do nothing but cause fear and horror for families across the country whose children were born via surrogacy.<\/p><p>It is not that there has not been an incredibly ethical framework put forward that safeguards the rights of children and puts them first and that safeguards the human rights of the surrogates and parents.  There are women around this country who are not entitled to sign permission slips for their children in school and who have been rejected and told that they are not the mothers of their children.  There are children who are being teased about this in school.  There are children who were born via surrogacy who are shortly to turn 18, because that is how long this has been going on in this country, and who will now never have that legal relationship with their parents because they will be adults.  Mothers are being denied legal connection with their children and children are being denied legal recognition of their relationship with their mothers and the provisions regarding inheritance from parents and grandparents that flow from that.  The delay is appalling.

I support the Senator's comments.  I welcome the funding announced for a project in Ballymahon.  It is a major project and has received additional funding but, as I have said, other projects are struggling.<\/p> <p>I will raise the issue of hospice beds, which I have raised previously.  There is just one hospice bed in County Longford to cover a population of 40,000 people.  We raised this issue with the then Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, when he was on a visit a number of years ago before the redesign of the St. Joseph's campus.

The first relates to yesterday's announcements on reopening and the easing of Covid-19 restrictions.  I am concerned about healthcare workers and particularly people in nursing homes.  I call for priority to be given to healthcare workers because they are dealing with more vulnerable people in nursing homes.  They should receive boosters as a matter of urgency.  Perhaps antigen testing could be used in nursing homes as well when it comes to infection control etc., which is really important when people are entering nursing homes.  Many nursing homes are closed now because there may be infection and people are not able to visit.  If antigen testing was in place and a booster injection could be given to healthcare workers and patients, it would help.<\/p> <p>Yesterday there were many announcements relating to the reopening of society and a number of restrictions have been eased.  In the budget, we have allocated money for marketing the country and encouraging tourism but coach tours are currently operating at 75% capacity and there has been no announcement on that restriction on people on coaches being lifted.  The restriction for school buses was at 50% and there was no clear announcement around that either.

When it is a copy and paste job, one cannot take it too seriously but I will focus on the rest.  Two thirds of the people in intensive care units in this country are not vaccinated so what more do we need to be told about the power of vaccines?  It is scientific evidence that vaccines work.  This links to some points I will make about Facebook and the prevalence of Covid-19 misinformation on the platform and its groups, about which I have spoken for the past year.<\/p> <p>This morning we heard reports that Facebook chief executive Mr. Mark Zuckerberg is planning to overhaul and rename Facebook.  That will not remove the toxicity in the concept of what Facebook has become.  In August this year Facebook stated it removed dozens of sources of anti-vaccination information but there were anti-vaccination protests nonetheless.  They were not huge and comprised a rabble of head-the-balls.  A couple of them will be coming along tomorrow, Thursday, and it is all being advertised through Facebook.  For example, it is stated that this will not be a child-friendly protest.  One post reads: \"We are the people demanding this caretaker Government stands down with immediate effect the continuance of medical apartheid and lockdown of this people.\"  These people are being radicalised online.<\/p> <p>We saw excellent testimony before the United States Senate by Ms Frances Haugen some weeks ago, who said that in order for Facebook to maximise profits, the company decides the algorithm, leading to outrage and hate bouncing off each other.  The algorithm increases the level of toxicity and hatred online and as a result we see events like people going into hospitals to tell people vaccines are killing people and they will save the people, only to see them dying a few days later.  There must be something serious done about Covid-19 misinformation spread online, particularly on Facebook.  Governments must now step in to regulate the area as social media has failed to do it time and again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021102000002#N00300","speaker":"1670"},{"type":"speech","time":1634722200,"counter":74,"content":"<p>I thank colleagues for their support.

I am sure people will want to pay their respects.<\/p> <p>Senator McGahon spoke this morning about the need for an online safety commission and regulator of all our online social spaces.  Senator Malcolm Byrne regularly speaks on the same topic.  There is certainly a variety of different views on any number of topics that can be discussed on social media.  What concerns me and what must be absolutely regulated is when the debate becomes incredibly divisive, abusive, threatening and harassing.  It does not seem to take much to get people from just having a conversation or interaction to being called a Nazi.  It does not take very long.  We must further that discussion and support the Minister in all his efforts to ensure we get that online safety commission and regulator, along with a culture of regulation, into social media.  People are allowed to think what they want and we must certainly respect people's views and the differences therein.  We do not have to tolerate being threatened and called horrible names.<\/p> <p>Senator Maria Byrne spoke about the need for screening in nursing homes.  Although we are in a very different place than we were last year, there are definitely some concerns that we did not learn from what happened at the beginning of this pandemic.  I very much support the Senator in asking the Minister to provide the resources to our nursing homes, both public and private, to ensure all staff receive boosters and that visitors allowed in are screened.  The Senator is right that many nursing homes are not allowing in visitors because of the current spike in numbers.<\/p> <p>I will write a letter to inquire about transport capacity.  It is interesting that the Senator notes the two relatively private industries - coach tourism and school transport - are at 50% or 75% but the public transport system is at 100% capacity.  There seems to be another anomaly there but I will write a letter today inquiring about that.<\/p> <p>Senator Garret Ahearn and Miche&aacute;l Carrigy asked for a debate on rural regeneration and I will write to the Minister today to see if we can get in that debate before Christmas.  What Senator Carrigy described this morning is an example of an organisation being penny wise and pound foolish.  It makes absolutely no sense that we incur costs in one part of the health service because we cannot afford to expend costs in another that would then save costs on the initial side.  I do not know if there is anything I can do for the Senator but I might speak to him after the Order of Business to see if I can help with that hospice bed in Longford.<\/p> <p>When I was first elected to the Oireachtas in 2011 and former Deputy Alan Shatter was made the Minister with responsibility for justice, he spent an inordinate amount of time looking at progressing the legislation around surrogacy because he had a huge interest in it.  Here we are 11 years later still trying to tell people how difficult it is.  I have no doubt it is not easy but that does not mean it should not be prioritised.  It is really shocking to read again, in a Sunday newspaper, about extended delays with the three Departments working together.  Again, I will send a letter to the Minister but we should ask for a meeting so we can find out exactly what is at the root of the problem and ensure we can give reassurances to the considerable number of families and children directly affected by this debacle.  I will come back to Senator Seery Kearney about that.<\/p> <p>Senators Martin Conway, Barry Ward and Jerry Buttimer asked for a debate on antisocial behaviour.  When we started this conversation a couple of months ago we spoke about big cities like Dublin, Limerick and Cork but it is not a problem just in big cities any more.  I live in a relatively small town and there is a gang of 15-year-olds and 16-year-olds going around beating up 12-year-olds and 13-year-olds.  Our noticeboards are alight at the weekend asking if we have seen a particular fellow with a particular colour hair.  It is the attitude and culture.<\/p> <p>Senator Barry Ward spoke about our larger cities and the prevailing change in culture that affects our new Irish.  The gentleman he spoke about is not new because he is 103.  He is here a long time.  We really must check ourselves and ensure correct measures can be put in place to try to arrest that kind of change in our culture.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State, Senator Hackett, spoke about multi-species sward feeds and the use of clovers in grasslands.

I will try to arrange this.  Senator Horkan asked for a debate on the hospitality sector and the confusion caused yesterday.  To be fair to the Ministers at the Cabinet table yesterday, they were trying to react in a timely manner to the information they had and to give as much notice as they possibly could.  They really are caught between a rock and a hard place.  I have no doubt that based on consultation today and tomorrow those anomalies will be ironed out.  There are obviously some, if not many, inconsistencies and they will also be fixed.<br\/><br\/>Senator Gavan talked about a family renting from the local authority in Limerick.  What he said was absolutely outrageous.  I do not know whether it is worth my while writing on our behalf to the county manager or the CEO.  It is absolutely unacceptable.  Can we imagine the headlines on the front of the <i>Daily Mail<\/i>or the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>if a private landlord said not to mind a shower and that people would be grand in a couple of years' time.  It is not acceptable.  It should not make a difference who the landlord is.  Landlords have responsibilities and tenants have rights.  I will write a letter and send it to Senator Gavan today.  Perhaps he will have a look at it and send it back.<br\/><br\/>Senator Cassells spoke about the intervention of the Minister yesterday on the accident and emergency department in Navan, which was very welcome.  Senator Craughwell reminded us of a programme on Jadotville that will be shown tonight on RT&Eacute; at 7 p.m.  He also spoke about the need for a Government information and education programme on trying to encourage vaccination.  I really do not think telling people vaccine centres are open and to come along on Saturday will be enough to bring some of the 300,000 people left.  If they have genuine concerns we need to address them.  A different type of education and information programme might be warranted and needed.<br\/><br\/>Senator Lombard asked for a debate on water services specific to Cork.  We could probably widen it out.  A considerable number of housing developments are being delayed because they do not have access to the services required for the sites.  We need to iron these out and come up with some short-term solutions.<br\/><br\/>Senator Davitt asked for a debate on carbon and our climate action budgets.  We will try to arrange this.  Senator Black spoke about the awful news released over the weekend with regard to the 108 incidents of abuse over many years.  What I think is most shocking is that the direction of the Minister to publish the report continues to be ignored.  This is absolutely astounding.  I will certainly send a letter looking for an interim report from the Law Reform Commission for the Senator and we will see where it goes.<br\/><br\/>Senator Moynihan spoke about musicians and the announcements coming from the deliberations over the coming days.  I hope we have them before Friday.  Senator Martin spoke about his Bill.  Senator Boyhan expressed concerns about waiting lists and I will certainly ask the Minister to attend the House for a debate as quickly as I possibly can.  He was here yesterday to discuss Sl&aacute;intecare.<br\/><br\/>Senator Kyne spoke about the roadshow of the Minister, Deputy McConalogue.  He also spoke about the need for a debate on the national development plan and Project Ireland 2040.  The debate request has been made but it will be the other side of the recess before the Minister gets to come back to us with a date.<br\/><br\/>Senator O'Loughlin opened today by discussing World Osteoporosis Day.  She encouraged women to get themselves screened because usually it is only after an accident or a fall that they find out there is something.  The earliest intervention would provide the most efficient and best outcomes.  The Senator spoke about the debate on dyslexia last week and the continuing roadblocks of bureaucratic nonsense put in children's way when trying to access services.  There probably is a need for a debate on it.

I agreed to the grouping in that context.  The amendments relate to three separate issues.  As we discussed at length on Committee Stage, these are the potentially negative consequences of the legislation, which I believe are unintended on the part of the Minister of State and his office.  In addition, we are questioning how effective the legislation is in addressing the problem of smuggling it is designed to address.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 1 relates to a core issue we will have to address, which are the rights and protections of smuggled persons.  I have highlighted areas of the legislation where there are inadequate protections for the rights of the smuggled person and where the smuggled person, certainly when they are acting in relation to a family member, could inadvertently be subject to prosecution.  Crucially, this amendment focuses on the wider picture.  We suggest \"the steps [that would be taken] to ensure the State has reflected the...Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, including the principle of non-refoulement in all [areas] of...operation of this Act\".  I am not bringing the convention in; I am aware it is already in law and Ireland is already party to it and is bound by it.  The question is how we ensure it is being reflected at all stages.  <\/p> <p>The reference to the number of cases taken to the European Court of Human Rights and the Court of Justice by persons who have been the object of people smuggling is, again, around the question of human rights.  I certainly do not think we should have that very high bar because very few people will be in a position to take cases to the Court of Human Rights or the Court of Justice, but those cases would be a very significant red flag if they were to be taken.<\/p> <p>I will focus more on the other amendments.  I know my colleague may wish to speak to amendment No. 1 as well.  Amendments Nos. 14, 15 and 18 are really about the detail of what happens when we change the law.  On amendment No. 14, the rationale for this legislation has been the practical impact of the current laws and the fact there is a perceived difficulty with prosecution in relation to them.  This amendment is similarly ensuring we get the law right this time.  I am asking for a report on an annual basis showing \"the estimated number[s of victims] of human trafficking...the methodology...to produce the estimate and potential alternative methods of estimation...[and] a summary of the outcomes for smuggled persons [who are] identified under this Act, including what proportion of those smuggled persons sought or were granted asylum [or] sought or were granted another form of international protection in the State\" and \"the number of persons [which is one of the stated purposes of the Bill] found guilty of an offence... and a summary of the sentences imposed\". <\/p> <p>I will go on to amendment No. 15 because it is not simply about how many people were prosecuted, which is my concern.  The Minister of State has said at great length that it is his expectation that those persons who are engaged in humanitarian action will not end up being prosecuted under this Act.  He knows I have tabled other amendments where I seek to confirm that by making it clear it is not an offence to engage in humanitarian action, or to act for humanitarian purposes, in the ways outlined under sections 6, 7 and 8.  Amendment No. 15, which I hope the Minister of State will accept because it is crucial, is to make sure there is no adverse effect, that is, a potential chilling effect or a stressful prosecution, whereby the burden of proof is moved to the person who is being prosecuted, because that burden of proof is now moving from the prosecutor having to prove criminality.  The burden of proof is now being put on a humanitarian actor, which is quite a significant shift.<\/p> <p>I ask the Minister of State to lay a report for us detailing how many prosecutions are not pursued due to a humanitarian defence.  We spoke at great length on Committee Stage about the scenario the Minister of State, Senator Ward and others see unfolding, which is that where there is a humanitarian defence a prosecution will not be pursued.  I am asking if we can track whether that is in fact happening, in addition to the number of prosecutions that are pursued where a humanitarian defence is employed, which is where somebody has gone through the whole process of prosecution, a potential period of imprisonment awaiting trial, periods of having to access legal support, construct a defence and, effectively, having to make that defence in the dock.  Then, and this is crucial because it relates to the chilling effect we spoke about, we should track \"any impact this Act may have had in respect of the level of engagement of humanitarian organisations in humanitarian activity in respect of smuggled persons\".<\/p> <p>I will not speak at the same length I have before because we have constraints on time.  In summary, Ireland believes that humanitarian search and rescue is a good thing.  We directed the national resources of our Naval Service to the humanitarian search and rescue of up to 8,000 people a year because we believed it was a good and not simply that it was acceptable.  It was something we channelled our national resources to.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=20\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The reason given for not continuing with that has simply been that we have not been given support from others in terms of bilateral agreements with other countries on pursuing humanitarian search and rescue.  The established position from Ireland has been that we support it. <\/p><p>NGOs and humanitarian actors stepped into the gap.  We went from rescuing 8,000 people in one year to 1,300 the next year to almost none the year after.  Humanitarian NGOs and civil society organisations have stepped in.  They are performing what we consider to be a good.  It is very important that our legislation does not work against that good.  That is why Part C is important.  <\/p><p>I would urge the Minister of State to accept all of these amendments and track the outcomes for smuggled persons.  Amendment No. 15 is crucial if we are going to see if this Bill unfolds as he has expressed the hope it will.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 18 combines a few of these issues.  It is another approach to the same thing.  It combines the question of the outcomes for smuggled persons, including the number that have been identified, those who have sought or have been given any form of international protection and an examination of the chilling effect on the work of humanitarian organisations.  It also includes the way in which section 9, the section which presents the humanitarian offence, has been used in decisions whether to prosecute and the impact of this Bill in terms of Ireland's fulfilment of its human rights obligations, including its obligations under the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and the European Convention on Human Rights.  Maybe amendment No. 18 is even better.  I do not know.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 18 combines the principles in amendment No. 14, in terms of the outcomes for smuggled persons, and amendment No. 15, in terms of how the Bill ends up operating and what its effects actually are.

These are matters we discussed in length on Committee Stage.<\/p> <p>I wish to make two points. The first is that a post-enactment report on the Bill will be prepared in accordance with Standing Orders and laid before the House.  This will provide an opportunity to address many of the issues raised.<\/p> <p>The second point is that I have requested that a briefing be prepared for Oireachtas Members in respect of several of these issues.  I would suggest that looking at issues such as the satisfaction of the State's obligations in respect of international protection applicants, people who have been trafficked and how humanitarian organisations engage with migrants before and after they arrive in the State simply through the lens of smuggling offences is not the best way of going about it.  People who are vulnerable and require protection may or may not have been smuggled and may or may not have entered the State irregularly.<\/p> <p>While there may be situations where law enforcement will be dealing with smuggled persons in difficult situations, such as where a ship has been intercepted, these are a very limited part of the picture.  As the Senator will be aware, there is a breadth of work ongoing in this area.  As I have said, the appointment of a national rapporteur, the development of the national referral mechanism and the many other initiatives that are ongoing in tandem to this Bill must be allowed to take root. <\/p> <p>The Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, this week announced a new public awareness campaign on human trafficking.  The key messages it is trying to convey are that human trafficking is a crime that is happening in Ireland, that traffickers often profit from the misery of their victims in forced employment and that the public needs to be vigilant.  The #anyonetrafficked 2021 campaign will be rolled out on social media and in key transport hubs across the country until the end of November.  It has been undertaken with the support of a number of other State agencies and non-State organisations. <\/p> <p>With that in mind, I would like to reassure the Senator of my Department's commitment to the type of inter-agency collaboration between the Department of Justice and NGOs that is being sought through these amendments.  Work has also been done on the development of training through NGOs, targeting front-line staff in industries such as hospitality, airline and shipping who may have come into contact with trafficked persons and providing dedicated accommodation for the female victims of sexual exploitation.

Post-enactment reports can be blunt and refer to the number of prosecutions full stop.  Detailed issues, such as the number of prosecutions in which section 9 was found to be relevant or the outcomes for smuggled persons who have had engagement with the Bill, might be included.  I hope that the Minister of State will indicate whether those very important metrics will be reflected in the post-enactment report and that he ensures they are part of it.

I also want to recognise the engagement of officials in the interim period between Committee and Report Stages.  That has been very constructive.<\/p> <p>Amendments Nos. 2 and 3 relate to a core aspect of the Bill.  Saying that a person can have a defence is very different from saying that a person will not be prosecuted or is not committing an offence.  We have spoken about the potential chilling effect of the signal that sends.  In many cases, humanitarian actors and NGOs are people who are not necessarily very well resourced.  They are taking an important step.  There is a recognition that we do not want a risk of unnecessary or inappropriate prosecution in the Bill for persons engaged in business.  There is provision in the Bill, as it stands, that it should not be an offence to perform activities under sections 6 and 7 in the presence of a smuggled person in the State where a person is doing so in the course of his or her ordinary business or work.  It is a sensible element of the Bill.  It is designed to ensure that if somebody rents a room in a bed and breakfast, takes somebody somewhere in a taxi, lets somebody on a bus or sells somebody a service in a shop in the ordinary course of events, even where this has an impact such a person would not be prosecuted.  We know it is not constructive to have a threat of prosecution hanging over ordinary and good actions.<\/p> <p>One of these amendments is about trying to ensure that when we talk about people who are doing things in the course of their work and their professions, we also include NGOs who are doing things in the course of their ordinary work.  Employees of NGOs do food runs and support people with shelter or basic needs.  As we know, many humanitarian organisations are trying to ensure that vulnerable persons get through the winter.  This involves ensuring the kind of important and supportive work we saw in Lesbos, and which we also see in communities in Ireland, does not carry any risk of prosecution.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=20\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Amendment No. 2 is to ensure that when we describe kinds of ordinary work, that it includes voluntary work, that it is framed as \"whether for profit or otherwise\", and that we are not simply protecting business owners but also protecting those who are volunteers within organisations.  Amendment No. 3 is an expansion of that because while the safety net clause may be in the Bill, it relates only to those who have a presence in the State.  I would like to see the same exemption applied in relation to \"entry into or transit across\".  While this would not deal with all of the humanitarian action that I believe should be regarded as not an offence, it would deal with humanitarian NGOs who do this as part of their ordinary work and it would give some more protection to them in terms of their engagement in the kinds of activities outlined under sections 6 and 7, if they are doing so under the rubric of their employment or their volunteer role with a humanitarian NGO.  Amendment No. 3 would slightly expand what is in the bill in a constructive way, but it may be halfway to having a full humanitarian action exemption, which I favour, and having a humanitarian defence that the Bill sets out.  This would at least take a certain cohort of humanitarian actors out of the realm of having to face potential prosecution.  I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, might be able to support these amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021102000002#R01100","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634722200,"counter":107,"content":"<p>We had this discussion on Committee Stage, with regard to Senator Higgins's amendments.  I appreciate very clearly the difference between an exemption and a defence, and I understand where the Senator is coming from.  In the context of amendment No. 2, which adds in the words \"whether for profit or otherwise\", I can see the value in that and I do not have a difficulty with that.<\/p> <p>On the proposed insert in subsection (3), I wonder if two issues arise there.  My understanding is that it expands the provision of the defining section 5 to also include an exemption in respect of section 8, which is the provision of fraudulent travel or identity documents for the purposes of assisting transit into or the presence in the State.  While I am very much alive to what Senator Higgins is suggesting for putting in place a layer of protection for people who are doing things in a bona fide way and who might inadvertently provide something without ever intending to commit an offence, I do have a small concern that the kind of activity involved in section 8 is of a different calibre to the potential offences under sections 6 and 7.  It is in a different category to those offences and I would be less inclined to extend the provisions of the existing subsection (2) through a subsection (3) in to cover section 8 as well.<\/p> <p>In addition to that, I come back to what I said on Committee Stage.  I am mindful of the difference between an exemption and a defence, but one of the pitfalls with prosecuting offences like this is that one can hamstring the prosecution and prevent it from ever bringing an action where it thinks it might be appropriate to bring one.  However noble it might be, that is the consequence of creating an exemption.  I have a concern with the further extension of that to cover certain categories whereby an unintended consequence might arise and that somebody who is clearly a person who should be prosecuted for one reason or another, or who in the opinion of the prosecutor should be prosecuted, would then be able to avail of an exemption and would be able to say \"Well you cannot prosecute me for this\".  My concern about subsection (3) as proposed through amendment No. 3 is that there is an unintended consequence that might arise from that.  We may end up giving an exemption to someone and giving him or her a free pass who might not be deserving of it.<\/p> <p>We have discussed how important it is in the context of this legislation to enable prosecutors and also to defend humanitarian activities and those involved in humanitarian activities.  At the same time, however, I come back to what I said on Committee Stage about relying on the prosecutorial discretion of the prosecutorial authority, and trusting in the fact that it does not want to prosecute people who should not be prosecuted, and to a certain extent understanding that we must, even when framing legislation, allow for the discretion of a prosecutor to make these decisions.  It is impossible, in drafting legislation of this breadth, to provide for every individual case.  The reality is that no matter how many of these amendments go in - I am not saying there are not some that should go in - and no matter how many changes we make, we will never have a piece of legislation that comprehensively addresses every possible scenario.  We will, therefore, be necessarily reliant on the discretion of the person who has to make a decision about a prosecution.  My concern about amendment No. 3 in particular is that it removes that discretion and we would try to cover everything in a legislative format, which is not possible, and this will have the potential for an unintended consequence of giving somebody a free pass who should not get it. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021102000002#S00200","speaker":"1685"},{"type":"speech","time":1634722200,"counter":108,"content":"<p>I thank the Senators for their comments.  Section 5(2), while a short provision, is very important for the broader context of the Bill.  It provides that a person does not for the purposes of the offences in sections 6 and 7 unlawfully assist presence in the State when providing goods or services in the ordinary course of his or her business trade or profession.  It is important to emphasise that it is intended to provide a clarification on the scope of the offences rather than to provide an exception of itself.  It does not prejudice the narrowness for specificity of sections 6 and 7, or suggest that other activities not mentioned do constitution assisting presence.  Rather, it makes absolutely clear for the avoidance of doubt, that certain activities do not constitute an offence.  This is particularly important for accommodation.  It is motivated by the work done at European level by the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights and others, and also by the work being done in Ireland to address the practical issues faced by those who come here.<\/p> <p>Fears have been raised an EU level that where a landlord is aware that a person is in breach of immigration law, that providing accommodation in the ordinary course of business could be interpreted as unlawfully assisting the presence of the person.  We do not agree with this interpretation and have made absolutely clear that it does not apply in this legislation.  That is less about protecting landlords than about ensuring that people can have access to accommodation and other essentials without any question about their immigration status.  We do not want a situation where proof of status is sought before letting property or providing any other services.<\/p> <p>I will now turn to the specific amendments.  The difficulty with amendment No. 3 is that the logic that applies to assisting presence is not the same as that which applies to assisting entry or transit.  People assisting entry in the course of their business are very deliberately and correctly within the scope of the offences.  I will give an obvious example: a mini-bus operator who knowingly facilitates smuggling cannot escape liability by showing that he or she also has a legitimate transit business.  The same applies to truck drivers, boat hire and so on.  It is not even a question of where the burden of proof lies.  The amendment would exclude conduct that we consider should definitely be criminal and, accordingly, it would be directly contrary to the policy of the Bill.  Under the circumstances, I cannot accept amendment No. 3.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 2 is quite different.  I am aware that Senator Higgins has been working with the Department officials on the wording to provide additional clarity.  The amendment is consistent with the spirit of the existing provision.  As I have said, section 5(2) exists to clarify the offences rather than to include or exclude things from them.

On Second Stage the Minister of State was extremely clear that his intention was certainly not that a smuggled person would end up potentially facing prosecution under this Act, and I know that that is not the intent.  I highlighted on Committee Stage the inadvertent risk that, as the Bill was phrased, a smuggled person - specifically, I have highlighted the issue of traveller identity documents, though I know there may be some wider concerns - who has, for example, the identity document of a child or other family member could find himself or herself falling under the frame of smuggling under section 8.  It is therefore really important we clarify this.<\/p> <p>I have suggested three different ways in which this might be done.  Where a person, as described in section 8, produces, procures, provides, possesses or controls a fraudulent traveller identity document in respect of a family member, and where that person is himself or herself the object of the people smuggling, that person should not be deemed to be committing an offence.  In such a situation there might be a whole family being smuggled and one of them may have the identity papers for the others.  We should not have a situation in which families, just when they might be trying to enter the international protection process, to seek asylum or whatever else, have, in parallel, one of their family members facing a potential charge of smuggling, even though that person is the smuggled person who is explicitly not the target of this legislation.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 6 contains a slightly different wording.  In that amendment I speak specifically about family members under the age of 18, though I think the amendment relating to wider family members is a better framing.  There are also, for example, people who may have identification for an elderly parent or somebody who does not speak the language.  There may be one family member who can speak English, Spanish or whatever the language might be and who is nominated to engage.  Losing that person would be very significant for a family.<\/p> <p>Amendments Nos. 4 and 5 are variations of the same.  Amendment No. 6, as I said, slightly constrains the matter to family members under the age of 18.<\/p> <p>I have had some engagement with the Minister of State's Department.  I think he has recognised that there is a potential lacuna or space for ambiguity in the law in this regard.  I would appreciate his response as to whether he feels he can address this or accept these amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021102000002#T01500","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1634722200,"counter":126,"content":"<p>I thank the Senators for their comments.  As I have made clear throughout the debate on the Bill, we do not intend to criminalise people who are being smuggled, and I think that extends properly to parents travelling with their children, for example.  I believe that, as it stands, that would fall under humanitarian assistance.  I appreciate that Senator Higgins and I differ on that being framed as a defence, and we will discuss that further when we come to the next group of amendments.  I recognise, however, that further clarity may be desirable, subject to it not creating ambiguity elsewhere.  On that basis I have asked for further consideration to be given by officials to the drafting on this question and on the non-criminalisation amendments, that is, amendments Nos. 12 and 13.  It is a difficult area.  We need to ensure that smugglers themselves do not fall under any definition of a smuggled person, for example, by having paid someone else in the chain for false documents in respect of themselves.  I would also prefer any clarification to apply to offences under sections 6 and 7 as well as to the documentary offences under section 8.  There is also a role for prosecutorial discretion.  To cite the most recent DPP guidelines on the decision to prosecute, \"a prosecutor should ... [take] particular care where there is information to suggest that the suspect is a victim of crime\".  The guideline goes on to refer to trafficking as an example.<\/p> <p>I cannot commit to a particular form of amendment at this stage - that will be subject to the advice of the Attorney General's office - but if the advice is that further provision would be beneficial, I will introduce the necessary amendments to the D&aacute;il and return to the Seanad with them.  Given that, I cannot agree to the amendments at this stage but I am, of course, happy to engage with the Senators further in due course on them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021102000002#T01600","speaker":"1618"},{"type":"speech","time":1634722200,"counter":127,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his engagement and welcome the fact that he is looking to ensure that that clarification, if it is inserted, will be a little wider than the issue I have addressed of documentation but will look also at sections 6 and 7.  That is positive.  I again emphasise that I do not believe the humanitarian defence is appropriate in respect of a smuggled person because we are talking about people who, by their nature, are probably entering a different legal process - for example, the international protection process.  Even the question of there being a potential prosecution, whether or not there may be a successful defence, could jeopardise the well-being and the access to rights for an entire family unit.  I think that that is how the Minister of State is minded but I urge him to be very robust in being clear that the smuggled person is not the object of prosecution.  I know he wants to clarify where that smuggled person is himself or herself.  I think that that clarification should be able to be teased out because we are quite clear.  I almost have two safety nets in some of these amendments, whereby reference is made to people who are the object of smuggling themselves and where it is done in respect of a family member.  That should be clear because if a smuggler is engaging in these actions in respect of other persons who are not the smuggler's family members, that would count as an exemption in respect of the actions taken for the family member.  However, that same extension would not extend to other actions the smuggler may have carried out for those who are not his or her family members.  I think that can be addressed.  I urge the Minister of State to make this very clear in the definitions, which is I think what he is trying to address, rather than placing people in a position of having to try to exercise a defence, especially given the likely vulnerability of those persons and their access.<\/p> <p>Again, I thank the Minister of State for his engagement on this.  I will be watching the D&aacute;il very closely and I hope we have the Minister of State back in the Seanad with amendments that address this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021102000002#T01700","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1634722200,"counter":128,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1634722200,"counter":129,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 5:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 11, between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following:  \t&ldquo;(8) Where a person who produces, procures, provides, possesses or controls a fraudulent travel or identity document does so in respect of a family member, and that person is themselves the object of people smuggling, they shall not commit an offence.&rdquo;.  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021102000002#T01900","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1634722200,"counter":130,"content":"<p>I second the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021102000002#T02000","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1634722200,"counter":131,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1634722200,"counter":132,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 6:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 11, between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following:  \t&ldquo;(8) It shall not be an offence where a person who produces, procures, provides, possesses or controls a fraudulent travel or identity document does so in respect of a family member under 18, and where that person is themselves the object of people smuggling.&rdquo;.  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021102000002#T02200","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1634722200,"counter":133,"content":"<p>I second the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021102000002#T02300","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1634722200,"counter":134,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1634722200,"counter":135,"content":"<p>If amendment No. 7 is agreed, amendments Nos. 8 to 11, inclusive, cannot be moved.

Amendments Nos. 7 to 9, inclusive, and 11 are similar in that they would effectively reframe the humanitarian assistance defence as being elements of the offence and accordingly it would be for the prosecution to prove the contrary.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 10 provides for a bar to prosecution under similar circumstances. <\/p> <p>The question of where the burden of proof should lie was discussed at length on Committee Stage and it is useful to recap now.  A significant motivation for this Bill was to increase the effectiveness of criminal sanctions in this area.  The very clear advice we received from the Garda and from prosecutors was that the existing framing in the 2000 Act of a requirement for material gain was a major practical block to successfully prosecuting organised criminal smugglers.  The reason for that, as I think is widely accepted, is that the payment will not typically take place in the state and the smuggled persons may not co-operate with authorities for fear of the consequences for them and their families at home.<\/p> <p>The starting point has to be that the existing legislation falls considerably short of providing an effective deterrent to people smugglers.  We have sought to strike an appropriate balance that reflects our intention, which is to focus on for-profit smuggling while also not placing an impossible burden on prosecutors.  I wish to make clear that allowing smugglers to operate without risk of prosecution does not further any humanitarian motive.  It places more and more people in the hands of criminal gangs who, at the very least, will charge exorbitant fees, will likely place the people smuggled in danger and may exploit them in the most shocking of ways.<\/p> <p>The State is not at odds with those providing genuine humanitarian assistance to migrants.  We simply have to ensure that well-intentioned measures do not unintentionally undermine the criminal sanctions we are putting in place.  Under the EU instruments for assisting entry-in-transit, we cannot incorporate a blanket element of financial material gain either as an element of the offence or as a defence.  We can make provision for humanitarian assistance, as we have done.  We have done so as broadly as possible.  In providing for a broad and generally applicable humanitarian assistance defence, we have gone well beyond what most other member states have done.  This discretion has been taken up by just seven other states and in many cases is far more narrowly drawn.<\/p> <p>Our terms with regard to where the burden of proof lies rest on the question of who is best placed to meet it.  One can take entry as an example.  The prosecution must prove that the accused intentionally assisted someone to enter the State in breach of immigration law and that the accused knew or had reasonable cause to believe that the entry was a breach.  That is a substantial burden.  It is showing that a person intentionally facilitated unlawful entry.  If that is proven and if the accused is then claiming that they were acting for humanitarian motives, it is reasonable to require them to provide positive and convincing evidence.<\/p> <p>The Senators have raised how significant a prosecution would be for a humanitarian actor.  While accepting that being prosecuted is, of course, very serious for anyone, I do not agree that the framing of a humanitarian assistance provision as a defence gives rise to a real risk of unjustified or politicised prosecution.  The Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, is independent in its functions and it establishes clear and well-understood guidelines on decisions to prosecute.  Critically, the guidelines state that a \"prosecutor should not lay a charge where there is no reasonable prospect of securing a conviction before a reasonable jury.\"   There is simply nothing to suggest that the DPP charges people to make political points where there is no prospect of a conviction.<\/p> <p>I do not think the bar to prosecution proposed in amendment No. 10 is realistic.  We would be asking the DPP to make a determination of fact, which would properly be for a court to do.  Assuming that the DPP believes there is some prospect of a conviction, then the language would not prevent that.  Even if we were to accept the Senators' hypothetical politically motivated prosecutor, these provisions would not prevent that.  Such a prosecutor could simply state that they were satisfied that the evidence was there.  Given the breadth of the defence as it is drafted, I do not believe there is a real risk of an unjustified prosecution and I do not accept that bona fide organisations now find themselves in jeopardy.  Similar language has been used in the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act 2000 and I do not believe that there has been politically motivated prosecutions in those cases.  I simply do not believe that any real risk exists in these circumstances but we need to secure prosecutions against those who are smuggling.  In the circumstances, I cannot accept the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021102000002#U00500","speaker":"1618"},{"type":"speech","time":1634722200,"counter":144,"content":"<p>This comes down to a very large transfer of responsibility for the policy outcome that we wish to achieve towards the discretion of prosecution.  If we believe that as an outcome, persons engaged in humanitarian actions should not be prosecuted for an offence, and if that is what we are hoping will happen, we should reflect that in the legislation rather than hoping that will come out from the process.  If, even having removed the for-profit piece, the burden of proof is now to be placed on those being potentially charged with smuggling, as per the briefing from the Department, they should at least be given the opportunity to demonstrate that burden of proof before prosecution, in that they could say they are not committing an offence.<\/p> <p>As the Minister of State has said, if there is a political motivation we might still see a prosecution, but that would be a different situation.  If a prosecutor is repeatedly prosecuting people for something that has been found to be an offence, that becomes an issue and a pattern can be clearly identified.  If a prosecutor chooses to prosecute people despite them having a defence to the offence, and that prosecutor is operating entirely within his or her permitted discretion, there is nothing we can do to address that pattern except to change the law again.  That is why I have suggested that if this is how we plan to have it unfold, we need to track what happens with the prosecutions.  This is not in terms of individual instances but if we are seeing cases coming up and the Article 9 humanitarian defence is being used - if, by its nature, that is happening in the dock - we will know that the deterrent or chilling effect that the Minister of State believes the humanitarian defence will have on a prosecutor prosecuting humanitarian NGOs is not working.  Again, we are leaving a great deal to chance and discretion.<\/p> <p>I ask the Minister of State to note our earlier point.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=20\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This legislation is not happening in a vacuum; it is happening in the context of equivalent similar legislation throughout Europe.  Other European countries have had very aggressive prosecutions.  I will not detail the cases again, but numerous members of MSF and other NGOs are being prosecuted.  The prosecution is not necessarily to achieve a conviction, but to create a financial, social and psychological burden on NGOs.  If we go down the route of prosecutorial discretion here in Ireland, we are also setting the template for that to be the model employed in other countries which are transposing the directive into their own laws.<\/p><p>I believe we should have aimed for something better because the jeopardy relating to the chill effect on humanitarian action is greater than the jeopardy regarding prosecutions in the legislation as framed.  I regret that the Minister of State will not accept the amendments.  I hope he will consider the issue further in the D&aacute;il and look at it in that context.  <\/p><p>Unfortunately, we know of such people.  We had a member of a refugee appeals tribunal who said \"No\" to everyone for years and that person was acting within their discretion.  This was somebody who effectively gave blanket refusals to everybody.  I do not want us to end up in such a situation.  That is not about the individuals; they have their discretion.  It is about not putting too much into that space.  I hope the Minister of State will reflect upon and engage with these issues further in the D&aacute;il.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021102000002#U00600","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634722200,"counter":146,"content":"<p>I made it very clear as we started proceedings today that a Senator may speak only once on Report Stage except the proposer of an amendment who is entitled to reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021102000002#V00200","speaker":"1674"},{"type":"speech","time":1634722200,"counter":147,"content":"<p>Can I-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021102000002#V00300","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1634722200,"counter":148,"content":"<p>I did not want to interrupt.

These two issues are constantly entwined because we are coming to the protection of the humanitarian worker and the protection of the smuggled person.  The purpose is to ensure that we do not have wrongful prosecution - a prosecution which creates a chilling effect on the humanitarian actor or creates a further damage or harm to the smuggled person, who, as the Minister of State described in his speech, will in many cases have experienced exceptional difficulties and will be extremely vulnerable.  <\/p> <p>I have proposed a blanket safety clause in amendments Nos. 12 and 13.  For both the smuggled person and the humanitarian actor, we need to err on the side of protection for different, but equally important, reasons.  While this is not quite here, it is between the lines.  When we talk about the damage done by smugglers and the importance of prosecuting them, we must remember that smuggling is happening because some people are desperate to travel and we do not have safe passage routes.  I have not tabled amendments because I recognise that is a wider piece.  However, I would like to hear a response.  We really need to engage on that question of improving our safe passage routes.<\/p> <p>Smugglers are not the cause of smuggling; desperation is the cause of smuggling.  It is then exploited by smugglers for profit.  The core driver is that many people are in extremely terrible situations.  In some cases, they are seeking family reunification but are excluded by narrow family reunification laws.  In some cases, they are fleeing direct conflict.  In some cases, they would seek asylum but physically cannot get to the place where they need to be in order to seek asylum.  Those are the people who in many cases are being smuggled.  It is important that this legislation does not put a further burden on those people because the responsibility for them being in that situation lies partly with the smugglers, but it also lies partly with states and the failure to provide safe passage routes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021102000002#V02300","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1634722200,"counter":168,"content":"<p>I echo everything that Senator Higgins has said.  Under the 2002 EU directive, the facilitator of entry and transit does not need to have obtained any financial benefit from smuggling in order for it to be considered a crime.  However, Article 6.1 of the protocol requires that the act be for financial gain or other material benefit.  The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime has gone further and stated that the financial and material benefit element of the crime is a key component of the international definition.  It notes that it was intended by the drafters to ensure that those who provided support for smuggled persons for humanitarian and family reasons were not prosecuted.  Criminalising people for smuggling without requiring a financial or other material element to the crime may have the effect of criminalising a wider range of circumstances not intended under the protocol, including, for example, people providing assistance on the basis of family or for humanitarian grounds.<\/p> <p>EU research has found that those involved in providing assistance to irregular migrants report that they fear sanctions.

I understand that the Senator is trying to avoid that with the reference to \"derives no financial benefit\", but that may fall foul of the minimum standards in the directive.

My colleague, Senator Ruane, is the person who first highlighted this issue on Committee Stage.<\/p> <p>A lot of the rationale for this legislation being brought forward is the perception that Ireland has been rated as tier 2, so less than best practice levels, in terms of our reports on how we are doing with identifying trafficking, and dealing with smuggling and other issues.  In terms of the issues that were identified as problems, to be honest, prosecutions and successful prosecutions were a small part of .  A lot of the issues that were identified as concerns in Ireland concerned the failure to identify trafficked or smuggled persons - I have focused in these amendments on smuggled persons because this is Bill on smuggling - and that there was a lack of knowledge and understanding on the part of front-line staff who were engaging with these vulnerable persons, first in identification and then in following up .  Also, there is a concern about ensuring the smuggled person is given the supports he or she needs to access his or her rights, including his or her rights under international protection and under the European convention.  That is the area where Ireland has been marked as falling down and that is where we have got a poorer ranking.  Therefore, this is an area that needs to be improved.<\/p> <p>In amendments No. 16 and 17, we specify the \"additional personnel, including independent civilian experts\" and \"the potential for human rights experts from non-governmental organisations to assist in identification and support of smuggled persons\".  This is an issue that was discussed at great length in the past and which was happening, in fact, coming up to about 2003 and 2004.  There had been a practice whereby you had independent human rights and civilian experts who were in a position to be, which we cannot expect every front-line security officer will be, experts in international protection law and due process and who had an expertise when it came to legislation on smuggling.  That was a really important resource and, crucially, as the Minister of State himself spoke about the fear a smuggled person will have when he or she encounters a person of authority or the fear he or she will have of both the smuggler and, potentially, a member of the police force or authority, especially if the smuggled person comes from an authoritarian situation, having those independent personnel as someone a smuggled person can talk to and engage with on how he or she accesses his or her rights is a very good idea which tends to lead to more honest communication which, as a result, also leads to better prosecution of smugglers.  That is something we had in 2003 and 2004.  It was being trialled, it was happening and then it stopped happening.  It is something we should revisit and I hope the Minister of State can revisit it.  It would make a huge difference if, for example, as well as having the security and officials we have, there was also an independent NGO, member of civil society or independent expert at the key points of entry at Ireland's ports and airports.  It would be best practice.  I believe it has been brought in in New Zealand and a few other places.

By placing a provision in the Bill committing the State to reporting on the level of training provided to officers and officials dealing with smuggling and trafficking, we offer these vulnerable people the best possible chance of being dealt with in a dignified and respectful manner.<\/p> <p>In regard to amendment No. 17, to ensure the vulnerable people this Bill seeks to protect are given the protections and rights to which they are entitled, it is crucial smuggled persons are properly identified.  Currently, Ireland and Romania are the only two EU states that are placed on the tier 2 watch list of the recently published Trafficking in Persons report.  The report, compiled by the United States Government to combat human trafficking, suggests with this ranking that the estimated number of victims of severe forms of trafficking or smuggling in Ireland is either very significant or is significantly increasing.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lynn Ruane:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2481\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2481&amp;amp;pid=LynnRuane&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=20\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is, therefore, essential that there is a commitment in this Bill to the establishment of a proper identification process which ties in to the rights and entitlements laid out in it.

I will speak to amendments Nos. 16 and 17 together because they are closely related.  I acknowledged in our discussions in the House last week that there is a fine line between people smuggling and human trafficking.  The Senator made some poignant points about the difficulties the most vulnerable people face when seeking safe passage for themselves and their loved ones.  I said the following at the time and feel strongly that I must reiterate it now.  The issues raised here are more appropriately dealt with in the context of human trafficking discussions.  As a result, I cannot accept either of the amendments.  In respect of the specific statistics regarding the outcome relating to smuggled persons, I mentioned on the Committee Stage that the Department of Justice publishes detailed statistics on the international protection process.  We must also consider the focus of this Bill and the wider measures that are being put in place, such as those announced by the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, which will further enhance Ireland's capabilities in protecting those who are victims of people smuggling or human trafficking.<\/p> <p>As the Senator will be aware, there is a breadth of work ongoing in this area.  As I have said before, the appointment of a national rapporteur, the development of the national referral mechanism and the many other initiatives that are ongoing in tandem with this legislation must be allowed to take root.  The Minister of State, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, just announced a new public awareness campaign on human trafficking.  The key message this will convey is that human trafficking is a crime which is happening in Ireland, that traffickers often profit from the misery of their victims in forced employment and that the public needs to be vigilant.  The #AnyoneTrafficked 2021 campaign will be rolled out on social media and in key transport hubs across the country until the end of November.  It is being undertaken with the support of a number of other State agencies and non-State organisations.<\/p> <p>I referred to aspects of the broader work being done on Second Stage and again on Committee Stage.  There are many actions being implemented by the Government to address the issues faced by victims of trafficking, not just the national referral mechanism, but also the designation of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission as a national rapporteur and the development of a new action plan on trafficking with legislation to go alongside it.  There has also been work on the development of training through NGOs targeting front-line staff and industries such as the hospitality, airline and shipping industries who may have come in contact with trafficked persons and provide dedicated accommodation for female victims of sexual exploitation.  There are also improvements being made to the criminal justice system to support victims through the implementation of Supporting a Victim's Journey, the running of a new awareness-raising campaign in partnership with the International Organisation for Migration to build on the success of previous campaigns, an increase in funding for supporting victims of crime generally and increased funding dedicated specifically to supporting the victims of trafficking.<\/p> <p>I was also able to confirm to Deputy Christopher O'Sullivan in the D&aacute;il last night that the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy English, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, and I have agreed to a review of the atypical working scheme for migrant fishers.  The officials already met last week and will be meeting again this week.  That will be another important step to ensure that human trafficking in this country is tackled, acknowledging that there may be certain rogue elements abusing the system.  The scheme was urgent when it was brought in five years ago but it is now time that it was reviewed.  In the circumstances, I cannot agree to the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021102000002#X00200","speaker":"1618"},{"type":"speech","time":1634722200,"counter":189,"content":"<p>The review the Minister of State has mentioned may be an opportunity for engagement on these issues.  This is something that needs to be looked at.  As my colleague outlined, we know that things are not working as they should at the moment.  I look forward to engaging with the Minister of State on that review.  The training component is pressing, as we know, and we need that, regardless of the review.  It would be good to see that happening and to know it would be happening.<\/p> <p>As the Minister of State mentioned, there are larger issues relating to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and training right across the board.  We have focused our discussion on border points but there are issues about the wider understanding of these issues within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We talked, for example, about presence in the State rather than the exit point.  In general, there needs to be much more understanding of that.  The Minister of State will note that we do not just talk about knowledge, training and information in our amendments, but also address the question of support.  It is not enough for people to be aware of others' legal rights.  It is key that the issue is framed on the basis of supporting people to access their rights.  Training should not simply be about the limitations of one's power but almost as a positive duty of support.<\/p> <p>We will be engaging on this matter.  I know an ongoing process is under way but it would be good to send a signal with this Bill that addresses the question of support.  It would show that we have listened to the full gamut of the expression of concern that was expressed.  I hope the Minister of State might consider bringing in a provision, even it is not worded exactly as we have it, for the ancillary supports that will be put in place around addressing the issue of smuggling.  It would send a positive signal if the Minister of State found a way to include that language in the Bill and in the reporting on the Bill.  The Minister of State mentioned the post-enactment review.  Perhaps, in parallel with that review, there could be a report on implementation and whether sufficient training has been implemented and so forth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021102000002#X00300","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1634722200,"counter":190,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1634722200,"counter":191,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 17:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 11, after line 40, to insert the following:<br \/><br \/>&ldquo;<b>Report on identification of smuggled persons<\/b><br \/><br \/><b>11<\/b>.

I urge him to reflect further on where the balance might be.  If we are going with what I regard as the risky strategy of relying on prosecutorial discretion, I suggest that we put measures in place to track how that pans out.  I also recommend a review.  The review we proposed had a number of caveats but there is nothing to stop the Minster of State from putting in an amendment providing for a review with those factors considered.  I know there will be a post-enactment report but a review would be merited if we found in that post-enactment report that there had been unintended consequences.  We talked about the metrics for what happens with regard to prosecutorial discretion, the outcomes for smuggled persons and, crucially, whether those other, ancillary issues are actually being addressed.  Matters such as how we are reviewed on our human rights performance are going to be core considerations.<\/p> <p>I thank the Minister of State for indicating that he will engage on some matters.  I think we are taking something of a risk with this approach.  I believe an exemption for humanitarian action would be a safer position but if the Minister of State cannot accept that, I urge him to build in a review in one year or two years' time, ideally during the lifetime of this Oireachtas and while the Minister of State is still in office, because I believe he has an understanding of these issues and cares about them.

We may not have our Naval Service out there doing search and rescue any more, which is heartbreaking, but we can at least speak up whenever we are in a room where these matters are discussed.
