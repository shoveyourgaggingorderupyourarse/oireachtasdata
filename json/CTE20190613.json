He is joined today by Ms Orla Duane, deputy director of audit at the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Apologies have been received from Deputies Deering and Connolly.  Before we commence our main business, there are several matters to be discussed in private session, which we will do after we have dealt with correspondence.<\/p> <p>  The first item on the agenda is the minutes of the meeting of 30 May, which I propose to hold over to the next meeting, when we can deal with any matters arising.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  We will now deal with correspondence received since our last meeting two weeks ago, some of which will be of immense interest to members.  There are three categories of correspondence.  The first, category A, comprises Nos. 2225A, 2226A and 2230A, from Dr. Fergal Lynch, Secretary General at the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  These are the briefing documents and opening statements for today's meeting.  Is it agreed that we note and publish them?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  Category B is correspondence from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers, follow-up material from previous meetings of the committee and other items for publication.  The first item of correspondence in this category is No. 2161B from Mr. Paul O'Toole, chief executive officer of the Higher Education Authority, dated 10 May 2019, enclosing a report undertaken by Mazars into its review of the relationship between Cork Institute of Technology and certain named companies and entities.  At our last meeting we agreed to note and publish this report and hold it over for further consideration.  We had some discussion on it, with particular reference to situations where people are employed by the institute of technology and also receive some payments from companies in which the institute has a shareholding.  The report makes several serious recommendations, including that there be proper agreements in place for such persons, that those arrangements be officially recorded and that assurances be given that their main work with the institute of technology will not be compromised by their additional duties.  Our discussion is on the public record and members are free to raise the matter any time we deal with related topics.  Is it agreed that we note and publish the report and move on, or would members like to hold it over?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#B00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":7,"content":"<p>Yes, I request that it be held over.

We had a preliminary discussion the last day, but there is no problem with having a more detailed discussion at a future date.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  The next item is No. 2193B from Mr. Niall Cody, Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, dated 27 May 2019, responding to recommendation No. A17 of this committee's fifth periodic report regarding the threshold for inclusion in the category of high-wealth individuals.  It is a very important and detailed letter in which there will be significant interest from journalists and others.  The Comptroller and Auditor General included a chapter on this issue in his last report, in which he suggested that the threshold be reduced from &euro;50 million.  In our periodic report, we likewise made a detailed recommendation to lower the threshold.  The report of the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners vindicates the work this committee has done on the issue in recent months.  He acknowledges the recommendation in our fifth periodic report and states that Revenue has completed its review, as requested by us, with a recommendation of lowering the threshold for high-wealth individuals to persons having wealth greater than &euro;20 million.<\/p><p>This was agreed by the board of the Revenue Commissioners on 16 May 2019.  The implementation of this recommendation will result in an additional 475 cases being managed by the high wealth individual division.  This important improvement is a result of our work and recommendations.  I thank the Revenue Commissioners for responding in such a forthright manner.<br\/><br\/>The Revenue Commissioners have produced a case base review document attached to this letter which we will publish but I want to highlight the significance and relevance of this.  Up to this point, the threshold for net assets was &euro;50 million and there were 200 high wealth individuals on the books and 278 associated cases.  Lowering the threshold to &euro;20 million will add 475 primary cases.  There will be close to 700 on the list where there were previously 200 and that has to be a good result.  These people may not all be resident here for income tax purposes.  They may have property here or investment income.  The Revenue Commissioners use three sources of data for this study: their own data, third party data and external sources.  In their own data they considered disposal of assets or acquisitions over &euro;5 million, gifts of inheritance, stamp duty, trusts, local property tax, which they considered for one year, income and ownership of property.  That led them to compile a significant list.  They then examined third party data for people with accounts of greater than &euro;20 million, which showed up in the deposit interest earned, investment from undertakings and people who had income from directors' fees, rents, pensions and other categories.  The external sources data was the 2018 rich list that we see published in <i>The Sunday Independent<\/i>and <i>The Sunday Times<\/i>.  The Revenue Commissioners compared those lists with their own lists and made sure that anybody on both lists was examined.  That does not mean that everybody examined was necessarily included in the final list.<br\/><br\/>The Revenue Commissioners said that there were 68 taxpayers identified, 35 of whom were also identified from the above criteria but they did not come into the division because they fell into other categories, they might have been beneficial owners or resident taxpayers appeared to have large shareholdings in high wealth non-resident companies, and a combination of shareholdings.  They examined them very closely.  In addition to the 475 individuals, 68 were examined in further detail who did not meet the criteria.  All in all, it was a good day for the Irish taxpayer, the public, the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, the Revenue Commissioners and the Committee of Public Accounts.  We are seeing the value of the work being done here.  I compliment everybody from the Revenue side especially on their willingness to take on board in an open way the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts, and on coming back to say they were being implemented forthwith.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#B00400","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I wanted to welcome some of this.

We note and publish that and we acknowledge the good work of the Revenue Commissioners in that regard.<\/p> <p>  No. 2195B is from Mr. Paul Quinn, chief procurement officer, Office of Government Procurement, dated 28 May 2019, providing follow-up information regarding the Construction Contracts Act 2013 which we requested at our meeting with the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board on 16 May 2019.  We will note and publish this and it will feed into our consideration of the matter in our next periodic report.  <\/p> <p>  The key issue here was that we asked about the Construction Contracts Act 2013 which was a side issue to the discussion with the board of the paediatric hospital but it dealt with the question of subcontractors being paid for work.  In this document Mr. Quinn points out that the Construction Contracts Act 2013 does provide, irrespective of the provisions of a subcontract, that the subcontractors are entitled to be paid the full value of work completed every 30 days.  I am putting this on record because subcontractors get concerned that they may be left waiting.  Paying parties must respond within 21 days and if they fail to respond, they can be caught for the full bill submitted in the event that they do not contest it.  Any dispute has to be adjudicated and can go for adjudication where that arises.  We asked for that to be put on record.<\/p> <p>  I will go back to Mr. Quinn to clarify a question that has arisen in respect of the children's hospital.  Where the main contractor makes a submission for extra work carried out, which could take quite a long time to adjudicate, where stands the subcontractor in the meantime?  I do not know the answer.  This document states the subcontractor is entitled to be paid for the full value of work within 30 days but if it is for extra work that has not been accepted by the contracting party, where does the subcontractor stand? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#C00900","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":18,"content":"<p>It is useful to know that but very often, for example, with road projects, if there is a dispute it is pushed to the end.

There is quite a bit in it and we could take quite a bit of time to deal with it this morning.  We have a few other things we want to do.  We will ensure that we deal with it next week.  The one item I might refer to as we go along relates to other correspondence relating to that, but I will hold over the publication of that until the next meeting.<\/p> <p>  No. 2206B is again from Robert Watt, dated 4 June, providing a further update to information requested by the committee previously regarding the single public service pension scheme.  We will note and publish this.  When the new single public service pension scheme was introduced, the Department responsible for the public sector and which sponsored the legislation did not know what public bodies were going to be covered by this.  It took it several years after the passage of the legislation to work out which public bodies were included in this.  We had a detailed discussion on this and I believe we referred to it in a previous report or perhaps it was to be included in our next report.  We received a report in February 2019, when we were dealing with this, showing that the Department was still not quite sure about quite a number of bodies some three years after the passage of legislation.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Watt has given us an update now as to where the Department stands on this issue.  At this stage, there are four issues in respect of all the public bodies that the Department believes should be included in this.  One issue is that three organisations, namely, the Residential Tenancies Board, the Health Products Regulatory Authority and the National Standards Authority of Ireland, submitted cases to the Minster for Public Expenditure and Reform explaining the difficulties they would face in meeting the arrears.  When this legislation came in, which was effective from three years ago, those organisations which had not provided the employer contribution in respect of the public service pension scheme were going to be asked to pay the arrears for the three years that they did not cover.  These three organisations said that they would operate the scheme from now on but that they did not have the resources to pay the arrears.  The Minister has accepted the case.  Accordingly, a ministerial direction was given quite recently to the three bodies under the 2012 Act to enable the bodies to retain the moneys owed in respect of the single pension employer contributions for the prior years.<\/p><p>The three public service bodies have started to remit the single scheme employer contributions due from 1 January 2019 onwards.  Essentially, the argument was the funding provided by the Department to them did not allow them to cover for arrears in previous years.  It will not affect the employees' scheme when they come to retire.  It is a pity it came to this.<\/p><p> There is one other issue.  We also mentioned the Dental Council.  It has arrears of &euro;7,000.  That figure has now been agreed but has not yet been paid.  It is the only organisation that has not paid its arrears where the Department is insisting the arrears be paid.  The Department of Health, which was engaging with the Dental Council, has confirmed the Dental Council's agreement to remit the required contribution in the near term.  We take it this will be wrapped up and paid by the Dental Council.  At the end of the day, three organisations did not pay the arrears.  This was because the Department did not have its house in order when the Oireachtas passed the legislation and it took three years to get on top of the legislation the House had passed.  The lesson is that, in future, any Department asking the Oireachtas to pass legislation must have arrangements in place to implement the legislation on the due date.  We will note and publish this.  At least we have now concluded this matter.<\/p><p> No. 2222B is from Mr. Maurice Buckley of the Office of Public Works, providing information requested by the committee regarding the costs, oversight and procurement process of the Kevin Street Garda station project.  This matter arose at our recent meeting with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on 9 May 2019.  The OPW came back with a letter.  We will note and publish this.  It seems to have dealt with the issues with regard to control of the project.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#D02200","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":49,"content":"<p>With regard to Departments doing their budgets and having certainty, are timelines applied for the conclusion of this type of claim?

We received this a week ago but we are only having our meeting now.  It provides a response to matters raised.  Some of these issues may been mentioned at yesterday's meeting but I will highlight the points we raised.  We will note and publish this.  We asked for details on the procurement subcontract committee meetings in 2016 and confirmation that trilocation in terms of the maternity hospital is a key objective.  We also asked for a note on consultancy fees in 2018 to include the name of the PR company and the length and total cost of the contract.  Q4 Public Relations was appointed in April 2015 and the contract runs until March 2021.  In the years from 2015 to 2018, inclusive, it was paid &euro;1,003,593 plus VAT.  That might have been mentioned yesterday at another meeting.  There is also a note on the decision examined by the board as to whether it would lease or purchase various high-tech hospital equipment.  There is a case to be made for both choices.  In February 2019, the board recommended reverting to the traditional capital funding approach of purchasing it rather than leasing it for an extended period.  We can discuss the merits or otherwise of this.  I am sure the board has gone into it in ten times more detail than we could do here.  We will just have to accept that it made the best decision it could.<\/p> <p>  We also asked about the cost certainty.  We asked for a note on the design costs of the hospital, including details of the 95% cost certainty of the preliminary design and the difference in the final design costs.  We were told the design team gave 95% certainty.  The board confirms the main mechanical and electrical construction contracts were received in October 2017 and the adjusted tender was &euro;636 million.  In November, the adjusted contract sum was &euro;890 million, which was an increase of &euro;254 million or 40% of the adjusted tender amount.  We asked the board to talk to us about how it is dealing with the design team with regard to the certainty it gave, which clearly has not stood up.  This issue has not been addressed.  We have been given the figure but the hard question has been avoided.  We asked whether it was following the company.  Certainty of 95% was given but now it is being shown that it did not hold up.  I believe the letter states the board is dealing with it but we want a more comprehensive note on what that means at this stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#E00800","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":56,"content":"<p>These are all important matters but the issue came up at another meeting, presumably because of dual membership between this committee and other committees-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#E00900","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":57,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#E01000","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":58,"content":"<p>People probably had these documents.

It depends on the nature of the contract and the level of certainty and risk.  We have had road projects where parameters were set as regards design and the companies involved had to work within those.  Any risks within those parameters were the main contractor's problem.  This has shown up two possible alternatives.  I am more concerned about the second of those alternatives than I am about the first.  The first is that the contractor goes in low, knowing that it will be able to add extras.  That is the general presumption.  My concern is that the contractor in this instance has much of knowledge and experience of dealing with the public sector in Ireland and other countries.  It habitually gets the design wrong.  It covers precisely what it is asked to cover in the full knowledge that it has more experience than the people with whom it is dealing on behalf of the Irish public and that they will have to come back and correct their earlier mistakes and ask for work that they should have asked for upfront to be done.  The contractor is very good at spotting where it knows it is getting designs submitted for tender.<\/p> <p>  I will provide an example.  One guy in the industry told me that if one goes through some of these designs, one could find that a contractor designed a room without including a door.  The guy putting in the tender has spotted that knowing full well that those requesting the work will have to come back to him to put in the door and he will charge a hefty amount for doing so.  Much of this is down to the fact the design work done on behalf of the contracting body may not have been up to scratch at the beginning.

We asked for an information note for the cost that will be incurred by the State for not meeting the 2020 climate action targets and when such costs will be due.  When one reads the letter, one can see that the State response, our collective response at Oireachtas and Government level, is entirely hypocritical.  The letter indicates that the arrangement at European level requires member states to meet their targets using unused emissions credit from earlier years or through purchasing credits from other member states via international markets.  In simple English, if we do not meet our targets, we can buy our way out of the problem by purchasing unused emissions from somewhere else.  This is the biggest act of gross hypocrisy when it comes to the environment.  We are stating that if we do not meet our targets, we will buy unused emission credits from somebody else before the deadline and pay the price.  This means that when the 2020 deadline arrives, we will be below our target because we will have unused credits in the system.<\/p><p>The NTMA is the body that purchases these on behalf of the State.  An important point is that to date the NTMA has already spent &euro;86.8 million of Irish taxpayers' money purchasing these credits, which is horrific.  This is to avoid a fine.  I know some of them may have been released in the meantime.  We asked about the 2020 climate action targets.  The letter goes on to state the Department estimates the additional cost of the requirement to be in the region of between &euro;6 million and &euro;13 million between now and then if we do not meet the additional cost.<\/p><p> We also asked about renewable energy targets.  People will find this equally upsetting.  The letter states Ireland has a target of 16% of renewable energy by 2020 and that we have increased it by a lot since 2005 when we were just at 3%.  The letter states the Department expects Ireland to achieve something in the order of 13% by 2020.  The letter also states that some years ago the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland estimated we could buy our way out of the problem at a cost of anywhere between &euro;65 million and &euro;130 million, depending on the price range of the trade.  This was carried out before any market activity emerged in the public domain.  In 2017, trades between Luxembourg, Lithuania and Estonia suggested a cost in the order of &euro;22.5 million per percentage point below our 16% target.  If we are 3% below our target based on those prices it could cost us another &euro;60 million to buy our way out of pretending we are meeting environmental targets.<\/p><p> I want to put this on the public record.  I want everyone who has an interest in the environment to know that what we are doing in this country is a charade . We buy unused credits, targets and emissions from other countries just to balance our books and pretend we are coming in under target.  We are doing nothing of the sort.  We should not have to spend taxpayers' money to buy our way out of these problems.  We should do the right thing in the first place.  I want to put this on the record and I hope people with an interest in the environment will take up the issue.<\/p><p> There is more in the correspondence from the Department with regard to broadband and we will discuss it in private session.  When the Department with responsibility for communications came before the committee we asked for details on bidder membership of the Granahan McCourt bid.  We wanted details on it because it has changed.  In the correspondence, the Department tells us that in March 2016 there were five bidders and that was the position at the time.  There was a process for making changes to a bidder.  Approval was granted in September 2017 following assessment of a further change in the make-up of the bidder.  This resulted in changes.  A further change to the bidder membership was approved in September 2018 and following approval the bidder membership is now set out as Granahan McCourt Dublin Ireland Limited, with reliance on the resources of McCourt Global LLC and Tetrad Corporation, as lead bidder and provider of equity; Enet as key subcontractor and not an equity holder; Kelly Group, with reliance on resources of Kelly Communications Group Limited and Kelly Integrated Limited, as a key subcontractor with nothing to do with the ownership; and Actavo Ireland Limited and KN Networks as key subcontractors.  The fact they are subcontractors is not the issue.  We are talking about ownership of the group, which has changed at least three times.<\/p><p> The final tender submitted by Granahan McCourt reflects the bidder membership as approved in September 2018.  We would like to know the current status of all of the companies involved and that have been in and out of the process since 2016.  They may have fallen out but are they still trading?  Did they ever trade?  What is their status and the link between them and the new companies?  The committee will not get to the bottom of it now because it is a bigger issue than what we will be able to conclude looking backwards.  They are all events that happened during years when accounts were audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It is an issue we will highlight.  It is a matter of great concern.  I acknowledge Mr. Mark Griffin for being upfront and forthright with information when we ask a question.  I must accept that.  We will note and publish it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#F01900","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":94,"content":"<p>It is really important that we know who this entity is and its ability to fund and deliver a project.  Knowing who the entity is will tell us this.  If a firm goes in for a tender to build schools it has to say what its turnover was in the past three years and what its form is.  This seems to be absent.  It is critical that we know who the bidders are.  The inclusion of subcontractors is a real curve ball.  Are they beneficial interests?  Can those subcontractors change?  Why are they even included if that is at the case except to say the firm cannot deliver it itself but these people might be able to do it.  This really exposes a huge flaw in the prospect of delivering and the longevity of the entity here.

We have previously received inquiries from the same correspondent on this matter and forwarded a response from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine which provided a background to the foal levy.  The Department advised that Horse Racing Ireland administers the levy and it is not practical to base the levy on the actual amount paid by the breeder for the nomination due to the variety of deals and shares available in the industry.  That is what the Department states; we do not necessarily endorse it.  It is just what it says.  Just because we repeat what it states does not mean we agree with it.  We are just acknowledging that is what it states.  I propose to advise the correspondent that the committee will not be taking the matter any further because ultimately it is a policy matter for the Department if it wants to change how the scheme is managed.  That is a policy decision for the Minister and it is not for the committee.  We will note it and inform the correspondent accordingly.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  No. 2194C, from an individual, is dated 27 May and people will be interested in it.  It requests an explanation for payments to Deputies for sitting on committees.  We are well used to people making allegations against Deputies.  Some of them are based on false information and some are just done for the sake of doing it.  The correspondent asked for someone to explain whether Deputies who already receive a salary for being a politician are paid extra for sitting on a committee.  The answer is \"No\".  Members sit here as part of their work in the Oireachtas.  The correspondent wants to know whether there is extra money for sitting on a committee and, if so, this individual wants the job.  For the record, and this is important, there is an allowance for chairpersons of Oireachtas committees only but not other members.  I propose we refer the correspondence to the Oireachtas website, where there is detailed information on Oireachtas salaries and allowances for specified positions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#G00700","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":100,"content":"<p>The Houses of the Oireachtas Commission is the one exception.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#G00800","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":101,"content":"<p>Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#G00900","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":102,"content":"<p>They get paid.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#G01000","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":103,"content":"<p>All members?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#G01100","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":104,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#G01200","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":105,"content":"<p>That is correct.

The individual believes that legislation is being breached.  Basically, there is legislation on the operation of the various schemes operated by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and by the appeals office.  Not everything is covered in the legislation.  Obviously, they have their own procedures to deal with similar-type cases.  The correspondent wants to know if there is any legislative provision for this and he is saying it is illegal that they have procedures in place that are secret and that are not covered in legislation.  If somebody thinks it is illegal, he or she can take it up legally but it is not a matter for the Committee of Public Accounts.  We will note the item.  Is that agreed?

I must be upfront on this one, without revealing the person's name.  This is a company which has a commercial interest in tendering for all these projects and which did not get any of the jobs and is dissatisfied with how the OPW has done it.  It is an issue between himself and the relevant body which we are not getting into.  The anti-ligature issue he raises is that the window, the window frames and the window openers are not designed in such a way that somebody could try to hang himself or herself in a Garda station and that the glass in the windows should be free from anything that could assist that process.  This is a company that is involved in the industry.  It is not our business.

We will now deal with statements and accounts received since the last meeting.  There are five statements and accounts for review, as listed on members' screens.  The first is the Public Trustee Account which administers 148 trusts related to activities of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine, including former Land Commission Trust balances.  The trustee account balances and there is only a small turnover.  The trust has received a clear audit opinion.<\/p> <p>  Next is the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland which has been given a clear audit opinion.<\/p> <p>  The Health Information and Quality Authority has received a qualified audit opinion to the effect that its statement gives a true and fair view, except that the authority accounts for the costs of retirement benefits entitlements only when they become payable, rather than when they are earned.  All health bodies in the State have received a direction from the Minister for Health to do it this way, which is out of sync with international accounting standards.  Historically, the Minister does not want these costs showing up as an annual cost; therefore, they are buried until people retire in 20, 30 or 40 years.  This is not in order with international accounting standards, but all Ministers have done it, not just the Minister.  It was a regular feature of past practice.  We will note that the Health Information and Quality Authority is not accounting for pensions, as is usually the case for other organisations.<\/p> <p>  Next is the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, which is given a clear audit opinion.  However, attention is drawn to the payment by the agency of &euro;1.9 million to the Revenue Commissioners in November 2018 in respect of an underpayment of VAT on certain services received from abroad.  The payment included &euro;600,000 in interest and penalties.  The amount of VAT involved was &euro;1.3 million, with the interest and penalties of &euro;600,000 bringing the total owed to &euro;1.9 million.  It is noted that there was a lapse in internal control in 2017 which resulted in non-compliant procurement in respect of four services contracts not being notified to NAMA's audit committee or other auditors and not being disclosed in its financial statements.  The related non-compliant expenditure total was &euro;4.35 million in 2017 and 2018.

I am holding over the noting of the National Asset Management Agency 2018 accounts.  We are not noting them today; we are holding over noting and discussing them until next week.<\/p> <p>  The next item is the Health Service Executive accounts.  They received a clear audit opinion, but attention is drawn to the fact that, on the direction of the Minister, the HSE has not recognised in the financial statements the liability, estimated at &euro;198 million, arising from a legal settlement with medical consultants which was agreed and adjudicated on by the High Court in June 2018.  There is also recurrent non-compliant procurement by the HSE, including 30% by value of a sample of payments, totalling &euro;66 million, examined in the course of the audit.   Representatives of the HSE are scheduled to appear before the committee, but I wish to raise certain issues with the accounts.  I want people to listen because the financing of the HSE is an important issue in the public arena.<\/p> <p>  These are the financial statements that were signed off on by the chairperson and chief financial officer on Monday, 13 May 2019.  The Comptroller and Auditor General completed his report on that day.  On the Friday before, there was a development that I, or any member of a Committee of Public Accounts, would find unacceptable.  It involves what the Minister or the Department on his instructions did before the board signed off on its accounts.  The net operating deficit shown in the financial statements is &euro;85.174 million for last year.  That is the audited figure.  However, it masks an issue referred to by the Comptroller and Auditor General, namely, that a High Court settlement on consultants' pay was adjudicated on in mid-June 2018.  In the normal course, the accounts should include a provision for that liability of &euro;198 million in the financial statements.  That would be the case for every organisation which produces accounts to international financial standards.  On the Friday before the accounts were signed off on, the Department, on the instructions of the Minister, issued a direction to the HSE not to include that liability.  However, it is a liability for the HSE.  Had the Minister not interfered with the final preparation of the accounts on the weekend before they were signed off on and audited, the deficit for the HSE last year would have been noted as being &euro;283 million.  This gross interference by the Minister or the Department is an attempt to massage the figures, fool the people and present unacceptable figures to the Committee of Public Accounts.  On the weekend the accounts were being finalised, the Department issued a letter to state the settlement of &euro;198 million was outstanding and the HSE was formally directed to exclude it from the financial statements.  That is outrageous.<\/p> <p>  When I referred to the Minister, I meant the Department.  We know that the Minister is the political head of the Department, but the committee deals with the Accounting Officer.  We will write to the Accounting Officer to seek a detailed explanation of the rationale for a direction issued to the HSE to exclude the liability of &euro;198 million from its annual audited financial statements.  If it had not been issued, the HSE accounts being presented today would show a deficit of &euro;283 million, but it produced accounts which showed a deficit of &euro;85 million.  I have made my point.  I want people to listen to what is going on.  Accounting Officers need to control expenditure, but presenting accounts that do not present a true and fair view in accordance with international accounting standards is not acceptable to the committee.  We may end up rejecting the accounts.  It is probably a new issue of which people are not aware.  It has only come to light because we are looking at it today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#K00800","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":165,"content":"<p>I agree completely with the observations of the Chairman.

The committee has been quite good on the issue of the late presentation of accounts and organisations have stepped up their game in that respect.  However, non-compliant procurement has been an issued since I joined the committee.  Members have raised it repeatedly, but there seems to be no sanction, other than it appearing as a footnote in the audit opinion.  At what point do we say that is not good enough?  Our periodic report must deal strongly with this issue.  We previously considered dealing with it as a single issue.  I do not know whether the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform or another Department sets the guidelines for procurement.  How is it that 30% of the sample came back as non-compliant?  That is an extremely high figure, considering the amount of money the HSE spends on procurement.

The references is No. 1386 B and would have been raised at the meeting on 21 June 2018.

If it was a legal opinion, would he be prepared to give us a copy of that legal opinion?  It does not sit with my understanding of protected disclosures.

In my opening statement I will give a brief overview of the main features of the Vote.  I hope the more detailed briefing material supplied in advance of the meeting was of assistance to the committee in providing a fuller picture of the work of the Department and its expenditure.<br\/><br\/>The total gross provision for the Vote in 2017 was &euro;1.311 billion, representing an increase of &euro;173 million, or 15%, on the provision for the previous year.  Nearly all of the Department&rsquo;s expenditure is related to current funding for programmes and services.  Capital funding makes up just under 2% of the total Vote.  <br\/><br\/>Our central mission as a Department is to work to achieve better outcomes and brighter futures for all children and young people in Ireland.  Among our key objectives are to ensure an effective child welfare and protection system; a high quality childcare system that is affordable and accessible; and an evidence-based approach to policy that helps children and young people to participate in decisions that affect their lives.  We support both preventive and early intervention services, as well as direct involvement in the lives of children, young people and families, where necessary.  We aim to collaborate with Departments, agencies and sectors to place children and young people at the heart of what we do.  We place great emphasis on consulting widely and using available evidence to inform the development of policy.  This involves the participation and collaboration of children, young people and other stakeholders.  We also stress value for money and evaluation from the early stages in planning projects.  Increasingly, our work involves dealing with significant legacy issues spanning many decades, while also trying to strengthen services for the children of today and planning the services of the future.  <br\/><br\/>In terms of the overall composition of the Vote, 54% of gross expenditure in 2017 was allocated to the work and services of Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, while 35% was accounted for by childcare supports, which we now describe as early learning and care, and school age childcare.  The remaining 11% of the Vote encompassed a variety of other programmes, including three other agencies - the Adoption Authority of Ireland, Oberstown Children Detention Campus and the Office of the Ombudsman for Children.  The Vote also includes the funding for the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes.  <br\/><br\/>The Department has had an extensive agenda of work.  In 2017 the major actions included commencing mandatory reporting as a legal requirement under the Children First Act 2015; implementing significant improvements to childcare supports in advance of the statutory national childcare scheme, which is due to commence later this year; ending the detention of children in adult prisons; commencing the Adoption (Amendment) Act 2017, which gave effect to the constitutional amendment on children's rights; publishing legislative proposals for the reform of the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>system, the Bill for which will be published soon; introducing a new bail supervision scheme, which has helped to reduce the number of children being detained; and working closely with Tusla on a range of child protection and welfare measures.  <br\/><br\/>We continued this work into 2018 and up to the present day.  Among the major actions are building on our work with Tusla on child welfare and protection measures, including a co-ordinated response to the special HIQA report commissioned by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and supporting the full roll-out of the national childcare information system; working closely with other Departments on child protection issues, particularly on policy and operations involving An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla; sponsoring the passage of the Childcare Support Act 2018 and continuing a major programme of work for the forthcoming national childcare scheme; continuing implementation of the access and inclusion model to help children with special needs to take part in the ECCE programme; increasing the ECCE scheme to two years, doubling the number of children accessing subsidies and doubling the number of childcare places across all age ranges; publishing a major strategy for early childhood entitled, First 5 - a Whole of Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families; publishing the first ever LGBTI+ youth strategy; completing the transition of the ABC programme to Tusla's prevention, partnership and family support services; developing a programme of action to deal sensitively with the burial of human remains at the site of the former mother and baby home in Tuam; working to deal with the emergence of evidence of illegal registration of births; and continuing a programme for streamlining the system of funding for youth services.<\/p><p>These actions are just part of the major programme of work that the Department engaged in during 2017 and since then.<\/p><p> We are very aware that we face a number of serious challenges which we have been working to address in conjunction with relevant agencies.  In the case of Tusla we are engaging closely on issues such as recruitment of sufficient social workers and addressing unallocated cases.  We have also had a close involvement in the expert advisory group to support implementation of recent recommendations of the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA.  We have been working intensively with Pobal on a major reform of governance and compliance procedures to ensure that childcare schemes meet today's requirements.  This is part of the major task of making early learning and care and school age childcare services affordable, accessible and of high quality.  The Department continues to work on a number of other important issues including reform of our youth funding schemes, which is under way.  We are in the process of replacing the current targeted schemes, which are the product of many years' history, with a single scheme aimed at best meeting the needs of disadvantaged and vulnerable young people.<\/p><p> I believe that the Department of Children and Youth Affairs has made a positive impact since its establishment in 2011, particularly in the areas of child welfare and protection, affordable and quality child care supports and collaboration across sectors to advance the well-being of children and young people, but of course much more remains to be done.  My colleagues and I will be happy to answer the committee's questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#R00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Fergal Lynch","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":252,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Lynch for his opening statement.

I welcome him and his team.  As attested by the opening statement, the Department has a huge scope, with many areas that could be examined.  I will keep my focus tight this morning.  Primarily, I wish to focus on the fact that the Department of Children and Youth Affairs advances a huge amount of money to an organisation called Pobal to administer its early years childcare programme; some &euro;500 million in fact.  Around a decade ago I remember the journalist Mr. Kevin Myers writing an opinion piece in <i>The Irish Independent<\/i>in which he tried to dig down into the world of quangos in this country.  The one that confused him the most was Pobal.  I will never forget his opening paragraph.  A journalist's opening paragraph should always capture the imagination and attention of the reader.  He asked the readers of <i>The Irish Independent<\/i>if they had ever heard of Pobal.  He followed up by saying that they probably had not, but they should have because the organisation had a very significant budget.  He then asked what exactly it did.  Perhaps the only person reading back then who would have known the answer was the Comptroller and Auditor General.<\/p><p>Prior to coming here this morning I have been contacted by many community childcare providers.  They know what Pobal is.  Following the so-called forensic audit, these hard-pressed childcare providers are being told by the watchdog that they owe money due to supposedly having received overpayments.  I would like to have something explained to me.  Why did the watchdog, that is, Pobal, which is in receipt of &euro;500 million of taxpayers' money, only really start to do these so-called forensic audits of community childcare services in the last year of the programme?  The programme has been in existence since 2008.  What monitoring practices have actually existed for the last decade?  Second, what is the estimated total loss to the Exchequer in the last decade as a result of this lack of adequate checks on payments by Pobal?  What is the process for recoupment? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#S00300","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560412800,"counter":254,"content":"<p>First, I will add some context.  Pobal is a registered charity and operates under the aegis of the Department of Community and Rural Development.  It organises a range of services.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs is Pobal's biggest customer, with &euro;500 million of childcare funding routed through it as the Deputy noted.  Pobal organises all of the schemes for us and it also carries out compliance work.  It has done compliance visits for many years.  The Deputy referred to 2008.  The compliance components Pobal was looking at in the early years concerned ensuring that parents were getting a service, the money from the public purse was being allocated to them and fees were not being raised.<\/p> <p>  Expenditure on childcare schemes has increased very significantly over the past several years.  Our concern has always been to ensure good value for money for the Exchequer.  However in the earlier years, up to 2015 or 2016, the money was granted on the basis of enrolments and registration.  Once enrolments and registration were demonstrated, that was it.  In later years the rules changed to be based on attendances.  Therefore in more recent years Pobal has rightly been asking questions about the actual attendance numbers of children at these centres as opposed to enrolments and registrations.  <\/p> <p>  With respect, I do not agree that Pobal has only started forensic audits in the last year.  We have certainly asked Pobal to engage in a good deal of work in this space during the last several years, and it has done so.  Pobal has identified excessive claims or overpayments in various years.  However, because the rules of the scheme changed in the last few years to become much more specifically focused on attendance requirements, it is only in the last two years that we have been able to either recover money where it has been overpaid or make sure it is not paid in the first place.  This has been made clear to the agencies involved.  The role of Pobal has changed somewhat over the years.  I can say more abut it if the committee wishes, but-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#S00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Fergal Lynch"},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":255,"content":"<p>I asked specifically what has been lost to the Exchequer.  I will come back to what Dr. Lynch has said.  I appreciate his answer.  Pobal has been asleep at the wheel.  Dr. Lynch referred to what was done in previous years.  Many different types of checks were going on.  There were checks on headcounts, audits and checks on childcare.  Meanwhile there were different checks on social economy and never the twain did meet.  That was part of the problem.  What does Dr. Lynch think has been lost to the Exchequer during the past decade?  I contend that Pobal was asleep at the wheel.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#S00500","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560412800,"counter":256,"content":"<p>We must base any amount potentially lost to the Exchequer on the rules.  The rules of the scheme were based on registrations and enrolments in earlier years.  This is an important point.  When we started examining whether there a case for recouping money, as recently as 2015 and 2016, we got legal advice on several cases.  The advice was that there was no such case because the rules were not sufficiently clear on attendance requirements.  These payments could not be recouped.  I can give the Deputy very specific figures on what Pobal has sought to recoup over the last few years.  In 2017 and 2018 Pobal's compliance visits produced an estimate of approximately &euro;937,000.  There are caveats here because of the type of data involved.  In the current year, 2018 and 2019, Pobal has identified potential excess claims of &euro;4.7 million.  I stress the word \"potential\".<\/p><p>In each of these cases, the money is not lost to the Exchequer.  It is either recouped through subsequent reductions or required to be submitted before the over-claim payment is made.  In some instances, providers were entitled to claim under a different scheme, that is, the community childcare subvention private, CCSP, scheme as opposed to the community childcare subvention, CCS, scheme, so it would not be payable.  The amounts identified in more recent years were recoupable or were not overpaid in the first instance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#S00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Fergal Lynch","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":258,"content":"<p>I know that but what is annoying some people in the community sector is that they are being penalised because of the practices that were allowed to happen.

Pobal is very careful not to grab the money from them and it has a very good case management and sustainability system.

We have been building ECCE to a second year and we have introduced a new access and inclusion model, AIM.  We tried to increase the uptake of some of the targeted schemes and, while we were unsuccessful at first, we were ultimately successful.  The result was that, at the beginning of 2017, we made provision for what we believed would be the requirement for that year.  In the event, ECCE funding was not required to the extent we had envisaged.

We paid &euro;19.4 million in the current year to assist providers because, as they will always say, this is not an area in which it is easy to cover costs and make any sort of return.  The Minister has said a couple of times that she would support a sectoral employment order which the providers could organise.  I understand that a number of the workforce are organising in that direction.

I am not saying for a moment that there is a quick fix for this or that we can do something overnight.

When we had the Department of Health here, I asked about a matter, and I want to ask the Department of Children and Youth Affairs too since it is also a part of this.

There was a delay in the Department of Children and Youth Affairs occupying the premises, with an extension to the lease at Mespil Road that cost &euro;1.5 million instead of moving to Miesian Plaza.  The move was delayed, as noted in the report, because the move of assistant principal officers to the pod-style system was deemed a significant cultural change.  I asked the Department of Health that question and want to ask Dr. Lynch too.

Some 85% of the 400 services that have registered already reach that requirement.  In other words, while people said that we would never be able to afford it or achieve this, 85% of the school-age childcare services are already meeting that.  The other 15% do not.  I have some questions in my mind about claims that this will substantially increase their cost, which I will put to them.  The Deputy quite rightly referred to pay for workers in the sector being at an average of &euro;11.93 an hour.  If one requires one member of staff per 12 children, even if the charge per hour is &euro;5, that would be &euro;60 compared to a &euro;12 cost for employment.

In recent years, for the moment at least, we have decided that the best way to do so is through Pobal, which provides a good service.  We have a strong governance arrangement with it.  In the context of administration costs relative to others, we have looked into the matter and are clear that the administration costs are good.  Pobal is a non-profit organisation.  We believe the administrative costs that it incurs are reasonable.  Obviously, we push very strongly each year in terms of the amount of money we would pay the organisation to operate the schemes for us.<\/p> <p>  We are planning, in the next year or less, to have a major review and analysis of our schemes and how we run and deliver the early-years schemes.

For example, should the work be done by another State agency?  Should it all be run by Tusla?  Should there be a separate entity altogether?  Should the work be taken into the Department, and so on?

I again agree with him that it is an area where Departments fall into difficulty.  One of our internal audit reports, which is a good and valuable report for us, gave us a limited assurance rather than a reasonable assurance, which is the full extent, and that was last June.  The criticisms were entirely valid and they were related to failing in certain circumstances to ensure that our contracts were on file or, in some of the earlier cases, and I stress that they were earlier, failing to have clear end dates or start dates.  We now have a procurement unit to attend to all of this.  We established a specific procurement unit within the Department, which has a centralised contract register that keeps all the supporting documentation and advises all of the units around the Department on procurement issues.  I expect that the chances of fairly basic and small errors, which should not happen, happening now are greatly reduced since the establishment of a small but focused procurement unit within the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#W01900","nonspeaker":"Dr. Fergal Lynch"},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":316,"content":"<p>I am pleased to hear that.

It issue an issue and I am wondering about the shortfall in the registration of children in a variety of schemes.  Did the Department improve this process following the audit?

It goes back to the factors leading to the underspend in 2017.  There was a lower uptake than we projected for both CCS and CETS.  One of the major reasons for that was practical.  The subsidies we were paying at the time were relatively low, relative to the cost of childcare.  For example, we were paying up to a maximum of &euro;95 for one of the payments.  We increased that to &euro;145 for 2018 because we recognised the gap was not bridgeable.  Similarly, we had a rate of &euro;50 that we increased to &euro;95.  We recognised that the difficulty was a trap whereby the subsidy that we were pitching was not sufficient to provide support for people seeking to use the scheme.  We addressed that and, by 2018, coverage had increased significantly and we were at the level that we predicted.  If my memory serves me, in a relatively short number of years we have gone from approximately 25,000 to approximately 60,000 people being covered by those schemes.  I would need to check the exact figures but it is of that order of magnitude.<\/p> <p>  We got there by 2018 but I fully accept that in 2017, we did not, and that was primarily for the reason I have described.

Everything the Department can do to support the sector is being done.

We have introduced what is called an area profile, needs assessment and service requirement tool, which is a bit of a mouthful.

They identify where services are falling short, where services are reasonably well provided and where the actual needs are.

The rules, as set out by Dr. Lynch's Department and transferred to Pobal, allowed for this to happen.  The Department changed the rules two years ago and the role of Pobal changed.  Reference was made to the recouping of &euro;937,000 in the year 2017-2018 and &euro;4.7 million in the year 2018-2019, which, nicely, is five times the amount from the previous year and seems to be a worrying trajectory in fairness but maybe it is not going to continue to &euro;25 million next year.  Hopefully, we are not going there.  Dr. Lynch has just said the incidence of fraud was very low, but low in what terms?  A sum of &euro;4.7 million is not low.  The Department has been able to recoup &euro;4.7 million from over-claims since the rules were changed.  Will Dr. Lynch explain how that figure has increased by five in a 12 month period?  Has the Department just become better at catching people or at claiming back?  Who is guilty?  Was everybody at it?  Was it the case that large providers copped on to the lack of governance and the availability of money?  Was it the CCS groups?  Who was doing it without knowing?  It is my view that small childcare providers would have known that if they did not have the child in front of them they could not get the payment for the child.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#Z02200","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560412800,"counter":403,"content":"<p>There are a couple of points there and I shall clarify some things.

Where a provider has made an overclaim, we give it the opportunity to dispute that and then we start to introduce penalties.  Currently, the penalty is that in year 2, if we find non-compliance on a second visit, we can withdraw its programme support payment or refuse to offer it to the provider.  That is the payment that amounts to &euro;19.4 million annually.  It is built into the compliance framework, contracts, etc. that we can refuse the provider access to that payment.  That is a lot of money for small services.  We can also refuse capital.  We have fairly good capital available annually, and not being able to access that is certainly a sanction.  The biggest sanction is that we are recouping it.  If a provider has overclaimed, we go in and change the PIP registration so that if the provider is expecting to receive a couple of thousand euro the following week, it will not receive that due to having overclaimed.

The person who looks after one's children is the most important person in the child's life after oneself.  Perhaps one's husband might be ahead, but the childcare provider is second after him.  It is because it is a caring, feminised profession that the pay is so low.  The Secretary General expressed his sympathy for the workers' situation, acknowledged their low pay and indicated his high regard for them.  However, sympathy, acknowledgement and high regard do not pay bills.  It is a matter of great concern that the pay for the mostly female workers in this sector is so low.  The Department has a role in regard to pay in the context of the focus on quality.  If staff are not adequately paid, we will not attract quality people and, as a consequence, children will suffer.  Although the Department does not actually employ the staff, it does have a function in this regard.  People are being paid &euro;11.93 per hour.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#BB00200","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":457,"content":"<p>I apologise for interrupting the Deputy but I must suspend the meeting at this point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#BB00300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":458,"content":"<p>Thank you, Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#BB00400","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":459,"content":"<p>To allow members time to attend votes in the Chamber and have lunch, I propose that we resume at 2.30 p.m.  I do not expect the meeting to continue for too long in the afternoon, but I will accommodate the members who are still waiting to speak.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#BB00500","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1560412800,"counter":460,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 1.25 p.m. and resumed at 2.35 p.m. in private session.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":461,"content":"<p>I welcome Dr. Lynch and his team.

People come into a very high-need area, become quite skilled and then move on to another area.  There are a number of pieces.  There are about 215 social workers trained in the universities every year.  We have recruited around 150 so we are getting a very high percentage of that new intake.  However, we are in competition with the HSE and the voluntary agencies.  The HSE is in a continual space for staff in disability services, elderly services and hospitals.  They have quite a high need as well.  Since our staff have come through the child protection and welfare side, they are seen as quite experienced and it is a fast upskilling so they are in demand in other areas.  A lot of young graduates also travel after a number of years.  We have discovered that staff will work for a period of up to two years and then leave because they can draw their contributions back down at that stage.  It is like a ready-made savings scheme.

Since it is a new agency and we have recruited quite a number of people, we have between 150 and 175 people on maternity leave at any point in time.  That creates the other demand.  They are not leavers but vacancies are created in the system for up to a year.  That is a constant churn.  We have developed a workforce strategy which includes the recruitment campaign and getting much more vocal about how a career in child protection and welfare is quite rewarding.  Despite the bad press that our business inevitably gets when something goes wrong, and that is quite serious, the overwhelming story from social workers is that it is a very rewarding workplace and a very rewarding career.  I see all the time that the effort and enthusiasm people put in goes way beyond what one would expect in a public sector organisation.  That has to be acknowledged in respect of staff who work in very difficult circumstances in some cases.<\/p> <p>  We have introduced a lot of change.  We have talked about this before in terms of services.  We have been training and developing people on a piece called Signs of Safety, a very good system that is trying to establish links for the child who is at risk with their family and local area.  It aims to maintain kids in their own environment, protect them, work with them and their family but also to draw others into that network so that the child is protected and remains in a family environment.  Social workers have made very strong statements about the usefulness of that and we have developed it around the country.  Those kind of initiatives are about changing the culture and the way we do business.  That has had an impact in terms of social workers looking at the business and saying it is a better way to do things.<\/p> <p>  We have a lot of initiatives looking at why people leave the organisation, better ways of recruiting and retaining staff.  It is not a secret that we have some areas that are very difficult to work in.  They are the areas where we struggle to retain and get people into.  Sometimes it is a circle that reinforces the vacancy problem, in that young newer graduates end up in those areas.  Their managers can often be relatively inexperienced so there is quite a high need to support them.  That is a challenge because it is probably the last place where new graduates should be.  We have tried to address how we support them, and how we can better train them and find better ways.  It has been a challenge in the public sector.  The rules around recruitment are there for very good reasons but we find it difficult sometimes to get the right people to the right place as quickly as we need to within the rules.  We have had to look at ways of trying to create pools of staff that we can use when we run into problems with staffing in particular areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#NN02100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Smyth"},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":545,"content":"<p>That information on the staff is very useful to have put on the record.

When Tusla was established, we were faced with a double challenge, one aspect of which was the availability of resources.  There was no policy in place at that time to ensure that those kids stayed with the families as much as possible, so kids got moved around.  Kids may still be moved around today, possibly because they have not settled in a particular placement or because there is some other issue.  Kids may be moved around in such circumstances, but in as far as it is possible, and this is something on which we are strong, we ensure that kids stay in their placements.  In the regions of north-east Dublin and Dublin-mid-Leinster there are approximately 250 instances of kids who are in foster care under private arrangements.  By and large, those kids remain in those foster care arrangements.  There is difficulty in finding local foster carers for them.  Once a child moves into private foster care, it is challenging to move him or her, purely because of attachments.  If the family support is good, the money aspect is seen as less important as the aspect of care for the child.  Ultimately, the objective is to ensure that the kids have a stable childhood that is as good as possible so that they become adults who can look after themselves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#OO00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Smyth"},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":558,"content":"<p>With regard to the 600 who are in other care rather than the regular fostering system, are addiction issues encountered?

Some calls are light while some are more serious.  In the early stages Tusla relies on the HSE computer system.  Does Tusla have a system of its own?

Referrals come from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, teachers, or medical professionals.  The volume was approximately 44,000 at that stage.  When we kicked off we had just under 10,000 unallocated cases, which means cases which are waiting to be allocated to a social worker.  Last year we had 57,000 referrals, which represents an increase of approximately 40% on that volume.  There are good reasons behind that.  The number of unallocated cases is down to 6,000.  That number is higher than we want it to be.  These cases are concentrated around five of our service areas.  We have 17 service areas throughout the country.  The unallocated cases are, in the main, in those five areas.  We have gone through the first reason that the number of unallocated cases is high, which relates to staffing.  We have also been doing a lot of work on our understanding.  When Tusla was created we had 17 separate areas.  We have a history going back to the days of the health boards, which is not that long ago.  It was 2005.  The systems remained independent of each other at that time.  We did not have the same way of dealing with referrals in each of those 17 areas.  The feature about which I talked earlier, the signs of safety model, is about ensuring that the same model of care and way of dealing with these cases is used across all areas.<\/p> <p>  Initial referrals into the system are normally triaged immediately and risk assessments are carried out.  HIQA has consistently found that, even in circumstances in which the number of unallocated cases is very high, Tusla does not leave kids at risk.  That initial process, within the first 24 hours, is about seeing whether the referral is high risk and whether the kid needs to be seen.  We then go into a process of initial assessment and then allocation.  Depending on the complexity of the case, the initial assessment can take a bit of time.<\/p> <p>  We are quite engaged in the analysis of the actual assessment and working with the people who refer children to us at the moment.  We get a lot of referrals from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We have been trying to work with An Garda, as well as with teachers, schools and others, to put in place systems which will give us a lot more information about the referral.  In light of the massive increase in referrals, we are trying to ensure that we get information that makes sense and on which we can make good assessments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#OO00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Smyth"},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":564,"content":"<p>For clarity, does mandatory reporting now exist?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#OO00900","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560412800,"counter":565,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#OO01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Smyth"},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":566,"content":"<p>If a schoolteacher or nurse sees an issue, he or she must report it.

Let us say a foster child in the care setting does something inappropriate to a younger family member and Tusla is phoned.

Is that the case?  When Tusla arrives, I am sure the thinking of the social worker on the ground is that Tusla has a child in foster care and that child is the organisation's priority.

The committee's investigation has particular interest in the following three themes - the roll-out time; value for money, including the cost benefit analysis; and ownership; and for today, we will be providing input on the CBA element of the second theme only, given our limited scope.<\/p> <p>  I will start with a brief introduction.  I am a partner in the PwC advisory practice, leading the technology, information, communication and entertainment practice.  I have more than 25 years experience, having spent 15 years of that time working as a senior executive in both the telecommunications and technology sectors prior to joining PwC in 2012.  I am the lead partner on the CBA advice provided by PwC on the NBP.  I am joined by my colleagues, Ms Fiona Smith, a director in our corporate finance practice and by Dr. Luke Redmond, an economist in our consulting team.  Together, we have extensive experience of delivering similar services across the public and private sector. <\/p> <p>  PwC was appointed in January 2015, following a competitive tendering process, as strategic advisers on the NBP, including assisting with the CBA as set out below.  We were commissioned to complete a CBA on behalf of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment.  The objective of the CBA is to assess the extent to which a State intervention to support the attainment of the primary NBP objective of universal next generation access will yield a positive return to Irish society.  The CBA was prepared as part of a wider-NBP project, which included a technical, design and planning work-stream - Analysys Mason-led; a financial appraisal and procurement work-stream - KPMG-led - including value for money, ownership and cost model; and an NBP strategy work-stream - PwC-led - which includes the CBA.  The team described above led the CBA, which falls within the scope of this committee session today.  Separate aspects of our work were performed by international experts from other PwC offices, with the UK firm of PwC responsible for the strategic advice and PwC Netherlands responsible for state aid advice.<\/p> <p>  Under the CBA, all public projects over &euro;20 million are required to complete a CBA in accordance with the public spending code.  Our work on the CBA was completed over a four-year period with numerous iterations with the final CBA published in May 2019. <\/p> <p>  The technical option as advised to us by the technical project advisers, Analysys Mason, is for 100% fibre-to-the-premises.  They concluded that this technology was the optimal solution for the delivery of the NBP objective of universal next-generation access broadband in the intervention area.  Therefore, this technical option forms the basis of the CBA assessment.  However, the Department advised us that it reserved the option to change the technical solution on a case by case basis during deployment where it makes technical and commercial sense to do so during the build period. <\/p> <p>  KPMG was responsible for developing the cost model taking into consideration the final bidder costs and assumed take-up over the duration of the contract.  This cost forms the basis of the cost element of the CBA.  <\/p> <p>  Each of the work streams operated independently and no one team had visibility of the detailed calculations of each of the constituent parts.  At no point did any change to the costs influence the benefits case, as both were prepared on a standalone basis by different parties.  The basis of the benefits compilation remained consistent throughout an iterative process over the four-year period, but was updated for new data points including, for example, changes to demographics, reduction of households in the intervention area and change in economic parameters.<\/p> <p>  We adopted a conservative approach to the evaluation of benefits throughout.  Additional adjustments were agreed at formal review stage with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in response to debate on certain subjective matters.  As the public spending code is not exact and requires an element of judgment in its application, the debate related to certain assumptions which were based on domestic data and international research.  We evaluated the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's queries and adjusted the CBA consistent with our conservative approach to benefit evaluation and in light of expected updates on the public spending code.  Our CBA is, and always has been, positive relative to the costs and benefits at each iteration. <\/p> <p>  We ran three different scenarios in our CBA.  All scenarios resulted in a positive benefit to cost ratio, BCR, over the 25-year period with the central scenario resulting in a BCR of 1.3 to 1.  In accordance with the public spending code, the only benefits included in the CBA are those that have empirical evidence available to substantiate them.  The benefits we have qualified as part of the CBA work are classified into two categories: residential, which are &euro;2.2 billion in the central scenario; and enterprise, which are &euro;1.5 billion in the central scenario.  Residential benefits within the CBA analysis include bundled communications - realised savings available by purchasing communication bundles; service waiting - reduced time required for value-adding online activity to be completed; remote working - time and cost savings for white collar workers being able to work remotely; and transaction savings - time and cost savings from online shopping.  The CBA analysis identifies enterprise benefits totalling &euro;1.5 billion to farm and non-farm enterprises in the intervention area, non-intervention area enterprises, and from additional job creation or employment benefits for enterprises within the intervention area.<\/p><p>Given that it is not possible to quantify a significant number of the benefits of the national broadband plan owing to the lack of available empirical evidence, we were asked by the Department to perform a separate piece of work on the qualitative benefits.  It was completed in August 2018 and published by the Department in May 2019.  The objective of the report was to outline additional benefits deemed to be non-quantifiable that could complement the quantifiable benefits outlined in the cost-benefit analysis model.  Such benefits include e-health, e-education, social inclusion, rural development, tourism and climate change.  The approach and content of the report consist of desk-based research to support each of the qualitative benefits and interviews and case studies with individuals and businesses both inside and outside the intervention area.  <\/p><p> I thank the committee for giving me the opportunity to appear before it to make this statement.  We are happy to take questions that members may be related to the advice we provided on the cost-benefit analysis for the national broadband plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019061300002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Amy Ball","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560380400,"counter":982,"content":"<p>I have two brief questions for Ms Ball.

When we built the benefits, we assumed that certain data points were relevant.  The first was the number of households about which we were talking about.  It amounted to 387,000.  We are talking about 100,000 businesses, of which 56,000 are farms and 44,000 are non-farms, being smaller SMEs.  We are also talking about 147,000 white collar workers who live in the intervention area.<\/p> <p>  It is important to think about these numbers in the context of the benefits which I will outline.  As Ms Ball said, we quantified two benefits: residential and enterprise.  We looked first at residential benefits which we categorised in four key components, the first of which was remote working.  We quantified that the annual savings per household would be &euro;81; that would be the benefit of remote working.  There is a study that states approximately 4% of people work from home.  That is considered to be a conservative estimate in today's terms.  Recent studies from the Industrial Development Agency, IDA, state that figure is up at 10% and there is an even more recent study which suggests it should be 14%.  That is an example of what Ms Ball meant when she mentioned that we were being conservative.  Remote working is about the savings to be gained.  If I was travelling from Milltown, outside Ennis, to work in Limerick, it would be a round trip of approximately 80 kms.  The savings we have calculated in that particular instance are from the points of view of fuel consumption and the time spent travelling in a car. <\/p> <p>  The next component we have quantified is what we call reduced service waiting time.  We have calculated that the annual saving per household would be approximately &euro;500.  The services about which we are talking are e-government services, including applications for motor tax, driving licences, NCT tests, passport applications and even video conferences that could be undertaken instead of face to face meetings.  It is based on the average time an adult spends on the Internet weekly, for which we have assumed a figure of 8.7 hours.  We have assumed that 25% of that time is productive.  That is how we came up with the calculation of &euro;500 per household per annum.  <\/p> <p>  The next benefit is what we call bundled communication, which is easy enough to understand.  Many service providers offer a complete package that is quad play.  In other words, a customer buys one package covering his or her mobile phone, TV and broadband services.  There is obviously a discount in buying such a bundled package.  In this case, we came up with an annual household saving of approximately &euro;31.  Again, we have tried to be conservative with that figure.  We have only applied it to 19% of the people in the intervention area because we all know that everybody is slow to change and that there is inertia when it comes to these things.  People in the intervention area might not be paying for a TV service.<\/p> <p>  The final benefit in residential areas is transaction savings through online shopping.  We are assuming an annual saving of approximately &euro;120 per household.<\/p> <p>  I will move on to the enterprise benefits.  We looked first at farm enterprises.  We are looking at the improvement in gross value added by virtue of this benefit.  In the case of farm enterprises, we have assumed an amount of &euro;492.  As I said, we are talking about 56,000 farms in the intervention area.  We have been conservative because we have only applied the figure to 20% of farms in the intervention area because we realise the savings about which we are talking will require some investment and will only really apply to medium and large farms.  The savings about which we are talking relate to animal health in monitoring animals, calf mortality and online applications.  The online applications are for e-government purposes and the savings are those that would be expected if a farm enterprise had access to high-speed broadband.  Our benefits report refers to a raft of developments in farm technology and the ways in which a farm is run as a business.  They are in areas such as energy efficiency, crop management, data for soil fertility and the monitoring of health and welfare of animals.  We say it is at early development stage, but, more importantly, as far as farm enterprises are concerned, it is at early adoption stage.  Therefore, we have not included their benefits, but one would expect significant growth in that area in the next 25 years.<\/p> <p>  The next category is non-farm enterprises.  These are small and medium-sized businesses in the intervention area which employ fewer than 50 people.  We have calculated a benefit of approximately &euro;1,200 per enterprise in terms of improvement in gross value added per annum.  These are the savings one would expect to make.  By virtue of operating on a 24\/7 basis, a business has access to more customers and can increase its revenue.  Its costs are reduced because of a decrease in the cost of marketing, for example.  A company that might have engaged in mail drops can now do everything electronically.  There can be savings made in the area of IT through cloud computing.  We expect an improvement in gross value added of approximately &euro;1,200.<\/p> <p>  As I said, 147,000 white collar workers work outside the intervention area.  They are travelling, say, from Rathdowney to Naas.  There is obviously a benefit for the business in Naas where that employee can work remotely.  We have used the same 4% statistic for remote working for enterprises that we have used for residences and assumed, based on a significant number of studies, that productivity can be increased by approximately 35%.  That results in an improvement of just under &euro;1,100 in gross value added for those businesses.<\/p> <p>  The final category is employment.  We have assumed an uplift in gross value added for businesses of approximately 212.  As Ms Ball said, we only include a benefit if there is empirical evidence that we can justify and quantify.  Equally as important is that they all comply with the public spending code on what should and should not be included in a cost-benefit analysis of this nature.<\/p> <p>  I should make two final points.  We have applied a displacement factor in the enterprise benefits.  Effectively, it is another haircut to reduce the benefits in order to reflect the economic factors that might apply at the time.<\/p><p>We, again, have been conservative in our approach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019061300002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Smith","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560380400,"counter":986,"content":"<p>Did Ms Ball want to add something on the non-quantifiable benefits?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019061300002#E00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560380400,"counter":987,"content":"<p>Yes.  As Ms Smith and I mentioned in our opening statement, under the public spending code we cannot put a quantifiable benefit within the CBA in the absence of empirical evidence.  As such, we commissioned research, examined case studies, conducted interviews, and consulted with enterprise bodies to assess the opportunities for benefits beyond the scope of the quantitative benefits.  They cross a range of areas and sectors, so I will just go through them at a high level.  Members are free to interrupt if they need clarification on anything.<\/p> <p>  In terms of education, there is a significant benefit attached to all schools having reliable access to technology.  Some of the school staff we spoke to mentioned that most of their courses were coming through an online format and children were now expected to complete their homework online at home.  One of the problems they are having in rural areas is that they do not have consistent resilient broadband available to them at all times.<\/p> <p>  Regarding health, doctors would have the ability to monitor patients in remote areas and people would not have to travel to GPs or hospitals on every occasion.  This helps ensure older people can live at home for longer periods.  On social inclusion, interacting online with community forums, or being able to communicate with family members who are not local or may even be abroad via Skype or FaceTime, has fantastic benefits for mental health.  Keeping in contact with people solidifies that social inclusion.  We are seeing huge movements there in some proof of concepts, which I have no doubt will become more and more prevalent over the next 25 years and will have a major impact on peoples' mental health and well-being.<\/p> <p>  This is relevant for tourism, given that many of our prime tourist spots, such as the Wild Atlantic Way, are in remote areas of the country.  It is very important that businesses, start-up enterprises, hotels, and tourism bodies in those areas have access to broadband to maintain an online presence, promote the areas and activities that are available to tourists, and develop small businesses in each of those areas.  I spend quite a lot of time in County Mayo, and the local surf company says its broadband is always falling out and it has missed out on mass bookings because of that.  It would definitely value always-on broadband.<\/p> <p>  The environment is a very topical area, both for Ireland generally and globally.  We have looked at the reduced emissions related to reduced commuting times.  I spend a lot of time in Silicon Valley and I am amazed at the prevalence of driverless cars.  They are definitely coming our way, if not in the next year or two but certainly over the next five to 25 years.  We see always-on broadband as being a key enabler of online access for cars, smart motoring and smart trafficking.  It will encourage the use of electric vehicles and, therefore, reduced emissions.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the smart home experience.  I do not know if any member has Alexa - we do not - but the rise of the Internet of things is something we often talk about.  In the future, all of our home appliances will be connected to the Internet.  I have seen a fridge that will automate one's order if the milk is running out.  Not only that, but if we think about the broader context of smart metering or smart home monitoring for businesses and homes alike, broadband is a key enabler for those and they are just not possible in its absence.  Yet technology is moving at pace, and the pace of growth of data is incredible.  In a recent study of ours, which has not yet been published, we see an increase in data at 25% year on year over the next five years for Europe alone.  With that data comes a need for better transmission networks, faster speeds, and greater resiliency across networks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019061300002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Amy Ball"},{"type":"speech","time":1560380400,"counter":988,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses.

A cost benefit analysis is quite difficult to perform in respect of some issues because of the subjective nature of the benefits.  The costs are always clear but the benefits are somewhat subjective, notwithstanding the public spending quota.  This is an example in that we are looking at the potential for the future.  Sometimes it is difficult to apply a mathematical equation that covers the future potential and, therefore, this is probably not a great example of the best use of a CBA, regardless of the fact that it is required by the State.  Both the need and the potential are obvious, and trying to apply a mathematical equation to support that is not always easy when one is at the early stages of such future potential.  Notwithstanding that, a lot has been made of it.  Some of the documents that were released, particularly the one from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, noted that some benefits were identified at a later stage, and that corresponded with additional costs.  The witnesses will have read some of the comments so I will give them an opportunity to provide us with some more information on that.  Could they elaborate on that?<\/p> <p>  I want to move on from that to the issue of ownership and the gap funding model, which does not fall under the witnesses' areas of expertise, but PwC did a report at some point on the ownership model.  If the witnesses could answer the first question, we will then move on to the ownership issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019061300002#E00500","speaker":"1274"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560380400,"counter":990,"content":"<p>I will address the first question.  When we are looking at a CBA of this nature, in the context of a 25-year programme of spend and benefits, it certainly relies on detailed empirical evidence and strong assessments of any of the underlying economic assumptions that would drive benefit delivery.  With that in mind, and looking at the composition of the team, we have had very strong expertise across it, including on economics, corporate finance, accounting, and international expertise in thought leadership.  We have liaised extensively with the network and we have examined extensive literature and research.  Our methodology and process have been very robust.   There has also been robust governance of each component of the CBA.<\/p> <p>  The CBA is split into three parts: the costs model, which was tendered separately by a separate group of advisers who prepared the cost under strict protocols; the technical solution, which was also tendered under a separate tender and again prepared under strict protocols; and the benefits, which were done and delivered by us.  It is at the CBA point that each of those three constructs come together into one formula.  We are happy with our methodology as part of that.  However, when we examined the public spending code, PSC, some of the directions were not always clear or specific in the context of, for example, certain economic drivers.  In that case, we took our knowledge of international precedents and applied our assessment to domestic data.<\/p> <p>  As we were running through the CBA, which started back in 2015, we ran a collaborative process with the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, IGEES, which is the economic unit of Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  At that time, we underwent an extensive review of the CBA, which has not changed essentially in terms of its format or content.  There may have been some changes to data and certain costs along the way, but the construct was essentially the same from 2015 on.  We had a very positive interaction with IGEES in 2015.  Any queries were addressed quickly and no outstanding issues or concerns needed to be remedied.  Following that, there were other iterations of the CBA because it was a working document or a working model.  We then met with IGEES officials again in June of 2018 and went through another review of the CBA.  At that point, we shared the CBA report and the detailed model along with all of the assumptions underpinning the model.  We then had a back-and-forth engagement with IGEES, probably for another seven months.  During that period, additional queries and points of clarification were raised, which we again addressed.  This culminated in a final meeting with IGEES and the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in December 2018.<\/p><p>During that meeting, a new member of IGEES who had just joined raised fresh concerns or challenges in respect of the formulation of the CBA.  Given the lengthy duration of this as a 25-year forecast for the future and predicated on taking an economic interpretation of some of the guidelines in the PSC, we had a good debate.  Particular areas of concern were raised by IGEES officials during the meeting.  One was about the inclusion of e-health, for which we had included both costs and benefits, as we believed there was a robust case to do so.  Its view was that under the PSC it was probably more conservative to remove it on the basis that a separate investment case would be required for that.  We accepted that and reverted.<\/p><p> The other main issues related to the gross value added, GVA, and displacement factors we applied to the CBA.  We took those away.  As I said, we relied upon international evidence and our assessment of domestic data to align on certain elements that would support our GVA and displacement factors applications within the CBA.  I will ask Dr. Redmond to reflect on this a little more, given that he is the economist in the room.  However, we met with IGEES at a later point in January where we debated those issues.  We accepted some of the challenge but we aligned on specific numbers that we would include in the CBA, which ultimately reduced the net benefits.  Following this, we did not receive any formal communication from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Typically, that communication would have gone to the Department, but we did not hear anything to reflect any issues or concerns that might have arisen.<\/p><p> To return to the Deputy's point relating to the costs and the benefits, there were very separated work streams working in silos.  Both were working to different timelines so the benefits would have been adjusted in February 2019 and the costs would have been changed in March 2019 once the final bidder costs were through.  I hope that answers his question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019061300002#E00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Amy Ball","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560380400,"counter":992,"content":"<p>The issue that arose was that a charge was made against the CBA that it was not credible.

They relate to the ownership model that has been followed, which is the gap funding model.  PwC did work on the broadband strategy for Ireland at one point and examined the various ownership models.  Like others, it identified the gap funding model as potentially the best route to take for a number of reasons, which it set out.  They are well documented and are included in the documentation provided to us.  Does Ms Ball accept that as the tendering and procurement processes moved on and SIRO, the ESB and Vodafone as a consortium pulled out, many of the benefits that were attached to the thinking at the time that supported the gap funding model were no longer reasons to continue with it?

There is the notion of the competitive tensions that would exist with the larger operators and their existing infrastructure, which is no longer part of the final process.  We discovered yesterday from Analysys Mason that, in effect, the current bidder is going to build on the existing network Eir has for the 300,000 homes and businesses that have been passed.

With regard to the cost, Ms Ball referred in her opening statement to the fact that the benefit should be 1.3 of the cost.  We now learn the overall cost of the project is approximately &euro;5 billion, according to what the Department and Ministers have been telling us in the past few weeks.  It is &euro;2.95 billion in subsidy and &euro;2 billion on top of that.  On Ms Ball's analysis that would appear to fall a long way short of the 1.3.  It would show that it is not even reaching break even.  When she was going through the different benefits, she used the word \"assumed\" in respect of each.  She said that PwC assumed in each of the areas it examined.  I have a concern about that.  How firm is all of that?<\/p> <p>  With regard to the CBA, a number of senior departmental officials expressed concerns that the PwC report had a series of flaws and inaccurate financial information.  For example, the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform sent a letter to the Minister in which he said that it is flawed and that the project does not represent value for money on any rigorous or objective basis.  We then found out, through a further letter from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to the Minister, that the value for money assessment consistently overestimated the cost to the private operator by &euro;1 billion.  That error was only discovered last April.  Will Ms Ball comment on those two issues?

Our client is very comfortable that we are using the right numbers in our published business case - our cost-benefit analysis, CBA.<\/p><p> On the second point about the assumed benefits, as we talk through benefits and look at them over a 25-year term, economic assumptions need to be made.  Forecasts, by their nature, can be subjective.  That is why this very good governance process is in place with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the public spending code where there is strong and robust evaluation of any cost-benefit analysis cases.  As such, I would be comfortable in saying that our assumptions are very well grounded in empirical research.  They have been evaluated by very qualified people.  We have referred to similar case studies across other countries and we also have adopted a very conservative approach.  We have some specific instances where we can show that we pared back benefits.  As the Deputy said, this is an assumption-based process so we wanted to make sure that we did not overstate benefits in any way.<\/p><p> The Deputy mentioned the perceived flaw in the information.  I refer the Deputy to the response I gave to Deputy Dooley when I went through the process of the creation of the CBA.  Where the costs were coming from another source, there was strong programme governance in place to the Department.  We are in constant communication with the Department.  This is a complex programme.  The costs were moving as the new bidder costs were coming through.  There was a difference in costs in terms of the exclusion or inclusion of certain operator costs.  Other costs which were moving were the contingencies.  When the error was identified, the proper checks and balances kicked in and the error was communicated to us.  We promptly remedied it within our CBA.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019061300002#F01200","nonspeaker":"Ms Amy Ball","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560380400,"counter":1004,"content":"<p>The most senior official in that Department, who has years of experience, was very definite about that.

The GVA discussion focused on the figure used to underpin the productivity and output benefits associated with white-collar workers living in the intervention area but working outside it.  In the updated model, it was originally proposed to use a 2016 GVA figure taken directly from the CSO but following conversations with colleagues at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and in view of widespread conversations on the impact of multinationals in the economy, an issue was raised on whether the 2016 GVA figure might be slightly high and not totally reflective of the productivity levels in the domestic economy.  In our discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform we agreed a different methodological approach.  We stated we would go back to a 2011 GVA figure, which would then be scaled up by the rate of growth in modified gross national income, GNI*, over the 2011 to 2016 period.<\/p> <p>  The reason we went for this approach, and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform highlighted this, was that in view of ongoing changes in national accounting practices modified GNI* was produced to give a more accurate view of the level of productivity in the economy.  While multinationals are a very important contributor to the economy, the level of activity they produce can skew our true understanding of the domestic landscape.  When we look at the calculation of GNI we have a GDP component and net factor income.<\/p> <p>  The reason I speak about this is because net factor income takes account of the income earned by Irish citizens and companies abroad from economic activity and property they hold.  It also factors out income earned by foreign-owned companies for economic activity in an Irish context.  GNI is a good figure but modified GNI was introduced by the CSO to take account of the activity of multinationals and specifically it takes account of the retained earnings of redomiciled foreign-owned companies in Ireland and the depreciation of foreign owned capital on national balance sheets.  This meant that when we scaled the GVA figure from 2011 to 2016, we saw the growth rate of GNI* was 39% whereas across the same period the growth rate in GDP was 61%.  We agreed with colleagues and used GNI* to give a more accurate figure than the productivity figure we were using across this period.  It is interesting, and it speaks to my colleagues' points on the conservative approach we were taking.<\/p> <p>  When we talk about the productivity benefit that arrives to white-collar workers living in the intervention area, PwC considered it might be appropriate to use a GVA figure associated with white-collar workers, the assumption being these white-collar workers while living in the intervention area actually travel outside the intervention area to work in large urban areas.  They undertake work in sectors that we would imagine have a higher value add relative to the national average.  They work in professional services, IT and financial services.  We felt this average value for white-collar workers would be a good GVA and could potentially be an option.  However, on foot of ongoing debate with our colleagues in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform as a result of the iterative process, it was concluded the GVA figure to be used was an average national GVA figure.<\/p><p>It included both white and blue-collar workers.  The use of a GVA for white-collar workers would have led to a higher productivity uplift for the white-collar workers in the intervention area but who were not working there.  The use of the national figure resulted in a reduction in the GVA.  That was part of the robust approach we used.<\/p><p> The second area on which there was discussion was on the concept of displacement.  When a policy intervention is introduced, such as the national broadband plan, and it leads to a positive uplift in economic activity or output in one sector of the economy, there is a risk that this might lead to a reduction in output in other sectors of the economy.  The public spending code indicates that a cost-benefit analysis needs to provide some sort of estimate or indication of how this displacement effect has been taken into account.  Officials in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform have pointed out, and we agree, that there is a limit to domestic demand for output.  There is an argument that any increased output in the economy from productivity improvements that the national broadband plan could be expected to deliver might lead to a fall-off in economic activity in other sectors of the economy.  In the cost-benefit analysis we identify productivity and output improvements occurring at three levels, namely, for white-collar workers living in the intervention area but working outside it; for farm enterprises; and, for non-farm enterprises.  The model took account of this through the application of a displacement factor onto the GVA or output uplift that the national broadband plan would deliver across these sectors.<\/p><p> The challenge here, and this is part of our robust methodology, is that there are no Ireland-specific estimates available for output displacement factors.  To apply displacement factors to take account of displacement, we relied on a combination of international empirical research and an analysis of domestic data.  The UK Government Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, now Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, produced a research paper on research to assess the improvement of understanding additionality.  It provides a range of displacement factors that can be applied to policy interventions across a range of themes and sub-themes and at regional and sub-regional levels.  In the context of the farm and non-farm enterprise benefits, the cost-benefit analysis identifies these benefits emerging at a sub-regional level.  We felt it was appropriate to utilise displacement factors from the UK Government paper at the sub-regional level.  Specifically, the national broadband plan can be viewed as providing business development competitiveness support to the enterprises within these regions and the specific approach is almost an enterprise support.  We applied an associated displacement factor of 16%.  This was shared with our colleagues in the team in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p><p> Within the other principal sector, which is the big driver of productivity benefits relating to the productivity improvement for white-collar workers, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform suggested we derive a displacement factor on the basis of looking at the volume of national output and identifying the split between the volume of that national output that goes to the domestic market versus the volume that goes to international destinations.  An analysis of Central Statistics Office, CSO, data revealed it was difficult to show that split, so we looked at the total GVA produced in the economy and looked at the split between that produced by foreign-owned companies versus domestically owned, the assumption being that the volume of domestically produced GVA is for the domestic market and GVA produced by foreign companies would be for export, and that any change for domestic demand for output would not negatively impact that.  That split showed that 60.3% of GVA is produced by foreign-owned companies, so we applied a displacement factor of 40% on the GVA uplift associated with white-collar workers.  They were part of the iterative discussions with the team in Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We had looked at using a displacement factor for white-collar workers of 20% based on an analysis of the UK Government research, but on discussion with Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, we felt the 40% figure was more appropriate. That was another contributor to the reduction in the benefit calculations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019061300002#H00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Luke Redmond","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560380400,"counter":1031,"content":"<p>At the previous meeting with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, it said it had outlined its concerns to PwC on gross added value mechanisms, displacement factors and so on.

There was an emergency on the previous occasion I was to be here and I appreciate the committee making the invitation available to me.<\/p> <p>  Reduced timetables are a daily reality for many vulnerable students and yet there has been a certain \"do not ask, do not tell\" culture, with devastating consequences for young people of various minority groups, and autistic students, and I thank the committee for looking at this issue.<\/p> <p>  AsIAm is Ireland's national autism charity.  We undertake a range of activities with the aim of bringing about an autism-friendly Ireland.  In recent years, there has been a number of significant advancements in the education system, with 86% of autistic students now attending mainstream school.  This is, of course, to be welcomed, but permission to enter a building is not, in and of itself, inclusion.  It is easy for us to pat ourselves on the back and think we are doing a great job without scrutinising the lived experiences of many young autistic people in the education system, particularly those who are out of school or on reduced timetables.<\/p> <p>  On a day-to-day basis, our young people adapt to a way of communicating, thinking and doing which is not their own.  From a young age, experiences such as getting the bus, going to the supermarket or sitting in a classroom require problem solving, adaptation and a large degree of stress and anxiety.  The principle of accessibility is part of both national and international law, yet this is far from a universal reality within the education system.  Many autistic students are asked to communicate with those who are not trained to share in that communication, sit in environments that cause severe overload and suffering, participate in learning and social activities that are not clear or easy to understand, and be educated alongside students and staff with often little or no knowledge or empathy of their experiences.  This is simply too big of an ask for many of our young people.  While they are doing their upmost to adapt, the system seems unable or unwilling to meet in the middle and provide an accessible experience.<\/p> <p>  For a long time, AsIAm has been contacted by parents whose children are not able to attend school.  In some instances, the correct provision, be it an autism class or a special school, is unavailable or there are not enough resources to support the child in school.  In other instances, the school is not operating an inclusive practise in respect of autism, leading to anxiety, sensory overload and social isolation.  Perhaps, most disturbing, there are children whose autistic behaviours are treated as matters of discipline in the same school policy designed for dealing with students who engage in such activities as smoking behind the shed.<\/p> <p>  We discovered over time that the issue of children being out of school was not straightforward.  Often a parent could not answer \"Yes\" or \"No\" to the question, \"Does your child go to school?\"  Such children may attend irregularly, with their levels of anxiety leading to long periods out; they may have insufficient support in a school; at times, a parent may have decided to insist on a reduced hours timetable; or they may simply not have a place to go to school at all.<\/p> <p>  What struck us throughout the process was the apparent indifference of the Department of Education and Skills to this issue.  We do not know how many autistic students are out of school or, indeed, how many are on reduced timetables.  The Department does not know because it has not asked and, as a result, schools have been left to their own devices on this issue.<\/p> <p>  As a result, we wanted to demonstrate that there was a genuine problem.  We conducted a survey of the autism community in relation to absence from school and published our report \"Invisible Children\" during world autism month in April.  The aim of this report was not to establish a definitive solution to the problem &ndash; this is a much bigger piece of work with no single answer - but rather to make the case for a need to look at this issue.<\/p> <p>  A significant cohort of our respondents, 17%, were students who were on reduced timetables.  Some of these students were as young as four or five.  In some instances, parents who did not wish to have a reduced timetable were threatened with a suspension or expulsion process should they not consent.  In many instances, reduced timetables were a symptom of a lack of resources and knowledge.<\/p> <p>  I will make specific recommendations ,which AsIAm feels could assist this cohort of students.  We call on the Department of Education and Skills to recognise that reduced timetables, while unacceptable, are happening.  We do not feel a school ever has a right to place a student on a reduced timetable without a parent's consent.  Equally, we strongly believe that schools should be given additional resources for the students who need it most.  We understand that for some autistic students a reduced timetable works well and is the will of the parent.  As a result, we believe there should be national guidelines on the practice and a keyholder identified who can sanction reduced hours.  We believe that boards of management should have to record all instances of reduced timetables.  We feel schools need to be provided with more support and more training to better support students on the spectrum, and that outside agencies, such as the HSE and Tusla, have an important role to play.<\/p> <p>  I thank the committee for its time and look forward to the members' questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019061300002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Adam Harris"},{"type":"speech","time":1560380400,"counter":1114,"content":"<p>It is not the first time we have heard about New Brunswick, Canada.

As the director of the Irish Traveller Movement, the national Traveller-led organisation, I welcome the opportunity to present on the matter of reduced timetables.<\/p> <p>  There is an urgent need for a review of the widespread use of reduced timetables, as there is no requirement to monitor the practice by the Department of Education and Skills or Tusla.  There are also no supports to monitor at local level.  Members may be aware that there were 87% cuts to Traveller-specific educational supports in 2011.  Since then, there has been an increased use of the practice of withdrawal of the visiting teacher service and resource teachers for Travellers.<\/p><p>Approximately 42 visiting teacher services were cut along with 500 resource teachers.  That plays an important role in the context of the reduced timetables that were put in place.<\/p><p> Another obstacle relates to monitoring and the lack of Government support for the work of national Traveller organisations to progress Traveller education.  Reduced timetables are of concern and represent an unacceptable practice to manage poor behaviour, in particular for pupils at risk of exclusion, including members of my community.  It is critical that other approaches be considered and adopted.  Where mitigating issues affect students' ability to engage, other options should be explored with all parties involved, including school personnel, students, Tusla and DEIS.  A reduced timetable should never be used to improve behavioural, special and additional needs or on the basis of identity.  The emerging practice of reduced timetables for Travellers, in particular, stems from low expectations for Travellers and feeds into the narrative that our young people will not, and cannot, accomplish their aspirations to become teachers, doctors or, indeed politicians.  Our young people have always had these aspirations and we need teachers to believe in their aspirations and dreams for the future.  There is also a potential for legal action arising from the misuse of the practice for Travellers under the Equal Status Acts and their provisions regarding \"any practice that might be concluded as being discriminatory in nature\".   The Equal Status Acts cite four areas in which a school must not discriminate, three of which are relevant in this regard.  These are access of a student to a course, facility or benefit provided by the school, any other term or condition of participation in the school and the expulsion of a student or any other sanction.<\/p><p> There are alternative approaches to the use of reduced timetables.  In the UK, there is a comprehensive objective to apply stringent standards across schools on the use of reduced timetables.  These criteria may apply for a proposed Irish model: only in exceptional circumstances should there be occasions where it is in the best interests of the pupil to have a temporarily reduced or part-time timetable to meet individual needs for a time-limited period, for example where a medical condition prevents a pupil from attending full-time education and a reduced timetable is considered as part of a re-integration package; a reduced timetable cannot be implemented without written agreement from a parent or carer and should only be used as a short-term measure.  In the Irish context these criteria should also apply; information about children missing from education is essential and all schools should notify Tusla and DEIS of any reduced education arrangements; and Tusla and DEIS teams should monitor and review these cases.  A further UK requirement is that an online procedure to report on the arrangement should be in place in each case and as it happens, with a proposed timeline agreed between parents and schools.<\/p><p> Among our recommendations, the Government should introduce legislation to control and monitor the use of reduced timetables and adopt mandatory protocols and guidance for all schools, including primary and post-primary schools.  It should monitor and audit current practices across all schools with regard to reduced timetables or shortened days and refine the use of school attendance records as a means to shield transparency on the matter.  It must monitor complaints taken under the Equal Status Acts related to the practice and report on its findings.  The Government should introduce ethnic identifiers in proposed future regulated practices in schools and in respect of reporting and monitoring mechanisms for DEIS and Tusla.  Education welfare services should have a monitoring role.  This would be a welcome additional force to recommendations accruing where there might be greater monitoring applied.  In their own guidelines to schools on behaviour, the education welfare services ask, \"Does the school have a standardised way for staff to record matters to do with student behaviour?\"  However, this is discretionary.  Finally, we recommend the reinstatement of the Traveller education advisory committee whereby issues affecting Traveller progression in education could be brought directly to the Minister with responsibility and the relevant Department.

We do this primarily in areas experiencing social and economic disadvantage.  Our engagement through our free legal advice clinics, community education, outreach and research with communities experiencing disadvantage in Limerick city has highlighted to us the use of reduced timetabling, shortened school days and in-school suspensions as particularly prevalent forms of school exclusion.  We also run a child law clinic in collaboration with the Children's Rights Alliance on a weekly basis nationally.  It has also been identified through those clinics that reduced timetabling practices are prevalent nationally.  As the committee will be aware, these practices operate outside the formal school suspension system for which there is mandatory recording and reporting of suspensions and a mechanism to appeal.  Based on our experience, these practices disproportionately affect some of the most vulnerable groups of children in Ireland.  These include children from lower socio-economic backgrounds, children with disabilities and children from the Traveller community.  These children have been identified in research and successive Government policy instruments as being at a significantly heightened risk of early school leaving.  The consistency of the experiences shared by different organisations, including organisations and groups representing Traveller and special needs children, on the prevalence of these exclusionary practices among these groups raises concerns around equality legislation.<\/p> <p>  CLM conducted research in collaboration with Southill Family Resource Centre last year based on the incidents reported to us at our weekly advice clinics in Limerick and throughout the country.  We then held a round-table discussion to which we invited representatives from a range of agencies supporting families in disadvantaged communities in Limerick city and county.  The findings from the round table were consistent across the board.  We found that the prevalence of these practices is widespread.  All participants at the round table had experience of unofficial exclusions and reported that they took various forms including pupils or students being sent home from school, being put on a reduced timetable, for example, signing the roll and staying in a designated area in a school for two hours, and being removed from class and sent to alternative rooms.  The view of participants was that the practice disproportionately affected pupils or students from lower socio-economic backgrounds, the Traveller community and those with a disability.  It was further found that there was no consistency in the manner in which these practices were implemented.  It might be done by way of a phone call or text message to a parent.  Participants were consistently of the view that there was little or no consultation with parents, guardians or pupils prior to the implementation of a reduced timetable; rather, it was imposed by the school with the threatened alternative being a formal suspension or exclusion.  Round-table participants expressed the view that parents or guardians were often uninformed about their rights as a parent or guardian in light of the impact of this measure on the pupil's or student's education.  While our research was limited in its scope, the findings were consistent with research conducted by Inclusion Ireland, which found that only a small number of parents, carers or guardians understood what a reduced timetable was or understood the possibility of appealing it.  Only 27% were able to say that the educational welfare officer was aware of a child being on a reduced timetable.  Inclusion Ireland also found that there were issues with communication and the language used to convey information to parents, carers and guardians who were almost always not informed of their children's rights.  This often results in misunderstandings between them and schools, which damages relationships further.<\/p> <p>  We asked participants in our round table to consider the impact of these practices on a child's rights to education.  Participants expressed the view that the use of reduced school hours timetables deprives children of their full academic and social skills and often results in an impact on a child's self-esteem, compassion and ambition to succeed in life.  One participant expressed the view that it can have a long-term impacts, limiting children's options for the rest of their lives.  CLM would, therefore, like to make a number of recommendations on foot of our own experiences.  CLM proposes that the joint committee seek legal clarity on the status of the practice of reduced timetables.  CLM recommends that the recording of a shortened school day or reduced timetable be included in the annual mandatory statutory returns to Tusla on school attendance data, as required for schools by section 21 of the Education (Welfare) Act 2000.  This data should be capable of disaggregation based on gender, disability and socio-economic background.  CLM recommends also the elaboration and dissemination of national guidelines.  We looked, for example, at Kent County Council's guidelines for schools as a model.  Kent County Council requires that reduced timetables should only be used in exceptional circumstances and sets out stringent parameters relating to the use and implementation of the practice, including consultation and the consent of parent and an assessment of the impact and duration of the timetable.<\/p><p>We recommend the implementation of legislation to clarify the practice of reduced timetables, taking into consideration time limits; recording; reporting; alternative educational provision during exclusions, which is crucial; and greater consultation between the school, parent and appeals process.

I am a primary school principal in Cnoc Mhuire senior school, Killinarden, Tallaght.  I have been principal for 11 years in my current school and before that I taught for ten years in a junior school.  I have a diploma in special needs education.  As part of this diploma, I spent time in various special schools, so I have extensive experience on the ground which I would like to share with the committee.<\/p> <p>  In my 11 years as principal, I have put reduced timetables in place for six children.  This was always the last resort.  In my experience and from talking to other principals, when a reduced timetable is put in place, it is always to act in the best interests of the child.  Generally, the timetable is put in place because the child cannot cope with a full day in school and requires a lot of one-on-one attention for the time that he or she is in school.  The child might not be succeeding in a large class and may need one-on-one or small group teaching, which cannot be sustained all day, because we do not have sufficient resources.  We have an allocation of hours for special needs teaching.  This is to cover everything, including children with emotional and behavioural difficulties, learning difficulties, assessed syndromes, speech and language difficulties, autism spectrum disorders, physical disabilities, hearing and visual impairments and children with exceptional ability.  These hours have to be divided among all the children with needs in the school, including the child who needs intensive support.  We have to ensure that the rights to an education and to special needs teaching hours for all children are not compromised because of the needs of one child.  It is a matter of balancing resources.<\/p> <p>  I will provide examples of real cases in which reduced timetables were put in place.  I hope this will illustrate the complex issues that schools face.  Having listened to the witnesses from other schools speak, I should say that we have a process in place.  We record these cases, consult the parents and the child would also be involved.  In my school, we have very clear procedures in place in this regard, as we have with everything in the school.<\/p> <p>  Last year, we decided to put a child on a shortened day because of the difficulties he was experiencing in the afternoons.  This included violent and aggressive outbursts in which other children and staff members were placed at risk.  He used to run around the school, banging walls and doors, hitting other children he encountered, upending furniture and engaging in general out-of-control behaviour.  A reduced timetable was put in place in an effort to reduce suspensions as he had been suspended for these outbursts.  We wanted him to experience success in school and not end each day on a negative note.  The reduced timetable was a temporary measure, which was reviewed every six weeks with the involvement of the boy's mother.<\/p> <p>  We had another child engaging in violent and aggressive behaviour and self-harm.  He really benefited from a reduced timetable.  He has been on a waiting list for child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, for approximately a year and was not getting any other supports.  When he had one-on-one attention from the teacher or special needs assistant, SNA, he was manageable but when the adult stepped away anything could happen.  The tension and apprehension in the class caused by his unpredictable behaviour was distressing for the other children.  We eventually got him placed in a special school for children with emotional and behavioural needs.  I am still in touch with the family and he is thriving.  Now that he is not in the classroom, it is calmer because the threat of violence is gone.  The children feel more secure and the SNA has more time to give to the other children in the class with SNA access.  The teacher feels she is making more progress in the classroom because she used to spend a lot of time and energy with this child.<\/p> <p>  One of my colleagues has a child in her class on a reduced timetable all year around.  The boy, who is in junior infants class, is the child of two addicts who had been neglected.  Social workers were involved in the case.  The boy had never seen a school building as he had only spent time at home and was not used to other adults or children.  He came in afraid every morning and tried to escape.  He was terrified.  He punched, hit and kicked every adult and child he met.  This was terrifying for him and all the other little four and five year olds in the class.  The position was unsustainable as the whole school was in chaos every morning when the child arrived, which was terrible for him and the other kids.  With the foster mother and social worker, a reduced timetable was put in place.  The boy started on one hour per day before moving to 90 minutes, two hours and then three hours.  I believe he is now coming in until 1 p.m. every day.  He still cannot do the full day but the reduced timetable has helped him.<\/p> <p>  A child in sixth class in a neighbouring school was refusing to go to school.  He had extreme anxiety about school and did not want to be there.  Since he had missed so many days in school, an agreement was made with the child, parents and educational welfare officer that if he came in, he would be allowed to go home early every day.  This got him in to school and eased his anxiety.<\/p> <p>  We do not have the resources to meet the complex and extreme needs of some children.  We are, therefore, balancing this with the duty of care we have to all the children in the school.  Reduced timetables are a minor issue.  We need to look at what leads to a reduced timetable for a child.  I urge the committee to focus on the other agencies which should be supporting schools and parents in managing the most vulnerable children, with a view to ensuring alternative placements are provided for children who cannot cope in a mainstream school.  By the time a child gets to a reduced timetable, he or she has been failed.  There are many layers involved and the issue is complex.<\/p> <p>  I firmly believe that the issue is not the reduced timetable.  I agree that there have to be simple guidelines, not loads of paperwork for schools, but a checklist or such to have in returns at the end of the year with information such as the number of children on reduced timetables.  It could be a nice, simple exercise for schools because we are flooded with paperwork.  Something could easily be worked out.  The committee needs to look at the complex factors that contribute to a child needing a reduced timetable in the first place and the lack of services and supports for children in need.  The needs of one child have to be balanced with those of the other children in the school.  I see quiet children who should be succeeding more in literacy, numeracy and everything else but do not get the necessary attention or time from the teacher because resources are directed to other children.  I urge the committee to look at the big picture.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019061300002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Orla Hanahoe"},{"type":"speech","time":1560380400,"counter":1122,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Hanahoe.

I am conscious of time and I will highlight a few points from our written submission.  The NCSE uses the term \"reduced timetable\" to refer to school-based arrangements whereby students have a later starting time or earlier finishing time than other students, take fewer subjects than is usual for their peers, or do not attend school for the full five days each week.<\/p> <p>  In the past, we have reported concerns that, for a variety of reasons, a number of students with severe emotional behavioural disorders were not in full-time education because they were on reduced attendance as a way to assist the school to manage their challenging behaviour.  We have also advised that some students with autism were on a reduced timetable and-or missed days from school because they could find it extremely difficult to cope in school due to extreme anxiety, sensory issues or social and communication difficulties.  In some cases, these students can be marked present on the roll but still miss significant time from school, which is not officially recorded.  There was little available information about this so the extent of the problem was not fully understood and, therefore, was not being fully addressed.  We recommended that schools should be required to report these arrangements to Tusla to ensure that these students are in receipt of an education that is appropriate to their needs and to create an understanding of the nature, extent and impact of this problem.<\/p> <p>  One of our key responsibilities is to work with schools to ensure there are sufficient places in mainstream and special schools for students with special educational needs.  We also provide advice and supports to schools on the education of students as well as providing professional learning opportunities for teachers.  While we do not have a direct role in ensuring that students attend school, we support Tusla in discharging its responsibilities to ensure that all students, including those with special educational needs, attend school or otherwise receive an education.  From time to time, information on individual students on reduced timetables is brought to our attention through, for example, revised school transport applications or engagement with parents.  While we do not track this information because we do not have a formal role in ensuring students' attendance at school, when our special education needs organisers, SENOs, become aware that a student is on a reduced day or reduced timetable, they remind the school of its responsibility to report this to Tusla.  Our SENOs also support parents, schools and students, where appropriate, to develop a plan for the student's return to full attendance.<\/p> <p>  We do not as yet have an informed view on whether the use of reduced timetables can be of benefit to students as, to date, we do not have sufficient evidence on which to base such a view.<\/p><p>We have been told by teachers and principals that there is a small but significant minority of students whose needs are so great that they are unable to manage a full school day.  This could be due to school phobia or sensory difficulties or severely challenging behaviours and schools make the case that reducing the length of their school day enables these students to attend school for at least some of the day or week.  The NCSE considers that, before reaching any decision on the appropriateness or otherwise of such arrangements, more information is required on the arrangements that schools put in place around reduced student timetables, including information on whether this includes a plan for the student&rsquo;s phased return to full-time education<b><font color=\"#104160\">.<\/font><\/b>We consider the issue of reduced timetabling is an extremely important matter which, depending on the arrangements in place, could potentially negatively impact on the education provided to students with special educational needs.  The overriding imperative must be that these students receive an education appropriate to their needs.<br\/><br\/>We welcome the committee&rsquo;s examination of the issues involved and would be very happy to provide further assistance to the committee should it be required.  The council has formed extensive contacts with New Brunswick over the past year and we would be very happy to assist in helping the committee to engage with our colleagues there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019061300002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Byrne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560380400,"counter":1125,"content":"<p>If witnesses wish to make further comments in written form, or wish to provide further documentation, they should feel free to send it to the clerk.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019061300002#H00200","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speech","time":1560380400,"counter":1126,"content":"<p>I spoke on this issue at the last meeting and I get angrier every time I hear the issue played out.

We do not need guidelines from anywhere as the Constitution is the guideline and it is the law of the country.  I have huge respect for the three witnesses from the voluntary sector but they need to take a harder line on this.  I accept that guidelines need to be monitored but every child is entitled to a free primary education.  Ms Hanahoe's example may fit in with what the Department of Education and Skills and the Minister said in the D&aacute;il.  Ms Mary Byrne and the National Council for Special Education are the people who advise on this matter and they have not endorsed it as they say they do not have the evidence to do so.  I am grateful to Ms Byrne for saying this and I will listen to her very carefully on this matter.  The Minister is very clear that this should not be happening but resources for schools, to ensure they can provide the education that is guaranteed under the Constitution, are the key issue.<\/p> <p>  When this committee makes its report, I firmly believe that we should take a hard line on this on behalf of children as they should not be denied their right to free primary education, by the schools or because of a lack of resources from the Department.  The only people who are getting on to us about this are the families of children with special needs and their representative organisations.  It affects Travellers and people from lower socio-economic backgrounds, as it was said was the case in Limerick.  It is utter discrimination and it is just an excuse.  The boards of management and education and training boards, ETBs, should be reporting this back to the Department of Education and Skills and demanding that resources be provided to ensure children can be dealt with.  I am grateful to the National Council for Special Education for the hard line it is taking on this and for saying it should not be happening.  The Minister took a hard line in the D&aacute;il and said it should not be happening but I am not sure he is doing anything to prevent it happening.

There may be exceptional cases, as Ms Hanahoe and Mr. Harris suggested, where a child may not be able to cope with a full day but consultation with parents is crucial.  The Education (Parent and Student Charter) Bill 2016 is coming forward and this issue could be relevant to that.

What qualifications does a teacher need to be the one-on-one person for a child?  Are there times where it is not a teacher but a special needs assistant, SNA, who is there?  When SNAs are hired, are they informed that there may be occasions when they will be with the most difficult student in the school as part of their job?

Is she aware of anything at all that the Department is doing to help?  Ms Hanahoe outlined cases involving major behavioural difficulties.  How does she choose the teacher?  In the context of one case, she referred to the \"teacher or special needs assistant\" and referred to what happened when the adult stepped away.

This comes back to monitoring in particular.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019061300002#J00300","speaker":"1389"},{"type":"speech","time":1560380400,"counter":1134,"content":"<p>I am a guest today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019061300002#J00400","speaker":"1430"},{"type":"speech","time":1560380400,"counter":1135,"content":"<p>A welcome guest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019061300002#J00500","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speech","time":1560380400,"counter":1136,"content":"<p>I hope this visit will be less controversial than my previous one.  I promise to behave.  I commend the committee on highlighting and examining this issue.  It has been hidden in plain sight.  This is a really important examination, as are the testimonies of those experiencing disadvantage, including Travellers, and those with autism.  I refer to the impact of the reduced timetables.  There are good ways of employing a reduced timetable but there are also significantly challenging ways.  I agree absolutely with Deputy Thomas Byrne that all children have a right to education.  We must keep that front and centre.  As a guest, I hope that the committee bears this in mind.  It is not a question of if but of how.  It is important that the committee examine this.  My first job, as a very wet-behind-the-ears community worker in Finglas, was with a youth encounter project.  It was all about children at risk of getting into all sorts of trouble.  St. Paul's is still going strong and it does incredible work.  There are examples such as those in New Brunswick but we have very good examples on our doorstep of how we can connect with children who might otherwise be at risk.<\/p> <p>  I attended an event about Oberstown.  It was very stark.  More than half of the young people there were out of school, for one reason or another, be it because of reduced timetables or because they were excluded.  The costs to their lives and society are considerable when we do not address this issue.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Thomas Byrne and I worked hard on giving the NCSE additional powers with regard to autism classes.  I refer to admission to schools.  Does the council need more powers to tackle this issue?  Does it need more resources?  The council should let us know because we are legislators.  We would be willing to give more powers, if needed.  There is consensus that the practice should be exceptional, considering it is necessary for every child to have an education.<\/p> <p>  Ms Hanahoe works in Killinarden.  I am sure my colleague, Senator Ruane, had a role in her being here today.  In an ideal world, what resources would Ms Hanahoe have?  If she could have anything, what resources would she need to educate all the pupils on her role as desired, bearing in mind all the pupils' circumstances, strong examples of which were given?  Where does responsibility lie for the data deficit?  Is it with the Department, the schools or Tusla?  What is the prevalence of the practice?  Is it getting worse or better?  Are there clear data on who in particular is affected by the practice?  I would like to hear answers to those questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019061300002#J00600","speaker":"1430"},{"type":"speech","time":1560380400,"counter":1137,"content":"<p>I have a few short questions.  I will be specific about who I am addressing.  Mr. Harris talked about the provision of additional therapies.  Is he suggesting that it be offered during the school day?  Should it be timetabled during school time for the students concerned?  Mr. Harris also said boards of management should explore other options before recommending that an autistic student with overly complex needs be expelled or transferred to another school.  Within the context of schools having limited resources, what is the impact on other children in a class considering that a third of the respondents in the survey said their child was on a reduced timetable due to a lack of resources?  The area of resources is a really big one.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Joyce referred to reduced timetables in behaviour-management situations.  Has he any alternative strategies that he would recommend or suggest should be taken on board?<\/p> <p>  Ms Keane talked about data that could be used.  How would she propose using data on the use of the reduced timetables in regard to gender, disability and socio-economic background?  How should they be disaggregated?  Sometimes when we label too much or have too many boxes to tick, it can lead to further segregation and, possibly, more exclusion.<\/p> <p>  Was there any reason the Department of Education and Skills or other State bodies, such as NCSE, did not take part in the round-table discussion.?  Perhaps they were not invited.  I would be interested in knowing the reason.<\/p> <p>  On Ms Hanahoe's remarks, it is always good to listen to another perspective.  Coming from a teaching background, I saw evidence of what she was talking about.  I concur with my colleague Deputy Thomas Byrne that every child should have the opportunity to have a school education.<\/p><p>That is not taking away from the importance of understanding the situation teachers and other pupils have to deal with and how they are affected.  I am interested in hearing a little more about the resources that are needed in helping parents to manage their children.  Sometimes parents have their own complex needs and we also need to help them with their parenting skills.  Sometimes we can do this through schools.  <\/p><p> I share Senator Gavan's view on the possible reduction of capitation grants.  It certainly could put children at a disadvantage in an already stretched environment.  It is not something I would like to see happen.  <\/p><p> I, too, want to ask about the role of parents if timetables were to be reduced.  In Ms Byrne's experience, do parents engage fully in a process aimed arriving at a mutually acceptable decision?  Obviously, we want parents to be consulted at all times, but does full engagement take place?  As I have dealt with parents and teachers in these situations, I am interested in hearing Ms Byrne's perspective.  <\/p><p> I will go back to the panellists in reverse order.  I ask Ms Byrne to respond first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019061300002#J00700","speaker":"1257","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560380400,"counter":1139,"content":"<p>A number of the questions have revolved around the supports schools have or need.  I draw the attention of the committee to the fact that the Department and the Government have approved a pilot scheme for a new school inclusion model to be carried out from September in one area.  It is based on recommendations made by the NCSE that students with behavioural, communication and sensory difficulties and so on require the appropriate supports at the right time.  To put some of the appropriate supports in place, we will have a range of supports provided in the pilot scheme area.  For example, the NCSE will have speech and language therapists and some behavioural practitioners and occupational therapists available.  We will be trying to work with the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, the HSE and other services in the area to see what model of support we can put in place in schools to build their capacity to work with students with the most challenging needs.  The project will be evaluated and it will be very interesting to see the outcomes for students and whether fewer of them will need to be on reduced timetables.  It is a really important project which is of relevance in this area.<\/p> <p>  It is not just in Ireland that we are hearing about an increase in the number of children on reduced timetables.  It is a phenomenon in a number of countries.  It is also important to stand back and look not just at the reduced timetables.  Ms Hanahoe referred to this issue.  It would be really good to look at what is driving the increase and the reasons behind it.  Given that we know that it is an international phenomenon, perhaps Ireland might play a part in setting up an international research project to look at it.  We were thinking funding might perhaps be given to the Educational Research Centre or an agency like it.  We are not on our own in dealing with this issue.<\/p> <p>  Schools have a responsibility to ensure those teachers with the greatest experience and qualifications are working with students with the greatest needs.  While undoubtedly many schools try to do this, we are sometimes disappointed to hear of instances where that is not the case and particularly about how teachers are deployed to special classes.  We are sometimes told that principals find it hard to get their experienced teachers to take these classes, sometimes because they are not confident enough or believe they do not have the requisite skills.  However, they are not really reasons not to give the class to the most experienced and most qualified teachers.<\/p> <p>  I was asked about three specific things I would like to address.  Senator Kelleher kindly suggested we might need more powers and resources to tackle these issues.  Actually the NCSE considers itself to be only part of the picture which is much wider than students with special educational needs.  While we have given consideration to whether our organisation should be collecting these data, we believe we could get an inaccurate picture.  We would only obtain information on students with special educational needs; it would not be right for us to collect information on other students.  We need a comprehensive approach to data collection and believe schools should be enabled to report centrally in order that we get a composite, comprehensive picture across schools and students.<\/p> <p>  The recommendation on the capitation grant and the reduction in it were brought up by two or three members.  We did suggest the Department might consider it.  What we had in mind was that while, of course, schools needed to be supported, perhaps the Department also needed to consider a disincentive for schools that might be over-engaging in the practice of having reduced timetables.  It was in that context that we made the recommendation.  I was asked about the role of parents and whether they were fully engaged in arriving at a mutually acceptable agreement.  I do not know the answer to that question because we do not have the data.  <\/p> <p>  On the very last point, to my knowledge, the NCSE did not receive an invitation to engage in a round-table discussion.  We generally engage in such discussions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019061300002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Byrne"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560380400,"counter":1140,"content":"<p>I was asked quite a few questions and I am trying to recall all of them.  <\/p> <p>  It comes down to resources.  To put the matter in context for the committee, my school is in one of the most marginalised communities in the country.  It is a tough place and we face really complex issues every day.  Number one is class size.  I am in the senior school where the pupil-teacher ratio is 24:1.  In the more middle-class school down the road and every other school it is 26:1.  That is not much of an advantage.  There should be a smaller class size.  I am working on an initiative with a group of DEIS school principals to have a maximum class size in the most disadvantaged schools of 15:1 in junior schools and 20:1 in senior schools.  In our school, if we had smaller classes, we would have more time for relationships.  A lot of this stems from relationships and the connection a child can have with the teacher.  Where there are a lot of children with complex needs in the class, we definitely need a smaller class size.<\/p> <p>  Staffing is a significant issue.  There is a crisis in teaching.  This year I have been unable to fill one post.  I have had about five teachers in the post all year because we cannot get teachers.  I am sure the issue has been reported on by the Irish National Teachers Organisation, INTO, and so on.  I have been using student teachers.  I might find a teacher for one month here or there and I am having to split classes.  Deputy Catherine Martin asked how I decided which teacher should teach each class.  I am lucky in that it is a small enough school of 170 kids.  Therefore, I know the kids and the teachers.  It is about matching personalities and judging who will work well with whom and be the most experienced teacher to teach the most challenging class.  However, we are struggling to find staff.  I have two temporary and two permanent posts vacant.  My advertisement has been up for one week and I have only received ten applicants for the temporary posts.  It is the last day of advertising for the permanent posts and nobody wants them.  Teachers are not choosing to work in schools like mine.  It is a challenge and I want the best teachers to teach the children.  Once we get teachers into a DEIS school, although they might be afraid, they generally love it and stay because they get such satisfaction from dealing with the children and seeing them progress.  The Department is probably aware of it, but there is a teacher recruitment crisis.  There is not a great choice. <\/p> <p>  Another issue is the waiting lists for child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, and speech and language therapy.<\/p><p>Many behavioural difficulties stem from speech and language difficulties and the waiting list is about eight months.  If the parent does engage, he or she might get a block of therapy and must then wait for another six months.  There are long waiting lists for occupational therapy.  When we get to work with the occupational therapist, we realise what helps a child with ASD.  One child who loves pressure wears his coat half the day and likes to carry piles of books around.  We find out what works for him.  We need a multidisciplinary approach.  In an ideal world, I would love to have access such as a hub with a psychologist, occupational therapist, speech and language therapist and clinical psychologist working to serve disadvantaged schools in particular and serving in the schools because it involves the capacity of the parents as well.  Sometimes they do not have the capacity to attend appointments so we experience missed appointments.  I use my home school liaison officer with many of these children whereby she would have picked up the mother, driven her to the appointment, waited for her and held her hand.  Getting therapy is a significant process in itself.  <\/p><p> What we find beneficial in our schools is access to a counsellor.  We get a counselling grant from Tusla and have a counsellor who comes to our school two days per week.  That has helped a lot of our children with emotional and behavioural difficulties because they have somebody with whom to talk things through and help them with bereavements and tragedies they face.  <\/p><p> It is all about early intervention because by the time a child gets to secondary school, it is very hard to pull him or her back.  I know what the secondary school in our area faces.  There is open drug dealing during the day and children are going into that secondary school on drugs.  I have come across children in sixth class who were taking drugs as well, so it is a significant social issue in our area.  It is not a simple process.  <\/p><p> We would never have an SNA working alone with a child.  A team is generally involved.  We would need to have two adults with some children at all times.  These children would be very difficult.  They would be in and out of the classroom with the SNA.  The SNA might see that they are getting a bit fidgety and difficult and bring them out, do a job or go to another room but it would be in the classroom.  We have no special rooms.  In-class suspension is something we do to avoid suspending children.  It involves children spending time out of their own classrooms with another teacher.  That sometimes helps because they want to get back to their own class.  It keeps them in school and learning and engaged.  It makes them want to be with their peers so that is a strategy we have found to be very beneficial.  <\/p><p> Is there anything anybody wants to ask me about?  I feel that our school is struggling.  There are so many issues to face.  It involves the complex issues of our particular area.  There are DEIS band 1 schools but then one has what we call DEIS plus schools that need even more resources than the more privileged or middle-class schools.  That needs to be taken into account.  I am sure members will have found that it involves very disadvantaged communities so they need to be targeted first and need to get more resources than the rest of the schools.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019061300002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Orla Hanahoe","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560380400,"counter":1142,"content":"<p>Deputy Catherine Martin and I taught in DEIS schools, so we have that experience as well.

I can only speak from my own experience.  We run two clinics per week in areas in Limerick with very high early school leaving, with the rate being as high as 46% in one area.  This is far higher than the national average of 12.5%.  We are dealing with parents who might have had a very poor educational history in terms of their own experience with schools.  Ms Hanahoe mentioned that the capacity of parents to engage with the school can also be an issue at times.  Yesterday, I met a parent who told me her son has been on reduced timetabling for four months and she does not know the reason why.  There is no formal communication around this.  It is a practice that has slid into existence but she does not know the reason why.  There is no piece of paper - no form or letter.  There is no way to appeal this.  Sometimes the balance of power is such that she knows that if she does something to challenge or appeal this, the alternative might be a form of suspension or formal exclusion so what she has is almost better than nothing.  It is almost as if the parent accepts that this is better than nothing.  As Deputy Thomas Byrne said, when a child has the right to an education, better than nothing is not enough.  The child has the right to five hours and 40 minutes at primary level or six hours at secondary level.  If the child is not getting the capacity to have that education, better than nothing is not enough.<\/p> <p>  A piece of work must be done around particular areas where, as Ms Hanahoe identified, capacity issues with parents exist.  I know there are some pilots running in Limerick.  Deputy Jan O'Sullivan and Senator Byrne might be aware of the ones in Corpus Christi school, Moyross, and Le Ch&eacute;ile national school in Roxborough, where they are working to have all those services within the same footprint.  The child will enter the early school years and into primary school level and the speech and language therapist and the physiotherapist will be on site.  Moreover, all the services the family will need to support that child, including supports for the family, will be on the one site.  The instances of \"do not attend\" or \"did not attend\" for some of these services were so staggeringly high that they thought they would bring them to the schools and consequently, they are building that footprint in Limerick with the Le Ch&eacute;ile model.  I also know that Corpus Christi school, Moyross, is doing a lot of work to support parents in terms of parenting capacity because it recognises that it is not enough to address the issue at the child's level.  This is generational.  We see generation upon generation in particular areas where early school leaving is part of the fabric of the family and the area in which it lives.  That engagement piece is significant in terms of the parents' capacity to support their child.  That is a significant issue.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Catherine Martin raised the length of time and whether there was any measurement with regard to that.  Last week, a family came to me whose child entered secondary school and is just about to complete second year but has been on a reduced timetable since the child's second month of first year, so we are looking at two years.  The child is going into his junior certificate year having been on a reduced timetable for two years.  There is no one particular issue.  It is the culmination of lots of different issues.  Again, for the parents in this case, it is almost an \"it is better than nothing\" approach.  This child does not have any particular identified need but has disciplinary issues.  Home tutoring was suggested as a possible solution to this family but the family consists of two adults and seven children living in a two-bedroom house.  How does home tutoring work in that scenario?  Where is the capacity to facilitate that?  No doubt, that is part of the problem that this child brings to school with him.  There is so much overcrowding that he is bringing that to school with him.  <\/p> <p>  There are different layers as to why this practice happens.  As for looking exclusively at it on the basis of a child with a disability or a child from the Traveller community or from a particular disadvantaged background, there are so many different layers.  Children are now coming to school from hotels and do not have the capacity to go home and do their homework or get a good night's sleep.  Homelessness is a significant issue with which we deal in our law centres in Limerick and Dublin.  It has a massive impact on a child's ability to complete a full school day.  <\/p> <p>  This relates to the Chairman's question about the data that are collected.  This is a critical issue.<\/p><p>There could be other alternative education provisions that could be identified if one knew the basis on which the child was on a reduced time timetable.  Issues such as disability or a particular economic or social background might be very evident.  Something like hidden homelessness goes under the radar and perhaps a child might need that support because of particular circumstances at the time.  That answers the question as to how the data could be used.  <\/p><p> On the round-table in Limerick, it was organised locally and invitations were sent through the Limerick citywide children and youth forum, which is made up of representatives of services which support families across the city and county.  The Department is not a member of the body.  Our hope is we will be able to extend it further.  It was a small piece we did last year.  Unfortunately, we have limited resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019061300002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Caroline Keane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560380400,"counter":1146,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Keane.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019061300002#M00200","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560380400,"counter":1147,"content":"<p>I will give feedback on some of the comments made.<\/p> <p>  We welcome Deputy Thomas Byrne's comment on there being a constitutional right to an education, as stated and as we have been stating for a long time.  Participating in full-time education is a fundamental right and it would be wrong to deprive anybody of it.  That is why we are here.  The outcomes for Traveller children, children with autism and for others owing to socio-economic reasons are such that they are leaving school without completing the leaving certificate, or the junior certificate for that matter.  <\/p> <p>  To respond to other issues raised, we have been contacted by parents across the country who have told us that their children are on a reduced timetable, that they are unaware of what recourse they have or the procedures or legislation in place.  While we know that there are remedies available,  it is left to parents to address the particular issue.  That is not the right approach to take.<\/p> <p>  I am looking at a submission the Irish Traveller Movement made some considerable time ago in April 2011 on education cuts.  There is a connection between the cuts made and the reduced timetables that are impacting directly on Traveller children today, as we have heard in the discussion on resources.  The removal overnight of the resources put in place to support, enable and encourage parents and schools will have a significant impact, as we are seeing.  We have lost a generation of young Travellers at primary and post-primary level, which has been a regressive step.  One of the recommendations is that there be an audit to see why the cuts took place to assess fully if they were justified or carried out in a disproportionate manner.  I understand this has not materialised.<\/p> <p>  We lost 40 visiting teachers who would link with communities and schools.  They would be very helpful.  <\/p> <p>  On resource teachers, I estimate that there were 500 at the time of the cuts and then they were gone.  It was fundamentally wrong in every sense to do this to the most vulnerable, marginalised and socially excluded group.  The opportunities for young Travellers today are being limited as a result.  We, therefore, need to address the issue of school resources.  It is not about blaming schools but about looking at how we work with the system in which these resources have been cut to improve provision.  It is also to ensure that where there are reduced timetables, there is a very clear rationale they are in place.  <\/p> <p>  We need to look at putting resources in place to ensure every single child will have access to a full education within the system.  As things stand, we are not achieving this.  People are beginning to seek advice and support from community law centres and NGOs to have these issues addressed.  We have made some clear recommendations.  There has to be a reframing to ensure this issue is eradicated with immediate effect.  I do not accept for one minute that a child should be put on a reduced timetable.  It appears to be based on identity and expectations as opposed to anything else.  There are reasons for this, given that some schools have mentioned Traveller children.  It is disproportionate.  We need to examine the issue without waiting to discover what is international best practice.  Ireland has to step up to the plate and develop best practice in order to shape Europe's response.  The Departments need to collaborate to ensure a strategic co-ordinated approach is adopted.  The task now for everybody, including all of the political parties, is to work together to that end.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019061300002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard Joyce"},{"type":"speech","time":1560380400,"counter":1148,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Joyce.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019061300002#M00400","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560380400,"counter":1149,"content":"<p>I will deal with the Chairman's questions.<\/p> <p>  On boards of management, one of the concerns AsIAm.ie has had for some time is that they are often asked to make significant decisions on opening autism classes, suspensions and expulsions.  The role of a board of management is to oversee the activities of a principal and hold him or her to account from a governance point of view.  We are concerned that very few boards of management have a representative of parents with a child with special needs or include a person with that expertise.  That is worrying and something at which the patron body should look.  <\/p> <p>  Whatever comes out of the process on reduced timetables, it has to be more than a recording exercise by a principal; it also has to involve a degree of sanction and approval.  <\/p> <p>  On the impact on other children, there is no doubt that schools that are inclusive and enrolling students with disabilities and other needs should be resourced appropriately.  The evidence shows that in the vast majority of cases having a child with a disability in a class has a positive educational impact on other children.  In a survey we conducted in April of attitudes to autism among 1,000 people selected at random the most open cohort was the 18 to 25 year age group.  The reason is those surveyed had sat in a classroom with people with disabilities.<\/p> <p>  On the therapies piece about which I was asked, it was in reference to the piece about which Ms Byrne had spoken on the in-school therapy pilot scheme and the proposals for the reform of the SNA scheme.  <\/p> <p>  To pick up on what Ms Hanahoe said about there being bigger overriding issues, one of the challenges in mainstreaming is that some expertise may have been lost in the process.  When a child attended a special school, he or she was able to access a lot of people with advanced knowledge and from therapeutic backgrounds, etc.  Mainstream schools do not currently have that resource.  <\/p> <p>  Deputy Thomas Byrne referenced the Constitution.  It is a point with which we very much agree and which we raise frequently, with the broader issue of illegality in the context of the Education Act, for example.<\/p><p>This relates to another area of the Constitution, namely, the parent as the primary educator.  The parents in our community play a central role in advocating for and supporting their children.  Our experience, however, is that they have the least choice and input in their child's education compared with other parents.  One of the key reasons parents cite the reduced timetables is that they wanted their child to go to an autism class or a special school and that was not possible.  I was asked whether there is usually a good engagement between parent and school.  Unfortunately, in many instances the engagement has been appalling.  I would use the word \"manipulative\" to describe the way parents have been handled, being told what would happen if they did not consent to this.<\/p><p> When we make the legal argument another factor is in play, namely, the UN convention, which is clear in stating that it is never the obligation of the child to somehow adjust and adapt to fit into the school.  The onus is on the member state and its agencies, in this case, the school, to adapt to meet the needs of the child.  When, for example, an autistic child is struggling and, as a result, experiences a meltdown and loses the ability to communicate that is not a choice.  That is happening because of the environment and the experience the child is having being inaccessible.  We need to consider this from an accessibility point of view and realise that the onus has to keep going back on to the State.<\/p><p> I am concerned that when instances such as that happen the policy that tends to be operated is a code of behaviour, not an accessibility policy about how to support the child in this instance.  For example, families frequently get in touch with us because the use of a behaviour contract is being put to children as young as nine and ten years.  Children are being asked to sign documents stating, for example, that they will respect personal space, be mindful in their tone of voice or will not get agitated if there is a change of plan.  It is the equivalent of asking a child to sign a document stating it will no longer be autistic.  These are fundamental accessibility needs and they are not being recognised.  <\/p><p> In our written submission, we outlined the reasons that parents said their children were on reduced timetables.  Resources come up, particularly in the lack of autism classes, but there are also issues such as lack of teacher training, the sensory environment and staff not having training in communication.  There are deeper cultural issues that have to be recognised.<\/p><p> Deputy Catherine Martin asked about numbers.  In our survey, 47% of the young people on reduced timetables had no engagement with their SENO.  I have the numbers on Tusla and numbers for how long the reduced timetable has been in place but I do not have them with me.  I can send them on without a problem.  We found that reduced timetables tend to be the first step towards a suspension or an expulsion.  During the research process for this, we tried to use freedom of information requests to get numbers from the Department on suspensions and expulsions of children with disabilities but there are no data.  That goes hand in glove with this issue.  <\/p><p> A question was asked about qualifications.  We still see many instances of newly qualified teachers being placed in autism classes or in additional teaching roles that are not appropriate.  The message that must go out is that it is not a case of choosing to be a special educational needs or mainstream teacher, our system now is that a person is a teacher and has to be willing to teach whomever they are called upon to teach, particularly as they become more experienced.<\/p><p> There is a deterioration in the accessibility of school buildings for autistic students.  There are beautiful new buildings around the country but they have a lot of light and glare, and multi-purpose spaces are being used with a lot of sensory activity at once.  Even the bright vibrant colour schemes pose fundamental accessibility issues.  While physical access is considered, autism-friendly design is not being embedded in the construction of autism classes or schools.<\/p><p> There is no doubt the problem comes back to training again and again.  Even though people with disabilities have been attending schools for some time, teachers are still completing their education without any discrete awareness of conditions such as autism.  Mary Immaculate College in Thurles has become the first teacher education college to teach a compulsory module on autism.  This needs to be explored more fully.  In terms of continuing professional development, CPD, what is the uptake of schemes such as the Middletown Centre for Autism's training programme?  If it is low, why is that the case?  I understand from the teachers' unions that they are very keen to be able to access more training.  A key priority in addressing this issue has to be to identify what sort of training is needed and how it can be delivered in a way that is acceptable to everybody.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019061300002#M00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Adam Harris","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560380400,"counter":1151,"content":"<p>In effect, reduced timetables amount to a suspension and the section 29 procedures presumably apply.

As the committee is aware, the Ombudsman for Children's Office, OCO, is an independent human rights institution established under the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002.  In light of these statutory functions, I welcome the committee's decision to examine the use of reduced timetables and to shine a light on this issue.<\/p> <p>  It is important to note that equal access to education is a fundamental right for children under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, UNCRC, which Ireland ratified in 1992.  Two of the main articles provide that all children must be able to enjoy their rights without discrimination of any kind and that children's best interests should be treated as a primary consideration in all actions concerning them.  I believe that the current invisibility of the use of reduced timetables in Irish schools is a real and serious concern that is impacting on how we as a country can say with confidence we are upholding the rights of all children fairly and equally.  I am aware that schools sometimes use reduced timetables as a positive intervention in exceptional circumstances for the purposes of supporting children at a particularly difficult time in their lives when a full day at school may have become an insurmountable challenge.  In these circumstances, schools use reduced timetables to facilitate a child to continue with their education to the maximum extent possible until such time as they are able to return to school full time.  This can be understood as a child-centred practice that is underpinned by a commitment to acting in the best interests of the child concerned.  Some of Ms Hanahoe's examples were very good.  In our experience, their use in these exceptional circumstances rarely causes difficulties and tends to involve a partnership between the child's parent or guardians and the school.  However, even in these circumstances it is essential to be cognisant of a potential inequality in the negotiating position of the parents and the school.  Therefore, safeguards need to be put in place to ensure that the use of a reduced timetable for the purposes of supporting a child is time-limited, in the best interests of the child concerned and put in place without any pressure having been placed on the child's parent or guardian to agree to it.<\/p> <p>  Simple safeguards in these circumstances could be a clear, shared and agreed understanding between the school, the child and the parents.  It should include the rationale for the reduced timetable, informed consent that has due regard to the views of the child and a formal, written agreement between the school and the child's parents.  If there are other parties involved with the child, they should have input to specific details about how long the reduced timetable will be in place and dates for reviewing its use.<\/p> <p>  I am more concerned about what I consider is the inappropriate use of reduced timetables as an informal suspension in response to behaviour by the child that a school is finding difficult to manage in the classroom.  This type of response by schools often occurs in the absence of policy or guidance and may not be recorded within the school and its use is not overseen by any external agency.  This means one child or a group of children could be missing significant amounts of education that cumulatively could be far more than a formal suspension.  We have heard examples of that today.  As we all know, excluding a child's access to education is seen as an extremely serious sanction to the extent that there are specific safeguards under Irish policy and legislation regarding its use.  Deputy Byrne mentioned that. <\/p> <p>  At the moment the use of reduced timetables is invisible.  It is not listed as an option.  There are no guidelines on its use, no guidance on recording its use and no external monitoring of same.  Therefore, the oversight of its use is in individual schools.  It is also impossible to determine if some cohort of children are more adversely affected than others but, as we heard, children with disabilities, children with emotional and behavioural difficulties or children from a different cultural background such as those in the Traveller or Roma communities or those in disadvantaged areas are likely to be the main recipients of reduced timetables.  Anecdotal evidence would suggest they are.  It is important that we do not underestimate the impact of prolonged reduced timetables as an exclusionary measure on children.  It may make children feel unwanted by the school community, they may be perceived as different by their peers, they may stop seeing school as a positive place and they may even drop out of school.  It can also be very disruptive for family life.  If parents expect their child to be in school for six or seven hours but have to pick up the child after one hour, that changes the family dynamic.<\/p><p>What do we believe is needed?  In our view, national policy and guidelines need to be developed that set the following out clearly: what a reduced timetable is; the exceptional circumstances in which it is permissible for schools to use reduced timetables; the circumstances in which it is not permissible for a school to do so; the information schools must provide to guardians, parents and children about reduced timetables; the procedures schools must follow when seeking to place a child on a reduced timetable, including the process for engaging with the child&rsquo;s parents and the children themselves; and the procedures for recording and reporting any event to another organisation.  Time limits should be a part of that and review times should be put in place quickly.  At the last meeting last week, the joint management board talked about a two-week limit.  The national policy and guidelines must also set out the procedures schools must follow to facilitate guardians and children to raise concerns and complain about the reduced timetable and to use the appeals process.  That is standard and fair justice.<\/p><p> In this regard, we suggest that consideration should be given to providing appropriate statutory underpinning for the use of reduced timetables.  In addition, further attention needs to be given to monitoring the use of reduced timetables nationally.  In this regard, I note the current absence of data, including data to clarify the extent to which the practice of reduced timetables is being used by schools; the number of children who are being placed on reduced timetables and the groups of children that are more likely to be placed on reduced timetables.  As we are looking to see whether there is a discrimination happening, we need to know those figures.<\/p><p> I acknowledge the huge efforts that have been made by teachers to balance the rights of all children within schools in those circumstances.  I have met the special needs principals who are putting huge efforts into this as well.  Where it is the case that schools are using reduced timetables as a behaviour management intervention, attention needs to be given to strengthening the supports available to schools through the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, the national behaviour support service, the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, and all the other auxiliary professions mentioned by Ms Hanahoe, such as occupational therapy, OT, speech and language therapy, SLT, the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, and counselling.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019061300002#N00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Muldoon","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560380400,"counter":1155,"content":"<p>On behalf of Tusla, I thank the committee for this opportunity to address it on the matter of reduced timetables.  Tusla's educational welfare service, EWS, which I represent, supports every child and young person&rsquo;s right to education and the right of every child to attend for the full school day unless exempted for exceptional reasons.  The key legislation related to school attendance, as referenced by Deputy Thomas Byrne a few minutes ago, is outlined in the Education (Welfare) Act 2000.  In order to assist schools to comply with their obligations under this legislation, the National Educational Welfare Board, which preceded the Tusla educational welfare service, along with Tusla, have provided two resource booklets to schools, namely, Developing a Code of Behaviour: Guidelines for Schools, which was issued in 2008, and; Developing the Statement of Strategy for School Attendance, which was issued to all schools in 2015.  Hard copies of these have been issued to all schools and soft copies are available online.<br\/><br\/>Under the Education (Welfare) Act 2000, schools are obliged to submit reports on school attendance to the educational welfare service in the following four key circumstances: if a student has been suspended for six or more consecutive days; if a student has reached 20 days' cumulative absence during the course of a school year; if a principal is concerned about a student&rsquo;s attendance, a decision which a principal can make at any stage or if the board of management of a school intends to expel a student.<br\/><br\/>Guidance has been provided to schools on reduced timetables and suspensions.  This refers to the question Deputy Thomas Byrne just asked and I will quote from both of these guidelines which say the following:<\/p><blockquote>Exclusion of a student for part of the school day, as a sanction, or asking parents to keep a child from school, as a sanction, is a suspension.  Any exclusion imposed by the school is a suspension, and should follow the Guidelines relating to suspension.<\/blockquote> <p>That has been clear in both of those guidelines since 2008.<br\/><br\/>Under section 29 of the Education Act 1998, parents have the right to appeal any suspension and Tusla's educational welfare service is available to advise and support parents should they wish to make such an appeal.  Tusla educational welfare service is aware that reduced timetables are being used in some schools but our awareness, like other witnesses, is informed by anecdotal information, information from representative groups and information from parents who contact us seeking support with their child.  There is a lack of hard data available to gauge the extent of the use of reduced timetables, as in many cases, as said previously, it appears to be unrecorded and unreported.<br\/><br\/>We recognise that as some other witnesses have said, schools face many complex needs on a daily basis and Tusla educational welfare service is aware that in certain exceptional circumstances, the use of a reduced timetable may be beneficial for a student.  However, any such arrangements should be short-term in nature, have regular scheduled reviews, be in the best interest of the student, have an accompanying education plan, have an accompanying plan for full integration and be agreed by the school, the parents, the guardians and the student.<br\/><br\/>Tusla educational welfare service is working with our partners in education and our parent Department to address the issue of reduced timetables.  We have prepared a proposed response, which we can share with members later.

I want to open by stating clearly that the Department&rsquo;s position is that each and every child has a right to education, to enable him or her to live a full life and to realise his or her potential.  The Education Act 1998 sets out the function of the Minister to provide for education.  The Act places a responsibility on boards of management to manage schools for the benefit of all students and provide an appropriate education utilising the resources made available by the State.<\/p> <p>  The position of the Department of Education and Skills is that all pupils who are enrolled in a school should attend for the full school day, unless exempted from doing so in exceptional circumstances.  Reduced timetables should not be used as a behavioural management technique, or as a de facto suspension or expulsion, nor does provision exist for the use of reduced timetables for particular cohorts of pupils.  Where schools apply a shorter school day in relation to a child, such arrangements should only be put in place in exceptional circumstances in order, for example, to assist a pupil to return to school, where he or she has been experiencing an absence due to a medical or mental health-related condition.  Any such arrangement should be a transitionary arrangement, which is designed to assist the reintegration of a pupil to a school environment.  In making such arrangements, school authorities should be mindful of the best interests of the child and of the child's right to a full school day.<\/p> <p>  Early intervention and whole school approaches are the most important strategy in managing emotional and behavioural difficulties.  The Department has put in place a suite of resources, including special education teachers and special needs assistants, to support the inclusion of pupils with special educational needs or behavioural issues.  The National Council for Special Education and the National Educational Psychological Service provide training and guidance to schools around the inclusion of pupils with special educational needs, including around the management of behaviours that challenge.<\/p> <p>  The Department recognises that this is a complex issue and is investing heavily in supporting children with special educational needs, with &euro;1.9 billion being spent in 2019.  Since 2011, the number of special education teachers has increased by 37% to more than 13,400.  Provision for up to 15,950 special needs assistants in total has been made for 2019, an increase of 51% since 2011.  The Department also provides a number of resources to DEIS schools and funds the DEIS programme to the tune of &euro;125 million.  The DEIS programme supports attendance and retention, including the home school community liaison scheme, which is part of Tusla&rsquo;s integrated educational welfare service, comprising the school completion programme, and the statutory educational welfare service.<\/p> <p>  The Department of Education and Skills is aware that the Traveller representative groups have highlighted inappropriate usage of reduced timetables in the context of poor educational outcomes.  The Department is committed to working with Traveller and Roma groups to achieve educational outcomes that are equal to those of the rest of the population and a number of initiatives are in place to try to address the current gap.  I wish to assure the committee and those present that the Department of Education and Skills is working with Tusla educational and welfare service and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs to support schools, with a view to ensuring that the use of reduced timetables is limited only to exceptional circumstances where it is necessary.  To that end, we are looking at an assessment of the data which are available and are working towards producing joint guidelines, which will clarify the sort of situations referred to Ms Hanahoe here, which may be appropriate.  That process will involved consultation with stakeholders.  I assure the committee that we are addressing this issue in conjunction with our colleagues in Tusla.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019061300002#O00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Cregg"},{"type":"speech","time":1560380400,"counter":1158,"content":"<p>The position of the Department of Education and Skills is that a reduced timetable should not be used as a behavioural management technique or as a de facto suspension or expulsion.  How has the Department checked?  Is Ms Cregg telling me that the Department believes schools are only using reduced timetables in exceptional circumstances?  Is the Department aware that Traveller representative groups have highlighted inappropriate use of reduced timetables?  Is that the only source of the Department's awareness?  It is shocking that the groups have had to bring that to the attention of the Department.  Many others are suffering due to abuse of the reduced timetable option.  When did the Department last communicate with schools to clarify the position that it should only arise in exceptional circumstances?  How has the Department been checking that it is only being used in exceptional circumstances?<\/p> <p>  Tusla has outlined how guidance has been provided to schools to the effect that the exclusion of a student for part of the school day as a sanction or asking a parent to keep a child from school as a sanction amounts to a suspension.  The Department maintains the measure cannot be used as a de facto suspension but yet guidance has been provided to schools that a reduced timetable amounts in fact to a suspension.  Can the Department explain the position?  Either it is happening or it is not.  If it is, how many section 29 applications have been made?  How many parents have appealed such moves?  My fear is that parents are not being informed.  I believe parents of the most vulnerable and of students from disadvantaged areas who are being subjected to reduced timetables are not aware of their rights.  I believe they are unaware of how to challenge such a measure.  What are we doing for parents to ensure they can advocate properly for the right of their children to education?  What supports are in place to ensure that children are getting their right to education?<\/p> <p>  Does the Department check what happens when a parent disagrees?  What if a parent disagrees but then the child is put out?  What happens then?  Are children being put on reduced timetables against the wishes of their parents?  Why is the operation of reduced timetables in schools not included in whole-school evaluation of management, leadership and learning, WSE-MLL, inspections?  I understand it is not because I asked the question two weeks ago.  How easy would it be to add a question on this when an inspector comes for three or four days to a school?  An inspector could ask whether a school operates a reduced timetable and ask for all the facts, including how the students go on the reduced timetable.  The students and parents are surveyed as part of the WSE-MLL inspections.  Why not add a question to those surveys?  When inspectors meet the boards of management as part of the WSE-MLL process, are board members asked how many reduced timetables they have approved and why?  Have inspectors formed the view that all the members of the board of management are okay with the measure?  Are they simply going with the wishes of the principal?  How well informed are board members on this?<\/p> <p>  What is the plan now?  The Minister has said he is not happy with this but we need more than that.  The Department has assured us it is working with Tusla with a view to ensuring that the use of reduced timetables is limited only to those exceptional circumstances where it is necessary.  What does that mean?  Can the Department break that down for me?  What are we going to see?  What is the plan?  How is the Department going to address it and stop this practice?  How is the Department going to support principals like Ms Hanahoe, who has spoken of a health and safety danger?  Ms Hanahoe has outlined how there is danger with the behaviour that she is trying to manage in her school.  That is unfair on students and principals and it is not safe.  What is the Department putting in place?  What is the greater plan?  For violent and aggressive outbursts there has to be a better option than reduced timetables.  I simply do not understand how the Department has been blind and deaf to all of this.  It fell to us to shine this light.  The best thing that has happened is that the light is being shone on this.  Did it really take until June 2019 to shine a light on the use and misuse of reduced timetables?  Did it take this long to shine the light on the dire need to resource our teachers, principals and schools to provide the education to which every child has a right?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019061300002#P00100","speaker":"1242"},{"type":"speech","time":1560380400,"counter":1159,"content":"<p>I agree with Deputy Catherine Martin.  This committee has uncovered an illegality that is ongoing.  We need to hold further public hearings.  I will be suggesting that Mr. Hislop, the chief inspector, comes in.  We need to bring back Ms Mary Byrne and her colleagues as well because not only has the Department been deaf to this but it has been warned.  It was specifically stated by Ms Byrne today that in 2012 and 2016, the Department was warned about this.  Clearly, it has done nothing except issue the legal position, which is that it is not acceptable.  The Department has stated that clearly on the record on every occasion.  In fairness to Ms Cregg, who is relatively new in this role, she took the hardest line on this issue.  She takes the view that it should simply not be happening at all.  In practice, that is not what is happening in schools.  Children are being denied their legal and constitutional rights on a daily basis.  By the way, if anyone is watching - I imagine there are people watching - my advice is to ask for the decision in writing from principals.  Oftentimes, according to colleagues throughout the country, when a parent asks for an announcement in writing of the reduced hours, it simply does not happen.  It is not acceptable that parents are getting telephone calls.<\/p> <p>  We need to keep on this because there are two sides to it.  The first is that this should not happen.  The second is that to prevent it from happening, we need the resources to be put in place.<\/p> <p>  I have great respect for the Ombudsman for Children but I do not think he has hit the nail on the head on this issue.  I believe this is an illegality and it must stop.  A harder line from the Ombudsman for Children would be helpful.  Dr. Muldoon has been clear but he has not been as clear as the Department or the National Council for Special Education.  The Ombudsman for Children is an independent officer so it is not my job to tell him his role.  However, if the Department is saying this should not happen at all except where there is illness and we know that it is happening from the groups, then I would certainly encourage the Ombudsman for Children to take a fresh look at this.  The committee needs to hold further public hearings on this to get to the bottom of it.  The resources issue is obviously the big elephant in the room but the Constitution provides guarantees.  The only right that encompasses resources in the Constitution is the right to primary education, and second level education follows from that.  The right to primary education implies resources.  There is nothing else in the Constitution.  There is no right to healthcare in the Constitution but there is a right to education.  I accept the point made about cuts for Travellers.  We in the committee hear that point.  The point is not aired all the time but we hear about resources for children with special needs all the time and we hear about the DEIS system.  This is an illegality and I believe we should perhaps ask the Oireachtas law service to look at this from a legal point of view.  We should get in the chief inspector, the Minister and the NCSE to go through in more detail the advice given.  If that could be provided to us, it would be useful.  Ms Byrne said that she was advised on the matter in 2012 and 2016 and I would be interested to hear more about that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019061300002#P00200","speaker":"1225"},{"type":"speech","time":1560380400,"counter":1160,"content":"<p>At the outset I wish to apologise to the witnesses.

It is failing the schools and teachers as well.<\/p> <p>  I can see that in many ways the finger is being pointed towards the schools.  That is unfair.  The schools do not have the necessary resources to address this issue.  Ms Hanahoe made a presentation earlier.  She drew a picture for me outlining the problem.

On the other hand, Ms Keane told us that based on the information in her survey, the educational welfare officer was only aware of 27% of cases, which clearly is a breach of what is supposed to happen.  Are schools informed that they are supposed to report to the National Educational Welfare Board on suspensions?  That indicates a breakdown.<\/p> <p>  I wish to ask the departmental officials the question Mr. Harris raised earlier about data.

They all agreed with the delegates present that it should only be in exceptional circumstances and as a last resort.  However, that does not seem to be the reality.  The policy is that it should only happen in very special cases, but in practice it is much more commonly used.  Again, that shows a breakdown.  Will the Department insert an extra field into the requirements of the primary online database, POD, returns schools make to oblige them to identify reduced timetables?  I am not sure if suspensions are already covered; they probably are.  This would mean that they would have to return the information.<\/p> <p>  Ms Cregg mentioned that guidelines were being drafted.

It is very useful to know that the NCSE is undertaking a pilot project, but I am conscious that it is only for children with special needs and that other groups are also isolated and excluded.  Could a pilot scheme be introduced to address the needs of other children who are excluded?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019061300002#Q00300","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560380400,"counter":1164,"content":"<p>The Department reinforces that this is a complex issue that needs to be addressed across the board.

In its inspection of a school the inspectorate seeks to support it by making a quality assessment of the teaching and learning and the learning experience and outcomes.  That is the context in which the school inspection takes place.  In DEIS school inspections schools are asked how many times reduced timetables are used, but that is a relatively recent development.  When the issue arises in schools, inspectors are able to challenge whether it is the best process to see if everything else has been followed before it is put in place.  From the school inspections where it has been raised, it appears that the process has been followed, but that is in a school as opposed to an individual context.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019061300002#Q00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Cregg"},{"type":"speech","time":1560380400,"counter":1165,"content":"<p>What process?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019061300002#Q00500","speaker":"1225"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560380400,"counter":1166,"content":"<p>It is in the context of whether resources have been applied appropriately and whether the resources available from the Department have been put in place.

We heard some of those details from Ms Byrne this morning.  Our approach in the Department since 2012 has been very much about putting the resources in place.  Those resources include additional teachers, special needs assistants, SNAs, and a variety of supports.  Special classes and the number of people on the ground have increased substantially.  Almost 20% of the total education Vote is now being used on special education.  That is the thrust of the way that we intend to go.<\/p> <p>  Mention was also made of therapeutic supports in schools.  A pilot is under way and that will be evaluated.  If the evaluation is positive, the intention is to plan for a more extensive roll-out into the school system so that all schools will have access to therapeutic support in areas such as occupational therapy, speech and language support and behavioural support.  We recognise that there are gaps and we will continue to address that through evidence-informed policymaking.  We will evaluate as we go through the process.<\/p> <p>  This debate and discussion are very informative and helpful from our point of view.  It is good that we know what is happening on the ground.

One thing to take away from today's meeting is that there is a child in Ireland who has been on a reduced timetable for two years.

First, schools are aware that they have an obligation to report suspensions.  It is very clear in the legislation and it is also very clear in the guidelines.  As recently as 2015, those guidelines were issued to all schools because they were requested to develop and submit a statement of strategy on attendance.  As of today, only 86% of schools have submitted those statements, despite my Department having two staff working full-time reminding people about that.  I will state to Senator Gallagher that while we do not want to point the finger at schools, and the vast majority of schools do try their absolute best to comply, a small percentage do not.<\/p> <p>  The reporting of suspensions happens at the end of the school year.  If, therefore, we are to do anything about intervening, that is not going to work.  To follow up on Ms Cregg's point, what we are proposing to do is based on the fact that, at the moment, if a school intends to expel a student, it has to submit information on such an intention to Tusla before doing that.  That information has to come into us and be logged in our office before our educational welfare officers are able to intervene.  We have a high success rate.  Last year, more than 300 intentions to expel resulted in only 180 expulsions.  We managed to stop about 120 of those intended expulsions by working with the school and the families.  We are proposing something similar in regard to reduced timetables.  That is despite the fact that I have clearly stated that a reduced timetable is a suspension.  We are going to be developing a reporting form that schools will have to submit to us if there is an intention to put a student on a reduced timetable.  Whether that is going to flush out all of this is another question.<\/p> <p>  It is clear from listening to all of the evidence, both the previous day and today, that much of what is happening is underground.  It is not being recorded, not being reported and not being written down.  We will also take seriously our responsibility to inform all schools and parents.  I will be proposing that in the first term next year, we get an information leaflet out to all parents regarding this issue.  We are also redeveloping our website.  It will have a frequently asked questions, FAQ, section where parents can log in and see their rights in respect of reduced timetables.  I have also just finished doing some work with the Children's Rights Alliance.  It is updating its information sheets for parents and students and they will also be available.  There will, therefore, be multiple sources available for parents.<\/p> <p>  On reporting mechanisms, I suggested that a referral form be put in place rather than the end of year report.  Schools will have access to that and they will be obliged to submit that form to us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019061300002#R02100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Noel Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1560380400,"counter":1188,"content":"<p>Can they submit parts of it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019061300002#R02200","speaker":"1225"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560380400,"counter":1189,"content":"<p>Not really.

While the population of special schools constitutes only 1.4% of the student population, they account for 28% and 22% of primary school expulsions and suspensions, respectively.  There is evidence to suggest that suspensions and expulsions are more common in the case of children with special needs.

We must remember that in its inspections, the school inspectorate only asks whether reduced timetables are used in special schools or DEIS schools, which suggests the presence of discrimination.

Cuba&rsquo;s relations with the EU have improved significantly in recent years, forming part of a general pattern of increased openness on the part of Cuba to re-engage with international partners. <\/p><p>This agreement is robust and comprehensive, consisting of three main pillars, namely political dialogue, co-operation and sectoral policy dialogue, and trade and trade co-operation.  The core aim of the political dialogue and co-operation agreement, PDCA, is to open channels of dialogue and co-operation between the EU and Cuba in order to assist the modernisation of the Cuban economy and society, strengthen human rights and democracy, and work together to achieve the sustainable development goals.  The agreement  provides for a comprehensive dialogue between the EU and Cuba on a range of policy areas, including human rights; small arms and light weapons; disarmament and non-proliferation; sustainable development; terrorism; serious crimes of international concern; unilateral coercive measures; combating illicit drugs; and combating racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance.  The agreement also provides for the development of co-operation, including on political and legal issues such as democracy, human rights, good governance, justice, citizens&rsquo; security and migration, as well as on social, environmental, economic and developmental issues.  Most of the agreement has been provisionally applied since 1 November 2017.  However, its full application requires ratification by all the EU member states once they have completed their own internal legal procedures. <\/p><p>Since establishing diplomatic relations with Cuba in 1999, Ireland&rsquo;s relationship with Cuba has grown significantly.  The visit of President Higgins to the island in 2017 was a high point in our relations and facilitated the further strengthening of ties between our two countries.  This visit also highlighted the interesting shared history between the two countries, with Irish emigrants having contributed to the economic, cultural and political evolution of Cuba over the years, and Cuban leaders having been influenced by the leaders of the Irish revolutionary and independence movements. <\/p><p>Cuba opened an embassy in Dublin in 2001 and Ireland&rsquo;s ambassador to Mexico is accredited to Cuba.  I welcome the ambassador here today.  The recent opening of two new missions in Latin America, in Colombia and Chile, has significantly increased our footprint in the region and has allowed our embassy in Mexico to dedicate greater resources to developing our relationship with Cuba.  The year 2019 marks the 20th anniversary of relations between the two countries and is being celebrated with a series of cultural events organised by our respective ambassadors. <\/p><p>Ireland and Cuba are like-minded on a number of multilateral issues such as disarmament, non-proliferation, gender equality and climate change.  We signed a memorandum of understanding on political dialogue with Cuba in 2015, and have since engaged in three rounds of bilateral political consultations, where such issues of mutual concern were discussed.<\/p><p>It is also important to acknowledge concerns about the challenging human rights situation in Cuba.  Ireland is keenly aware of the difficult situation that exists for human rights defenders and civil society actors in Cuba.  Ireland, together with the EU and our fellow member states, continues to encourage reform within Cuba, particularly in the areas of freedom of expression, the right to peaceful assembly, the protection of open civil society space and a free, fair and open judicial system. The EU and Cuba have an annual dialogue in the area of human rights and this agreement provides for further engagement in this extremely important area.  Encouraging steps have been taken by Cuba, including in the reform of the constitution, approved by referendum after a process of public consultation.  Among other reforms, the new constitution establishes the presumption of innocence in criminal proceedings and the right to<i>habeas corpus<\/i>, and extends a ban on discrimination, including on the basis of sexuality.  The PDCA recognises the potential contribution of civil society and specifically provides for further co-operation between the EU and Cuba in this area and encourages the active participation of civil society in the formulation and execution of development co-operation policies. <\/p><p>I thank the select committee for the opportunity to present this motion.  My assessment and that of the Department is that the PDCA provides a solid framework and welcome opportunity to strengthen both EU-Cuba and Ireland-Cuba relations, providing for closer economic and political ties, and it also helps to provide the framework for further constructive dialogue on the many human rights issues.  <\/p><p>I hope the select committee will support the motion, and that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann may approve the terms of this agreement so that Ireland may proceed to ratify it in the near future.  I am happy to take any questions members may have at this point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2019061300002#F00300","speaker":"1337"},{"type":"speech","time":1560380400,"counter":1203,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State and call Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2019061300002#F00400","speaker":"1270"},{"type":"speech","time":1560380400,"counter":1204,"content":"<p>This is a significant date in Ireland-Cuba relations.

It is the culmination of all of that work that we are at this particular step today.  This is an important agreement, as is establishment of Ireland-Cuba relations for 20 years and the celebrations there will be to mark that.  The agreement is quite comprehensive in respect of the three pillars on which it will work.<\/p> <p>  I have been lucky to be able to visit Cuba a number of times and I have seen first hand what life is like there.<\/p><p>We can learn much from Cuba in particular areas.

We now need to see the concrete steps as to exactly what this will mean for both Ireland and Cuba.  There is great potential for further engagement between Ireland and Cuba, particularly on trade and I know some small groups are working on that.  However, the elephant in the room is the United States.  I am not sure how much progress can be made while that is not being addressed.  I have asked the T&aacute;naiste many questions on the matter.  I will quote from his reply to the most recent one: \"Ireland believes that the embargo serves no constructive purpose and that the lifting of the embargo would facilitate an opening of the island&rsquo;s economy to the benefit of its people.\"<\/p><p> For this agreement to really bring about progress and more positive effects for both Ireland and particularly Cuba, that needs to be addressed.  How can we trade with a country if there is an embargo and if there are also banking issues?  How can we apply pressure to get that blockade lifted?  We know it was lifted for a short time under President Obama and it has now come back again.  It is causing so many difficulties for people in Cuba.  How successful can this agreement be while the blockade is in place?  That is not to take from the significance of the agreement. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2019061300002#F00500","speaker":"1291","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560380400,"counter":1206,"content":"<p>I agree with the Deputy and I reiterate the T&aacute;naiste's points that we believe this economic embargo serves no constructive purpose.  The embargo seriously hampers our own economic activity as well as that of the European Union and any progress that Cuba itself can make.  We have consistently supported the annual resolution put forward by Cuba, most recently for the 27th consecutive time.  One might argue that obviously has not changed things.  However, as a united European Union, we all need to continue to reiterate and consistently support that position at the UN General Assembly and wherever we have an opportunity to raise this concern.  Obviously there were conversations most recently with the President of the United States of America.  We need to use those channels, our strong relationship with the US, to raise these concerns at every stage we can.<\/p> <p>  As the Deputy has said, if the embargo is not lifted, there is only so much this overall agreement can do.  I think it still allows us to do a considerable amount and creates opportunities for continued dialogue at every level of the Government in terms of human rights and in terms of their own economic activity.

There was a time when Cuba was mentioned that people would say we do not have anything to do with that part of the world.<\/p><p>This is a relatively small independent country that is developing and going its own way.  As can be seen from the figures, it has a small number of unemployed compared with Ireland.  It has a population about three times ours, but its GDP <i>per capita<\/i>is only one ninth of ours.  For countries like Cuba coming from where it came from in a relatively short period, a country like ours, which is totally independent, should use whatever influence we have to bring and help them along and to support their development.  The average person living in Cuba went through periods of living under a very strict regime.  It is at times like this when it is developing that it needs friends and support.  It is important for an independent country like Ireland with no hard views one way or the other to support it.<\/p><p>I recommend that a small delegation of maybe a couple of Members of this Parliament should visit these countries at this stage of their development and report back so that we can find out at first hand what is happening.

Like others, I fully support the motion on Ireland's ratification of the EU-Cuba Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreement.  Unfortunately, the process seems to have taken longer than anticipated and we are one of the last EU countries to ratify the agreement.  The Minister of State might explain the background there.  It is welcome that we are discussing it today and hopefully it will receive broad if not unanimous support in this committee and in the D&aacute;il.<\/p> <p>  When people talk about the history of Cuba, I think about what was there before the independent Cuban state that exists now.  I think of the Batista regime when it was a playground for the rich.  The Mafia was involved, people were downtrodden and poor.  Literacy was extremely low in the local population.  That has all been transformed.  For many of us it is a shining beacon in that part of the world to see how a small country, despite all the pressure from a near neighbour, has developed.  Its education and health systems are examples for all of us around the world, no matter how developed our countries are.  The extraordinary thing for Cuba is that for all the tragedies around the world, it has sent its people in, for example in respect of the apartheid regime, and the invasion of Angola, when the Cubans stood with the South African people.  The recent peace process in Colombia probably would not have happened without the facilitation of the Cuban Government.  We have a lot that we can learn.  I refer to hurricanes and so on and to the doctors who are sent into the shanty towns and the poor areas.  There is enormous positivity.  Anyone who travels to Cuba meets the people.  It is friendly and safe.  It ticks all the boxes for a holiday.  Society is free and open and people feel comfortable.  Anyone I know who has travelled to Cuba wants to go back.  That is a great message to be sending out.  <\/p> <p>  There have been long connections between Ireland and Cuba and I hope they continue.  The  EU-Cuba Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreement is the first bilateral agreement between Cuba and the EU.  The EU is Cuba's second most important trading partner, its biggest external investor and the source of one third of the 3.5 million tourists visiting the island every year.  It is important that we have this agreement to build on and improve these ties.  However, to date, Ireland's trading relationship with Cuba is relatively poor.  This morning we have an opportunity to vastly improve this.  I urge the Government to investigate possible avenues where we can improve our trading ties with Cuba.  As the agreement will soon be ratified by all EU member states and will come into force, does the Minister of State know of any plans to send an Irish trade delegation to Cuba?<\/p> <p>  I refer to the issue Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan raised.  I have talked to some companies that wanted to invest in Cuba and increase those ties but there has been a monetary difficulty.  Has the EU discussed this?  How are they going to get around the US embargo?  It is the biggest difficulty for trade with Cuba.  There is difficulty for ships travelling with goods and so on.  I commend the Irish Government on consistently supporting the Cuban motion at the UN condemning this illegal blockade.  As the Minister of State said, it is the 27th time.  That is something we can be proud of as a country.  We have close ties with the US but, at crucial times, it is important that we stand up and speak up for another small nation.  Under the Obama Administration, some moves were made to loosen the blockade but the measures did not go far enough.  They probably came too late in the term of the Administration as well.  Progress was made towards a broad change, however.  There was a message that change was coming.  The famous handshake at the funeral of Nelson Mandela was the right message, not only in the context of the funeral but also more generally between the US Administration and the Cuban Government.<\/p> <p>  Unfortunately, the Trump Administration has tightened the blockade to levels never seen before.  This includes unilaterally imposed measures.  The US national security adviser, John Bolton, was speaking in Miami on the 58th anniversary of the failed Bay of Pigs invasion.  Miami is an important swing state and it is part of the difficulty of US Administrations that they are in thrall to this state, particularly to those who left Cuba.  Mr. Bolton confirmed that the US would fully implement Title 3 of the Helms-Burton Act, which allows Cuban-Americans to sue foreign companies if they trade with Cuba.  That is one of the difficult barriers that we will have to overcome.  It completely contravenes the commonly accepted rules of international law.  The US Government must not be allowed to impose extraterritorial measures and should immediately lift its illegal blockade.  That is what we are publicly saying and putting into law by passing this trade agreement.  Has the Minister of State discussed these extraterritorial measures with her European counterparts and is she working with other European governments to challenge the US Administration on these measures?  This is the next challenge that is going to face us.  Most important, trade involves finance.  On measures that penalise or make it more difficult to trade with Cuba, we need to signpost what they are and try to overcome them collectively.  I welcome the fact that it is being discussed.  I am a bit concerned that we were such a long time coming to it and would appreciate if the Minister of State can give us the background on that.  There is strong support in Ireland for this agreement.  Anyone who has travelled to the area is impressed by the quality of life of Cuban people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2019061300002#H00500","speaker":"1309"},{"type":"speech","time":1560380400,"counter":1218,"content":"<p>We would all agree that we can learn something from each other.  We can certainly learn from Cuba and they can learn from us.  That is why it is important not just for Irish-Cuban relations but for EU-Cuban relations as well.  On the timelines, it is true that 20 other member states have ratified this already.  There are still some that have not, so we are not exactly last.  One of the biggest challenges has been Brexit.  There is no point in saying otherwise.  There has been a delay in terms of administration and staff in being able to process this.  At the same time, that has not prevented the actual application of this agreement, which has been in place for some time now.  A number of informal dialogues have been taking place since as far back as 2015 in anticipation of this agreement, particularly in the area of human rights.  The most recent one took place in 2018, in October I think, with the anticipation of this being agreed by all member states.  We have moved it along as quickly as we can.  There were other challenges in front of us; there was no other reason.<\/p><p>There are no plans that I am aware of at the moment but this is something we can raise with Enterprise Ireland.  The Global Ireland 2025 strategy is focusing on doubling our global footprint across the globe.  This region is of particular significance for us as well so if there are particular companies that have an interest, Enterprise Ireland would be very interested and happy to engage in that regard.  I believe a number of small Irish companies are actively pursuing opportunities in the Cuban market but as mentioned by many Deputies there are many challenges in terms of the embargo and also the Helms-Burton Act.  That is an issue we have raised, and particularly the T&aacute;naiste, at the foreign affairs committee.  The High Representative, Federica Mogherini, has raised that also in our discussions at the United Nations.  We have been asking for the US to reinstate the waiver that had previously been in place for six months at a time.  It was then reduced to 45 days and it is no longer in place now.  That is hindering matters and, as far as we are concerned, is contrary to international European law.  We are continually raising that issue to see if the waiver can be reinstated as quickly as possible.<\/p><p> Overall, relations between the EU, Ireland and Cuba have improved significantly in recent years.  This agreement shows a willingness and an openness for Cuba to re-engage on specific issues and areas of concern.  This gives us the platform to do that.  Also, the 20-year anniversary gives us a particular emphasis this year and an opportunity at home and in Cuba to see how we can strengthen that, not just in terms of trade or economically but culturally and otherwise.<\/p><p> I thank the Deputies for their support.

My primary focus in this address will be on business insurance.  I am very conscious of the difficulties that the cost and availability of insurance are creating for many businesses and voluntary and community groups.  I can understand the frustration that many people have with the existing position.  I believe that, with the objective evidence provided by the Personal Injuries Commission benchmarking report on the higher than average award levels for soft tissue injuries in the country, we have a solid basis for addressing these difficulties through the enactment of the Judicial Council Bill.  I will talk about that in more detail later.<\/p> <p>  The cost of insurance working group has made it clear from the outset that there is no single policy or legislative silver bullet to stem or reverse immediately premium price rises and that some of the necessary reforms will take time to implement.  This was also recognised by this committee in its motor insurance report.  The major constraints faced by any Government are twofold.  Award levels are the prerogative of the courts and therefore, for constitutional reasons, the Judiciary cannot be directed as to the levels that should be applied.  Second, pricing levels are a commercial matter for insurance companies and are determined based on the risks that they are willing to accept.  For legal reasons, the Government cannot interfere in such matters as this is prohibited by the EU Solvency II directive.  It was recognised that there was much the Government could do to improve the general environment within which insurers operate as well as laying the ground for a more long-term transformation of the insurance market through tackling issues such as award levels.  This is the context within which the work of the cost of insurance working group needs to be considered.<\/p> <p>  There has been significant progress in the implementation of the two cost of insurance working group reports.  Examples include addressing the personal injuries framework in Ireland through the establishment of the Personal Injuries Commission, and its subsequent two reports, the second of which benchmarked award levels for soft tissue injuries and made recommendations to address gaps that exist between this jurisdiction and others.  Another is the commencement by the Law Reform Commission of the examination of the possibility of capping awards in respect of some or all categories of personal injuries through legislation.  Insurance fraud is being tackled through closer co-operation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the insurance industry on foot of the fraud round table's work and the recent decision by the Garda Commissioner to develop a divisional focus on insurance fraud, which will be guided by the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau, GNECB, which will also train garda&iacute; throughout the country on investigating insurance fraud, as well as the recent success under Operation Coatee, which targets insurance related criminality.<\/p> <p>  The Government has made several legislative changes which are significant in the insurance reform debate and called for by stakeholders.  These include increasing transparency around the cost of private motor insurance through the establishment of the national claims information database, NCID, in the Central Bank as well as the Courts Service confirming that it will publish a more detailed breakdown of awards in personal injury cases in its annual reports; increasing the effectiveness of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board through the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) Act 2019; making it easier for businesses and insurers to challenge cases where fraud or exaggeration is suspected through amendments to sections 8 and 14 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004; and providing certainty to policyholders and insurers through the reform of the insurance compensation fund.<\/p> <p>  The committee should note that I look forward to the finalisation of the work of the Central Statistics Office, CSO, on a price index for business insurance as well as the Central Bank's work potentially to extend the scope of the NCID to include employer and public liability insurance, which at this point I believe it should.  I will also look at how we can speed up the work related to the development of a functioning fraud database, recognising that data protection concerns must be addressed before other issues such as the governance or location of such a database can be decided.  I believe that the cost of insurance working group actions taken to date have helped to create a much more receptive atmosphere for what we are trying to achieve with the reform of the area of insurance and personal injuries litigation, since there is a much greater understanding of the depth, nature and extent of the underlying problems and much greater support for what needs to be done to address them.<\/p> <p>  I believe that these actions have had a significant impact on private motor insurance.  CSO figures from May 2019, which is a small change from the script circulated, which indicated April, show that the price of motor insurance is now 24.5%, rather than 24.4%, lower than the July 2016 peak, almost three years ago.  My colleagues in Government and I are determined to continue working to ensure that these positive pricing trends can be extended to other forms of insurance, including those relevant to businesses.<\/p> <p>  I will address the issue which I believe is key in the next phase of work of the cost of insurance working group.  Bringing the levels of personal injury damages awarded in this country more in line with those awarded in other jurisdictions is the single most essential challenge which must be overcome if there is to be a sustainable reduction in insurance costs.  The Personal Injuries Commission has highlighted the significant differential between award levels in this country and England and Wales in particular, and has made a number of recommendations to address the issue, including the establishment of a judicial council to compile guidelines for appropriate general damages for various types of personal injury.<\/p> <p>  I believe that this awards gap needs to be closed significantly and I am working with the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, to ensure that this happens at the earliest opportunity through the enactment of the Judicial Council Bill, which completed Committee Stage in the Seanad in April.  Since then, the Government has approved the drafting of amendments for Report Stage in the Seanad, which will provide for the establishment of a personal injuries guidelines committee, the sole purpose of which will be to develop guidelines for various types of personal injury to be adopted by the judicial council.  The amendments are subject to formal legal drafting by our colleagues in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and I hope that they will be agreed on Report Stage in the Seanad shortly.  I have been informed that the Seanad will take this next Thursday.  The co-operation of all Members of the Oireachtas will be vital in getting the Bill enacted as soon as possible.  I know that I can count already on support from members of this committee.<\/p> <p>  It is to be hoped that this, along with the work that the Law Reform Commission has commenced, will result in the lowering of award levels.  If this were to happen, I would expect the insurance industry to take account of such reductions in its pricing.  Mr. Justice Nicholas Kearns, former President of the High Court and the chairperson of the Personal Injuries Commission, noted in the foreword of the commission's second report that insurance industry representatives on the Personal Injuries Commission repeatedly stated that because award levels and associated costs accounted for the bulk of the cost of insurance, if claims costs were to come down and to be maintained at a consistent and predictable level, then premiums would also reduce accordingly.<\/p> <p>  I want to address the establishment of a dedicated Garda insurance fraud unit.  It is important to clarify that the recommendation from the cost of insurance working group was to explore the potential for further co-operation between the insurance sector and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with regard to insurance fraud investigation.  While the issue, including the UK precedent, was explored in the report and the potential benefits were outlined, no commitment was given on this matter.  It was made clear that it was always subject to further examination and that any decision on this matter was always going to be for the Garda Commissioner.  Since my previous appearance before the committee last year, the Garda Commissioner has decided for operational reasons that a divisional focus is preferable to the establishment of a centralised insurance investigation unit.  I understand that this approach is aligned with a general divisional focused Garda model.  The Commissioner intends that the GNECB will guide divisions and provide training in the investigation of insurance fraud.  It is important to accept the expert view of the Garda Commissioner in this regard, and I am confident that this marks a key turning point in how insurance fraud will be investigated by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the future.<\/p> <p>  Aside from what we as a Government or the Oireachtas can achieve, I will address the legal profession and the insurance sector itself, which also have to play an important role in addressing the issues that some businesses are experiencing.  I have spoken in the D&aacute;il previously about the frustrations that exist among businesses and other groups regarding these two sectors.  In that respect, I met the Law Society and the Bar Council of Ireland and set out to both my belief that it was vital that they continued to give their public support and commitment to the Personal Injuries Commission's recommendations.<\/p><p>I accept the commitments which both have since made.  On the insurance side, I have put it to the industry that it needs to provide strong public commitments very soon to reflect savings to be gained from the recalibration of award levels.  In addition, it will be important for it to widen its risk horizons and to re-enter segments of the market from which it has previously exited as a sign of good faith that the claims environment should begin to stabilise once the Judicial Council Bill has been enacted.  <\/p><p> In the end, the availability and cost of insurance to some businesses will depend on the consistency and quantum of award levels.  The cost of insurance working group structure remains the best means by which to continue to achieve this objective.  The enactment of the Judicial Council Bill will also be an important step forward in this regard and I hope there will be support in the Houses to enable a speedy conclusion to this process.  In this spirit, I intend to work closely with Deputies Michael McGrath and Pearse Doherty on considering how to progress their respective insurance related Private Members' Bills, the Civil Liability and Courts (Amendment) Bill 2019 and the Consumer Insurance Contracts Bill 2017.  Along with the cumulative effects of the completed implementation of the two reports&rsquo; recommendations, this work will include views on increasing stability in the pricing of insurance for businesses and developing a more competitive insurance market overall.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019061300002#E00200","speaker":"1364","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560380400,"counter":1237,"content":"<p>With regard to the establishment of a judicial council, specifically the terms of reference for drawing up the new guidelines, how does the Minister of State envisage expediting the judicial council's review of the book of quantum?

As I said, we expect Report Stage of the Bill will be taken in the Seanad next Thursday.  I hope it will conclude the same day.  It will subsequently be moved to the D&aacute;il as quickly as possible.  I apologise for repeating myself but it was understood that the Judicial Council Bill would be completed before the end of 2018.  When it become obvious to me, prior to Christmas, that it would be delayed I targeted its completion for the end of the summer session.  I believe that target can be realised.  We can get it through the Seanad on Thursday and have it back before the D&aacute;il before the end of the summer session.  I have also requested a motion for earlier signature to allow the legislation to be enacted without delay.  The will allow the President to sign the Bill and it will then become law.  I have not done anything beyond that.  At that point, I will liaise with the Attorney General with a view to ensuring that, from the insurance side, the judicial council will be established as quickly as possible.<\/p> <p>  I should note that the Judicial Council Bill is a large Bill, which proposes the most revolutionary reorganisation of the Judiciary for decades.  While the insurance side of the legislation is receiving considerable focus and attention, it is only a small part of the Bill.  Neither I nor members of the committee can control the Bill's progress.  It will go before the Select Committee on Justice and Equality for Committee Stage debate and I expect there will be deep analysis and scrutiny.  I hope, however, that this scrutiny will not delay the passage of the Bill beyond the end of the summer session.  Having said that, if we can get it through both Houses, I will speak with the Attorney General to try to have the council established as quickly as possible.<\/p> <p>  Under the schedule I have for this initiative, we should be able to form the committee of seven judges, one from each court, and have the analysis concluded and the new guidelines in place towards the end of the year.

It is then a matter for individuals travelling to Northern Ireland or the UK to take that card with them.  The current position is that a person's insurance company will send their policyholders a green card on request.  I am not satisfied with that position as some people may not be aware that this will be a legal requirement and that the card could be requested on the side of the road in Northern Ireland or the UK.  The right thing for the insurance companies to do would be to automatically send a green card to everybody who has insured their cars.

The Minister of State is looking for the insurance companies to automatically issue green insurance cards without the insurance policyholder having to apply.  Post Brexit, companies that export to the UK will be required to have a customs registration number, known as an EORI number.  As it stands, exporters can apply for such numbers online.  From my understanding of the latest figures I have found, which run up to the end of May, approximately 84,000 businesses will need customs registration numbers, of which 46,500 have them in place.  Another 45% of exporters, approximately 37,500, do not have a number in place.  In order to prepare for the event of a no-deal Brexit at the end of October, could the Department of Finance engage with the Revenue Commissioners to automatically issue customs registration or EORI numbers to the remainder of these exporters now?  Could that measure be introduced?  It is in keeping with the Minister of State's view on the green insurance card.  To be ready for Brexit, it is critical that any company that exports - and the Revenue Commissioners indicate that there are approximately 85,000 such businesses - have EORI numbers in place.

I also welcome his remarks on my Bill which was passed on Second Stage nearly two years ago.  It was agreed at this committee that we would deal with amendments to it on Committee State in the second week of July.  As I know that the Government has issued a money message for it, I look forward to passage of the Bill into law.<\/p> <p>  In his opening statement the Minister of State said he had put it to the industry that it needed to give strong public commitments very soon to reflect savings to be gained in the recalibration of award levels.  Has he received a single commitment from it that this will happen?  We know that in 2002 the Irish Insurance Federation - Insurance Ireland's predecessor - made a very clear commitment when it outlined a list of reforms it believed were required and argued that if they were implementted, there would be a reduction in premiums by a certain percentage.  There was transparency.  I do not know if the Minister of State trusts the insurance industry, but I do not.  It is involved in price gouging and a lot of spin, bluster and distraction on the real reasons premiums are increasing.  I am not saying its issues such as the making of exaggerated claims and fraud are not real and do not need to be dealt with.  There is a need for zero tolerance in the attitude towards them, but when we see that insurance companies have increased their profits by 1,300% in one year and made a profit of nearly &euro;250 million on the backs of hard-pressed motorists and businesses that are seeing their public liability insurance premiums increase, that tells me that it is simply price gouging on the part of the industry.  Has the Minister of State received a commitment from it similar to the one received from the Irish Insurance Federation in 2002 when it stated clearly that if anti-fraud measures were to be implemented, they would result in a reduction of 2%; that if there were to be changes in the book of quantum, they would result in a 1% reduction; and that if the PIAB was to be involved, it would result in a reduction of 7.6%?  That was very clear and verifiable.  My concern is that while we need to do this in respect of the book of quantum and see An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na taking enforcing action on fraudulent claims, there is no guarantee that any of the reductions will be passed on to customers.  Past experience shows that the industry will just pocket the money.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019061300002#H00400","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1560380400,"counter":1281,"content":"<p>One thing on which I am clear is that we are doing all of this work in order that the benefit will flow to the consumer, the person paying premiums, not the insurance company.  I have made strong statements on the insurance companies.  I do not hold them in high regard.  They always win.  They are the ones who charge premiums and are in charge of the allocation of an award, if one is made.  The sector decides the methodology to be used by which smaller claims remain on an insured person's record.  They remain on an insurance company's books for a significant period of time before being settled.  The most significant issue is the level of award.  The report of the Personal Injuries Commission highlighted the fact that the difference was about four and a half times the amount.  The Department of Finance has produced an analysis that shows that it was five times the amount, while the PIAB carried out an analysis that also showed that it was almost five times the amount.  I am talking about lower awards.  The insurance sector was also represented on the Personal Injuries Commission.  On occasion after occasion, it has stated that if award levels are reduced, premiums will be reduced.  I am the person who has said to the Chairman of the committee that it should bring in representatives of the insurance companies.  This is a public forum and the committee should put that exact question to them also.  I will put it to them company by company, but that will not happen in public.  I will adopt a very hard line to ensure what Deputy Doherty spoke about will not happen, namely, that insurance companies potentially will trouser the money if the level of awards comes down and premiums stay high.  That is not what this is about.

He has made the point that he does not hold insurance companies in high regard.  The point is that 17 years ago we were able to get the insurance industry to produce a table that was very clear.  It took into account road safety, the PIAB, a reduction in the incidence of uninsured driving, the promotion of rehabilitation, the abolition of stamp duty of 2%, the reform of the courts, anti-fraud measures, the exclusion of earnings from the black economy, a reduced number of solicitors for plaintiffs, the book of quantum and repeal of the Health Act.  The industry stated that if all of this was done, it would result in a reduction in premiums of 36.35%.  We have been here before and seen motor insurance premiums increase by over 70%, according to the CSO.  The industry tells us that it was all because of Setanta.  We fixed the issues related to Setanta and the risks for insurance companies through legislation, yet we have not seen premiums drop by 70%.

I know that the figures quoted are correct on the basis of how they are presented, but the fact that the sector was losing &euro;75 million a year was the reason insurance companies were exiting the Irish market.  I remind the Deputy that, year on year, between 70% and 80% of personal injury claims involve whiplash.  As I said, there was a loss of &euro;75 million in 2016.  Make no mistake - I am not here to defend the insurance companies.

I am not saying insurance companies should not be profitable.  Of course, we need insurance companies that are profitable, but should they be making profits on the backs of drivers, businesses and those involved in community groups who are trying to run festivals?<\/p><p>No, they should not.  What they are not willing to give is a commitment that if we introduce reforms, such as those contained in the Judicial Council Bill, they will reduce premiums.  That is the problem.  They are making these profits at a time when they are stating that claims are far too high, that there is fraudulent activity, etc.  Yet, the claims were as high last year, the year before and for several years before that.  Fraudulent activity has been happening forever and a day.  I take a zero-tolerance position in respect of fraudulent activity and the Minister of State knows my position on it.  I believe strongly that we should have a centralised Garda enforcement unit.  This committee has agreed to invite the Garda Commissioner before it in order to tease out how we might look at the model he wants to deploy.  Therefore, I take a zero-tolerance approach to fraudulent claims.  However, what I do not fall for is the spin from the industry that fraudulent claims are the reason premiums are going up, or that it is the level of awards.

If we deal with fraudulent claims, if we enable the Garda enforcement action, if we are far more robust in regard to prosecution and deterring people from making fraudulent claims, I am not convinced the premiums will reduce a penny.  The core of this goes back to the point that these companies where gambling, and it was not gambling with people's premiums.  They were basically investing in the bond market with the premiums and when the returns fell, their profits fell.  They then put up prices to cover that fall.<\/p> <p>  We need to take a very tough approach.  There has been a kid-glove approach from Government, although perhaps not from the Minister of State.  Some of the Minister of State's colleagues have really let him down in a number of ways recently.

Fraud, we are told, costs the sector approximately &euro;200 million, although that is an industry figure and I do not have an actual figure.  The Deputy must remember that the vast majority of claims are legitimate and this a concern I have about something that is happening right now.  I applaud the strength with which the Deputy has consistently been opposed to fraudulent and exaggerated claims, as have I and most others also.  However, the big issue we come down to is that over &euro;2 billion was awarded to people in regard to claims, which is a huge quantity of money.  What we are trying to do is put in place a structure whereby people who are affected by a moderate incident get an moderate amount of compensation in damages to compensate them for that incident.  Again, I am talking about the lower levels of claims, not the higher levels of claims, and it is important to put that in context.  That was the nuts and bolts of what the Personal Injuries Commission report is about.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019061300002#J00400","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1560380400,"counter":1289,"content":"<p>Deputy John McGuinness took the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1560380400,"counter":1290,"content":"<p>I agree with the objective.  To take a hypothetical situation, if we pass the Judicial Council Bill and if we set up the council - there are a number of ifs - we may reach a position where that panel recommends, for example, that soft tissue injuries, such as whiplash, would be cut by half, given these make up the majority of claims in the first instance.  However, the industry is not indicating that this would result in premium reductions of X%.  There is nothing from the industry side.  Therefore, the industry has forced us into a dealing with a matter which we would deal with in any event.  If the claims are too high, they are too high.  If there are fraudulent claims, they need to be stamped out.  The problem is that the industry is sitting back and looking at its profits increase dramatically,  It then sees these reforms, which are only going to push up its profits unless it decides to pass them back.  If the industry is stating that high claims for soft tissue injuries are affecting the industry, it will be able to do the calculations and it should be able to turn around and say that if the book of quantum said X amount for soft tissue injuries, say, &euro;7,000 as opposed to &euro;15,000, that would result in a premium reduction for motorists of 10% across the board, although these are hypothetical figures.  The industry is not willing to do that and the question is why that is the case.  In my view, it is because it does not want to be held accountable.  We need to get the companies where they were in 2012, when there was an action plan and, although we were in the same type of crisis, there was a commitment from them.  However, Insurance Ireland is a different animal from its predecessor.  I would encourage the Minister of State to deal with that.<\/p> <p>  I want to talk about the Central Bank.  The Central Bank ceased to publish private motor insurance statistics in 2015.  The statistics published that year told us something very clear - I ask the Minister of State to remember this point - namely, that the average cost per policy, which combines cost per claim and claim frequency, in year one declined for both comprehensive and third-party fire and theft.  The average cost per policy decreased by 4% from 2014 to 2015, from &euro;272 to &euro;261 for comprehensive cover.  Third-party reduced from &euro;288 to &euro;272.  In terms of frequency, comprehensive policies saw a decrease from 5.2 claims per 100 policy years in 2014 when compared with the previous year.  The number of third-party claims decreased from 3.7 claims per 100 policy years.  In 2015, the statistics showed that the costs to insurers appeared to have fallen.<\/p> <p>  We had transparency when the Central Bank was producing private motor insurance statistics.  The last time it published them, in 2015, we were able to see that the cost to the insurers per policy was reducing for comprehensive insurance, the cost per policy was reducing for third party, the number of claims that were being made was reducing to 5.2 per 100 policies for both comprehensive and third party and the cost to the insurers was falling.  However, what happened to premiums in the same year that all of this was happening?  Premiums from January to December 2015 went up by 30%.  There is only one beneficiary of the Oireachtas or the Central Bank ending the private insurance motor insurance statistics and that is the insurance companies.  They can come in here and feed us bullshit about claims, about premiums and about this, that and the other, and we do not have the statistics to argue.  We have to rely on statistics from back in 2015, when we can see very clearly that everything was going in the other direction yet they decided to increase premiums by 30%.  I would argue strongly that we need to get those data back.  It is one of the big issues in terms of transparency.  We need to have the granular detail.  We need to know exactly what is going on with this industry - an industry that is under investigation both domestically and at European level, rightly so.  This would mean we can make a proper calculation of what is actually happening.<\/p> <p>  In my view, the CSO also has a role in the context of calculating the real cost of insurance for both motorists and businesses, an issue on which I have spoken to the Minister of State before.  I have huge regard for the CSO.  It is brilliant.  However, there is no point in the CSO telephoning and saying, \"Hello, AXA Insurance, this is Mr. so-and-so from the CSO, we are doing our monthly survey on insurance costs and we want to ask what is the price for this, that and the other.\"  The insurance companies are wise to this.  If I phone up looking for an insurance premium and the Minister of State phones up looking for the same, we can get two different quotes.  It is not that they know it is the CSO; the CSO introduces itself.  Therefore, there is now a question around the credibility of the CSO data.  The insurance industry itself disputed the CSO data when the premiums were increasing by 70%.<\/p><p>The other advocates and consumers are now questioning the CSO data because they believe it has been manipulated by the industry.  That is not something about which any of us should be shocked.  Deputy Michael McGrath spoke about the fact that the evidence from the Insurance Reform Alliance, consumer groups and our experience is that what the data is now showing does not reflect the experience of individuals out there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019061300002#J00600","speaker":"1288","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560380400,"counter":1292,"content":"<p>To respond to something the Deputy said previously, my colleagues in the Government did not let me down.

I do not think anyone is questioning my commitment to dealing with the insurance difficulties we have at the moment.  Subsequently, when it looked though as the Judicial Council Bill would be slowed down or delayed, I went to the Taoiseach and he gave me his full support.

The bank will engage with external stakeholders, including industry and consumer representative groups to convey the key data requirements for employer's and public liability.  The bank will research the employer's and public liability insurance environment in other jurisdictions, including focusing on data availability.

I appreciate that he has said he does not know from where the figures have come but I want to draw attention to the Alliance for Insurance Reform survey that was only circulated to us earlier.  There were 494 responses, with the largest sector being motor and transport, followed by hospitality, leisure, retail, not-for-profits, healthcare, arts and entertainment, with \"other\" accounting for 6%.  There were not that many questions but question No. 3 was answered by all 494 respondents.  It asked how much insurance costs have increased since 2015, and the average answer was 204%.  There is a question on whether an insurer had increased excesses or added new exclusions, and 28% of respondents having increased excesses, with 11% seeing new exclusions, 23% seeing both and 36% seeing neither.  There is a question as to what three phrases best describe the impact that increasing insurance premia has on an organisation.  From the possible responses, 48.5% of respondents indicated it threatened the future of the organisation, 45% stated it inhibited the ability to grow and 32% indicated it was preventing the organisation from providing certain services while 25% stated it made jobs less secure.  Respondents were also asked if the Government is doing enough to address the insurance problem.  Of the 494 respondents, two said \"Yes\", 23 did not know and 469, or almost 95%, said \"No\".  That is not a personal attack on the Minister of State.<\/p> <p>  That is a flavour of the issue.  These are people who took the time to respond to the survey and they are involved with the industry.  We have had people in here who run play centres, events festivals, playgrounds, local authorities, pubs and restaurants.  I do not doubt that every time the Minister of State goes to a public function, people are talking about insurance.  I am the chair of a school board and I know such boards that have seen their premiums go from &euro;27,000 to &euro;34,000 per year with no new claims or incidents.  Once a group package agreement is over, the charge is being increased by significant amounts.  Insurance is necessary for most people and they cannot afford to be without it.  The Minister of State was a member of this committee when we did our work on motor insurance, and 92% of people are not claiming.  This means 8% of people have caused the premium rises.  The legal and insurance industries may be making now but we had figures indicating that at a time they certainly were not making money.<\/p> <p>  There is a significant frustration and I would be happy to progress  the Judicial Council Bill 2017 as speedily as possible in the Seanad next Thursday.  Report and Final Stages will be taken and the legislation could be passed very quickly.  There may be 30 Government amendments.  I am certainly happy to progress it as fast as possible.  We were ready to take it in the Seanad as soon as it was offered and no other Bill delayed it.  We were happy to process it as soon as it was scheduled for us.  The Minister of State's opening statement lists all the good work being done, and the Bill is a part of that.<\/p> <p>  I do not wish to portray all insurance companies or legal people as evil.  I have family members who are involved with solicitors, etc.  The awards available to people for what seems to most people to be minor incidents are an attraction.  I have said it previously in the Seanad that if people are caught trying to rob a bank, they would probably go to jail and end up with a sanction but people who make a false insurance claim, by and large, end up with no sanction if they get caught.  They can come back next week to try again.  We are bringing in the Garda Commissioner, which is helpful, as well as insurance company representatives.  It is morally and socially unacceptable to make exaggerated claims and stage accidents.  There is a cost.  There was a social welfare campaign with the line, \"Welfare cheats cheat us all\", and insurance fraud is costing every one of us.  Most of us with cars will not make a claim but premiums continue to increase.  I acknowledge that I experience a small drop following a large increase over a couple of years in my premium.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the work done by the Minister of State but when does he think restaurants, pubs and charity events will benefit from meaningful reductions?   We know this is about reducing the volume and value of claims.  With motor insurance, it is also about having fewer accidents and crashes.  When does the Minister of State believe there will be meaningful results?  These businesses are closing and are under pressure.  He knows this as he is doing that work.  Can he give them some hope?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019061300002#L00400","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speech","time":1560380400,"counter":1315,"content":"<p>I refer to the Alliance for Insurance Reform figures.

There has been a 24.5% reduction from the peak in 2016 in that sector.  The 2016 increase figure of 69% was from a very low base arising from a price war that turned out to be a catastrophe for the sector.  When the cost of insuring a vehicle was less than the cost of a windscreen, it did not work out well for any of us.  The price war drove people from the sector, as companies went bust and companies exited the market.  As a result, insurance costs started to increase.  If we accept the CSO figures for the increase, we must accept the same CSO methodology pointing to a decrease.

A woman responded and said that we should tell the judges what to do now that we have a panel of seven.  We do not have the authority to do that under the separation of powers.

If not, and there is no change in the amounts, the only way the Oireachtas can acquire the authority is via a referendum.  We are prepared to consider that, depending on the outcome.

Recent insurance incidents that have been reported in the media have engaged the public in a way I have not seen many issues engage the public.  There are many issues on which one would like to engage the public but this issue has taken off.  With fraudulent exaggerated claims, everybody feels that money is being given to people who do not deserve it and the rest of us are paying for it.  That situation must be resolved quite speedily.

The sooner we go down that road, the better.  Then we will get to a situation where we have fair insurance for our young people, for example, who are completely extorted, our taxi drivers will not be facing a situation where their livelihood will be lost if they have one claim against their insurance, and we will get past the situation where huge numbers of small businesses, festivals and so on in this country literally have their livelihoods and their ability to continue to function viably threatened because of insurance extortion by insurance companies.<\/p> <p>  I commend the work that has been done on a cross-party basis, including by the Government, the Minister of State and others, in dealing with legitimate issues.  There is no doubt they are legitimate issues.  Insurance fraud is wrong and it has to be dealt with and stamped out.  There should be no excessive awards.  There should be fair rewards for fair and legitimate claims.  We should not have a situation where legal costs are essentially driving up the cost of insurance for people and we should do everything we can to eliminate unnecessary legal costs and all the other matters we have talked about to have some sort of consistency in awards.<\/p> <p>  There is nothing in any of this update that will prevent the profiteering.  That is the problem.  The insurance companies will continue to profiteer for as long as they can.  Why would they not?  They always have and unless we do something to stop them profiteering, they always will.  I put it to the Minister of State that this is the problem with all of this and the evidence is now starting to come in, because whatever claims they could make that all these sorts of reforms were necessary in order for them to bring them into line, and they were not making money and so on are gone now because they are making money.  They are making a lot of money, they are not dropping the premiums, and I do not believe for one minute that they ever will.  That is why the Minister of State cannot get that assurance from them in writing because they will not ever give it in writing.<\/p> <p>  To be honest, there is nothing that we are proposing that will force them to reduce premiums to fair and reasonable levels because that is not the business they are in.  They are not in the business of ensuring that people get fair insurance premiums.  They are not even in the business of making sure that everybody who needs insurance gets it because, as we know, they will exit from areas where they cannot make a profit if they feel like it.  They just decide not to provide insurance in that area because they cannot make a profit.  They go where the profits are and they will use every compulsion and pressure on the Minister of State and on us to get us to take measures which will drive up their profits.  What compulsion is there on them to feed those increased profits back into fair premiums?  I put it to the Minister of State that there is none.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019061300002#N00200","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1560380400,"counter":1349,"content":"<p>I have heard this position being presented before, that not-for-profit insurance companies are the way forward.  However, those companies would be obliged to adhere to the same Solvency II rules as a for-profit company.  They would have to adhere to the same EU directives on insurance and capitalisation as a for-profit company.  While the figures look very rosy, the issue is that they are only profitable for motor insurance.  The employer's liability, EL, and the public liability, PL, side are loss making and have been loss making for five or six years.  I will give the Deputy the figures on this.  The liability insurers made underwritings of loss outside of motor insurance in 2017 of &euro;46.9 million.  That is the liability and what they lost to underwrite the EL and PL side of insurance.  There is not much profit there.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is asking to open the State up potentially to making losses in that sector.  It is something that is not the right direction.  We have the right pathway.  The Deputy has commended all of us on the work we are doing on this.  I try to be fair to all Members of both Houses and the help and support on this is total.  Nobody is trying to implement an ideology or to be political.  We are all trying to put in place a better sector so that businesses can get a fair premium, stay trading and employ people for the benefit to society that brings.  There is a profit on motor insurance but there is no profit on the liability side and we cannot just ignore that this is the case.  The &euro;227 million profit from 2017 is broken down into a &euro;126 million overall profit.  Motor profit might be more than that but the public liability is removed out of it because it is in a loss and there is a &euro;100 million profit from investments.  Those are the figures.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy's line to me is effectively to keep the spotlight on the insurance companies, and I will do that.  The figures we have to date are for almost &euro;200 million in profit from three companies in 2018.  The profits are up again from 2017.  I can only assume that for the other five major companies which have to report, the figures will also be increased.  I do not want profiteering in the insurance sector.  I want companies to be profitable, because if they are profitable, they stay, they underwrite accordingly, they underwrite well, and they treat their clients properly.<\/p> <p>  I am not sure if the Deputy has heard me make the point that on too many occasions I have had people with me who have been contracted with an insurance company for years or decades and then suddenly, because the risk appetite is not there or it just suits the insurance companies to exit, it leaves.  To me, that is an appalling treatment of somebody that a company has been contracted with for years or decades.  That is wrong, it does it because it suits it, and that is because the insurance company potentially is reducing its risk appetite because it is easier to do so than to stay in the sector.  I will keep the hard line to them, as I know the Deputy will when they come in here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019061300002#N00300","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1560380400,"counter":1350,"content":"<p>The problem is, and the Minister of State did not really respond to this point, that there is nothing we can do apart from keeping the spotlight on them, to use the Minister of State's phrase.

There is nothing we can do to stop them just exiting the market whenever it suits them for whatever reasons they decide.<\/p> <p>  I put it to the Minister of State that there is probably not a lot we can do either to stop them cooking the books for when they are making losses and when they are making profits, because we know they can carry out creative accountancy with their internal operations, their parent companies and their subsidiaries and they can move money around, just as the likes of Google and Facebook do.

Some of the work practices in some of the marts are not good.  I have raised this with the main insurer of the marts in the country, which is one particular insurance company.  Many of the health and safety reports done have concluded with the works being carried out, and this has ensured that those marts are insured.  Some of the smaller marts potentially do not have enough business to cover the extra work that must be done to bring up the health and safety standards.<\/p><p>I have seen the film &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; with the Bill Murray character.  I am unsure whether the Chairman is Bill Murray but there is a character in the film call Phil and Bill Murray comes along every day and greets Phil.  I have been here before and I keep pushing our proposals and the work that we are doing.  The cost of insurance working group has been on the go for 30 months.  We have highlighted how all these proposals would take time.  I am unsure whether the Chairman is Bill Murray and I am Phil or <i>vice versa<\/i>, but we are nearing the end of it.  In particular, we are nearing the end of it for what I consider to be the biggest issue, which is the level of awards.  When we are done and we get the level of awards down or reduce them, my role and that of the Chairman and the committee will be to keep the spotlight on the insurance companies to ensure they do not try to pocket potential windfall amounts because we will have reduced the awards to the point where people who are damaged from a moderate injury receive a moderate payment.  That is what we must do.  We cannot allow the insurance companies to do that.  I am absolutely determined in this regard, as I know is the Chairman.  The Chairman has as great a role as do I because he has a public forum to which he can bring in the insurance companies, one by one, and keep the hard line on them, as I do in private.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019061300002#R00400","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1560380400,"counter":1425,"content":"<p>That does not seem to be working.  That is the point I am making.  You and I are talking about this, and the committee is dealing with it.  Yet, as the working group deals with it, there are businesses operating throughout the economy that are being forced to close or curtail their activities because of the various types of insurance.  That cannot be endured.  One sector cannot hold all of the other sectors to ransom.  One insurance company insures most of the marts.  Most of the marts have experienced significant increases.  I met representatives of the taxi industry some weeks ago.  There is no justification for the increases they have experienced.
