He is joined today by Ms Orla Duane, deputy director of audit at the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Apologies have been received from Deputies Deering and Connolly.  Before we commence our main business, there are several matters to be discussed in private session, which we will do after we have dealt with correspondence.<\/p> <p>  The first item on the agenda is the minutes of the meeting of 30 May, which I propose to hold over to the next meeting, when we can deal with any matters arising.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  We will now deal with correspondence received since our last meeting two weeks ago, some of which will be of immense interest to members.  There are three categories of correspondence.  The first, category A, comprises Nos. 2225A, 2226A and 2230A, from Dr. Fergal Lynch, Secretary General at the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  These are the briefing documents and opening statements for today's meeting.  Is it agreed that we note and publish them?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  Category B is correspondence from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers, follow-up material from previous meetings of the committee and other items for publication.  The first item of correspondence in this category is No. 2161B from Mr. Paul O'Toole, chief executive officer of the Higher Education Authority, dated 10 May 2019, enclosing a report undertaken by Mazars into its review of the relationship between Cork Institute of Technology and certain named companies and entities.  At our last meeting we agreed to note and publish this report and hold it over for further consideration.  We had some discussion on it, with particular reference to situations where people are employed by the institute of technology and also receive some payments from companies in which the institute has a shareholding.  The report makes several serious recommendations, including that there be proper agreements in place for such persons, that those arrangements be officially recorded and that assurances be given that their main work with the institute of technology will not be compromised by their additional duties.  Our discussion is on the public record and members are free to raise the matter any time we deal with related topics.  Is it agreed that we note and publish the report and move on, or would members like to hold it over?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#B00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":7,"content":"<p>Yes, I request that it be held over.

We had a preliminary discussion the last day, but there is no problem with having a more detailed discussion at a future date.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  The next item is No. 2193B from Mr. Niall Cody, Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, dated 27 May 2019, responding to recommendation No. A17 of this committee's fifth periodic report regarding the threshold for inclusion in the category of high-wealth individuals.  It is a very important and detailed letter in which there will be significant interest from journalists and others.  The Comptroller and Auditor General included a chapter on this issue in his last report, in which he suggested that the threshold be reduced from &euro;50 million.  In our periodic report, we likewise made a detailed recommendation to lower the threshold.  The report of the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners vindicates the work this committee has done on the issue in recent months.  He acknowledges the recommendation in our fifth periodic report and states that Revenue has completed its review, as requested by us, with a recommendation of lowering the threshold for high-wealth individuals to persons having wealth greater than &euro;20 million.<\/p><p>This was agreed by the board of the Revenue Commissioners on 16 May 2019.  The implementation of this recommendation will result in an additional 475 cases being managed by the high wealth individual division.  This important improvement is a result of our work and recommendations.  I thank the Revenue Commissioners for responding in such a forthright manner.<br\/><br\/>The Revenue Commissioners have produced a case base review document attached to this letter which we will publish but I want to highlight the significance and relevance of this.  Up to this point, the threshold for net assets was &euro;50 million and there were 200 high wealth individuals on the books and 278 associated cases.  Lowering the threshold to &euro;20 million will add 475 primary cases.  There will be close to 700 on the list where there were previously 200 and that has to be a good result.  These people may not all be resident here for income tax purposes.  They may have property here or investment income.  The Revenue Commissioners use three sources of data for this study: their own data, third party data and external sources.  In their own data they considered disposal of assets or acquisitions over &euro;5 million, gifts of inheritance, stamp duty, trusts, local property tax, which they considered for one year, income and ownership of property.  That led them to compile a significant list.  They then examined third party data for people with accounts of greater than &euro;20 million, which showed up in the deposit interest earned, investment from undertakings and people who had income from directors' fees, rents, pensions and other categories.  The external sources data was the 2018 rich list that we see published in <i>The Sunday Independent<\/i>and <i>The Sunday Times<\/i>.  The Revenue Commissioners compared those lists with their own lists and made sure that anybody on both lists was examined.  That does not mean that everybody examined was necessarily included in the final list.<br\/><br\/>The Revenue Commissioners said that there were 68 taxpayers identified, 35 of whom were also identified from the above criteria but they did not come into the division because they fell into other categories, they might have been beneficial owners or resident taxpayers appeared to have large shareholdings in high wealth non-resident companies, and a combination of shareholdings.  They examined them very closely.  In addition to the 475 individuals, 68 were examined in further detail who did not meet the criteria.  All in all, it was a good day for the Irish taxpayer, the public, the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, the Revenue Commissioners and the Committee of Public Accounts.  We are seeing the value of the work being done here.  I compliment everybody from the Revenue side especially on their willingness to take on board in an open way the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts, and on coming back to say they were being implemented forthwith.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#B00400","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I wanted to welcome some of this.

We note and publish that and we acknowledge the good work of the Revenue Commissioners in that regard.<\/p> <p>  No. 2195B is from Mr. Paul Quinn, chief procurement officer, Office of Government Procurement, dated 28 May 2019, providing follow-up information regarding the Construction Contracts Act 2013 which we requested at our meeting with the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board on 16 May 2019.  We will note and publish this and it will feed into our consideration of the matter in our next periodic report.  <\/p> <p>  The key issue here was that we asked about the Construction Contracts Act 2013 which was a side issue to the discussion with the board of the paediatric hospital but it dealt with the question of subcontractors being paid for work.  In this document Mr. Quinn points out that the Construction Contracts Act 2013 does provide, irrespective of the provisions of a subcontract, that the subcontractors are entitled to be paid the full value of work completed every 30 days.  I am putting this on record because subcontractors get concerned that they may be left waiting.  Paying parties must respond within 21 days and if they fail to respond, they can be caught for the full bill submitted in the event that they do not contest it.  Any dispute has to be adjudicated and can go for adjudication where that arises.  We asked for that to be put on record.<\/p> <p>  I will go back to Mr. Quinn to clarify a question that has arisen in respect of the children's hospital.  Where the main contractor makes a submission for extra work carried out, which could take quite a long time to adjudicate, where stands the subcontractor in the meantime?  I do not know the answer.  This document states the subcontractor is entitled to be paid for the full value of work within 30 days but if it is for extra work that has not been accepted by the contracting party, where does the subcontractor stand? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#C00900","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":18,"content":"<p>It is useful to know that but very often, for example, with road projects, if there is a dispute it is pushed to the end.

There is quite a bit in it and we could take quite a bit of time to deal with it this morning.  We have a few other things we want to do.  We will ensure that we deal with it next week.  The one item I might refer to as we go along relates to other correspondence relating to that, but I will hold over the publication of that until the next meeting.<\/p> <p>  No. 2206B is again from Robert Watt, dated 4 June, providing a further update to information requested by the committee previously regarding the single public service pension scheme.  We will note and publish this.  When the new single public service pension scheme was introduced, the Department responsible for the public sector and which sponsored the legislation did not know what public bodies were going to be covered by this.  It took it several years after the passage of the legislation to work out which public bodies were included in this.  We had a detailed discussion on this and I believe we referred to it in a previous report or perhaps it was to be included in our next report.  We received a report in February 2019, when we were dealing with this, showing that the Department was still not quite sure about quite a number of bodies some three years after the passage of legislation.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Watt has given us an update now as to where the Department stands on this issue.  At this stage, there are four issues in respect of all the public bodies that the Department believes should be included in this.  One issue is that three organisations, namely, the Residential Tenancies Board, the Health Products Regulatory Authority and the National Standards Authority of Ireland, submitted cases to the Minster for Public Expenditure and Reform explaining the difficulties they would face in meeting the arrears.  When this legislation came in, which was effective from three years ago, those organisations which had not provided the employer contribution in respect of the public service pension scheme were going to be asked to pay the arrears for the three years that they did not cover.  These three organisations said that they would operate the scheme from now on but that they did not have the resources to pay the arrears.  The Minister has accepted the case.  Accordingly, a ministerial direction was given quite recently to the three bodies under the 2012 Act to enable the bodies to retain the moneys owed in respect of the single pension employer contributions for the prior years.<\/p><p>The three public service bodies have started to remit the single scheme employer contributions due from 1 January 2019 onwards.  Essentially, the argument was the funding provided by the Department to them did not allow them to cover for arrears in previous years.  It will not affect the employees' scheme when they come to retire.  It is a pity it came to this.<\/p><p> There is one other issue.  We also mentioned the Dental Council.  It has arrears of &euro;7,000.  That figure has now been agreed but has not yet been paid.  It is the only organisation that has not paid its arrears where the Department is insisting the arrears be paid.  The Department of Health, which was engaging with the Dental Council, has confirmed the Dental Council's agreement to remit the required contribution in the near term.  We take it this will be wrapped up and paid by the Dental Council.  At the end of the day, three organisations did not pay the arrears.  This was because the Department did not have its house in order when the Oireachtas passed the legislation and it took three years to get on top of the legislation the House had passed.  The lesson is that, in future, any Department asking the Oireachtas to pass legislation must have arrangements in place to implement the legislation on the due date.  We will note and publish this.  At least we have now concluded this matter.<\/p><p> No. 2222B is from Mr. Maurice Buckley of the Office of Public Works, providing information requested by the committee regarding the costs, oversight and procurement process of the Kevin Street Garda station project.  This matter arose at our recent meeting with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on 9 May 2019.  The OPW came back with a letter.  We will note and publish this.  It seems to have dealt with the issues with regard to control of the project.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#D02200","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":49,"content":"<p>With regard to Departments doing their budgets and having certainty, are timelines applied for the conclusion of this type of claim?

We received this a week ago but we are only having our meeting now.  It provides a response to matters raised.  Some of these issues may been mentioned at yesterday's meeting but I will highlight the points we raised.  We will note and publish this.  We asked for details on the procurement subcontract committee meetings in 2016 and confirmation that trilocation in terms of the maternity hospital is a key objective.  We also asked for a note on consultancy fees in 2018 to include the name of the PR company and the length and total cost of the contract.  Q4 Public Relations was appointed in April 2015 and the contract runs until March 2021.  In the years from 2015 to 2018, inclusive, it was paid &euro;1,003,593 plus VAT.  That might have been mentioned yesterday at another meeting.  There is also a note on the decision examined by the board as to whether it would lease or purchase various high-tech hospital equipment.  There is a case to be made for both choices.  In February 2019, the board recommended reverting to the traditional capital funding approach of purchasing it rather than leasing it for an extended period.  We can discuss the merits or otherwise of this.  I am sure the board has gone into it in ten times more detail than we could do here.  We will just have to accept that it made the best decision it could.<\/p> <p>  We also asked about the cost certainty.  We asked for a note on the design costs of the hospital, including details of the 95% cost certainty of the preliminary design and the difference in the final design costs.  We were told the design team gave 95% certainty.  The board confirms the main mechanical and electrical construction contracts were received in October 2017 and the adjusted tender was &euro;636 million.  In November, the adjusted contract sum was &euro;890 million, which was an increase of &euro;254 million or 40% of the adjusted tender amount.  We asked the board to talk to us about how it is dealing with the design team with regard to the certainty it gave, which clearly has not stood up.  This issue has not been addressed.  We have been given the figure but the hard question has been avoided.  We asked whether it was following the company.  Certainty of 95% was given but now it is being shown that it did not hold up.  I believe the letter states the board is dealing with it but we want a more comprehensive note on what that means at this stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#E00800","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":56,"content":"<p>These are all important matters but the issue came up at another meeting, presumably because of dual membership between this committee and other committees-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#E00900","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":57,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#E01000","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":58,"content":"<p>People probably had these documents.

It depends on the nature of the contract and the level of certainty and risk.  We have had road projects where parameters were set as regards design and the companies involved had to work within those.  Any risks within those parameters were the main contractor's problem.  This has shown up two possible alternatives.  I am more concerned about the second of those alternatives than I am about the first.  The first is that the contractor goes in low, knowing that it will be able to add extras.  That is the general presumption.  My concern is that the contractor in this instance has much of knowledge and experience of dealing with the public sector in Ireland and other countries.  It habitually gets the design wrong.  It covers precisely what it is asked to cover in the full knowledge that it has more experience than the people with whom it is dealing on behalf of the Irish public and that they will have to come back and correct their earlier mistakes and ask for work that they should have asked for upfront to be done.  The contractor is very good at spotting where it knows it is getting designs submitted for tender.<\/p> <p>  I will provide an example.  One guy in the industry told me that if one goes through some of these designs, one could find that a contractor designed a room without including a door.  The guy putting in the tender has spotted that knowing full well that those requesting the work will have to come back to him to put in the door and he will charge a hefty amount for doing so.  Much of this is down to the fact the design work done on behalf of the contracting body may not have been up to scratch at the beginning.

We asked for an information note for the cost that will be incurred by the State for not meeting the 2020 climate action targets and when such costs will be due.  When one reads the letter, one can see that the State response, our collective response at Oireachtas and Government level, is entirely hypocritical.  The letter indicates that the arrangement at European level requires member states to meet their targets using unused emissions credit from earlier years or through purchasing credits from other member states via international markets.  In simple English, if we do not meet our targets, we can buy our way out of the problem by purchasing unused emissions from somewhere else.  This is the biggest act of gross hypocrisy when it comes to the environment.  We are stating that if we do not meet our targets, we will buy unused emission credits from somebody else before the deadline and pay the price.  This means that when the 2020 deadline arrives, we will be below our target because we will have unused credits in the system.<\/p><p>The NTMA is the body that purchases these on behalf of the State.  An important point is that to date the NTMA has already spent &euro;86.8 million of Irish taxpayers' money purchasing these credits, which is horrific.  This is to avoid a fine.  I know some of them may have been released in the meantime.  We asked about the 2020 climate action targets.  The letter goes on to state the Department estimates the additional cost of the requirement to be in the region of between &euro;6 million and &euro;13 million between now and then if we do not meet the additional cost.<\/p><p> We also asked about renewable energy targets.  People will find this equally upsetting.  The letter states Ireland has a target of 16% of renewable energy by 2020 and that we have increased it by a lot since 2005 when we were just at 3%.  The letter states the Department expects Ireland to achieve something in the order of 13% by 2020.  The letter also states that some years ago the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland estimated we could buy our way out of the problem at a cost of anywhere between &euro;65 million and &euro;130 million, depending on the price range of the trade.  This was carried out before any market activity emerged in the public domain.  In 2017, trades between Luxembourg, Lithuania and Estonia suggested a cost in the order of &euro;22.5 million per percentage point below our 16% target.  If we are 3% below our target based on those prices it could cost us another &euro;60 million to buy our way out of pretending we are meeting environmental targets.<\/p><p> I want to put this on the public record.  I want everyone who has an interest in the environment to know that what we are doing in this country is a charade . We buy unused credits, targets and emissions from other countries just to balance our books and pretend we are coming in under target.  We are doing nothing of the sort.  We should not have to spend taxpayers' money to buy our way out of these problems.  We should do the right thing in the first place.  I want to put this on the record and I hope people with an interest in the environment will take up the issue.<\/p><p> There is more in the correspondence from the Department with regard to broadband and we will discuss it in private session.  When the Department with responsibility for communications came before the committee we asked for details on bidder membership of the Granahan McCourt bid.  We wanted details on it because it has changed.  In the correspondence, the Department tells us that in March 2016 there were five bidders and that was the position at the time.  There was a process for making changes to a bidder.  Approval was granted in September 2017 following assessment of a further change in the make-up of the bidder.  This resulted in changes.  A further change to the bidder membership was approved in September 2018 and following approval the bidder membership is now set out as Granahan McCourt Dublin Ireland Limited, with reliance on the resources of McCourt Global LLC and Tetrad Corporation, as lead bidder and provider of equity; Enet as key subcontractor and not an equity holder; Kelly Group, with reliance on resources of Kelly Communications Group Limited and Kelly Integrated Limited, as a key subcontractor with nothing to do with the ownership; and Actavo Ireland Limited and KN Networks as key subcontractors.  The fact they are subcontractors is not the issue.  We are talking about ownership of the group, which has changed at least three times.<\/p><p> The final tender submitted by Granahan McCourt reflects the bidder membership as approved in September 2018.  We would like to know the current status of all of the companies involved and that have been in and out of the process since 2016.  They may have fallen out but are they still trading?  Did they ever trade?  What is their status and the link between them and the new companies?  The committee will not get to the bottom of it now because it is a bigger issue than what we will be able to conclude looking backwards.  They are all events that happened during years when accounts were audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It is an issue we will highlight.  It is a matter of great concern.  I acknowledge Mr. Mark Griffin for being upfront and forthright with information when we ask a question.  I must accept that.  We will note and publish it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#F01900","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":94,"content":"<p>It is really important that we know who this entity is and its ability to fund and deliver a project.  Knowing who the entity is will tell us this.  If a firm goes in for a tender to build schools it has to say what its turnover was in the past three years and what its form is.  This seems to be absent.  It is critical that we know who the bidders are.  The inclusion of subcontractors is a real curve ball.  Are they beneficial interests?  Can those subcontractors change?  Why are they even included if that is at the case except to say the firm cannot deliver it itself but these people might be able to do it.  This really exposes a huge flaw in the prospect of delivering and the longevity of the entity here.

We have previously received inquiries from the same correspondent on this matter and forwarded a response from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine which provided a background to the foal levy.  The Department advised that Horse Racing Ireland administers the levy and it is not practical to base the levy on the actual amount paid by the breeder for the nomination due to the variety of deals and shares available in the industry.  That is what the Department states; we do not necessarily endorse it.  It is just what it says.  Just because we repeat what it states does not mean we agree with it.  We are just acknowledging that is what it states.  I propose to advise the correspondent that the committee will not be taking the matter any further because ultimately it is a policy matter for the Department if it wants to change how the scheme is managed.  That is a policy decision for the Minister and it is not for the committee.  We will note it and inform the correspondent accordingly.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  No. 2194C, from an individual, is dated 27 May and people will be interested in it.  It requests an explanation for payments to Deputies for sitting on committees.  We are well used to people making allegations against Deputies.  Some of them are based on false information and some are just done for the sake of doing it.  The correspondent asked for someone to explain whether Deputies who already receive a salary for being a politician are paid extra for sitting on a committee.  The answer is \"No\".  Members sit here as part of their work in the Oireachtas.  The correspondent wants to know whether there is extra money for sitting on a committee and, if so, this individual wants the job.  For the record, and this is important, there is an allowance for chairpersons of Oireachtas committees only but not other members.  I propose we refer the correspondence to the Oireachtas website, where there is detailed information on Oireachtas salaries and allowances for specified positions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#G00700","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":100,"content":"<p>The Houses of the Oireachtas Commission is the one exception.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#G00800","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":101,"content":"<p>Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#G00900","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":102,"content":"<p>They get paid.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#G01000","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":103,"content":"<p>All members?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#G01100","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":104,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#G01200","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":105,"content":"<p>That is correct.

The individual believes that legislation is being breached.  Basically, there is legislation on the operation of the various schemes operated by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and by the appeals office.  Not everything is covered in the legislation.  Obviously, they have their own procedures to deal with similar-type cases.  The correspondent wants to know if there is any legislative provision for this and he is saying it is illegal that they have procedures in place that are secret and that are not covered in legislation.  If somebody thinks it is illegal, he or she can take it up legally but it is not a matter for the Committee of Public Accounts.  We will note the item.  Is that agreed?

I must be upfront on this one, without revealing the person's name.  This is a company which has a commercial interest in tendering for all these projects and which did not get any of the jobs and is dissatisfied with how the OPW has done it.  It is an issue between himself and the relevant body which we are not getting into.  The anti-ligature issue he raises is that the window, the window frames and the window openers are not designed in such a way that somebody could try to hang himself or herself in a Garda station and that the glass in the windows should be free from anything that could assist that process.  This is a company that is involved in the industry.  It is not our business.

We will now deal with statements and accounts received since the last meeting.  There are five statements and accounts for review, as listed on members' screens.  The first is the Public Trustee Account which administers 148 trusts related to activities of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine, including former Land Commission Trust balances.  The trustee account balances and there is only a small turnover.  The trust has received a clear audit opinion.<\/p> <p>  Next is the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland which has been given a clear audit opinion.<\/p> <p>  The Health Information and Quality Authority has received a qualified audit opinion to the effect that its statement gives a true and fair view, except that the authority accounts for the costs of retirement benefits entitlements only when they become payable, rather than when they are earned.  All health bodies in the State have received a direction from the Minister for Health to do it this way, which is out of sync with international accounting standards.  Historically, the Minister does not want these costs showing up as an annual cost; therefore, they are buried until people retire in 20, 30 or 40 years.  This is not in order with international accounting standards, but all Ministers have done it, not just the Minister.  It was a regular feature of past practice.  We will note that the Health Information and Quality Authority is not accounting for pensions, as is usually the case for other organisations.<\/p> <p>  Next is the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, which is given a clear audit opinion.  However, attention is drawn to the payment by the agency of &euro;1.9 million to the Revenue Commissioners in November 2018 in respect of an underpayment of VAT on certain services received from abroad.  The payment included &euro;600,000 in interest and penalties.  The amount of VAT involved was &euro;1.3 million, with the interest and penalties of &euro;600,000 bringing the total owed to &euro;1.9 million.  It is noted that there was a lapse in internal control in 2017 which resulted in non-compliant procurement in respect of four services contracts not being notified to NAMA's audit committee or other auditors and not being disclosed in its financial statements.  The related non-compliant expenditure total was &euro;4.35 million in 2017 and 2018.

I am holding over the noting of the National Asset Management Agency 2018 accounts.  We are not noting them today; we are holding over noting and discussing them until next week.<\/p> <p>  The next item is the Health Service Executive accounts.  They received a clear audit opinion, but attention is drawn to the fact that, on the direction of the Minister, the HSE has not recognised in the financial statements the liability, estimated at &euro;198 million, arising from a legal settlement with medical consultants which was agreed and adjudicated on by the High Court in June 2018.  There is also recurrent non-compliant procurement by the HSE, including 30% by value of a sample of payments, totalling &euro;66 million, examined in the course of the audit.   Representatives of the HSE are scheduled to appear before the committee, but I wish to raise certain issues with the accounts.  I want people to listen because the financing of the HSE is an important issue in the public arena.<\/p> <p>  These are the financial statements that were signed off on by the chairperson and chief financial officer on Monday, 13 May 2019.  The Comptroller and Auditor General completed his report on that day.  On the Friday before, there was a development that I, or any member of a Committee of Public Accounts, would find unacceptable.  It involves what the Minister or the Department on his instructions did before the board signed off on its accounts.  The net operating deficit shown in the financial statements is &euro;85.174 million for last year.  That is the audited figure.  However, it masks an issue referred to by the Comptroller and Auditor General, namely, that a High Court settlement on consultants' pay was adjudicated on in mid-June 2018.  In the normal course, the accounts should include a provision for that liability of &euro;198 million in the financial statements.  That would be the case for every organisation which produces accounts to international financial standards.  On the Friday before the accounts were signed off on, the Department, on the instructions of the Minister, issued a direction to the HSE not to include that liability.  However, it is a liability for the HSE.  Had the Minister not interfered with the final preparation of the accounts on the weekend before they were signed off on and audited, the deficit for the HSE last year would have been noted as being &euro;283 million.  This gross interference by the Minister or the Department is an attempt to massage the figures, fool the people and present unacceptable figures to the Committee of Public Accounts.  On the weekend the accounts were being finalised, the Department issued a letter to state the settlement of &euro;198 million was outstanding and the HSE was formally directed to exclude it from the financial statements.  That is outrageous.<\/p> <p>  When I referred to the Minister, I meant the Department.  We know that the Minister is the political head of the Department, but the committee deals with the Accounting Officer.  We will write to the Accounting Officer to seek a detailed explanation of the rationale for a direction issued to the HSE to exclude the liability of &euro;198 million from its annual audited financial statements.  If it had not been issued, the HSE accounts being presented today would show a deficit of &euro;283 million, but it produced accounts which showed a deficit of &euro;85 million.  I have made my point.  I want people to listen to what is going on.  Accounting Officers need to control expenditure, but presenting accounts that do not present a true and fair view in accordance with international accounting standards is not acceptable to the committee.  We may end up rejecting the accounts.  It is probably a new issue of which people are not aware.  It has only come to light because we are looking at it today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#K00800","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":165,"content":"<p>I agree completely with the observations of the Chairman.

The committee has been quite good on the issue of the late presentation of accounts and organisations have stepped up their game in that respect.  However, non-compliant procurement has been an issued since I joined the committee.  Members have raised it repeatedly, but there seems to be no sanction, other than it appearing as a footnote in the audit opinion.  At what point do we say that is not good enough?  Our periodic report must deal strongly with this issue.  We previously considered dealing with it as a single issue.  I do not know whether the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform or another Department sets the guidelines for procurement.  How is it that 30% of the sample came back as non-compliant?  That is an extremely high figure, considering the amount of money the HSE spends on procurement.

The references is No. 1386 B and would have been raised at the meeting on 21 June 2018.

If it was a legal opinion, would he be prepared to give us a copy of that legal opinion?  It does not sit with my understanding of protected disclosures.

In my opening statement I will give a brief overview of the main features of the Vote.  I hope the more detailed briefing material supplied in advance of the meeting was of assistance to the committee in providing a fuller picture of the work of the Department and its expenditure.<br\/><br\/>The total gross provision for the Vote in 2017 was &euro;1.311 billion, representing an increase of &euro;173 million, or 15%, on the provision for the previous year.  Nearly all of the Department&rsquo;s expenditure is related to current funding for programmes and services.  Capital funding makes up just under 2% of the total Vote.  <br\/><br\/>Our central mission as a Department is to work to achieve better outcomes and brighter futures for all children and young people in Ireland.  Among our key objectives are to ensure an effective child welfare and protection system; a high quality childcare system that is affordable and accessible; and an evidence-based approach to policy that helps children and young people to participate in decisions that affect their lives.  We support both preventive and early intervention services, as well as direct involvement in the lives of children, young people and families, where necessary.  We aim to collaborate with Departments, agencies and sectors to place children and young people at the heart of what we do.  We place great emphasis on consulting widely and using available evidence to inform the development of policy.  This involves the participation and collaboration of children, young people and other stakeholders.  We also stress value for money and evaluation from the early stages in planning projects.  Increasingly, our work involves dealing with significant legacy issues spanning many decades, while also trying to strengthen services for the children of today and planning the services of the future.  <br\/><br\/>In terms of the overall composition of the Vote, 54% of gross expenditure in 2017 was allocated to the work and services of Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, while 35% was accounted for by childcare supports, which we now describe as early learning and care, and school age childcare.  The remaining 11% of the Vote encompassed a variety of other programmes, including three other agencies - the Adoption Authority of Ireland, Oberstown Children Detention Campus and the Office of the Ombudsman for Children.  The Vote also includes the funding for the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes.  <br\/><br\/>The Department has had an extensive agenda of work.  In 2017 the major actions included commencing mandatory reporting as a legal requirement under the Children First Act 2015; implementing significant improvements to childcare supports in advance of the statutory national childcare scheme, which is due to commence later this year; ending the detention of children in adult prisons; commencing the Adoption (Amendment) Act 2017, which gave effect to the constitutional amendment on children's rights; publishing legislative proposals for the reform of the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>system, the Bill for which will be published soon; introducing a new bail supervision scheme, which has helped to reduce the number of children being detained; and working closely with Tusla on a range of child protection and welfare measures.  <br\/><br\/>We continued this work into 2018 and up to the present day.  Among the major actions are building on our work with Tusla on child welfare and protection measures, including a co-ordinated response to the special HIQA report commissioned by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and supporting the full roll-out of the national childcare information system; working closely with other Departments on child protection issues, particularly on policy and operations involving An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla; sponsoring the passage of the Childcare Support Act 2018 and continuing a major programme of work for the forthcoming national childcare scheme; continuing implementation of the access and inclusion model to help children with special needs to take part in the ECCE programme; increasing the ECCE scheme to two years, doubling the number of children accessing subsidies and doubling the number of childcare places across all age ranges; publishing a major strategy for early childhood entitled, First 5 - a Whole of Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families; publishing the first ever LGBTI+ youth strategy; completing the transition of the ABC programme to Tusla's prevention, partnership and family support services; developing a programme of action to deal sensitively with the burial of human remains at the site of the former mother and baby home in Tuam; working to deal with the emergence of evidence of illegal registration of births; and continuing a programme for streamlining the system of funding for youth services.<\/p><p>These actions are just part of the major programme of work that the Department engaged in during 2017 and since then.<\/p><p> We are very aware that we face a number of serious challenges which we have been working to address in conjunction with relevant agencies.  In the case of Tusla we are engaging closely on issues such as recruitment of sufficient social workers and addressing unallocated cases.  We have also had a close involvement in the expert advisory group to support implementation of recent recommendations of the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA.  We have been working intensively with Pobal on a major reform of governance and compliance procedures to ensure that childcare schemes meet today's requirements.  This is part of the major task of making early learning and care and school age childcare services affordable, accessible and of high quality.  The Department continues to work on a number of other important issues including reform of our youth funding schemes, which is under way.  We are in the process of replacing the current targeted schemes, which are the product of many years' history, with a single scheme aimed at best meeting the needs of disadvantaged and vulnerable young people.<\/p><p> I believe that the Department of Children and Youth Affairs has made a positive impact since its establishment in 2011, particularly in the areas of child welfare and protection, affordable and quality child care supports and collaboration across sectors to advance the well-being of children and young people, but of course much more remains to be done.  My colleagues and I will be happy to answer the committee's questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#R00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Fergal Lynch","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":252,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Lynch for his opening statement.

I welcome him and his team.  As attested by the opening statement, the Department has a huge scope, with many areas that could be examined.  I will keep my focus tight this morning.  Primarily, I wish to focus on the fact that the Department of Children and Youth Affairs advances a huge amount of money to an organisation called Pobal to administer its early years childcare programme; some &euro;500 million in fact.  Around a decade ago I remember the journalist Mr. Kevin Myers writing an opinion piece in <i>The Irish Independent<\/i>in which he tried to dig down into the world of quangos in this country.  The one that confused him the most was Pobal.  I will never forget his opening paragraph.  A journalist's opening paragraph should always capture the imagination and attention of the reader.  He asked the readers of <i>The Irish Independent<\/i>if they had ever heard of Pobal.  He followed up by saying that they probably had not, but they should have because the organisation had a very significant budget.  He then asked what exactly it did.  Perhaps the only person reading back then who would have known the answer was the Comptroller and Auditor General.<\/p><p>Prior to coming here this morning I have been contacted by many community childcare providers.  They know what Pobal is.  Following the so-called forensic audit, these hard-pressed childcare providers are being told by the watchdog that they owe money due to supposedly having received overpayments.  I would like to have something explained to me.  Why did the watchdog, that is, Pobal, which is in receipt of &euro;500 million of taxpayers' money, only really start to do these so-called forensic audits of community childcare services in the last year of the programme?  The programme has been in existence since 2008.  What monitoring practices have actually existed for the last decade?  Second, what is the estimated total loss to the Exchequer in the last decade as a result of this lack of adequate checks on payments by Pobal?  What is the process for recoupment? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#S00300","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560412800,"counter":254,"content":"<p>First, I will add some context.  Pobal is a registered charity and operates under the aegis of the Department of Community and Rural Development.  It organises a range of services.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs is Pobal's biggest customer, with &euro;500 million of childcare funding routed through it as the Deputy noted.  Pobal organises all of the schemes for us and it also carries out compliance work.  It has done compliance visits for many years.  The Deputy referred to 2008.  The compliance components Pobal was looking at in the early years concerned ensuring that parents were getting a service, the money from the public purse was being allocated to them and fees were not being raised.<\/p> <p>  Expenditure on childcare schemes has increased very significantly over the past several years.  Our concern has always been to ensure good value for money for the Exchequer.  However in the earlier years, up to 2015 or 2016, the money was granted on the basis of enrolments and registration.  Once enrolments and registration were demonstrated, that was it.  In later years the rules changed to be based on attendances.  Therefore in more recent years Pobal has rightly been asking questions about the actual attendance numbers of children at these centres as opposed to enrolments and registrations.  <\/p> <p>  With respect, I do not agree that Pobal has only started forensic audits in the last year.  We have certainly asked Pobal to engage in a good deal of work in this space during the last several years, and it has done so.  Pobal has identified excessive claims or overpayments in various years.  However, because the rules of the scheme changed in the last few years to become much more specifically focused on attendance requirements, it is only in the last two years that we have been able to either recover money where it has been overpaid or make sure it is not paid in the first place.  This has been made clear to the agencies involved.  The role of Pobal has changed somewhat over the years.  I can say more abut it if the committee wishes, but-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#S00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Fergal Lynch"},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":255,"content":"<p>I asked specifically what has been lost to the Exchequer.  I will come back to what Dr. Lynch has said.  I appreciate his answer.  Pobal has been asleep at the wheel.  Dr. Lynch referred to what was done in previous years.  Many different types of checks were going on.  There were checks on headcounts, audits and checks on childcare.  Meanwhile there were different checks on social economy and never the twain did meet.  That was part of the problem.  What does Dr. Lynch think has been lost to the Exchequer during the past decade?  I contend that Pobal was asleep at the wheel.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#S00500","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560412800,"counter":256,"content":"<p>We must base any amount potentially lost to the Exchequer on the rules.  The rules of the scheme were based on registrations and enrolments in earlier years.  This is an important point.  When we started examining whether there a case for recouping money, as recently as 2015 and 2016, we got legal advice on several cases.  The advice was that there was no such case because the rules were not sufficiently clear on attendance requirements.  These payments could not be recouped.  I can give the Deputy very specific figures on what Pobal has sought to recoup over the last few years.  In 2017 and 2018 Pobal's compliance visits produced an estimate of approximately &euro;937,000.  There are caveats here because of the type of data involved.  In the current year, 2018 and 2019, Pobal has identified potential excess claims of &euro;4.7 million.  I stress the word \"potential\".<\/p><p>In each of these cases, the money is not lost to the Exchequer.  It is either recouped through subsequent reductions or required to be submitted before the over-claim payment is made.  In some instances, providers were entitled to claim under a different scheme, that is, the community childcare subvention private, CCSP, scheme as opposed to the community childcare subvention, CCS, scheme, so it would not be payable.  The amounts identified in more recent years were recoupable or were not overpaid in the first instance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#S00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Fergal Lynch","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":258,"content":"<p>I know that but what is annoying some people in the community sector is that they are being penalised because of the practices that were allowed to happen.

Pobal is very careful not to grab the money from them and it has a very good case management and sustainability system.

We have been building ECCE to a second year and we have introduced a new access and inclusion model, AIM.  We tried to increase the uptake of some of the targeted schemes and, while we were unsuccessful at first, we were ultimately successful.  The result was that, at the beginning of 2017, we made provision for what we believed would be the requirement for that year.  In the event, ECCE funding was not required to the extent we had envisaged.

We paid &euro;19.4 million in the current year to assist providers because, as they will always say, this is not an area in which it is easy to cover costs and make any sort of return.  The Minister has said a couple of times that she would support a sectoral employment order which the providers could organise.  I understand that a number of the workforce are organising in that direction.

I am not saying for a moment that there is a quick fix for this or that we can do something overnight.

When we had the Department of Health here, I asked about a matter, and I want to ask the Department of Children and Youth Affairs too since it is also a part of this.

There was a delay in the Department of Children and Youth Affairs occupying the premises, with an extension to the lease at Mespil Road that cost &euro;1.5 million instead of moving to Miesian Plaza.  The move was delayed, as noted in the report, because the move of assistant principal officers to the pod-style system was deemed a significant cultural change.  I asked the Department of Health that question and want to ask Dr. Lynch too.

Some 85% of the 400 services that have registered already reach that requirement.  In other words, while people said that we would never be able to afford it or achieve this, 85% of the school-age childcare services are already meeting that.  The other 15% do not.  I have some questions in my mind about claims that this will substantially increase their cost, which I will put to them.  The Deputy quite rightly referred to pay for workers in the sector being at an average of &euro;11.93 an hour.  If one requires one member of staff per 12 children, even if the charge per hour is &euro;5, that would be &euro;60 compared to a &euro;12 cost for employment.

In recent years, for the moment at least, we have decided that the best way to do so is through Pobal, which provides a good service.  We have a strong governance arrangement with it.  In the context of administration costs relative to others, we have looked into the matter and are clear that the administration costs are good.  Pobal is a non-profit organisation.  We believe the administrative costs that it incurs are reasonable.  Obviously, we push very strongly each year in terms of the amount of money we would pay the organisation to operate the schemes for us.<\/p> <p>  We are planning, in the next year or less, to have a major review and analysis of our schemes and how we run and deliver the early-years schemes.

For example, should the work be done by another State agency?  Should it all be run by Tusla?  Should there be a separate entity altogether?  Should the work be taken into the Department, and so on?

I again agree with him that it is an area where Departments fall into difficulty.  One of our internal audit reports, which is a good and valuable report for us, gave us a limited assurance rather than a reasonable assurance, which is the full extent, and that was last June.  The criticisms were entirely valid and they were related to failing in certain circumstances to ensure that our contracts were on file or, in some of the earlier cases, and I stress that they were earlier, failing to have clear end dates or start dates.  We now have a procurement unit to attend to all of this.  We established a specific procurement unit within the Department, which has a centralised contract register that keeps all the supporting documentation and advises all of the units around the Department on procurement issues.  I expect that the chances of fairly basic and small errors, which should not happen, happening now are greatly reduced since the establishment of a small but focused procurement unit within the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#W01900","nonspeaker":"Dr. Fergal Lynch"},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":316,"content":"<p>I am pleased to hear that.

It issue an issue and I am wondering about the shortfall in the registration of children in a variety of schemes.  Did the Department improve this process following the audit?

It goes back to the factors leading to the underspend in 2017.  There was a lower uptake than we projected for both CCS and CETS.  One of the major reasons for that was practical.  The subsidies we were paying at the time were relatively low, relative to the cost of childcare.  For example, we were paying up to a maximum of &euro;95 for one of the payments.  We increased that to &euro;145 for 2018 because we recognised the gap was not bridgeable.  Similarly, we had a rate of &euro;50 that we increased to &euro;95.  We recognised that the difficulty was a trap whereby the subsidy that we were pitching was not sufficient to provide support for people seeking to use the scheme.  We addressed that and, by 2018, coverage had increased significantly and we were at the level that we predicted.  If my memory serves me, in a relatively short number of years we have gone from approximately 25,000 to approximately 60,000 people being covered by those schemes.  I would need to check the exact figures but it is of that order of magnitude.<\/p> <p>  We got there by 2018 but I fully accept that in 2017, we did not, and that was primarily for the reason I have described.

Everything the Department can do to support the sector is being done.

We have introduced what is called an area profile, needs assessment and service requirement tool, which is a bit of a mouthful.

They identify where services are falling short, where services are reasonably well provided and where the actual needs are.

The rules, as set out by Dr. Lynch's Department and transferred to Pobal, allowed for this to happen.  The Department changed the rules two years ago and the role of Pobal changed.  Reference was made to the recouping of &euro;937,000 in the year 2017-2018 and &euro;4.7 million in the year 2018-2019, which, nicely, is five times the amount from the previous year and seems to be a worrying trajectory in fairness but maybe it is not going to continue to &euro;25 million next year.  Hopefully, we are not going there.  Dr. Lynch has just said the incidence of fraud was very low, but low in what terms?  A sum of &euro;4.7 million is not low.  The Department has been able to recoup &euro;4.7 million from over-claims since the rules were changed.  Will Dr. Lynch explain how that figure has increased by five in a 12 month period?  Has the Department just become better at catching people or at claiming back?  Who is guilty?  Was everybody at it?  Was it the case that large providers copped on to the lack of governance and the availability of money?  Was it the CCS groups?  Who was doing it without knowing?  It is my view that small childcare providers would have known that if they did not have the child in front of them they could not get the payment for the child.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#Z02200","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560412800,"counter":403,"content":"<p>There are a couple of points there and I shall clarify some things.

Where a provider has made an overclaim, we give it the opportunity to dispute that and then we start to introduce penalties.  Currently, the penalty is that in year 2, if we find non-compliance on a second visit, we can withdraw its programme support payment or refuse to offer it to the provider.  That is the payment that amounts to &euro;19.4 million annually.  It is built into the compliance framework, contracts, etc. that we can refuse the provider access to that payment.  That is a lot of money for small services.  We can also refuse capital.  We have fairly good capital available annually, and not being able to access that is certainly a sanction.  The biggest sanction is that we are recouping it.  If a provider has overclaimed, we go in and change the PIP registration so that if the provider is expecting to receive a couple of thousand euro the following week, it will not receive that due to having overclaimed.

The person who looks after one's children is the most important person in the child's life after oneself.  Perhaps one's husband might be ahead, but the childcare provider is second after him.  It is because it is a caring, feminised profession that the pay is so low.  The Secretary General expressed his sympathy for the workers' situation, acknowledged their low pay and indicated his high regard for them.  However, sympathy, acknowledgement and high regard do not pay bills.  It is a matter of great concern that the pay for the mostly female workers in this sector is so low.  The Department has a role in regard to pay in the context of the focus on quality.  If staff are not adequately paid, we will not attract quality people and, as a consequence, children will suffer.  Although the Department does not actually employ the staff, it does have a function in this regard.  People are being paid &euro;11.93 per hour.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#BB00200","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":457,"content":"<p>I apologise for interrupting the Deputy but I must suspend the meeting at this point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#BB00300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":458,"content":"<p>Thank you, Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#BB00400","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":459,"content":"<p>To allow members time to attend votes in the Chamber and have lunch, I propose that we resume at 2.30 p.m.  I do not expect the meeting to continue for too long in the afternoon, but I will accommodate the members who are still waiting to speak.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#BB00500","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1560412800,"counter":460,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 1.25 p.m. and resumed at 2.35 p.m. in private session.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":461,"content":"<p>I welcome Dr. Lynch and his team.

People come into a very high-need area, become quite skilled and then move on to another area.  There are a number of pieces.  There are about 215 social workers trained in the universities every year.  We have recruited around 150 so we are getting a very high percentage of that new intake.  However, we are in competition with the HSE and the voluntary agencies.  The HSE is in a continual space for staff in disability services, elderly services and hospitals.  They have quite a high need as well.  Since our staff have come through the child protection and welfare side, they are seen as quite experienced and it is a fast upskilling so they are in demand in other areas.  A lot of young graduates also travel after a number of years.  We have discovered that staff will work for a period of up to two years and then leave because they can draw their contributions back down at that stage.  It is like a ready-made savings scheme.

Since it is a new agency and we have recruited quite a number of people, we have between 150 and 175 people on maternity leave at any point in time.  That creates the other demand.  They are not leavers but vacancies are created in the system for up to a year.  That is a constant churn.  We have developed a workforce strategy which includes the recruitment campaign and getting much more vocal about how a career in child protection and welfare is quite rewarding.  Despite the bad press that our business inevitably gets when something goes wrong, and that is quite serious, the overwhelming story from social workers is that it is a very rewarding workplace and a very rewarding career.  I see all the time that the effort and enthusiasm people put in goes way beyond what one would expect in a public sector organisation.  That has to be acknowledged in respect of staff who work in very difficult circumstances in some cases.<\/p> <p>  We have introduced a lot of change.  We have talked about this before in terms of services.  We have been training and developing people on a piece called Signs of Safety, a very good system that is trying to establish links for the child who is at risk with their family and local area.  It aims to maintain kids in their own environment, protect them, work with them and their family but also to draw others into that network so that the child is protected and remains in a family environment.  Social workers have made very strong statements about the usefulness of that and we have developed it around the country.  Those kind of initiatives are about changing the culture and the way we do business.  That has had an impact in terms of social workers looking at the business and saying it is a better way to do things.<\/p> <p>  We have a lot of initiatives looking at why people leave the organisation, better ways of recruiting and retaining staff.  It is not a secret that we have some areas that are very difficult to work in.  They are the areas where we struggle to retain and get people into.  Sometimes it is a circle that reinforces the vacancy problem, in that young newer graduates end up in those areas.  Their managers can often be relatively inexperienced so there is quite a high need to support them.  That is a challenge because it is probably the last place where new graduates should be.  We have tried to address how we support them, and how we can better train them and find better ways.  It has been a challenge in the public sector.  The rules around recruitment are there for very good reasons but we find it difficult sometimes to get the right people to the right place as quickly as we need to within the rules.  We have had to look at ways of trying to create pools of staff that we can use when we run into problems with staffing in particular areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#NN02100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Smyth"},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":545,"content":"<p>That information on the staff is very useful to have put on the record.

When Tusla was established, we were faced with a double challenge, one aspect of which was the availability of resources.  There was no policy in place at that time to ensure that those kids stayed with the families as much as possible, so kids got moved around.  Kids may still be moved around today, possibly because they have not settled in a particular placement or because there is some other issue.  Kids may be moved around in such circumstances, but in as far as it is possible, and this is something on which we are strong, we ensure that kids stay in their placements.  In the regions of north-east Dublin and Dublin-mid-Leinster there are approximately 250 instances of kids who are in foster care under private arrangements.  By and large, those kids remain in those foster care arrangements.  There is difficulty in finding local foster carers for them.  Once a child moves into private foster care, it is challenging to move him or her, purely because of attachments.  If the family support is good, the money aspect is seen as less important as the aspect of care for the child.  Ultimately, the objective is to ensure that the kids have a stable childhood that is as good as possible so that they become adults who can look after themselves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#OO00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Smyth"},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":558,"content":"<p>With regard to the 600 who are in other care rather than the regular fostering system, are addiction issues encountered?

Some calls are light while some are more serious.  In the early stages Tusla relies on the HSE computer system.  Does Tusla have a system of its own?

Referrals come from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, teachers, or medical professionals.  The volume was approximately 44,000 at that stage.  When we kicked off we had just under 10,000 unallocated cases, which means cases which are waiting to be allocated to a social worker.  Last year we had 57,000 referrals, which represents an increase of approximately 40% on that volume.  There are good reasons behind that.  The number of unallocated cases is down to 6,000.  That number is higher than we want it to be.  These cases are concentrated around five of our service areas.  We have 17 service areas throughout the country.  The unallocated cases are, in the main, in those five areas.  We have gone through the first reason that the number of unallocated cases is high, which relates to staffing.  We have also been doing a lot of work on our understanding.  When Tusla was created we had 17 separate areas.  We have a history going back to the days of the health boards, which is not that long ago.  It was 2005.  The systems remained independent of each other at that time.  We did not have the same way of dealing with referrals in each of those 17 areas.  The feature about which I talked earlier, the signs of safety model, is about ensuring that the same model of care and way of dealing with these cases is used across all areas.<\/p> <p>  Initial referrals into the system are normally triaged immediately and risk assessments are carried out.  HIQA has consistently found that, even in circumstances in which the number of unallocated cases is very high, Tusla does not leave kids at risk.  That initial process, within the first 24 hours, is about seeing whether the referral is high risk and whether the kid needs to be seen.  We then go into a process of initial assessment and then allocation.  Depending on the complexity of the case, the initial assessment can take a bit of time.<\/p> <p>  We are quite engaged in the analysis of the actual assessment and working with the people who refer children to us at the moment.  We get a lot of referrals from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We have been trying to work with An Garda, as well as with teachers, schools and others, to put in place systems which will give us a lot more information about the referral.  In light of the massive increase in referrals, we are trying to ensure that we get information that makes sense and on which we can make good assessments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#OO00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Smyth"},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":564,"content":"<p>For clarity, does mandatory reporting now exist?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#OO00900","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560412800,"counter":565,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#OO01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Smyth"},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":566,"content":"<p>If a schoolteacher or nurse sees an issue, he or she must report it.

As I understand it, there is an engagement, induction or space where those children understand.  I can get the committee something very clear on that.

The following is more of a public issue.  There were problems in the past where garda&iacute; felt there were credible reports of issues of concern regarding children in foster care in a family setting where those families had children of their own.  How urgently does Tusla triage those cases now?  Mr. Smyth probably knows the type of cases I am talking about.  Garda&iacute; said there were credible reports and Tusla was accused of leaving a child in the place of concern for a long period of time causing difficulty.  I will not even go into whether there are legal cases or compensation issues.  I am more interested in the children rather than the money end of it.

The most recent case is one that occurred between 2004 and 2007.  It is a specific area.  To provide an example, there were three social workers working across that county at the time who were working in separate teams and not even connected together.  The same area today has a headcount of 20 people working together on one team.  To be honest with the Chairman, issues like that were the reason Tusla was established in the first place.

My next point is in the same space.  What learning can Tusla do from the following?  I have a specific case in mind but will speak generally rather than to get into that.  I refer to circumstances in which a couple with their own children take in a couple of foster children.  It happens all over the place.  Let us say a foster child in the care setting does something inappropriate to a younger family member and Tusla is phoned.  The complaint I get is that because children in foster care are in the Tusla system, Tusla is more concerned about the fostered child than about the child at the receiving end of the mistreatment.  Is that the case?  When Tusla arrives, I am sure the thinking of the social worker on the ground is that Tusla has a child in foster care and that child is the organisation's priority.  However, it might be leaving a problem in the house.  Does Mr. Smyth get the point?  How does Tusla handle that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#WW01400","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560412800,"counter":966,"content":"<p>I understand the point absolutely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#WW01500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Smyth"},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":967,"content":"<p>It must happen.
