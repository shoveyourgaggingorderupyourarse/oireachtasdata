He is joined today by Ms Orla Duane, deputy director of audit at the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Apologies have been received from Deputies Deering and Connolly.  Before we commence our main business, there are several matters to be discussed in private session, which we will do after we have dealt with correspondence.<\/p> <p>  The first item on the agenda is the minutes of the meeting of 30 May, which I propose to hold over to the next meeting, when we can deal with any matters arising.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  We will now deal with correspondence received since our last meeting two weeks ago, some of which will be of immense interest to members.  There are three categories of correspondence.  The first, category A, comprises Nos. 2225A, 2226A and 2230A, from Dr. Fergal Lynch, Secretary General at the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  These are the briefing documents and opening statements for today's meeting.  Is it agreed that we note and publish them?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  Category B is correspondence from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers, follow-up material from previous meetings of the committee and other items for publication.  The first item of correspondence in this category is No. 2161B from Mr. Paul O'Toole, chief executive officer of the Higher Education Authority, dated 10 May 2019, enclosing a report undertaken by Mazars into its review of the relationship between Cork Institute of Technology and certain named companies and entities.  At our last meeting we agreed to note and publish this report and hold it over for further consideration.  We had some discussion on it, with particular reference to situations where people are employed by the institute of technology and also receive some payments from companies in which the institute has a shareholding.  The report makes several serious recommendations, including that there be proper agreements in place for such persons, that those arrangements be officially recorded and that assurances be given that their main work with the institute of technology will not be compromised by their additional duties.  Our discussion is on the public record and members are free to raise the matter any time we deal with related topics.  Is it agreed that we note and publish the report and move on, or would members like to hold it over?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#B00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":7,"content":"<p>Yes, I request that it be held over.

We had a preliminary discussion the last day, but there is no problem with having a more detailed discussion at a future date.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  The next item is No. 2193B from Mr. Niall Cody, Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, dated 27 May 2019, responding to recommendation No. A17 of this committee's fifth periodic report regarding the threshold for inclusion in the category of high-wealth individuals.  It is a very important and detailed letter in which there will be significant interest from journalists and others.  The Comptroller and Auditor General included a chapter on this issue in his last report, in which he suggested that the threshold be reduced from &euro;50 million.  In our periodic report, we likewise made a detailed recommendation to lower the threshold.  The report of the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners vindicates the work this committee has done on the issue in recent months.  He acknowledges the recommendation in our fifth periodic report and states that Revenue has completed its review, as requested by us, with a recommendation of lowering the threshold for high-wealth individuals to persons having wealth greater than &euro;20 million.<\/p><p>This was agreed by the board of the Revenue Commissioners on 16 May 2019.  The implementation of this recommendation will result in an additional 475 cases being managed by the high wealth individual division.  This important improvement is a result of our work and recommendations.  I thank the Revenue Commissioners for responding in such a forthright manner.<br\/><br\/>The Revenue Commissioners have produced a case base review document attached to this letter which we will publish but I want to highlight the significance and relevance of this.  Up to this point, the threshold for net assets was &euro;50 million and there were 200 high wealth individuals on the books and 278 associated cases.  Lowering the threshold to &euro;20 million will add 475 primary cases.  There will be close to 700 on the list where there were previously 200 and that has to be a good result.  These people may not all be resident here for income tax purposes.  They may have property here or investment income.  The Revenue Commissioners use three sources of data for this study: their own data, third party data and external sources.  In their own data they considered disposal of assets or acquisitions over &euro;5 million, gifts of inheritance, stamp duty, trusts, local property tax, which they considered for one year, income and ownership of property.  That led them to compile a significant list.  They then examined third party data for people with accounts of greater than &euro;20 million, which showed up in the deposit interest earned, investment from undertakings and people who had income from directors' fees, rents, pensions and other categories.  The external sources data was the 2018 rich list that we see published in <i>The Sunday Independent<\/i>and <i>The Sunday Times<\/i>.  The Revenue Commissioners compared those lists with their own lists and made sure that anybody on both lists was examined.  That does not mean that everybody examined was necessarily included in the final list.<br\/><br\/>The Revenue Commissioners said that there were 68 taxpayers identified, 35 of whom were also identified from the above criteria but they did not come into the division because they fell into other categories, they might have been beneficial owners or resident taxpayers appeared to have large shareholdings in high wealth non-resident companies, and a combination of shareholdings.  They examined them very closely.  In addition to the 475 individuals, 68 were examined in further detail who did not meet the criteria.  All in all, it was a good day for the Irish taxpayer, the public, the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, the Revenue Commissioners and the Committee of Public Accounts.  We are seeing the value of the work being done here.  I compliment everybody from the Revenue side especially on their willingness to take on board in an open way the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts, and on coming back to say they were being implemented forthwith.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#B00400","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I wanted to welcome some of this.

We note and publish that and we acknowledge the good work of the Revenue Commissioners in that regard.<\/p> <p>  No. 2195B is from Mr. Paul Quinn, chief procurement officer, Office of Government Procurement, dated 28 May 2019, providing follow-up information regarding the Construction Contracts Act 2013 which we requested at our meeting with the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board on 16 May 2019.  We will note and publish this and it will feed into our consideration of the matter in our next periodic report.  <\/p> <p>  The key issue here was that we asked about the Construction Contracts Act 2013 which was a side issue to the discussion with the board of the paediatric hospital but it dealt with the question of subcontractors being paid for work.  In this document Mr. Quinn points out that the Construction Contracts Act 2013 does provide, irrespective of the provisions of a subcontract, that the subcontractors are entitled to be paid the full value of work completed every 30 days.  I am putting this on record because subcontractors get concerned that they may be left waiting.  Paying parties must respond within 21 days and if they fail to respond, they can be caught for the full bill submitted in the event that they do not contest it.  Any dispute has to be adjudicated and can go for adjudication where that arises.  We asked for that to be put on record.<\/p> <p>  I will go back to Mr. Quinn to clarify a question that has arisen in respect of the children's hospital.  Where the main contractor makes a submission for extra work carried out, which could take quite a long time to adjudicate, where stands the subcontractor in the meantime?  I do not know the answer.  This document states the subcontractor is entitled to be paid for the full value of work within 30 days but if it is for extra work that has not been accepted by the contracting party, where does the subcontractor stand? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#C00900","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":18,"content":"<p>It is useful to know that but very often, for example, with road projects, if there is a dispute it is pushed to the end.

There is quite a bit in it and we could take quite a bit of time to deal with it this morning.  We have a few other things we want to do.  We will ensure that we deal with it next week.  The one item I might refer to as we go along relates to other correspondence relating to that, but I will hold over the publication of that until the next meeting.<\/p> <p>  No. 2206B is again from Robert Watt, dated 4 June, providing a further update to information requested by the committee previously regarding the single public service pension scheme.  We will note and publish this.  When the new single public service pension scheme was introduced, the Department responsible for the public sector and which sponsored the legislation did not know what public bodies were going to be covered by this.  It took it several years after the passage of the legislation to work out which public bodies were included in this.  We had a detailed discussion on this and I believe we referred to it in a previous report or perhaps it was to be included in our next report.  We received a report in February 2019, when we were dealing with this, showing that the Department was still not quite sure about quite a number of bodies some three years after the passage of legislation.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Watt has given us an update now as to where the Department stands on this issue.  At this stage, there are four issues in respect of all the public bodies that the Department believes should be included in this.  One issue is that three organisations, namely, the Residential Tenancies Board, the Health Products Regulatory Authority and the National Standards Authority of Ireland, submitted cases to the Minster for Public Expenditure and Reform explaining the difficulties they would face in meeting the arrears.  When this legislation came in, which was effective from three years ago, those organisations which had not provided the employer contribution in respect of the public service pension scheme were going to be asked to pay the arrears for the three years that they did not cover.  These three organisations said that they would operate the scheme from now on but that they did not have the resources to pay the arrears.  The Minister has accepted the case.  Accordingly, a ministerial direction was given quite recently to the three bodies under the 2012 Act to enable the bodies to retain the moneys owed in respect of the single pension employer contributions for the prior years.<\/p><p>The three public service bodies have started to remit the single scheme employer contributions due from 1 January 2019 onwards.  Essentially, the argument was the funding provided by the Department to them did not allow them to cover for arrears in previous years.  It will not affect the employees' scheme when they come to retire.  It is a pity it came to this.<\/p><p> There is one other issue.  We also mentioned the Dental Council.  It has arrears of &euro;7,000.  That figure has now been agreed but has not yet been paid.  It is the only organisation that has not paid its arrears where the Department is insisting the arrears be paid.  The Department of Health, which was engaging with the Dental Council, has confirmed the Dental Council's agreement to remit the required contribution in the near term.  We take it this will be wrapped up and paid by the Dental Council.  At the end of the day, three organisations did not pay the arrears.  This was because the Department did not have its house in order when the Oireachtas passed the legislation and it took three years to get on top of the legislation the House had passed.  The lesson is that, in future, any Department asking the Oireachtas to pass legislation must have arrangements in place to implement the legislation on the due date.  We will note and publish this.  At least we have now concluded this matter.<\/p><p> No. 2222B is from Mr. Maurice Buckley of the Office of Public Works, providing information requested by the committee regarding the costs, oversight and procurement process of the Kevin Street Garda station project.  This matter arose at our recent meeting with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on 9 May 2019.  The OPW came back with a letter.  We will note and publish this.  It seems to have dealt with the issues with regard to control of the project.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#D02200","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":49,"content":"<p>With regard to Departments doing their budgets and having certainty, are timelines applied for the conclusion of this type of claim?

We received this a week ago but we are only having our meeting now.  It provides a response to matters raised.  Some of these issues may been mentioned at yesterday's meeting but I will highlight the points we raised.  We will note and publish this.  We asked for details on the procurement subcontract committee meetings in 2016 and confirmation that trilocation in terms of the maternity hospital is a key objective.  We also asked for a note on consultancy fees in 2018 to include the name of the PR company and the length and total cost of the contract.  Q4 Public Relations was appointed in April 2015 and the contract runs until March 2021.  In the years from 2015 to 2018, inclusive, it was paid &euro;1,003,593 plus VAT.  That might have been mentioned yesterday at another meeting.  There is also a note on the decision examined by the board as to whether it would lease or purchase various high-tech hospital equipment.  There is a case to be made for both choices.  In February 2019, the board recommended reverting to the traditional capital funding approach of purchasing it rather than leasing it for an extended period.  We can discuss the merits or otherwise of this.  I am sure the board has gone into it in ten times more detail than we could do here.  We will just have to accept that it made the best decision it could.<\/p> <p>  We also asked about the cost certainty.  We asked for a note on the design costs of the hospital, including details of the 95% cost certainty of the preliminary design and the difference in the final design costs.  We were told the design team gave 95% certainty.  The board confirms the main mechanical and electrical construction contracts were received in October 2017 and the adjusted tender was &euro;636 million.  In November, the adjusted contract sum was &euro;890 million, which was an increase of &euro;254 million or 40% of the adjusted tender amount.  We asked the board to talk to us about how it is dealing with the design team with regard to the certainty it gave, which clearly has not stood up.  This issue has not been addressed.  We have been given the figure but the hard question has been avoided.  We asked whether it was following the company.  Certainty of 95% was given but now it is being shown that it did not hold up.  I believe the letter states the board is dealing with it but we want a more comprehensive note on what that means at this stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#E00800","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":56,"content":"<p>These are all important matters but the issue came up at another meeting, presumably because of dual membership between this committee and other committees-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#E00900","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":57,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#E01000","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":58,"content":"<p>People probably had these documents.

It depends on the nature of the contract and the level of certainty and risk.  We have had road projects where parameters were set as regards design and the companies involved had to work within those.  Any risks within those parameters were the main contractor's problem.  This has shown up two possible alternatives.  I am more concerned about the second of those alternatives than I am about the first.  The first is that the contractor goes in low, knowing that it will be able to add extras.  That is the general presumption.  My concern is that the contractor in this instance has much of knowledge and experience of dealing with the public sector in Ireland and other countries.  It habitually gets the design wrong.  It covers precisely what it is asked to cover in the full knowledge that it has more experience than the people with whom it is dealing on behalf of the Irish public and that they will have to come back and correct their earlier mistakes and ask for work that they should have asked for upfront to be done.  The contractor is very good at spotting where it knows it is getting designs submitted for tender.<\/p> <p>  I will provide an example.  One guy in the industry told me that if one goes through some of these designs, one could find that a contractor designed a room without including a door.  The guy putting in the tender has spotted that knowing full well that those requesting the work will have to come back to him to put in the door and he will charge a hefty amount for doing so.  Much of this is down to the fact the design work done on behalf of the contracting body may not have been up to scratch at the beginning.

We asked for an information note for the cost that will be incurred by the State for not meeting the 2020 climate action targets and when such costs will be due.  When one reads the letter, one can see that the State response, our collective response at Oireachtas and Government level, is entirely hypocritical.  The letter indicates that the arrangement at European level requires member states to meet their targets using unused emissions credit from earlier years or through purchasing credits from other member states via international markets.  In simple English, if we do not meet our targets, we can buy our way out of the problem by purchasing unused emissions from somewhere else.  This is the biggest act of gross hypocrisy when it comes to the environment.  We are stating that if we do not meet our targets, we will buy unused emission credits from somebody else before the deadline and pay the price.  This means that when the 2020 deadline arrives, we will be below our target because we will have unused credits in the system.<\/p><p>The NTMA is the body that purchases these on behalf of the State.  An important point is that to date the NTMA has already spent &euro;86.8 million of Irish taxpayers' money purchasing these credits, which is horrific.  This is to avoid a fine.  I know some of them may have been released in the meantime.  We asked about the 2020 climate action targets.  The letter goes on to state the Department estimates the additional cost of the requirement to be in the region of between &euro;6 million and &euro;13 million between now and then if we do not meet the additional cost.<\/p><p> We also asked about renewable energy targets.  People will find this equally upsetting.  The letter states Ireland has a target of 16% of renewable energy by 2020 and that we have increased it by a lot since 2005 when we were just at 3%.  The letter states the Department expects Ireland to achieve something in the order of 13% by 2020.  The letter also states that some years ago the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland estimated we could buy our way out of the problem at a cost of anywhere between &euro;65 million and &euro;130 million, depending on the price range of the trade.  This was carried out before any market activity emerged in the public domain.  In 2017, trades between Luxembourg, Lithuania and Estonia suggested a cost in the order of &euro;22.5 million per percentage point below our 16% target.  If we are 3% below our target based on those prices it could cost us another &euro;60 million to buy our way out of pretending we are meeting environmental targets.<\/p><p> I want to put this on the public record.  I want everyone who has an interest in the environment to know that what we are doing in this country is a charade . We buy unused credits, targets and emissions from other countries just to balance our books and pretend we are coming in under target.  We are doing nothing of the sort.  We should not have to spend taxpayers' money to buy our way out of these problems.  We should do the right thing in the first place.  I want to put this on the record and I hope people with an interest in the environment will take up the issue.<\/p><p> There is more in the correspondence from the Department with regard to broadband and we will discuss it in private session.  When the Department with responsibility for communications came before the committee we asked for details on bidder membership of the Granahan McCourt bid.  We wanted details on it because it has changed.  In the correspondence, the Department tells us that in March 2016 there were five bidders and that was the position at the time.  There was a process for making changes to a bidder.  Approval was granted in September 2017 following assessment of a further change in the make-up of the bidder.  This resulted in changes.  A further change to the bidder membership was approved in September 2018 and following approval the bidder membership is now set out as Granahan McCourt Dublin Ireland Limited, with reliance on the resources of McCourt Global LLC and Tetrad Corporation, as lead bidder and provider of equity; Enet as key subcontractor and not an equity holder; Kelly Group, with reliance on resources of Kelly Communications Group Limited and Kelly Integrated Limited, as a key subcontractor with nothing to do with the ownership; and Actavo Ireland Limited and KN Networks as key subcontractors.  The fact they are subcontractors is not the issue.  We are talking about ownership of the group, which has changed at least three times.<\/p><p> The final tender submitted by Granahan McCourt reflects the bidder membership as approved in September 2018.  We would like to know the current status of all of the companies involved and that have been in and out of the process since 2016.  They may have fallen out but are they still trading?  Did they ever trade?  What is their status and the link between them and the new companies?  The committee will not get to the bottom of it now because it is a bigger issue than what we will be able to conclude looking backwards.  They are all events that happened during years when accounts were audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It is an issue we will highlight.  It is a matter of great concern.  I acknowledge Mr. Mark Griffin for being upfront and forthright with information when we ask a question.  I must accept that.  We will note and publish it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#F01900","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":94,"content":"<p>It is really important that we know who this entity is and its ability to fund and deliver a project.  Knowing who the entity is will tell us this.  If a firm goes in for a tender to build schools it has to say what its turnover was in the past three years and what its form is.  This seems to be absent.  It is critical that we know who the bidders are.  The inclusion of subcontractors is a real curve ball.  Are they beneficial interests?  Can those subcontractors change?  Why are they even included if that is at the case except to say the firm cannot deliver it itself but these people might be able to do it.  This really exposes a huge flaw in the prospect of delivering and the longevity of the entity here.

We have previously received inquiries from the same correspondent on this matter and forwarded a response from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine which provided a background to the foal levy.  The Department advised that Horse Racing Ireland administers the levy and it is not practical to base the levy on the actual amount paid by the breeder for the nomination due to the variety of deals and shares available in the industry.  That is what the Department states; we do not necessarily endorse it.  It is just what it says.  Just because we repeat what it states does not mean we agree with it.  We are just acknowledging that is what it states.  I propose to advise the correspondent that the committee will not be taking the matter any further because ultimately it is a policy matter for the Department if it wants to change how the scheme is managed.  That is a policy decision for the Minister and it is not for the committee.  We will note it and inform the correspondent accordingly.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  No. 2194C, from an individual, is dated 27 May and people will be interested in it.  It requests an explanation for payments to Deputies for sitting on committees.  We are well used to people making allegations against Deputies.  Some of them are based on false information and some are just done for the sake of doing it.  The correspondent asked for someone to explain whether Deputies who already receive a salary for being a politician are paid extra for sitting on a committee.  The answer is \"No\".  Members sit here as part of their work in the Oireachtas.  The correspondent wants to know whether there is extra money for sitting on a committee and, if so, this individual wants the job.  For the record, and this is important, there is an allowance for chairpersons of Oireachtas committees only but not other members.  I propose we refer the correspondence to the Oireachtas website, where there is detailed information on Oireachtas salaries and allowances for specified positions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#G00700","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":100,"content":"<p>The Houses of the Oireachtas Commission is the one exception.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#G00800","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":101,"content":"<p>Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#G00900","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":102,"content":"<p>They get paid.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#G01000","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":103,"content":"<p>All members?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#G01100","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":104,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#G01200","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":105,"content":"<p>That is correct.

The individual believes that legislation is being breached.  Basically, there is legislation on the operation of the various schemes operated by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and by the appeals office.  Not everything is covered in the legislation.  Obviously, they have their own procedures to deal with similar-type cases.  The correspondent wants to know if there is any legislative provision for this and he is saying it is illegal that they have procedures in place that are secret and that are not covered in legislation.  If somebody thinks it is illegal, he or she can take it up legally but it is not a matter for the Committee of Public Accounts.  We will note the item.  Is that agreed?

I must be upfront on this one, without revealing the person's name.  This is a company which has a commercial interest in tendering for all these projects and which did not get any of the jobs and is dissatisfied with how the OPW has done it.  It is an issue between himself and the relevant body which we are not getting into.  The anti-ligature issue he raises is that the window, the window frames and the window openers are not designed in such a way that somebody could try to hang himself or herself in a Garda station and that the glass in the windows should be free from anything that could assist that process.  This is a company that is involved in the industry.  It is not our business.

We will now deal with statements and accounts received since the last meeting.  There are five statements and accounts for review, as listed on members' screens.  The first is the Public Trustee Account which administers 148 trusts related to activities of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine, including former Land Commission Trust balances.  The trustee account balances and there is only a small turnover.  The trust has received a clear audit opinion.<\/p> <p>  Next is the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland which has been given a clear audit opinion.<\/p> <p>  The Health Information and Quality Authority has received a qualified audit opinion to the effect that its statement gives a true and fair view, except that the authority accounts for the costs of retirement benefits entitlements only when they become payable, rather than when they are earned.  All health bodies in the State have received a direction from the Minister for Health to do it this way, which is out of sync with international accounting standards.  Historically, the Minister does not want these costs showing up as an annual cost; therefore, they are buried until people retire in 20, 30 or 40 years.  This is not in order with international accounting standards, but all Ministers have done it, not just the Minister.  It was a regular feature of past practice.  We will note that the Health Information and Quality Authority is not accounting for pensions, as is usually the case for other organisations.<\/p> <p>  Next is the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, which is given a clear audit opinion.  However, attention is drawn to the payment by the agency of &euro;1.9 million to the Revenue Commissioners in November 2018 in respect of an underpayment of VAT on certain services received from abroad.  The payment included &euro;600,000 in interest and penalties.  The amount of VAT involved was &euro;1.3 million, with the interest and penalties of &euro;600,000 bringing the total owed to &euro;1.9 million.  It is noted that there was a lapse in internal control in 2017 which resulted in non-compliant procurement in respect of four services contracts not being notified to NAMA's audit committee or other auditors and not being disclosed in its financial statements.  The related non-compliant expenditure total was &euro;4.35 million in 2017 and 2018.

I am holding over the noting of the National Asset Management Agency 2018 accounts.  We are not noting them today; we are holding over noting and discussing them until next week.<\/p> <p>  The next item is the Health Service Executive accounts.  They received a clear audit opinion, but attention is drawn to the fact that, on the direction of the Minister, the HSE has not recognised in the financial statements the liability, estimated at &euro;198 million, arising from a legal settlement with medical consultants which was agreed and adjudicated on by the High Court in June 2018.  There is also recurrent non-compliant procurement by the HSE, including 30% by value of a sample of payments, totalling &euro;66 million, examined in the course of the audit.   Representatives of the HSE are scheduled to appear before the committee, but I wish to raise certain issues with the accounts.  I want people to listen because the financing of the HSE is an important issue in the public arena.<\/p> <p>  These are the financial statements that were signed off on by the chairperson and chief financial officer on Monday, 13 May 2019.  The Comptroller and Auditor General completed his report on that day.  On the Friday before, there was a development that I, or any member of a Committee of Public Accounts, would find unacceptable.  It involves what the Minister or the Department on his instructions did before the board signed off on its accounts.  The net operating deficit shown in the financial statements is &euro;85.174 million for last year.  That is the audited figure.  However, it masks an issue referred to by the Comptroller and Auditor General, namely, that a High Court settlement on consultants' pay was adjudicated on in mid-June 2018.  In the normal course, the accounts should include a provision for that liability of &euro;198 million in the financial statements.  That would be the case for every organisation which produces accounts to international financial standards.  On the Friday before the accounts were signed off on, the Department, on the instructions of the Minister, issued a direction to the HSE not to include that liability.  However, it is a liability for the HSE.  Had the Minister not interfered with the final preparation of the accounts on the weekend before they were signed off on and audited, the deficit for the HSE last year would have been noted as being &euro;283 million.  This gross interference by the Minister or the Department is an attempt to massage the figures, fool the people and present unacceptable figures to the Committee of Public Accounts.  On the weekend the accounts were being finalised, the Department issued a letter to state the settlement of &euro;198 million was outstanding and the HSE was formally directed to exclude it from the financial statements.  That is outrageous.<\/p> <p>  When I referred to the Minister, I meant the Department.  We know that the Minister is the political head of the Department, but the committee deals with the Accounting Officer.  We will write to the Accounting Officer to seek a detailed explanation of the rationale for a direction issued to the HSE to exclude the liability of &euro;198 million from its annual audited financial statements.  If it had not been issued, the HSE accounts being presented today would show a deficit of &euro;283 million, but it produced accounts which showed a deficit of &euro;85 million.  I have made my point.  I want people to listen to what is going on.  Accounting Officers need to control expenditure, but presenting accounts that do not present a true and fair view in accordance with international accounting standards is not acceptable to the committee.  We may end up rejecting the accounts.  It is probably a new issue of which people are not aware.  It has only come to light because we are looking at it today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#K00800","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":165,"content":"<p>I agree completely with the observations of the Chairman.

The committee has been quite good on the issue of the late presentation of accounts and organisations have stepped up their game in that respect.  However, non-compliant procurement has been an issued since I joined the committee.  Members have raised it repeatedly, but there seems to be no sanction, other than it appearing as a footnote in the audit opinion.  At what point do we say that is not good enough?  Our periodic report must deal strongly with this issue.  We previously considered dealing with it as a single issue.  I do not know whether the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform or another Department sets the guidelines for procurement.  How is it that 30% of the sample came back as non-compliant?  That is an extremely high figure, considering the amount of money the HSE spends on procurement.

The references is No. 1386 B and would have been raised at the meeting on 21 June 2018.

If it was a legal opinion, would he be prepared to give us a copy of that legal opinion?  It does not sit with my understanding of protected disclosures.

In my opening statement I will give a brief overview of the main features of the Vote.  I hope the more detailed briefing material supplied in advance of the meeting was of assistance to the committee in providing a fuller picture of the work of the Department and its expenditure.<br\/><br\/>The total gross provision for the Vote in 2017 was &euro;1.311 billion, representing an increase of &euro;173 million, or 15%, on the provision for the previous year.  Nearly all of the Department&rsquo;s expenditure is related to current funding for programmes and services.  Capital funding makes up just under 2% of the total Vote.  <br\/><br\/>Our central mission as a Department is to work to achieve better outcomes and brighter futures for all children and young people in Ireland.  Among our key objectives are to ensure an effective child welfare and protection system; a high quality childcare system that is affordable and accessible; and an evidence-based approach to policy that helps children and young people to participate in decisions that affect their lives.  We support both preventive and early intervention services, as well as direct involvement in the lives of children, young people and families, where necessary.  We aim to collaborate with Departments, agencies and sectors to place children and young people at the heart of what we do.  We place great emphasis on consulting widely and using available evidence to inform the development of policy.  This involves the participation and collaboration of children, young people and other stakeholders.  We also stress value for money and evaluation from the early stages in planning projects.  Increasingly, our work involves dealing with significant legacy issues spanning many decades, while also trying to strengthen services for the children of today and planning the services of the future.  <br\/><br\/>In terms of the overall composition of the Vote, 54% of gross expenditure in 2017 was allocated to the work and services of Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, while 35% was accounted for by childcare supports, which we now describe as early learning and care, and school age childcare.  The remaining 11% of the Vote encompassed a variety of other programmes, including three other agencies - the Adoption Authority of Ireland, Oberstown Children Detention Campus and the Office of the Ombudsman for Children.  The Vote also includes the funding for the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes.  <br\/><br\/>The Department has had an extensive agenda of work.  In 2017 the major actions included commencing mandatory reporting as a legal requirement under the Children First Act 2015; implementing significant improvements to childcare supports in advance of the statutory national childcare scheme, which is due to commence later this year; ending the detention of children in adult prisons; commencing the Adoption (Amendment) Act 2017, which gave effect to the constitutional amendment on children's rights; publishing legislative proposals for the reform of the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>system, the Bill for which will be published soon; introducing a new bail supervision scheme, which has helped to reduce the number of children being detained; and working closely with Tusla on a range of child protection and welfare measures.  <br\/><br\/>We continued this work into 2018 and up to the present day.  Among the major actions are building on our work with Tusla on child welfare and protection measures, including a co-ordinated response to the special HIQA report commissioned by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and supporting the full roll-out of the national childcare information system; working closely with other Departments on child protection issues, particularly on policy and operations involving An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla; sponsoring the passage of the Childcare Support Act 2018 and continuing a major programme of work for the forthcoming national childcare scheme; continuing implementation of the access and inclusion model to help children with special needs to take part in the ECCE programme; increasing the ECCE scheme to two years, doubling the number of children accessing subsidies and doubling the number of childcare places across all age ranges; publishing a major strategy for early childhood entitled, First 5 - a Whole of Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families; publishing the first ever LGBTI+ youth strategy; completing the transition of the ABC programme to Tusla's prevention, partnership and family support services; developing a programme of action to deal sensitively with the burial of human remains at the site of the former mother and baby home in Tuam; working to deal with the emergence of evidence of illegal registration of births; and continuing a programme for streamlining the system of funding for youth services.<\/p><p>These actions are just part of the major programme of work that the Department engaged in during 2017 and since then.<\/p><p> We are very aware that we face a number of serious challenges which we have been working to address in conjunction with relevant agencies.  In the case of Tusla we are engaging closely on issues such as recruitment of sufficient social workers and addressing unallocated cases.  We have also had a close involvement in the expert advisory group to support implementation of recent recommendations of the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA.  We have been working intensively with Pobal on a major reform of governance and compliance procedures to ensure that childcare schemes meet today's requirements.  This is part of the major task of making early learning and care and school age childcare services affordable, accessible and of high quality.  The Department continues to work on a number of other important issues including reform of our youth funding schemes, which is under way.  We are in the process of replacing the current targeted schemes, which are the product of many years' history, with a single scheme aimed at best meeting the needs of disadvantaged and vulnerable young people.<\/p><p> I believe that the Department of Children and Youth Affairs has made a positive impact since its establishment in 2011, particularly in the areas of child welfare and protection, affordable and quality child care supports and collaboration across sectors to advance the well-being of children and young people, but of course much more remains to be done.  My colleagues and I will be happy to answer the committee's questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#R00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Fergal Lynch","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":252,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Lynch for his opening statement.

I welcome him and his team.  As attested by the opening statement, the Department has a huge scope, with many areas that could be examined.  I will keep my focus tight this morning.  Primarily, I wish to focus on the fact that the Department of Children and Youth Affairs advances a huge amount of money to an organisation called Pobal to administer its early years childcare programme; some &euro;500 million in fact.  Around a decade ago I remember the journalist Mr. Kevin Myers writing an opinion piece in <i>The Irish Independent<\/i>in which he tried to dig down into the world of quangos in this country.  The one that confused him the most was Pobal.  I will never forget his opening paragraph.  A journalist's opening paragraph should always capture the imagination and attention of the reader.  He asked the readers of <i>The Irish Independent<\/i>if they had ever heard of Pobal.  He followed up by saying that they probably had not, but they should have because the organisation had a very significant budget.  He then asked what exactly it did.  Perhaps the only person reading back then who would have known the answer was the Comptroller and Auditor General.<\/p><p>Prior to coming here this morning I have been contacted by many community childcare providers.  They know what Pobal is.  Following the so-called forensic audit, these hard-pressed childcare providers are being told by the watchdog that they owe money due to supposedly having received overpayments.  I would like to have something explained to me.  Why did the watchdog, that is, Pobal, which is in receipt of &euro;500 million of taxpayers' money, only really start to do these so-called forensic audits of community childcare services in the last year of the programme?  The programme has been in existence since 2008.  What monitoring practices have actually existed for the last decade?  Second, what is the estimated total loss to the Exchequer in the last decade as a result of this lack of adequate checks on payments by Pobal?  What is the process for recoupment? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#S00300","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560412800,"counter":254,"content":"<p>First, I will add some context.  Pobal is a registered charity and operates under the aegis of the Department of Community and Rural Development.  It organises a range of services.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs is Pobal's biggest customer, with &euro;500 million of childcare funding routed through it as the Deputy noted.  Pobal organises all of the schemes for us and it also carries out compliance work.  It has done compliance visits for many years.  The Deputy referred to 2008.  The compliance components Pobal was looking at in the early years concerned ensuring that parents were getting a service, the money from the public purse was being allocated to them and fees were not being raised.<\/p> <p>  Expenditure on childcare schemes has increased very significantly over the past several years.  Our concern has always been to ensure good value for money for the Exchequer.  However in the earlier years, up to 2015 or 2016, the money was granted on the basis of enrolments and registration.  Once enrolments and registration were demonstrated, that was it.  In later years the rules changed to be based on attendances.  Therefore in more recent years Pobal has rightly been asking questions about the actual attendance numbers of children at these centres as opposed to enrolments and registrations.  <\/p> <p>  With respect, I do not agree that Pobal has only started forensic audits in the last year.  We have certainly asked Pobal to engage in a good deal of work in this space during the last several years, and it has done so.  Pobal has identified excessive claims or overpayments in various years.  However, because the rules of the scheme changed in the last few years to become much more specifically focused on attendance requirements, it is only in the last two years that we have been able to either recover money where it has been overpaid or make sure it is not paid in the first place.  This has been made clear to the agencies involved.  The role of Pobal has changed somewhat over the years.  I can say more abut it if the committee wishes, but-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#S00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Fergal Lynch"},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":255,"content":"<p>I asked specifically what has been lost to the Exchequer.  I will come back to what Dr. Lynch has said.  I appreciate his answer.  Pobal has been asleep at the wheel.  Dr. Lynch referred to what was done in previous years.  Many different types of checks were going on.  There were checks on headcounts, audits and checks on childcare.  Meanwhile there were different checks on social economy and never the twain did meet.  That was part of the problem.  What does Dr. Lynch think has been lost to the Exchequer during the past decade?  I contend that Pobal was asleep at the wheel.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#S00500","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560412800,"counter":256,"content":"<p>We must base any amount potentially lost to the Exchequer on the rules.  The rules of the scheme were based on registrations and enrolments in earlier years.  This is an important point.  When we started examining whether there a case for recouping money, as recently as 2015 and 2016, we got legal advice on several cases.  The advice was that there was no such case because the rules were not sufficiently clear on attendance requirements.  These payments could not be recouped.  I can give the Deputy very specific figures on what Pobal has sought to recoup over the last few years.  In 2017 and 2018 Pobal's compliance visits produced an estimate of approximately &euro;937,000.  There are caveats here because of the type of data involved.  In the current year, 2018 and 2019, Pobal has identified potential excess claims of &euro;4.7 million.  I stress the word \"potential\".<\/p><p>In each of these cases, the money is not lost to the Exchequer.  It is either recouped through subsequent reductions or required to be submitted before the over-claim payment is made.  In some instances, providers were entitled to claim under a different scheme, that is, the community childcare subvention private, CCSP, scheme as opposed to the community childcare subvention, CCS, scheme, so it would not be payable.  The amounts identified in more recent years were recoupable or were not overpaid in the first instance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#S00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Fergal Lynch","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":258,"content":"<p>I know that but what is annoying some people in the community sector is that they are being penalised because of the practices that were allowed to happen.

Pobal is very careful not to grab the money from them and it has a very good case management and sustainability system.

We have been building ECCE to a second year and we have introduced a new access and inclusion model, AIM.  We tried to increase the uptake of some of the targeted schemes and, while we were unsuccessful at first, we were ultimately successful.  The result was that, at the beginning of 2017, we made provision for what we believed would be the requirement for that year.  In the event, ECCE funding was not required to the extent we had envisaged.

We paid &euro;19.4 million in the current year to assist providers because, as they will always say, this is not an area in which it is easy to cover costs and make any sort of return.  The Minister has said a couple of times that she would support a sectoral employment order which the providers could organise.  I understand that a number of the workforce are organising in that direction.

I am not saying for a moment that there is a quick fix for this or that we can do something overnight.

When we had the Department of Health here, I asked about a matter, and I want to ask the Department of Children and Youth Affairs too since it is also a part of this.

There was a delay in the Department of Children and Youth Affairs occupying the premises, with an extension to the lease at Mespil Road that cost &euro;1.5 million instead of moving to Miesian Plaza.  The move was delayed, as noted in the report, because the move of assistant principal officers to the pod-style system was deemed a significant cultural change.  I asked the Department of Health that question and want to ask Dr. Lynch too.

Some 85% of the 400 services that have registered already reach that requirement.  In other words, while people said that we would never be able to afford it or achieve this, 85% of the school-age childcare services are already meeting that.  The other 15% do not.  I have some questions in my mind about claims that this will substantially increase their cost, which I will put to them.  The Deputy quite rightly referred to pay for workers in the sector being at an average of &euro;11.93 an hour.  If one requires one member of staff per 12 children, even if the charge per hour is &euro;5, that would be &euro;60 compared to a &euro;12 cost for employment.

In recent years, for the moment at least, we have decided that the best way to do so is through Pobal, which provides a good service.  We have a strong governance arrangement with it.  In the context of administration costs relative to others, we have looked into the matter and are clear that the administration costs are good.  Pobal is a non-profit organisation.  We believe the administrative costs that it incurs are reasonable.  Obviously, we push very strongly each year in terms of the amount of money we would pay the organisation to operate the schemes for us.<\/p> <p>  We are planning, in the next year or less, to have a major review and analysis of our schemes and how we run and deliver the early-years schemes.

For example, should the work be done by another State agency?  Should it all be run by Tusla?  Should there be a separate entity altogether?  Should the work be taken into the Department, and so on?

I again agree with him that it is an area where Departments fall into difficulty.  One of our internal audit reports, which is a good and valuable report for us, gave us a limited assurance rather than a reasonable assurance, which is the full extent, and that was last June.  The criticisms were entirely valid and they were related to failing in certain circumstances to ensure that our contracts were on file or, in some of the earlier cases, and I stress that they were earlier, failing to have clear end dates or start dates.  We now have a procurement unit to attend to all of this.  We established a specific procurement unit within the Department, which has a centralised contract register that keeps all the supporting documentation and advises all of the units around the Department on procurement issues.  I expect that the chances of fairly basic and small errors, which should not happen, happening now are greatly reduced since the establishment of a small but focused procurement unit within the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#W01900","nonspeaker":"Dr. Fergal Lynch"},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":316,"content":"<p>I am pleased to hear that.

It issue an issue and I am wondering about the shortfall in the registration of children in a variety of schemes.  Did the Department improve this process following the audit?

It goes back to the factors leading to the underspend in 2017.  There was a lower uptake than we projected for both CCS and CETS.  One of the major reasons for that was practical.  The subsidies we were paying at the time were relatively low, relative to the cost of childcare.  For example, we were paying up to a maximum of &euro;95 for one of the payments.  We increased that to &euro;145 for 2018 because we recognised the gap was not bridgeable.  Similarly, we had a rate of &euro;50 that we increased to &euro;95.  We recognised that the difficulty was a trap whereby the subsidy that we were pitching was not sufficient to provide support for people seeking to use the scheme.  We addressed that and, by 2018, coverage had increased significantly and we were at the level that we predicted.  If my memory serves me, in a relatively short number of years we have gone from approximately 25,000 to approximately 60,000 people being covered by those schemes.  I would need to check the exact figures but it is of that order of magnitude.<\/p> <p>  We got there by 2018 but I fully accept that in 2017, we did not, and that was primarily for the reason I have described.

Everything the Department can do to support the sector is being done.

We have introduced what is called an area profile, needs assessment and service requirement tool, which is a bit of a mouthful.

They identify where services are falling short, where services are reasonably well provided and where the actual needs are.

The rules, as set out by Dr. Lynch's Department and transferred to Pobal, allowed for this to happen.  The Department changed the rules two years ago and the role of Pobal changed.  Reference was made to the recouping of &euro;937,000 in the year 2017-2018 and &euro;4.7 million in the year 2018-2019, which, nicely, is five times the amount from the previous year and seems to be a worrying trajectory in fairness but maybe it is not going to continue to &euro;25 million next year.  Hopefully, we are not going there.  Dr. Lynch has just said the incidence of fraud was very low, but low in what terms?  A sum of &euro;4.7 million is not low.  The Department has been able to recoup &euro;4.7 million from over-claims since the rules were changed.  Will Dr. Lynch explain how that figure has increased by five in a 12 month period?  Has the Department just become better at catching people or at claiming back?  Who is guilty?  Was everybody at it?  Was it the case that large providers copped on to the lack of governance and the availability of money?  Was it the CCS groups?  Who was doing it without knowing?  It is my view that small childcare providers would have known that if they did not have the child in front of them they could not get the payment for the child.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#Z02200","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560412800,"counter":403,"content":"<p>There are a couple of points there and I shall clarify some things.

Where a provider has made an overclaim, we give it the opportunity to dispute that and then we start to introduce penalties.  Currently, the penalty is that in year 2, if we find non-compliance on a second visit, we can withdraw its programme support payment or refuse to offer it to the provider.  That is the payment that amounts to &euro;19.4 million annually.  It is built into the compliance framework, contracts, etc. that we can refuse the provider access to that payment.  That is a lot of money for small services.  We can also refuse capital.  We have fairly good capital available annually, and not being able to access that is certainly a sanction.  The biggest sanction is that we are recouping it.  If a provider has overclaimed, we go in and change the PIP registration so that if the provider is expecting to receive a couple of thousand euro the following week, it will not receive that due to having overclaimed.

The person who looks after one's children is the most important person in the child's life after oneself.  Perhaps one's husband might be ahead, but the childcare provider is second after him.  It is because it is a caring, feminised profession that the pay is so low.  The Secretary General expressed his sympathy for the workers' situation, acknowledged their low pay and indicated his high regard for them.  However, sympathy, acknowledgement and high regard do not pay bills.  It is a matter of great concern that the pay for the mostly female workers in this sector is so low.  The Department has a role in regard to pay in the context of the focus on quality.  If staff are not adequately paid, we will not attract quality people and, as a consequence, children will suffer.  Although the Department does not actually employ the staff, it does have a function in this regard.  People are being paid &euro;11.93 per hour.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#BB00200","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":457,"content":"<p>I apologise for interrupting the Deputy but I must suspend the meeting at this point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#BB00300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":458,"content":"<p>Thank you, Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#BB00400","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":459,"content":"<p>To allow members time to attend votes in the Chamber and have lunch, I propose that we resume at 2.30 p.m.  I do not expect the meeting to continue for too long in the afternoon, but I will accommodate the members who are still waiting to speak.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#BB00500","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1560412800,"counter":460,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 1.25 p.m. and resumed at 2.35 p.m. in private session.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":461,"content":"<p>I welcome Dr. Lynch and his team.

People come into a very high-need area, become quite skilled and then move on to another area.  There are a number of pieces.  There are about 215 social workers trained in the universities every year.  We have recruited around 150 so we are getting a very high percentage of that new intake.  However, we are in competition with the HSE and the voluntary agencies.  The HSE is in a continual space for staff in disability services, elderly services and hospitals.  They have quite a high need as well.  Since our staff have come through the child protection and welfare side, they are seen as quite experienced and it is a fast upskilling so they are in demand in other areas.  A lot of young graduates also travel after a number of years.  We have discovered that staff will work for a period of up to two years and then leave because they can draw their contributions back down at that stage.  It is like a ready-made savings scheme.

Since it is a new agency and we have recruited quite a number of people, we have between 150 and 175 people on maternity leave at any point in time.  That creates the other demand.  They are not leavers but vacancies are created in the system for up to a year.  That is a constant churn.  We have developed a workforce strategy which includes the recruitment campaign and getting much more vocal about how a career in child protection and welfare is quite rewarding.  Despite the bad press that our business inevitably gets when something goes wrong, and that is quite serious, the overwhelming story from social workers is that it is a very rewarding workplace and a very rewarding career.  I see all the time that the effort and enthusiasm people put in goes way beyond what one would expect in a public sector organisation.  That has to be acknowledged in respect of staff who work in very difficult circumstances in some cases.<\/p> <p>  We have introduced a lot of change.  We have talked about this before in terms of services.  We have been training and developing people on a piece called Signs of Safety, a very good system that is trying to establish links for the child who is at risk with their family and local area.  It aims to maintain kids in their own environment, protect them, work with them and their family but also to draw others into that network so that the child is protected and remains in a family environment.  Social workers have made very strong statements about the usefulness of that and we have developed it around the country.  Those kind of initiatives are about changing the culture and the way we do business.  That has had an impact in terms of social workers looking at the business and saying it is a better way to do things.<\/p> <p>  We have a lot of initiatives looking at why people leave the organisation, better ways of recruiting and retaining staff.  It is not a secret that we have some areas that are very difficult to work in.  They are the areas where we struggle to retain and get people into.  Sometimes it is a circle that reinforces the vacancy problem, in that young newer graduates end up in those areas.  Their managers can often be relatively inexperienced so there is quite a high need to support them.  That is a challenge because it is probably the last place where new graduates should be.  We have tried to address how we support them, and how we can better train them and find better ways.  It has been a challenge in the public sector.  The rules around recruitment are there for very good reasons but we find it difficult sometimes to get the right people to the right place as quickly as we need to within the rules.  We have had to look at ways of trying to create pools of staff that we can use when we run into problems with staffing in particular areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#NN02100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Smyth"},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":545,"content":"<p>That information on the staff is very useful to have put on the record.

When Tusla was established, we were faced with a double challenge, one aspect of which was the availability of resources.  There was no policy in place at that time to ensure that those kids stayed with the families as much as possible, so kids got moved around.  Kids may still be moved around today, possibly because they have not settled in a particular placement or because there is some other issue.  Kids may be moved around in such circumstances, but in as far as it is possible, and this is something on which we are strong, we ensure that kids stay in their placements.  In the regions of north-east Dublin and Dublin-mid-Leinster there are approximately 250 instances of kids who are in foster care under private arrangements.  By and large, those kids remain in those foster care arrangements.  There is difficulty in finding local foster carers for them.  Once a child moves into private foster care, it is challenging to move him or her, purely because of attachments.  If the family support is good, the money aspect is seen as less important as the aspect of care for the child.  Ultimately, the objective is to ensure that the kids have a stable childhood that is as good as possible so that they become adults who can look after themselves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#OO00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Smyth"},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":558,"content":"<p>With regard to the 600 who are in other care rather than the regular fostering system, are addiction issues encountered?

Some calls are light while some are more serious.  In the early stages Tusla relies on the HSE computer system.  Does Tusla have a system of its own?

Referrals come from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, teachers, or medical professionals.  The volume was approximately 44,000 at that stage.  When we kicked off we had just under 10,000 unallocated cases, which means cases which are waiting to be allocated to a social worker.  Last year we had 57,000 referrals, which represents an increase of approximately 40% on that volume.  There are good reasons behind that.  The number of unallocated cases is down to 6,000.  That number is higher than we want it to be.  These cases are concentrated around five of our service areas.  We have 17 service areas throughout the country.  The unallocated cases are, in the main, in those five areas.  We have gone through the first reason that the number of unallocated cases is high, which relates to staffing.  We have also been doing a lot of work on our understanding.  When Tusla was created we had 17 separate areas.  We have a history going back to the days of the health boards, which is not that long ago.  It was 2005.  The systems remained independent of each other at that time.  We did not have the same way of dealing with referrals in each of those 17 areas.  The feature about which I talked earlier, the signs of safety model, is about ensuring that the same model of care and way of dealing with these cases is used across all areas.<\/p> <p>  Initial referrals into the system are normally triaged immediately and risk assessments are carried out.  HIQA has consistently found that, even in circumstances in which the number of unallocated cases is very high, Tusla does not leave kids at risk.  That initial process, within the first 24 hours, is about seeing whether the referral is high risk and whether the kid needs to be seen.  We then go into a process of initial assessment and then allocation.  Depending on the complexity of the case, the initial assessment can take a bit of time.<\/p> <p>  We are quite engaged in the analysis of the actual assessment and working with the people who refer children to us at the moment.  We get a lot of referrals from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We have been trying to work with An Garda, as well as with teachers, schools and others, to put in place systems which will give us a lot more information about the referral.  In light of the massive increase in referrals, we are trying to ensure that we get information that makes sense and on which we can make good assessments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#OO00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Smyth"},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":564,"content":"<p>For clarity, does mandatory reporting now exist?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#OO00900","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560412800,"counter":565,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019061300002#OO01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Smyth"},{"type":"speech","time":1560412800,"counter":566,"content":"<p>If a schoolteacher or nurse sees an issue, he or she must report it.

Let us say a foster child in the care setting does something inappropriate to a younger family member and Tusla is phoned.

Is that the case?  When Tusla arrives, I am sure the thinking of the social worker on the ground is that Tusla has a child in foster care and that child is the organisation's priority.

Cuba&rsquo;s relations with the EU have improved significantly in recent years, forming part of a general pattern of increased openness on the part of Cuba to re-engage with international partners. <\/p><p>This agreement is robust and comprehensive, consisting of three main pillars, namely political dialogue, co-operation and sectoral policy dialogue, and trade and trade co-operation.  The core aim of the political dialogue and co-operation agreement, PDCA, is to open channels of dialogue and co-operation between the EU and Cuba in order to assist the modernisation of the Cuban economy and society, strengthen human rights and democracy, and work together to achieve the sustainable development goals.  The agreement  provides for a comprehensive dialogue between the EU and Cuba on a range of policy areas, including human rights; small arms and light weapons; disarmament and non-proliferation; sustainable development; terrorism; serious crimes of international concern; unilateral coercive measures; combating illicit drugs; and combating racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance.  The agreement also provides for the development of co-operation, including on political and legal issues such as democracy, human rights, good governance, justice, citizens&rsquo; security and migration, as well as on social, environmental, economic and developmental issues.  Most of the agreement has been provisionally applied since 1 November 2017.  However, its full application requires ratification by all the EU member states once they have completed their own internal legal procedures. <\/p><p>Since establishing diplomatic relations with Cuba in 1999, Ireland&rsquo;s relationship with Cuba has grown significantly.  The visit of President Higgins to the island in 2017 was a high point in our relations and facilitated the further strengthening of ties between our two countries.  This visit also highlighted the interesting shared history between the two countries, with Irish emigrants having contributed to the economic, cultural and political evolution of Cuba over the years, and Cuban leaders having been influenced by the leaders of the Irish revolutionary and independence movements. <\/p><p>Cuba opened an embassy in Dublin in 2001 and Ireland&rsquo;s ambassador to Mexico is accredited to Cuba.  I welcome the ambassador here today.  The recent opening of two new missions in Latin America, in Colombia and Chile, has significantly increased our footprint in the region and has allowed our embassy in Mexico to dedicate greater resources to developing our relationship with Cuba.  The year 2019 marks the 20th anniversary of relations between the two countries and is being celebrated with a series of cultural events organised by our respective ambassadors. <\/p><p>Ireland and Cuba are like-minded on a number of multilateral issues such as disarmament, non-proliferation, gender equality and climate change.  We signed a memorandum of understanding on political dialogue with Cuba in 2015, and have since engaged in three rounds of bilateral political consultations, where such issues of mutual concern were discussed.<\/p><p>It is also important to acknowledge concerns about the challenging human rights situation in Cuba.  Ireland is keenly aware of the difficult situation that exists for human rights defenders and civil society actors in Cuba.  Ireland, together with the EU and our fellow member states, continues to encourage reform within Cuba, particularly in the areas of freedom of expression, the right to peaceful assembly, the protection of open civil society space and a free, fair and open judicial system. The EU and Cuba have an annual dialogue in the area of human rights and this agreement provides for further engagement in this extremely important area.  Encouraging steps have been taken by Cuba, including in the reform of the constitution, approved by referendum after a process of public consultation.  Among other reforms, the new constitution establishes the presumption of innocence in criminal proceedings and the right to<i>habeas corpus<\/i>, and extends a ban on discrimination, including on the basis of sexuality.  The PDCA recognises the potential contribution of civil society and specifically provides for further co-operation between the EU and Cuba in this area and encourages the active participation of civil society in the formulation and execution of development co-operation policies. <\/p><p>I thank the select committee for the opportunity to present this motion.  My assessment and that of the Department is that the PDCA provides a solid framework and welcome opportunity to strengthen both EU-Cuba and Ireland-Cuba relations, providing for closer economic and political ties, and it also helps to provide the framework for further constructive dialogue on the many human rights issues.  <\/p><p>I hope the select committee will support the motion, and that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann may approve the terms of this agreement so that Ireland may proceed to ratify it in the near future.  I am happy to take any questions members may have at this point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2019061300002#F00300","speaker":"1337"},{"type":"speech","time":1560380400,"counter":981,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State and call Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2019061300002#F00400","speaker":"1270"},{"type":"speech","time":1560380400,"counter":982,"content":"<p>This is a significant date in Ireland-Cuba relations.

It is the culmination of all of that work that we are at this particular step today.

There is great potential for further engagement between Ireland and Cuba, particularly on trade and I know some small groups are working on that.  However, the elephant in the room is the United States.  I am not sure how much progress can be made while that is not being addressed.  I have asked the T&aacute;naiste many questions on the matter.  I will quote from his reply to the most recent one: \"Ireland believes that the embargo serves no constructive purpose and that the lifting of the embargo would facilitate an opening of the island&rsquo;s economy to the benefit of its people.\"<\/p><p> For this agreement to really bring about progress and more positive effects for both Ireland and particularly Cuba, that needs to be addressed.  How can we trade with a country if there is an embargo and if there are also banking issues?  How can we apply pressure to get that blockade lifted?  We know it was lifted for a short time under President Obama and it has now come back again.  It is causing so many difficulties for people in Cuba.  How successful can this agreement be while the blockade is in place?

We have consistently supported the annual resolution put forward by Cuba, most recently for the 27th consecutive time.  One might argue that obviously has not changed things.  However, as a united European Union, we all need to continue to reiterate and consistently support that position at the UN General Assembly and wherever we have an opportunity to raise this concern.  Obviously there were conversations most recently with the President of the United States of America.  We need to use those channels, our strong relationship with the US, to raise these concerns at every stage we can.<\/p> <p>  As the Deputy has said, if the embargo is not lifted, there is only so much this overall agreement can do.

For countries like Cuba coming from where it came from in a relatively short period, a country like ours, which is totally independent, should use whatever influence we have to bring and help them along and to support their development.

It is important for an independent country like Ireland with no hard views one way or the other to support it.<\/p><p>I recommend that a small delegation of maybe a couple of Members of this Parliament should visit these countries at this stage of their development and report back so that we can find out at first hand what is happening.

That has all been transformed.  For many of us it is a shining beacon in that part of the world to see how a small country, despite all the pressure from a near neighbour, has developed.  Its education and health systems are examples for all of us around the world, no matter how developed our countries are.  The extraordinary thing for Cuba is that for all the tragedies around the world, it has sent its people in, for example in respect of the apartheid regime, and the invasion of Angola, when the Cubans stood with the South African people.  The recent peace process in Colombia probably would not have happened without the facilitation of the Cuban Government.  We have a lot that we can learn.  I refer to hurricanes and so on and to the doctors who are sent into the shanty towns and the poor areas.  There is enormous positivity.  Anyone who travels to Cuba meets the people.  It is friendly and safe.  It ticks all the boxes for a holiday.  Society is free and open and people feel comfortable.  Anyone I know who has travelled to Cuba wants to go back.  That is a great message to be sending out.  <\/p> <p>  There have been long connections between Ireland and Cuba and I hope they continue.  The  EU-Cuba Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreement is the first bilateral agreement between Cuba and the EU.  The EU is Cuba's second most important trading partner, its biggest external investor and the source of one third of the 3.5 million tourists visiting the island every year.  It is important that we have this agreement to build on and improve these ties.  However, to date, Ireland's trading relationship with Cuba is relatively poor.  This morning we have an opportunity to vastly improve this.  I urge the Government to investigate possible avenues where we can improve our trading ties with Cuba.  As the agreement will soon be ratified by all EU member states and will come into force, does the Minister of State know of any plans to send an Irish trade delegation to Cuba?<\/p> <p>  I refer to the issue Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan raised.  I have talked to some companies that wanted to invest in Cuba and increase those ties but there has been a monetary difficulty.  Has the EU discussed this?  How are they going to get around the US embargo?  It is the biggest difficulty for trade with Cuba.  There is difficulty for ships travelling with goods and so on.  I commend the Irish Government on consistently supporting the Cuban motion at the UN condemning this illegal blockade.  As the Minister of State said, it is the 27th time.  That is something we can be proud of as a country.  We have close ties with the US but, at crucial times, it is important that we stand up and speak up for another small nation.  Under the Obama Administration, some moves were made to loosen the blockade but the measures did not go far enough.  They probably came too late in the term of the Administration as well.  Progress was made towards a broad change, however.  There was a message that change was coming.  The famous handshake at the funeral of Nelson Mandela was the right message, not only in the context of the funeral but also more generally between the US Administration and the Cuban Government.<\/p> <p>  Unfortunately, the Trump Administration has tightened the blockade to levels never seen before.  This includes unilaterally imposed measures.  The US national security adviser, John Bolton, was speaking in Miami on the 58th anniversary of the failed Bay of Pigs invasion.  Miami is an important swing state and it is part of the difficulty of US Administrations that they are in thrall to this state, particularly to those who left Cuba.  Mr. Bolton confirmed that the US would fully implement Title 3 of the Helms-Burton Act, which allows Cuban-Americans to sue foreign companies if they trade with Cuba.  That is one of the difficult barriers that we will have to overcome.  It completely contravenes the commonly accepted rules of international law.  The US Government must not be allowed to impose extraterritorial measures and should immediately lift its illegal blockade.  That is what we are publicly saying and putting into law by passing this trade agreement.  Has the Minister of State discussed these extraterritorial measures with her European counterparts and is she working with other European governments to challenge the US Administration on these measures?  This is the next challenge that is going to face us.  Most important, trade involves finance.  On measures that penalise or make it more difficult to trade with Cuba, we need to signpost what they are and try to overcome them collectively.  I welcome the fact that it is being discussed.  I am a bit concerned that we were such a long time coming to it and would appreciate if the Minister of State can give us the background on that.  There is strong support in Ireland for this agreement.  Anyone who has travelled to the area is impressed by the quality of life of Cuban people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2019061300002#H00500","speaker":"1309"},{"type":"speech","time":1560380400,"counter":996,"content":"<p>We would all agree that we can learn something from each other.  We can certainly learn from Cuba and they can learn from us.  That is why it is important not just for Irish-Cuban relations but for EU-Cuban relations as well.  On the timelines, it is true that 20 other member states have ratified this already.  There are still some that have not, so we are not exactly last.  One of the biggest challenges has been Brexit.  There is no point in saying otherwise.  There has been a delay in terms of administration and staff in being able to process this.  At the same time, that has not prevented the actual application of this agreement, which has been in place for some time now.  A number of informal dialogues have been taking place since as far back as 2015 in anticipation of this agreement, particularly in the area of human rights.  The most recent one took place in 2018, in October I think, with the anticipation of this being agreed by all member states.  We have moved it along as quickly as we can.  There were other challenges in front of us; there was no other reason.<\/p><p>There are no plans that I am aware of at the moment but this is something we can raise with Enterprise Ireland.  The Global Ireland 2025 strategy is focusing on doubling our global footprint across the globe.  This region is of particular significance for us as well so if there are particular companies that have an interest, Enterprise Ireland would be very interested and happy to engage in that regard.  I believe a number of small Irish companies are actively pursuing opportunities in the Cuban market but as mentioned by many Deputies there are many challenges in terms of the embargo and also the Helms-Burton Act.  That is an issue we have raised, and particularly the T&aacute;naiste, at the foreign affairs committee.  The High Representative, Federica Mogherini, has raised that also in our discussions at the United Nations.  We have been asking for the US to reinstate the waiver that had previously been in place for six months at a time.  It was then reduced to 45 days and it is no longer in place now.  That is hindering matters and, as far as we are concerned, is contrary to international European law.  We are continually raising that issue to see if the waiver can be reinstated as quickly as possible.<\/p><p> Overall, relations between the EU, Ireland and Cuba have improved significantly in recent years.  This agreement shows a willingness and an openness for Cuba to re-engage on specific issues and areas of concern.  This gives us the platform to do that.  Also, the 20-year anniversary gives us a particular emphasis this year and an opportunity at home and in Cuba to see how we can strengthen that, not just in terms of trade or economically but culturally and otherwise.<\/p><p> I thank the Deputies for their support.

My primary focus in this address will be on business insurance.  I am very conscious of the difficulties that the cost and availability of insurance are creating for many businesses and voluntary and community groups.  I can understand the frustration that many people have with the existing position.  I believe that, with the objective evidence provided by the Personal Injuries Commission benchmarking report on the higher than average award levels for soft tissue injuries in the country, we have a solid basis for addressing these difficulties through the enactment of the Judicial Council Bill.  I will talk about that in more detail later.<\/p> <p>  The cost of insurance working group has made it clear from the outset that there is no single policy or legislative silver bullet to stem or reverse immediately premium price rises and that some of the necessary reforms will take time to implement.  This was also recognised by this committee in its motor insurance report.  The major constraints faced by any Government are twofold.  Award levels are the prerogative of the courts and therefore, for constitutional reasons, the Judiciary cannot be directed as to the levels that should be applied.  Second, pricing levels are a commercial matter for insurance companies and are determined based on the risks that they are willing to accept.  For legal reasons, the Government cannot interfere in such matters as this is prohibited by the EU Solvency II directive.  It was recognised that there was much the Government could do to improve the general environment within which insurers operate as well as laying the ground for a more long-term transformation of the insurance market through tackling issues such as award levels.  This is the context within which the work of the cost of insurance working group needs to be considered.<\/p> <p>  There has been significant progress in the implementation of the two cost of insurance working group reports.  Examples include addressing the personal injuries framework in Ireland through the establishment of the Personal Injuries Commission, and its subsequent two reports, the second of which benchmarked award levels for soft tissue injuries and made recommendations to address gaps that exist between this jurisdiction and others.  Another is the commencement by the Law Reform Commission of the examination of the possibility of capping awards in respect of some or all categories of personal injuries through legislation.  Insurance fraud is being tackled through closer co-operation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the insurance industry on foot of the fraud round table's work and the recent decision by the Garda Commissioner to develop a divisional focus on insurance fraud, which will be guided by the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau, GNECB, which will also train garda&iacute; throughout the country on investigating insurance fraud, as well as the recent success under Operation Coatee, which targets insurance related criminality.<\/p> <p>  The Government has made several legislative changes which are significant in the insurance reform debate and called for by stakeholders.  These include increasing transparency around the cost of private motor insurance through the establishment of the national claims information database, NCID, in the Central Bank as well as the Courts Service confirming that it will publish a more detailed breakdown of awards in personal injury cases in its annual reports; increasing the effectiveness of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board through the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) Act 2019; making it easier for businesses and insurers to challenge cases where fraud or exaggeration is suspected through amendments to sections 8 and 14 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004; and providing certainty to policyholders and insurers through the reform of the insurance compensation fund.<\/p> <p>  The committee should note that I look forward to the finalisation of the work of the Central Statistics Office, CSO, on a price index for business insurance as well as the Central Bank's work potentially to extend the scope of the NCID to include employer and public liability insurance, which at this point I believe it should.  I will also look at how we can speed up the work related to the development of a functioning fraud database, recognising that data protection concerns must be addressed before other issues such as the governance or location of such a database can be decided.  I believe that the cost of insurance working group actions taken to date have helped to create a much more receptive atmosphere for what we are trying to achieve with the reform of the area of insurance and personal injuries litigation, since there is a much greater understanding of the depth, nature and extent of the underlying problems and much greater support for what needs to be done to address them.<\/p> <p>  I believe that these actions have had a significant impact on private motor insurance.  CSO figures from May 2019, which is a small change from the script circulated, which indicated April, show that the price of motor insurance is now 24.5%, rather than 24.4%, lower than the July 2016 peak, almost three years ago.  My colleagues in Government and I are determined to continue working to ensure that these positive pricing trends can be extended to other forms of insurance, including those relevant to businesses.<\/p> <p>  I will address the issue which I believe is key in the next phase of work of the cost of insurance working group.  Bringing the levels of personal injury damages awarded in this country more in line with those awarded in other jurisdictions is the single most essential challenge which must be overcome if there is to be a sustainable reduction in insurance costs.  The Personal Injuries Commission has highlighted the significant differential between award levels in this country and England and Wales in particular, and has made a number of recommendations to address the issue, including the establishment of a judicial council to compile guidelines for appropriate general damages for various types of personal injury.<\/p> <p>  I believe that this awards gap needs to be closed significantly and I am working with the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, to ensure that this happens at the earliest opportunity through the enactment of the Judicial Council Bill, which completed Committee Stage in the Seanad in April.  Since then, the Government has approved the drafting of amendments for Report Stage in the Seanad, which will provide for the establishment of a personal injuries guidelines committee, the sole purpose of which will be to develop guidelines for various types of personal injury to be adopted by the judicial council.  The amendments are subject to formal legal drafting by our colleagues in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and I hope that they will be agreed on Report Stage in the Seanad shortly.  I have been informed that the Seanad will take this next Thursday.  The co-operation of all Members of the Oireachtas will be vital in getting the Bill enacted as soon as possible.  I know that I can count already on support from members of this committee.<\/p> <p>  It is to be hoped that this, along with the work that the Law Reform Commission has commenced, will result in the lowering of award levels.  If this were to happen, I would expect the insurance industry to take account of such reductions in its pricing.  Mr. Justice Nicholas Kearns, former President of the High Court and the chairperson of the Personal Injuries Commission, noted in the foreword of the commission's second report that insurance industry representatives on the Personal Injuries Commission repeatedly stated that because award levels and associated costs accounted for the bulk of the cost of insurance, if claims costs were to come down and to be maintained at a consistent and predictable level, then premiums would also reduce accordingly.<\/p> <p>  I want to address the establishment of a dedicated Garda insurance fraud unit.  It is important to clarify that the recommendation from the cost of insurance working group was to explore the potential for further co-operation between the insurance sector and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with regard to insurance fraud investigation.  While the issue, including the UK precedent, was explored in the report and the potential benefits were outlined, no commitment was given on this matter.  It was made clear that it was always subject to further examination and that any decision on this matter was always going to be for the Garda Commissioner.  Since my previous appearance before the committee last year, the Garda Commissioner has decided for operational reasons that a divisional focus is preferable to the establishment of a centralised insurance investigation unit.  I understand that this approach is aligned with a general divisional focused Garda model.  The Commissioner intends that the GNECB will guide divisions and provide training in the investigation of insurance fraud.  It is important to accept the expert view of the Garda Commissioner in this regard, and I am confident that this marks a key turning point in how insurance fraud will be investigated by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the future.<\/p> <p>  Aside from what we as a Government or the Oireachtas can achieve, I will address the legal profession and the insurance sector itself, which also have to play an important role in addressing the issues that some businesses are experiencing.  I have spoken in the D&aacute;il previously about the frustrations that exist among businesses and other groups regarding these two sectors.  In that respect, I met the Law Society and the Bar Council of Ireland and set out to both my belief that it was vital that they continued to give their public support and commitment to the Personal Injuries Commission's recommendations.<\/p><p>I accept the commitments which both have since made.  On the insurance side, I have put it to the industry that it needs to provide strong public commitments very soon to reflect savings to be gained from the recalibration of award levels.  In addition, it will be important for it to widen its risk horizons and to re-enter segments of the market from which it has previously exited as a sign of good faith that the claims environment should begin to stabilise once the Judicial Council Bill has been enacted.  <\/p><p> In the end, the availability and cost of insurance to some businesses will depend on the consistency and quantum of award levels.  The cost of insurance working group structure remains the best means by which to continue to achieve this objective.  The enactment of the Judicial Council Bill will also be an important step forward in this regard and I hope there will be support in the Houses to enable a speedy conclusion to this process.  In this spirit, I intend to work closely with Deputies Michael McGrath and Pearse Doherty on considering how to progress their respective insurance related Private Members' Bills, the Civil Liability and Courts (Amendment) Bill 2019 and the Consumer Insurance Contracts Bill 2017.  Along with the cumulative effects of the completed implementation of the two reports&rsquo; recommendations, this work will include views on increasing stability in the pricing of insurance for businesses and developing a more competitive insurance market overall.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019061300002#E00200","speaker":"1364","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560380400,"counter":1015,"content":"<p>With regard to the establishment of a judicial council, specifically the terms of reference for drawing up the new guidelines, how does the Minister of State envisage expediting the judicial council's review of the book of quantum?

It will subsequently be moved to the D&aacute;il as quickly as possible.  I apologise for repeating myself but it was understood that the Judicial Council Bill would be completed before the end of 2018.  When it become obvious to me, prior to Christmas, that it would be delayed I targeted its completion for the end of the summer session.  I believe that target can be realised.  We can get it through the Seanad on Thursday and have it back before the D&aacute;il before the end of the summer session.

I am of the view that the insurance companies should automatically send out a green card for every car insured here.  It is then a matter for individuals travelling to Northern Ireland or the UK to take that card with them.  The current position is that a person's insurance company will send their policyholders a green card on request.  I am not satisfied with that position as some people may not be aware that this will be a legal requirement and that the card could be requested on the side of the road in Northern Ireland or the UK.  The right thing for the insurance companies to do would be to automatically send a green card to everybody who has insured their cars.

The Minister of State is looking for the insurance companies to automatically issue green insurance cards without the insurance policyholder having to apply.  Post Brexit, companies that export to the UK will be required to have a customs registration number, known as an EORI number.  As it stands, exporters can apply for such numbers online.  From my understanding of the latest figures I have found, which run up to the end of May, approximately 84,000 businesses will need customs registration numbers, of which 46,500 have them in place.  Another 45% of exporters, approximately 37,500, do not have a number in place.  In order to prepare for the event of a no-deal Brexit at the end of October, could the Department of Finance engage with the Revenue Commissioners to automatically issue customs registration or EORI numbers to the remainder of these exporters now?  Could that measure be introduced?  It is in keeping with the Minister of State's view on the green insurance card.  To be ready for Brexit, it is critical that any company that exports - and the Revenue Commissioners indicate that there are approximately 85,000 such businesses - have EORI numbers in place.

I also welcome his remarks on my Bill which was passed on Second Stage nearly two years ago.  It was agreed at this committee that we would deal with amendments to it on Committee State in the second week of July.  As I know that the Government has issued a money message for it, I look forward to passage of the Bill into law.<\/p> <p>  In his opening statement the Minister of State said he had put it to the industry that it needed to give strong public commitments very soon to reflect savings to be gained in the recalibration of award levels.  Has he received a single commitment from it that this will happen?  We know that in 2002 the Irish Insurance Federation - Insurance Ireland's predecessor - made a very clear commitment when it outlined a list of reforms it believed were required and argued that if they were implementted, there would be a reduction in premiums by a certain percentage.  There was transparency.  I do not know if the Minister of State trusts the insurance industry, but I do not.  It is involved in price gouging and a lot of spin, bluster and distraction on the real reasons premiums are increasing.  I am not saying its issues such as the making of exaggerated claims and fraud are not real and do not need to be dealt with.  There is a need for zero tolerance in the attitude towards them, but when we see that insurance companies have increased their profits by 1,300% in one year and made a profit of nearly &euro;250 million on the backs of hard-pressed motorists and businesses that are seeing their public liability insurance premiums increase, that tells me that it is simply price gouging on the part of the industry.  Has the Minister of State received a commitment from it similar to the one received from the Irish Insurance Federation in 2002 when it stated clearly that if anti-fraud measures were to be implemented, they would result in a reduction of 2%; that if there were to be changes in the book of quantum, they would result in a 1% reduction; and that if the PIAB was to be involved, it would result in a reduction of 7.6%?  That was very clear and verifiable.  My concern is that while we need to do this in respect of the book of quantum and see An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na taking enforcing action on fraudulent claims, there is no guarantee that any of the reductions will be passed on to customers.

I have made strong statements on the insurance companies.  I do not hold them in high regard.  They always win.  They are the ones who charge premiums and are in charge of the allocation of an award, if one is made.  The sector decides the methodology to be used by which smaller claims remain on an insured person's record.  They remain on an insurance company's books for a significant period of time before being settled.  The most significant issue is the level of award.  The report of the Personal Injuries Commission highlighted the fact that the difference was about four and a half times the amount.  The Department of Finance has produced an analysis that shows that it was five times the amount, while the PIAB carried out an analysis that also showed that it was almost five times the amount.  I am talking about lower awards.  The insurance sector was also represented on the Personal Injuries Commission.  On occasion after occasion, it has stated that if award levels are reduced, premiums will be reduced.  I am the person who has said to the Chairman of the committee that it should bring in representatives of the insurance companies.  This is a public forum and the committee should put that exact question to them also.  I will put it to them company by company, but that will not happen in public.  I will adopt a very hard line to ensure what Deputy Doherty spoke about will not happen, namely, that insurance companies potentially will trouser the money if the level of awards comes down and premiums stay high.

It took into account road safety, the PIAB, a reduction in the incidence of uninsured driving, the promotion of rehabilitation, the abolition of stamp duty of 2%, the reform of the courts, anti-fraud measures, the exclusion of earnings from the black economy, a reduced number of solicitors for plaintiffs, the book of quantum and repeal of the Health Act.  The industry stated that if all of this was done, it would result in a reduction in premiums of 36.35%.  We have been here before and seen motor insurance premiums increase by over 70%, according to the CSO.  The industry tells us that it was all because of Setanta.

I am not saying insurance companies should not be profitable.  Of course, we need insurance companies that are profitable, but should they be making profits on the backs of drivers, businesses and those involved in community groups who are trying to run festivals?<\/p><p>No, they should not.  What they are not willing to give is a commitment that if we introduce reforms, such as those contained in the Judicial Council Bill, they will reduce premiums.  That is the problem.  They are making these profits at a time when they are stating that claims are far too high, that there is fraudulent activity, etc.  Yet, the claims were as high last year, the year before and for several years before that.  Fraudulent activity has been happening forever and a day.  I take a zero-tolerance position in respect of fraudulent activity and the Minister of State knows my position on it.  I believe strongly that we should have a centralised Garda enforcement unit.  This committee has agreed to invite the Garda Commissioner before it in order to tease out how we might look at the model he wants to deploy.

A good example is that the industry only reported 50 fraudulent claims in nine months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019061300002#H00800","speaker":"1288","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560380400,"counter":1064,"content":"<p>That is my point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019061300002#J00200","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1560380400,"counter":1065,"content":"<p>If the issue was as big as they say in all of their advertising, which is that it is costing everybody &euro;50 extra on their premiums, then there would be thousands of claims reported.  I have no doubt there are more than 50 fraudulent claims in the system.  However, the reality is that these companies are price gouging.  If we deal with fraudulent claims, if we enable the Garda enforcement action, if we are far more robust in regard to prosecution and deterring people from making fraudulent claims, I am not convinced the premiums will reduce a penny.  The core of this goes back to the point that these companies where gambling, and it was not gambling with people's premiums.  They were basically investing in the bond market with the premiums and when the returns fell, their profits fell.  They then put up prices to cover that fall.<\/p> <p>  We need to take a very tough approach.  There has been a kid-glove approach from Government, although perhaps not from the Minister of State.  Some of the Minister of State's colleagues have really let him down in a number of ways recently.  Unless we get clear commitments from the industry, I do not know how we can ensure that a private company which is based on profits for its shareholders is actually going to pass on any of the reductions or that any reforms introduced by the Oireachtas will benefit people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019061300002#J00300","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1560380400,"counter":1066,"content":"<p>I am not sure if the Deputy has heard me do so but I have made the point on numerous occasions that for every fraud case, there are hundreds of exaggerated claims, and for every exaggerated claim, there are hundreds of legitimate claims which are awarded funds on the basis of the book of quantum, in line with the award levels.  Fraud, we are told, costs the sector approximately &euro;200 million, although that is an industry figure and I do not have an actual figure.  The Deputy must remember that the vast majority of claims are legitimate and this a concern I have about something that is happening right now.  I applaud the strength with which the Deputy has consistently been opposed to fraudulent and exaggerated claims, as have I and most others also.  However, the big issue we come down to is that over &euro;2 billion was awarded to people in regard to claims, which is a huge quantity of money.  What we are trying to do is put in place a structure whereby people who are affected by a moderate incident get an moderate amount of compensation in damages to compensate them for that incident.  Again, I am talking about the lower levels of claims, not the higher levels of claims, and it is important to put that in context.  That was the nuts and bolts of what the Personal Injuries Commission report is about.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019061300002#J00400","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1560380400,"counter":1067,"content":"<p>Deputy John McGuinness took the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1560380400,"counter":1068,"content":"<p>I agree with the objective.  To take a hypothetical situation, if we pass the Judicial Council Bill and if we set up the council - there are a number of ifs - we may reach a position where that panel recommends, for example, that soft tissue injuries, such as whiplash, would be cut by half, given these make up the majority of claims in the first instance.  However, the industry is not indicating that this would result in premium reductions of X%.  There is nothing from the industry side.  Therefore, the industry has forced us into a dealing with a matter which we would deal with in any event.  If the claims are too high, they are too high.  If there are fraudulent claims, they need to be stamped out.  The problem is that the industry is sitting back and looking at its profits increase dramatically,  It then sees these reforms, which are only going to push up its profits unless it decides to pass them back.  If the industry is stating that high claims for soft tissue injuries are affecting the industry, it will be able to do the calculations and it should be able to turn around and say that if the book of quantum said X amount for soft tissue injuries, say, &euro;7,000 as opposed to &euro;15,000, that would result in a premium reduction for motorists of 10% across the board, although these are hypothetical figures.  The industry is not willing to do that and the question is why that is the case.  In my view, it is because it does not want to be held accountable.  We need to get the companies where they were in 2012, when there was an action plan and, although we were in the same type of crisis, there was a commitment from them.  However, Insurance Ireland is a different animal from its predecessor.  I would encourage the Minister of State to deal with that.<\/p> <p>  I want to talk about the Central Bank.  The Central Bank ceased to publish private motor insurance statistics in 2015.  The statistics published that year told us something very clear - I ask the Minister of State to remember this point - namely, that the average cost per policy, which combines cost per claim and claim frequency, in year one declined for both comprehensive and third-party fire and theft.  The average cost per policy decreased by 4% from 2014 to 2015, from &euro;272 to &euro;261 for comprehensive cover.  Third-party reduced from &euro;288 to &euro;272.  In terms of frequency, comprehensive policies saw a decrease from 5.2 claims per 100 policy years in 2014 when compared with the previous year.  The number of third-party claims decreased from 3.7 claims per 100 policy years.  In 2015, the statistics showed that the costs to insurers appeared to have fallen.<\/p> <p>  We had transparency when the Central Bank was producing private motor insurance statistics.  The last time it published them, in 2015, we were able to see that the cost to the insurers per policy was reducing for comprehensive insurance, the cost per policy was reducing for third party, the number of claims that were being made was reducing to 5.2 per 100 policies for both comprehensive and third party and the cost to the insurers was falling.  However, what happened to premiums in the same year that all of this was happening?  Premiums from January to December 2015 went up by 30%.  There is only one beneficiary of the Oireachtas or the Central Bank ending the private insurance motor insurance statistics and that is the insurance companies.  They can come in here and feed us bullshit about claims, about premiums and about this, that and the other, and we do not have the statistics to argue.  We have to rely on statistics from back in 2015, when we can see very clearly that everything was going in the other direction yet they decided to increase premiums by 30%.  I would argue strongly that we need to get those data back.  It is one of the big issues in terms of transparency.  We need to have the granular detail.  We need to know exactly what is going on with this industry - an industry that is under investigation both domestically and at European level, rightly so.  This would mean we can make a proper calculation of what is actually happening.<\/p> <p>  In my view, the CSO also has a role in the context of calculating the real cost of insurance for both motorists and businesses, an issue on which I have spoken to the Minister of State before.  I have huge regard for the CSO.  It is brilliant.  However, there is no point in the CSO telephoning and saying, \"Hello, AXA Insurance, this is Mr. so-and-so from the CSO, we are doing our monthly survey on insurance costs and we want to ask what is the price for this, that and the other.\"  The insurance companies are wise to this.  If I phone up looking for an insurance premium and the Minister of State phones up looking for the same, we can get two different quotes.  It is not that they know it is the CSO; the CSO introduces itself.  Therefore, there is now a question around the credibility of the CSO data.  The insurance industry itself disputed the CSO data when the premiums were increasing by 70%.<\/p><p>The other advocates and consumers are now questioning the CSO data because they believe it has been manipulated by the industry.  That is not something about which any of us should be shocked.  Deputy Michael McGrath spoke about the fact that the evidence from the Insurance Reform Alliance, consumer groups and our experience is that what the data is now showing does not reflect the experience of individuals out there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019061300002#J00600","speaker":"1288","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560380400,"counter":1070,"content":"<p>To respond to something the Deputy said previously, my colleagues in the Government did not let me down.

I appreciate that he has said he does not know from where the figures have come but I want to draw attention to the Alliance for Insurance Reform survey that was only circulated to us earlier.  There were 494 responses, with the largest sector being motor and transport, followed by hospitality, leisure, retail, not-for-profits, healthcare, arts and entertainment, with \"other\" accounting for 6%.  There were not that many questions but question No. 3 was answered by all 494 respondents.  It asked how much insurance costs have increased since 2015, and the average answer was 204%.  There is a question on whether an insurer had increased excesses or added new exclusions, and 28% of respondents having increased excesses, with 11% seeing new exclusions, 23% seeing both and 36% seeing neither.  There is a question as to what three phrases best describe the impact that increasing insurance premia has on an organisation.  From the possible responses, 48.5% of respondents indicated it threatened the future of the organisation, 45% stated it inhibited the ability to grow and 32% indicated it was preventing the organisation from providing certain services while 25% stated it made jobs less secure.  Respondents were also asked if the Government is doing enough to address the insurance problem.  Of the 494 respondents, two said \"Yes\", 23 did not know and 469, or almost 95%, said \"No\".  That is not a personal attack on the Minister of State.<\/p> <p>  That is a flavour of the issue.  These are people who took the time to respond to the survey and they are involved with the industry.  We have had people in here who run play centres, events festivals, playgrounds, local authorities, pubs and restaurants.  I do not doubt that every time the Minister of State goes to a public function, people are talking about insurance.  I am the chair of a school board and I know such boards that have seen their premiums go from &euro;27,000 to &euro;34,000 per year with no new claims or incidents.  Once a group package agreement is over, the charge is being increased by significant amounts.  Insurance is necessary for most people and they cannot afford to be without it.  The Minister of State was a member of this committee when we did our work on motor insurance, and 92% of people are not claiming.  This means 8% of people have caused the premium rises.  The legal and insurance industries may be making now but we had figures indicating that at a time they certainly were not making money.<\/p> <p>  There is a significant frustration and I would be happy to progress  the Judicial Council Bill 2017 as speedily as possible in the Seanad next Thursday.  Report and Final Stages will be taken and the legislation could be passed very quickly.  There may be 30 Government amendments.  I am certainly happy to progress it as fast as possible.  We were ready to take it in the Seanad as soon as it was offered and no other Bill delayed it.  We were happy to process it as soon as it was scheduled for us.  The Minister of State's opening statement lists all the good work being done, and the Bill is a part of that.<\/p> <p>  I do not wish to portray all insurance companies or legal people as evil.  I have family members who are involved with solicitors, etc.  The awards available to people for what seems to most people to be minor incidents are an attraction.  I have said it previously in the Seanad that if people are caught trying to rob a bank, they would probably go to jail and end up with a sanction but people who make a false insurance claim, by and large, end up with no sanction if they get caught.  They can come back next week to try again.  We are bringing in the Garda Commissioner, which is helpful, as well as insurance company representatives.  It is morally and socially unacceptable to make exaggerated claims and stage accidents.  There is a cost.  There was a social welfare campaign with the line, \"Welfare cheats cheat us all\", and insurance fraud is costing every one of us.  Most of us with cars will not make a claim but premiums continue to increase.  I acknowledge that I experience a small drop following a large increase over a couple of years in my premium.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the work done by the Minister of State but when does he think restaurants, pubs and charity events will benefit from meaningful reductions?   We know this is about reducing the volume and value of claims.  With motor insurance, it is also about having fewer accidents and crashes.  When does the Minister of State believe there will be meaningful results?  These businesses are closing and are under pressure.  He knows this as he is doing that work.

The only insurance one is legally obliged to have is motor insurance.  Motor insurance was where the cost of insurance working group started.  There has been a 24.5% reduction from the peak in 2016 in that sector.  The 2016 increase figure of 69% was from a very low base arising from a price war that turned out to be a catastrophe for the sector.  When the cost of insuring a vehicle was less than the cost of a windscreen, it did not work out well for any of us.

A woman responded and said that we should tell the judges what to do now that we have a panel of seven.  We do not have the authority to do that under the separation of powers.  People think the Government should tell judges what to do.  We are putting a structure in place and if it is required, the LRC will make a determination on whether we have the authority to do so.  If not, and there is no change in the amounts, the only way the Oireachtas can acquire the authority is via a referendum.  We are prepared to consider that, depending on the outcome.  I do not wish to have to take that path but if we must do so, it is something we will consider.<\/p><p> In addition, people have the perception that the Government should price insurance.  A major editorial by a well respected business newspaper stated that the Government should consider entering the insurance market.  We are expressly prohibited from doing so by law.  People have a perception that the Government should do this, that and the other in areas where it is disallowed.  We cannot go there.

It probably will be, but it will be at the end of the year.  One is then looking at a decision on the formation of the committee taking longer, the formation of the committee taking longer and the decision within the committee taking longer again.  If we do not get this done before the end of the session, it could be the end of 2020 before it happens.  That would be a catastrophe.

The sooner we go down that road, the better.  Then we will get to a situation where we have fair insurance for our young people, for example, who are completely extorted, our taxi drivers will not be facing a situation where their livelihood will be lost if they have one claim against their insurance, and we will get past the situation where huge numbers of small businesses, festivals and so on in this country literally have their livelihoods and their ability to continue to function viably threatened because of insurance extortion by insurance companies.<\/p> <p>  I commend the work that has been done on a cross-party basis, including by the Government, the Minister of State and others, in dealing with legitimate issues.  There is no doubt they are legitimate issues.  Insurance fraud is wrong and it has to be dealt with and stamped out.  There should be no excessive awards.  There should be fair rewards for fair and legitimate claims.  We should not have a situation where legal costs are essentially driving up the cost of insurance for people and we should do everything we can to eliminate unnecessary legal costs and all the other matters we have talked about to have some sort of consistency in awards.<\/p> <p>  There is nothing in any of this update that will prevent the profiteering.  That is the problem.  The insurance companies will continue to profiteer for as long as they can.  Why would they not?  They always have and unless we do something to stop them profiteering, they always will.  I put it to the Minister of State that this is the problem with all of this and the evidence is now starting to come in, because whatever claims they could make that all these sorts of reforms were necessary in order for them to bring them into line, and they were not making money and so on are gone now because they are making money.  They are making a lot of money, they are not dropping the premiums, and I do not believe for one minute that they ever will.  That is why the Minister of State cannot get that assurance from them in writing because they will not ever give it in writing.<\/p> <p>  To be honest, there is nothing that we are proposing that will force them to reduce premiums to fair and reasonable levels because that is not the business they are in.  They are not in the business of ensuring that people get fair insurance premiums.  They are not even in the business of making sure that everybody who needs insurance gets it because, as we know, they will exit from areas where they cannot make a profit if they feel like it.  They just decide not to provide insurance in that area because they cannot make a profit.  They go where the profits are and they will use every compulsion and pressure on the Minister of State and on us to get us to take measures which will drive up their profits.  What compulsion is there on them to feed those increased profits back into fair premiums?  I put it to the Minister of State that there is none.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019061300002#N00200","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1560380400,"counter":1127,"content":"<p>I have heard this position being presented before, that not-for-profit insurance companies are the way forward.  However, those companies would be obliged to adhere to the same Solvency II rules as a for-profit company.  They would have to adhere to the same EU directives on insurance and capitalisation as a for-profit company.  While the figures look very rosy, the issue is that they are only profitable for motor insurance.  The employer's liability, EL, and the public liability, PL, side are loss making and have been loss making for five or six years.  I will give the Deputy the figures on this.  The liability insurers made underwritings of loss outside of motor insurance in 2017 of &euro;46.9 million.  That is the liability and what they lost to underwrite the EL and PL side of insurance.  There is not much profit there.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is asking to open the State up potentially to making losses in that sector.  It is something that is not the right direction.  We have the right pathway.  The Deputy has commended all of us on the work we are doing on this.  I try to be fair to all Members of both Houses and the help and support on this is total.  Nobody is trying to implement an ideology or to be political.  We are all trying to put in place a better sector so that businesses can get a fair premium, stay trading and employ people for the benefit to society that brings.  There is a profit on motor insurance but there is no profit on the liability side and we cannot just ignore that this is the case.  The &euro;227 million profit from 2017 is broken down into a &euro;126 million overall profit.  Motor profit might be more than that but the public liability is removed out of it because it is in a loss and there is a &euro;100 million profit from investments.  Those are the figures.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy's line to me is effectively to keep the spotlight on the insurance companies, and I will do that.  The figures we have to date are for almost &euro;200 million in profit from three companies in 2018.  The profits are up again from 2017.  I can only assume that for the other five major companies which have to report, the figures will also be increased.  I do not want profiteering in the insurance sector.  I want companies to be profitable, because if they are profitable, they stay, they underwrite accordingly, they underwrite well, and they treat their clients properly.<\/p> <p>  I am not sure if the Deputy has heard me make the point that on too many occasions I have had people with me who have been contracted with an insurance company for years or decades and then suddenly, because the risk appetite is not there or it just suits the insurance companies to exit, it leaves.  To me, that is an appalling treatment of somebody that a company has been contracted with for years or decades.  That is wrong, it does it because it suits it, and that is because the insurance company potentially is reducing its risk appetite because it is easier to do so than to stay in the sector.  I will keep the hard line to them, as I know the Deputy will when they come in here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019061300002#N00300","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1560380400,"counter":1128,"content":"<p>The problem is, and the Minister of State did not really respond to this point, that there is nothing we can do apart from keeping the spotlight on them, to use the Minister of State's phrase.

Again, he was injured and could not play sport again for four weeks.  After listening to discussions about exaggerated and fraudulent claims, he rang me.  He was feeling guilty.  When I asked him if his case was fraudulent, he said it was not.  When I asked him if he exaggerated his injuries, again he said he did not.  When I asked if his award was within the guidelines, he stated it was.  He got &euro;14,500 which was the correct amount of money for an award in the book of quantum.  If we have to pay out every time somebody gets an injury on a football field, the damage is being done with the levels of awards, the period in which they are being settled, the issue being dragged out over years, and inconsistencies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019061300002#O00600","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1560380400,"counter":1136,"content":"<p>I agree with all of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019061300002#O00700","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1560380400,"counter":1137,"content":"<p>That is good because we do not always agree.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019061300002#O00800","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1560380400,"counter":1138,"content":"<p>We do not.

I am not sure how much of a positive impact this will have on the cost of insurance for ordinary citizens and businesses.  It will take time, because it will have to go through the Oireachtas.  Then a committee will have to be set up in the Judiciary, which will have a review and will then decide.  We could still be discussing this in two years, with no change having been made to awards.  As far as I am concerned this is one leg of a stool.  The Minister of State indicated in his initial comments that there is no single silver bullet.  As far as I am concerned one of the legs of this stool is the awards being paid out by the Judiciary.  This problem has been caused by the Judiciary because it has increased the awards on an annual basis.  It has been shown that on average, there has been an increase of between &euro;700 and &euro;900 per annum in a variety of awards, without any justification.  I hope that we get the Judicial Council Bill 2017 through the Seanad and the D&aacute;il as quickly as possible.  I hope that the Government initiates the necessary legislation as quickly as possible in order that this proposed committee, which I have not yet seen, can be established as quickly as possible.  I hope that we do not need to bring legislation forward to provide for a cap on damages.  The perception is that the Government is dragging its heels on this issue.  I do not believe it is.  This is a complex matter but we need to deal with it quickly because as people have indicated, businesses, farmers, communities, festivals, shows and ordinary citizens driving their motor vehicles are suffering as a result of this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019061300002#Q01600","speaker":"1438"},{"type":"speech","time":1560380400,"counter":1195,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.

I know that employer's liability and public liability are different things, as the Minister of State said.  However a business is a business.

Nothing has happened and there has been no change, in spite of what I read in various media outlets.  There is the odd press release claiming that the cost of insurance has come down but it has not.  It has not come down in the transport business; it has actually significantly increased.  A man sent me a text message this morning because he knew this meeting was coming up.  He told me that in his business, insurance costs have increased during the past three years by 200%.  The mart operators appeared before us.  They simply cannot get insurance.  People outside the Oireachtas who are watching and listening to what we are doing are not interested in the different avenues one must travel to deal with the different headings of insurance.  They are interested in one thing, namely, whether their house insurance, motor insurance and public liability and employer's liability insurance have gone up.

The Minister of State mentioned that it went to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  Is that not really the problem?  So many within Government have a finger in the pie of insurance, in terms of legislation or regulation, that this will get dragged on forever.  The insurance companies love it because once they see the Government struggling to get to grips with it, then they are getting away with it.  They are making vast profits.  They are not charities.  They would not be in the business for the sake of charity or without profit.  They are making profits.  They have concealed or kept information from us.  They have been reluctant to deal with the Minister of State and with the working group.  They have had to be dragged to that table.

I am talking about the pathway to how we get the reform done.  I am obliged to be interested.  I am obliged to adhere to the principle of separation of powers.  I am obliged to highlight that the State does not have any role in the pricing of insurance products.  I cannot ignore these points.  I am determined to do the work that I am doing, rather than ending up wrapped up in court for years.  However, if I do not take the correct pathway, that is what will happen and that serves no one.<\/p><p>The Chairman said marts cannot get insurance.  I was in a mart three weeks ago and that mart has insurance.  On the Chairman's point on whether the cost of insurance is going up, yes the insurance for marts is expensive because the successful marts are putting between 600 and 1,000 large animals into a venue with people.  Some of the work practices in some of the marts are not good.  I have raised this with the main insurer of the marts in the country, which is one particular insurance company.  Many of the health and safety reports done have concluded with the works being carried out, and this has ensured that those marts are insured.  Some of the smaller marts potentially do not have enough business to cover the extra work that must be done to bring up the health and safety standards.<\/p><p>I have seen the film &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; with the Bill Murray character.  I am unsure whether the Chairman is Bill Murray but there is a character in the film call Phil and Bill Murray comes along every day and greets Phil.  I have been here before and I keep pushing our proposals and the work that we are doing.  The cost of insurance working group has been on the go for 30 months.  We have highlighted how all these proposals would take time.  I am unsure whether the Chairman is Bill Murray and I am Phil or <i>vice versa<\/i>, but we are nearing the end of it.  In particular, we are nearing the end of it for what I consider to be the biggest issue, which is the level of awards.  When we are done and we get the level of awards down or reduce them, my role and that of the Chairman and the committee will be to keep the spotlight on the insurance companies to ensure they do not try to pocket potential windfall amounts because we will have reduced the awards to the point where people who are damaged from a moderate injury receive a moderate payment.  That is what we must do.  We cannot allow the insurance companies to do that.  I am absolutely determined in this regard, as I know is the Chairman.  The Chairman has as great a role as do I because he has a public forum to which he can bring in the insurance companies, one by one, and keep the hard line on them, as I do in private.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019061300002#R00400","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1560380400,"counter":1203,"content":"<p>That does not seem to be working.

That cannot be endured.  One sector cannot hold all of the other sectors to ransom.  One insurance company insures most of the marts.  Most of the marts have experienced significant increases.
