There are about 5,187 adults, 1,400 families and 3,000 children homeless.  The impact on the children is quite shocking.  Our system to deal with homelessness is close to collapse, if an additional burden is put on existing services which are very stretched.  In 2014 Fr. Peter McVerry said it was a national emergency, but it has deteriorated seriously since.  It is shocking that only 638 social houses were built in 2016, of which 384 were built by local authorities.  Approximately 5,800 private houses were built in 2016.<\/p>  <p>  I will address the various initiatives.  Rents are exorbitant.  The average rent in Dublin is &euro;1,744 per month and &euro;1,100 nationally.  At all levels of the continuum of housing policy, the position is very serious and grave and the initiatives put forward have clearly failed.  The development contribution rebate scheme has produced negligible results, while the infrastructural scheme for affordable housing has had very poor outcomes and results.  So far seven units have been provided under the repair and lease scheme.  On the much-vaunted planning change in repect of over 100 houses, did anybody see the advertisement placed by An Bord Plean&aacute;la on 1 August apologising for the delays in planning due to an inability and as lack of staff to progress and process planning applications?  Above all, there is no overall focus on or plan for affordable housing.  Most of those who are homeless will continue to remain homeless for an undue length of time and more people will become homeless.  It is reckoned that about 90 people become homeless every month, although the Government does not publish figures any more.  Likewise, for the foreseeable future most people will struggle to afford to pay rent and to buy a house unless there is a fundamental shift in policy.<\/p>  <p>  Does the Taoiseach accept that the Government's policies are simply not working and have not worked for the past few years and that there is a need for radical change in the provision of both council and affordable housing?  The social housing list includes about 120,000 people and only 600 social houses were built last year.  People want to be in a position to afford to buy a house.  Does the Taoiseach accept that there is no overall plan to provide affordable housing, either for rent or to buy?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000003#A00200","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1505912400,"counter":7,"content":"<p>I want to start by saying some words about Jimmy Magee.  It was with great sadness that we all learned today of the death of this iconic sports commentator.  His commentaries were legendary and based on a breadth of knowledge of sport that was peerless.  He also had an innate sense of timing, which often meant that his descriptions of events became as memorable as the events themselves.  He was part of the fabric of Irish sport and lived and breathed sport.  He would talk about, reminisce and recall sports events with anyone and everyone.  Although his voice may now be silent, the wonderful memories created for us by the Memory Man will live on forever.<\/p><p> To answer the Deputy's question, on my own behalf and on behalf of the Government, I very much acknowledge the stress that is being endured by many families and people who are facing homelessness at present who are staying in emergency accommodation.  As I have said previously, homelessness is a stain on our society.<\/p> <p> When it comes to the larger issue of housing, which, of course, is much broader than homelessness, we are absolutely aware of the need to ensure that more affordable housing is available for people.  It has long been the case in Ireland that those in the 20s and 30s can aspire to buy their first home.  That is now increasingly difficult, not because house prices are higher than they were ten years ago but because mortgages are more difficult to get and, of course, the availability of new houses and apartment is very much less than it should be.  These are issues that the Government is very much attuned to, and issues where we acknowledge that more progress needs to be made in the time ahead.<\/p> <p> It is important to point out some of the progress that is being made.  Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin accurately listed many of the problems.  It is important to balance that by mentioning a little about the progress that is being made.  For example, today, and indeed every working day, 80 individuals and their families will be housed by the State, that is, there were roughly 19,000 new tenancies last year.  We anticipate 21,000 new tenancies this year, which is a significant response to a serious problem.  Also, we have had the development of the family hubs, of which the Deputy would be aware.  That has allowed us to reduce the number of children and families in bed and breakfast accommodation and hotels by almost half in the period gone by.  The hubs provide much better and much more appropriate accommodation for families able to do their own laundry and cooking, etc.<\/p> <p> We have a plan, which is Rebuilding Ireland.  It is working.  It is funded to the tune of &euro;5.4 billion over the period of the plan but we acknowledge that more needs to be done.  The Deputy will have heard already from the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, some of the additional measures that are taking place.  For example, house building itself is ramping up considerably.  We expect 2,500 social houses, that is, council houses and apartments, to be built this year.  That number will rise to approximately 5,000 next year of which 3,800 will be built directly by local authorities, others will be acquired through Part V and others - long-standing voids - will be brought back into use.  We are getting to the point where we are starting to see supply recover but we are very much in catch-up mode, but catch up is what we intend to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000003#A00300","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505912700,"counter":9,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach's reply, with the greatest of respect, illustrates the disconnect between the Government rhetoric and talk and the reality on the ground.

There is a scandalous lack of services for families with children with disabilities.  There is an absence of scheduled respite care services, especially for adults with intellectual disabilities and complex needs, including autism.  These families believe they have been abandoned by the State.  They are living in a perpetual crisis, under continuous stress, with no break because they cannot avail of proper respite services.  As I am sure the Taoiseach knows, it gets worse as parents get older, get sick or their loved ones develop more challenging behaviour.  Last night on RTE's \"Prime Time\" programmme we heard the story of Adrienne Murphy and her son Caoimh, a 14-year-old boy with autism.  His mother was forced to make a desperate public plea to the HSE to provide residential care because she simply could no longer cope.  He is in a hospital bed used to treat burn victims, not in a facility dedicated to meeting his particular needs.<\/p>  <p>  Following last night's programme the Taoiseach may deal with Caoimh's case, but what about the others?  In my constituency of Louth and Meath East I am contacted regularly by families who are in similar situations.  Sam is an 18-year-old with severe autism, challenging behaviour and complex needs, which often result in violent episodes.  His mother is battling to access a respite care service.  Sam recently turned 18 years and is no longer eligible to avail of respite care services for children.  As such, he is now without access to any respite care service.  His family are exhausted and distressed and constant worrying about what might happen if there is a family crisis or illness and they cannot care for him.  His mother has met the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris.  She has built a campaign but believe her son's needs remain invisible to the Government.  <\/p>  <p>  Adam is a 42-year-old who is non-verbal and has high-support needs.  His parents are elderly and at their wit's end.  They have cared for him for all of his life with very little support from the State.  This is another family who cannot secure a residential placement because no funding has been found.  There is no real, fit for purpose, way to provide proper services for these citizens.  The system is chaotic and disorganised and it is left to the endeavours and ability of individual families.<\/p><p>Budget 2018 provides an opportunity for the Government to make real differences to these families.  What measures will Government introduce to ensure citizens, such as Caoimh, Sam and Adam, receive the dedicated services they so urgently need?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000005#C01700","speaker":"1330","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505913900,"counter":30,"content":"<p>The Deputy will appreciate that I am unable to comment on individual cases on which I do not have the details and that even if I do have the details of individual cases it is not possible for me to breach client or patient confidentiality without the permission of the client or patient to do so.  That said, in regard to the case of Caoimh, the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, and the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, are very much aware of it and met this morning with officials from the HSE and the Department for an update on the discussions on residential placements.  The HSE has been working on this case for some time and I understand that there will be further contact today with the young man's mother.  We are informed that this is not a funding issue and that a residential placement will be funded once the application has been accepted.  The HSE has been providing ongoing care to the family thus far in terms of home supports.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to support for people with disabilities in general, it is important to acknowledge the work that is being done by the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, and the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath.  There was a &euro;90 million increase in funding for services for people with disabilities this year and an increase in the disability allowance for the first time in eight years.  Children with severe disabilities, those in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance, for the first time now receive a medical card by right regardless of their parents' income, which acknowledges the enormous cost of health care for many parents with children with severe disabilities.  Approximately 10,000 children who previously did not have a medical card now receive one by right and a further 40,000 no longer face reviews.<\/p>  <p>  Decongregation is very much under way.  This is happening in my own constituency and, I am sure, in Deputy Adams's constituency.  Old institutions, where people with disabilities were kept in Florence Nightingale-style wards, are being closed and those people are being moved into community houses, which is much better accommodation than they had previously.  Dedicated funding has been put in place for emergency placements, which is of crucial importance.  An issue that had been a big problem in previous years, namely placements for school-leavers, has been improved dramatically.  It is important to acknowledge that progress, which is very real and is being experienced by hundreds of people and their families every year.<\/p>  <p>  There is, of course, always more work to be done and we acknowledge that.  This week, for example, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, and the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, announced &euro;10 million in funding for pre-activation supports for people with disabilities who might be able to move into employment.  As this is an issue Deputy Adams has raised in this House many times, I hope he will take the opportunity to welcome that.<\/p>  <p>  We acknowledge that there are two areas that will require additional investment in the years to come: first, respite, because respite provides a life line for families, giving them the break that they need while their loved one spends a period in respite and, second, the issue of people with disabilities who are living with parents who are now in their sixties and seventies and getting on in years and are understandably concerned about what will happen to their son or daughter with a disability who is still living with them when they pass on or they become unable to look after him or her.  They are two areas that will require additional investment in the years ahead.  However, it is important to acknowledge those many things done in this year alone to improve the lives of people with disabilities and, of course, their families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000006#D00200","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1505913900,"counter":31,"content":"<p>With respect, Taoiseach, it is not good enough.

We will certainly miss him.<\/p>  <p>  I want to ask the Taoiseach about the forthcoming budget.  With there being fewer than three weeks to budget day, it is important that we have an honest debate in this Chamber about the choices we face.  During the past few days we have had the opening salvo in a phoney war between the Government and Fianna F&aacute;il.  On Monday the Taoiseach made it clear that he would like to increase the threshold above which people pay income tax at the higher rate.  This proposal, designed to give no benefit at all to the poorest half of the working population, would clearly be regressive and its impact would be marginal.  For someone earning &euro;40,000, the gain would be the grand sum of &euro;4 a week but only for the richest half of the working population.  I hope it is clear that this bad idea should not manifest itself in the budget.  Fianna Fail's view is that instead the 5% rate of the universal social charge, USC, should be lowered.  Again, it would be a regressive measure, albeit marginally less so than the Taoiseach's proposal.  It would benefit more people but only to the extent of &euro;2 a week.  It would be a tragedy if these were to be the only options with which we would be presented which would deliver a paltry dividend as against using the same sum of money, a modest enough &euro;200 million, to make a real difference in the provision of services.  Reducing college fees by &euro;1,000 would cost &euro;74 million; cutting class sizes in both primary and secondary schools would cost only &euro;22 million; raising the wages of all those who work in the child care sector to a living wage would cost &euro;63 million; and eliminating waiting lists for home care packages would cost &euro;18 million.  These are four substantial changes the Taoiseach could afford to make rather than giving a token amount to people who could really live without it when there are such pressures on services. <\/p>  <p>  My question is straightforward.  Will the Taoiseach accept that, having regard to the tight fiscal space available, that this year there is insufficient space to cut taxes?  Will he give a commitment that instead, for at least the coming year, he will devote whatever resources are available which will be modest enough in the grand scheme of things to making a meaningful investment in public services that would make a difference to the people?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000007#E00800","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1505914800,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I should first state clearly that the budget has not yet been written or agreed to.

The first is to balance the books.  For the first time in ten years, we will produce a budget which will balance the books.  That may not be a politically popular thing to do, but it is the most important thing to do because when an economy is growing, we should balance the books and pay down our debt.  We will do both because we will not repeat the mistakes of the past made by other parties, although we will learn from them.<\/p>  <p>  The second thing we will do is increase spending on public services and infrastructure.  We estimate that when account is taken of the full-year cost of measures previously announced and commitments made, as well as the additional fiscal space, public spending will increase by approximately 4.5% next year.  That equates to a spending increase on services and infrastructure of between &euro;1.5 billion and &euro;1.8 billion.  We will do that and also find some space for tax relief.  We think that is the right thing to do because 2 million people work hard, of whom 1.4 million pay income tax and USC.  They produce the wealth that allows us to do all of those other things and I believe they deserve a break in the budget.  For that reason, we will find some space to give them an increase in their take home pay and a tax reduction that they deserve which, in turn, will allow them to spend more on their families and more in the economy, thus creating employment for others.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the statistic the Deputy used for the richest and the poorer halves, he should bear in mind that 30% of people have been taken out of the USC and tax net.  We have taken 30% of the 50% to whom he referred out of the tax net altogether.  Is it not right to say to people who are in the middle income bracket and still pay USC and income tax and who very often believe they pay for everything and get very little in return that there should be something in the budget for them also?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000008#F00300","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1505914800,"counter":43,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach might acknowledge that I know something about forming budgets.

Is it the case that they have got their bit?  The line seems to be that the Government has taken them out of the USC net and that is enough for them.  The 30% on the lowest incomes who are getting by will get nothing because they are not part of the coping classes on which the Taoiseach's focus groups are focused.  He talked about learning from the mistakes of the past.  If we have learned anything from them, it is that one cannot be all things to all men and women and that one cannot spread a bob for everybody and make a meaningful difference.  If resources are scarce, the only progressive thing to do is to ensure we have quality public services which make a difference to the people who depend on them.  I have instanced some examples, but many things could be done on the capital side.  I will instance them again for the Taoiseach when we get closer to the budget, but let us have the debate, not a phoney war or kite flying by the Government and Fianna F&aacute;il to test the temperature.

The Deputy can bring that up on Leaders' Questions the next time.  On 23 February 2015, Apple announced to major fanfare its biggest project in Europe to date, a &euro;1.7 billion investment in two data centres to be located in Athenry, Galway, as well as in Denmark.  It had plans to create hundreds of local jobs in construction and operations, providing amenities for local schools and residents, as well as running the plants on clean and renewable energy from the outset.  Nearly three years on, the plant in Denmark is set to be up and running before the end of the year, as per Apple's projected schedule, while the plant in Athenry has not even secured full planning permission yet.  Apple announced last month new plans to build a second data centre in Denmark at a cost of more than &euro;800 million, which will also run entirely on renewable energy.  Apple considered 19 countries before settling in Ireland for one of the data centres and there was great excitement about job creation possibilities, opportunities for small, local businesses and communities, as well as the spin-off benefit of other multinational companies coming to Ireland on the back of such a successful global company choosing Ireland as its base.  Last week, Bloomberg reported that Apple is reconsidering its decision to locate in Ireland as it is concerned that even if the Commercial Court approves the application in October, there could be further objections down the line to further delay the project.<\/p>  <p>  There is a serious worry that the second Danish plant could be a replacement for the plant planned for Galway.  It is scheduled to begin operations in the second quarter of 2019.  There is a bigger underlying issue of concern as Ireland is sending a signal to other large multinational companies looking for a European base that planning in Ireland can be mired in delays, with large infrastructural projects being held up for years on the back of minor objections.  The fear is that any multinational company examining Apple's experience in Galway may not consider Ireland.  We will be bypassed for a country with progressive planning laws, where governments do everything possible to create inward investment.<\/p>  <p>  This is not about Galway or Apple but rather it is about Ireland.  Will the Taoiseach give a commitment to this House and the multinational companies across the world that Ireland's planning laws will be changed to ensure this scenario will not be repeated?

There are currently 27 data centres in the country and the Government is very keen for the Apple data centre in Athenry to go ahead.  It involves a capital investment of &euro;850 million which will provide 300 construction jobs and 150 on-site permanent jobs.  It will be one of the biggest capital investments in the west of Ireland, matched only by the Gort to Tuam motorway.  Planning permission was originally granted by Galway County Council in September 2015 and affirmed by An Bord Plean&aacute;la in August 2016.  However, as Deputy Grealish mentioned, the planning permission is currently subject to judicial review in the Commercial Court.  The Government looks forward to a speedy decision in that case.<\/p> <p> I met the vice president of Apple approximately two weeks ago.  We discussed Athenry.  She reaffirmed Apple's commitment to going ahead with the project.  Notwithstanding that another data centre is going ahead in Denmark, provided planning permission is granted Apple remains committed to the Athenry project, which I very much welcome.  However, the Apple representatives made it very clear to me that they are frustrated at the planning and judicial delays and while that will not affect this project it will colour decisions that they might make about future investments and, therefore, I share the Deputy's concerns in that regard.<\/p> <p> The Government is considering a change to the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act to include data centres as strategic infrastructure, thus allowing them to get through the planning process much more quickly.  In July, my Department established a high-level working group comprising the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, the IDA, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, EirGrid and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Energy.  It will develop a strategic policy approach to the development of data centres in Ireland, including the possible designation of areas for suitable development as data centres and also the identification and resolution of planning issues and infrastructure requirements including the energy requirements of data centres.  <\/p> <p> The Government is very keen for this project to go ahead.

Companies such as Microsoft, Google, Facebook and medical device companies such as Medtronic, Boston Scientific and Merit Medical have been very successful as a result of their Irish operations.

However, no formal notification has been received by the HSE from the manufacturer of its intention to discontinue access to the scheme which, as the Deputy said, is unprecedented.<\/p>  <p>  It is completely inappropriate and unethical for any company to link reimbursement decisions to a compassionate access scheme and I would consider it unscrupulous if the company was not to honour any commitments which is it has made to patients.  The Minister for Health has directed the HSE to seek assurances from the relevant hospital, that is, Beaumont Hospital, that appropriate care arrangements are in place in the event of the access problem being this continue by the company and that appropriate ethical guidelines has been adhered to for this access programme.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has carefully considered the pricing and reimbursement of the medicine through its decision-making process and there is insufficient evidence to suggest patients would drive a clinically meaningful benefit from this treatment.  At the heart of the assessment process is the rationale that decisions about the reimbursement of medicines in Ireland are made on an objective and scientific basis, taking into account expert opinion, as appropriate, and recognising the health needs of the population and other factors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000015#N01000","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1505918100,"counter":138,"content":"<p>In an article in the <i>Sunday Independent<\/i>the Taoiseach set out his vision for the country to 2027.

There is no point in producing a planning framework that says the country will look like this in 2040 and then producing a capital plan that does not align with that.  There has already been public consultation.  I understand that there is a procedure in the D&aacute;il under which the national planning framework must be debated and adopted - that is in legislation so there will, of course, be a D&aacute;il debate on it.

Cabinet Committees A, B, C, D and E met last week.  The next meeting of Cabinet Committee D has yet to be scheduled.<\/p>  <p>  Cabinet Committee D covers housing, climate action, infrastructure investment and delivery, and the national planning framework.  Among other issues, this committee will provide political oversight of our efforts to deal with the housing and homelessness crisis and our transition to a sustainable, low-carbon economy.<\/p>  <p>  Providing affordable, quality and accessible housing is a priority in A Programme for a Partnership Government.  The previously constituted Cabinet committee on housing met regularly to oversee the development and implementation of the Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.<\/p>  <p>  On 14 June, I outlined to the House my view that while Rebuilding Ireland is working, it may not be enough.  I tasked the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, to review the plan and to consider what additional measures may be required.<\/p>  <p>  The first set of measures, with a particular focus on homelessness, was presented following the recent summit with local authority chief executives.  Yesterday, the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, announced a further set of measures in relation to the rental market.  Further announcements will be made over the coming weeks.  Work continues on implementing the actions already in the plan.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to housing, the new Cabinet committee covers a wide range of infrastructure investment and climate action.  These are two of the most significant challenges facing the country and were considered at a special meeting of the Government on 19 July 2017 in Kildare.  Following this meeting, the Government published Ireland's first national mitigation plan.  Prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015, the plan is an initial step to set Ireland on a pathway to achieve decarbonisation by mid-century in line with the Government's policy objectives.  The Cabinet committee will help to ensure a co-ordinated approach across all Departments to this transition.<\/p>  <p>  The Government recognises that increasing capital investment in our public infrastructure is also required.  Targeted increases in capital expenditure will support the efficient growth of our economy and the delivery of Ireland's climate objectives.<\/p>  <p>  Decisions in relation to this increased capital expenditure will be informed by the review of the capital plan, published last week.<\/p>  <p>  The Cabinet committee will help drive the development and delivery of infrastructure and associated policy through the forthcoming national planning framework and new ten year national investment plan, both currently under preparation.  This long-term approach will provide clarity and certainty in planning and capital expenditure, while facilitating a sustainable approach to meeting Ireland's future investment needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000018#Q01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1505919900,"counter":227,"content":"<p>There are four Deputies offering.

Will the Taoiseach outline his views on whether it would be a good idea to reconfigure NAMA as a new national housing delivery agency to supplement and complement the work done by local authorities which obviously also have to be prime drivers in these matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000019#R00300","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1505920500,"counter":232,"content":"<p>Six years of failed and flawed policies by a Fine Gael and Labour Party Government and, more recently, a Fine Gael, Independent and Independent Alliance Government have left us with a national housing and homelessness emergency.  I want to know more about the references the Taoiseach belatedly made - six years too late - to the possibility of NAMA, instead of flogging land and property as it has done for the past six years, being transformed into an agency to deliver social and affordable housing.  I know that the Taoiseach is fond of jogging and will be familiar with the Nike slogan, \"Just do it\".  I am wondering if he will just do it, albeit six years too late.  Will he just do it and transform NAMA into what it should always have been, namely, a vehicle to deliver social and affordable housing, using what is left of its land banks and assets?<\/p>  <p>  Today Dr. Rory Hearne and Dr. Mary Murphy from NUI Maynooth added their voices to those of Fr.

This is very relevant in the context of our capacity to deliver housing, if what she says is true.

There are 90,000 homeless households, including 3,000 homeless children, while three homeless citizens died over the summer.  It all comes down to an ideological question.  Sinn F&eacute;in believes every citizen has the right to a home.  we believe it should be a constitutional right, but the Taoiseach's Government does not share that belief.  It is clearly of the view that this fundamental right should be subject to the whims of the market.  In other words, the profit motive dictates the way in which the Government deals with the homelessness crisis.  In my constituency and across the north east the number of homeless children has increased, but the Government has ignored the gravity of the issue.  There is a special need for the Government to limit the grounds on which landlords can evict citizens; we should be keeping citizens in their homes.  This week's Residential Tenancies Board quarterly rent index report found that rents in Dublin were 10% higher than they were at the peak of the Celtic tiger.  The Government is failing to protect renters.  Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il have opposed motions we have introduced to introduce rent certainty, with rent reviews being linked with the consumer price index.  I welcome the decision to extend the rent pressure zones to include Drogheda which should have been included in the first instance.

Will he explain the status of his statement about NAMA?  Has the issue been considered by the Cabinet committee or the wider Cabinet or is it just something that was inserted at the last minute to try to grab a headline?  The Taoiseach knows that for nearly two years we have been pushing for a significant role to be played by a changed NAMA in helping to make up the huge deficit in social housing.  It is extraordinary that 4,000 units offered by NAMA last year to local authorities were turned down.  That is extraordinary when there are 3,000 children in emergency accommodation in hotels.

I would like to see that in writing from a European body, not an academic.  If I did see that in writing from a European body I would certainly be interested.  As in the case of all capital spend, not only housing spend, there is capital smoothing provision under the European rules which allows for only one quarter of it to be counted in the first year.  I would be interested in any European document that states that there is some sort of exception made if a country has a right to housing in its Constitution.  I would also be interested to know whether countries that have a right to housing in their constitutions have a homelessness problem, which I suspect they do; whether they have people on housing lists, again I suspect they do; and whether they have people who cannot afford homes, which I expect they do because a right in a constitution does not build homes.  Developers and local authorities build homes and this, I believe, is where the solution lies and not in rights that may not be realised on the ground.  I would be interested to learn if those countries have a homelessness problem.  I expect we will find out that they do.<\/p>  <p>  The wording of the proposed amendment put forward by one of the parties opposite appears to suggest that there would be no limits on eligibility such that everyone in the State would be entitled to social housing, which I imagine would be akin to what was done in eastern Europe in the Communist countries, whereby everyone would be required to live in a government-owned apartment block.

I refer to some construction or consultancy firms that are awarded big State contracts and are then often found to be up to this sort of practice.  For example, on foot of a question I raised in the D&aacute;il prior to the summer recess, a raid was carried out on the building site where the regeneration of Dophin's Barn is taking place during the summer because the workers on that site had not received payslips for two months.  They were working on a public contract project.  That raid was carried out subsequent to my raising the issue here, but, as of the last report I heard, those workers still have not received payslips.  Is that not incredible?  This is a public contract for a major job and those workers are not getting payslips.  I contend that is due to bogus self-employment practices, but that needs to be investigated.

Will the Taoiseach consider measures like that for firms that are awarded public contracts and then found to be up to this sort of sharp practice?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000021#T00400","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1505921700,"counter":268,"content":"<p>Will the Cabinet committee on social policy and public service reform examine the crisis faced by young people in receipt of jobseeker's benefit, who, as a result of Government policy, have had their income sliced from &euro;193 to &euro;102 a week?

Therefore, what is in those will be prioritised but no decisions have been made.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding unemployment, the target is to reduce unemployment to between 5% and 6% and to reduce long-term unemployment - there will always be a certain number of people who are in between jobs or out of work for some reason - to less than 2.5%, which is a target we can achieve but it is not one that will be easy to achieve.  Those targets are updated and reviewed from time to time.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Howlin was correct in what he said.  The participation rate - it is a different thing - is the number of adults who are working or involved in the workforce.  Our participation rates are still relatively low by European standards and they are lower than they were the last time the economy was this strong.  We want to see those increase significantly in the years ahead.  The Action Plan for Jobless households, published by the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, very much sets out how we can do that in terms of extending activation to more groups of people and increase participation rates.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of participation rates by people with disabilities, I very much agree with other Members of the House that I want to see the number of people with disabilities who are able to take part in the workforce improve in the time ahead.  A number of measures have already been taken in that respect.  Only last week the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, and the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, announced &euro;10 million in funding for pre-activation supports for people with disabilities to assist them to enter the workforce.  Before I finished my term of office as Minister for Social Protection, I changed the rules around the free travel pass to provide that if a person in receipt of a disability allowance or an invalidity payment takes up employment, he or she will retain their free travel pass for five years.  Also, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is changing some rules around the disability allowance because many people in receipt of that allowance fear that if they take up a job and it does not work out, they will find it hard to get that allowance again.  The Department will change the rules to provide that a person can have their claim suspended for a period of time, 12 weeks or longer, to enable them to try working and if it works out for them, that is great.  If it does not, they will be automatically reinstated on their disability allowance.  In addition to that, we will change the income limits around medical cards for people who are on disability allowance and other disability payments.  From the survey we have done, we have found that the biggest single fear people with disabilities have is that they will lose their medical card if they take up employment.  We have already agreed to change the income limits for people who are on disability payments.  The Minister for Health intends to legislate for that in 2018.  We will also raise the target for the percentage of people with disabilities employed in the public service from 3% to 6%.<\/p><p>I am delighted to see the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection in the House because her Department is almost at the figure of 6%, but other Departments and agencies are not doing quite so well.  One of the things we discussed at the Cabinet committee was having a bespoke recruitment campaign or bespoke access to positions for people with disabilities because if somebody who has a disability goes up in an interview against somebody who does not, he or she will be at a disadvantage.  Perhaps what we should do is have dedicated positions or a dedicated entry route for people with disabilities.  They were the things that we discussed and on which we agreed to make progress at the Cabinet committee.  The main discussion was about the ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  I have explained the reason for the delay in that regard.<\/p> <p> On the young jobseekers issue, it is welcome that the number of young people who are unemployed is falling rapidly and much faster than the general level of unemployment, which is extremely encouraging.  In Great Britain and Northern Ireland, for example, the jobseeker's payment for young people is &pound;50 or &pound;60 which is unbelievably low and it is not the case that welfare rates are set in London.  One of the changes we have made is that any young jobseeker who does anything else will receive the full adult payment.  If he or she take a place on a community employment, T&uacute;s or Gateway scheme or goes back to education or if he or she is a carer, he or she will receive the full adult payment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000021#T00600","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505922300,"counter":271,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach did not answer my question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000022#U00200","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1505922300,"counter":272,"content":"<p>That is the answer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000022#U00300","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1505922300,"counter":273,"content":"<p>About public procurement and public contracts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000022#U00400","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1505922300,"counter":274,"content":"<p>We are out of time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000022#U00500","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Issues","time":1505922300,"counter":275,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000022#U00550"},{"type":"question","time":1505922300,"counter":276,"qnumday":7,"qnumall":"[32321\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000022#U00600","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if the Cabinet Committee on Brexit will be retained when Cabinet committees are re-established.","asker":"1330","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1505922300,"counter":277,"qnumday":8,"qnumall":"[32896\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000022#U00700","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the status of the all-island civic dialogue.","asker":"1330","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1505922300,"counter":278,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 8 together.<\/p><p>The Government has approved the establishment of a total of six Cabinet committees, one of which will deal with EU affairs and Brexit.

I understand the very good reasons the Government disengaged or halted the bilateral work on contingency planning, but we all cannot stand back and look at an emerging train wreck and allow it to happen before being flabbergasted by the consequences.

We are working to maintain as close a trading relationship as possible with the United Kingdom so trade can continue.  That is what we are working towards.  Initially there will be a long transition phase, during which the rules of trade would remain the same, and after that a free trade agreement with the United Kingdom in which the rules of trade would remain much the same.  We are clearly just one of the parties negotiating in this space.<\/p> <p> In the North all I can say is I strongly encourage the political parties in Northern Ireland to come together to form an Executive and have the Northern Assembly up and running.  Deputy Adams has expressed the wish that Northern Ireland should stay in the customs union and European Single Market; it would be useful if the Assembly and Executive said that, and it would certainly strengthen the position of those who wish to ensure there is no economic or trade border between North and South.

Local officers from my Department have been in ongoing communication with the Southill Pathways to Employment scheme.  I am pleased to advise that they have resolved the matter and obtained adequate insurance for the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  By way of background, the responsibility for acquiring insurance cover for community employment, CE, schemes rests with the CE sponsoring organisation as the legal employer.  The annual budget provided to CE schemes includes an amount to cover consumable services and materials, including insurance, necessary for the effective operation of the project.  The Deputy is aware that in last year's budget, the capitation grant was increased.  My Department has become aware in recent times of an increase in insurance premiums for CE schemes.  A number of representatives from CE schemes whom I have met since my appointment in June have brought this to my attention.  The main reason cited for this is an increase in claims frequency over recent years by such schemes.  In this context, schemes are asked to be especially mindful of their obligations under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to be aware that CE employers are at all times independent contractors for all purposes and, in those circumstances, it is not possible for the Department to become an insurance agent.  Adequate insurance is required to cover schemes' legal liabilities.  My Department recommends that schemes seek alternative quotes to ensure they get value for money, as has happened in this case.  Also, if CE schemes are not filling their contracted number of participants, it is recommended that they align their insurance requirement with actual participant numbers.  We are all aware a number of CE schemes around the country have a number of vacancies.  In any cases where a scheme is experiencing particular difficulties, as this one was, the sponsor should contact the local Intreo centre or my office, where assistance will be given in as much as is possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000023#V03300","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1505922900,"counter":322,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for confirming that the matter at Southill has been resolved and my constituents will be delighted with the official confirmation.

How is that calculated and how does it anticipate what the insurance will be from year to year?<\/p>  <p>  There is a broader question.  I know the people in Southill, both participants and staff, went through a great deal of anxiety and distress, feeling obligated to contact their public representatives because for several weeks it looked as if the scheme would close because of a lack of insurance.

The rise some community employment schemes have experienced in recent years has nothing to do with the capitation grant and probably more to do with current societal issues.  It is fair to say that because of the 72 actions the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, took in regard to the insurance industry, insurance companies have started to reduce their premiums by approximately 20% to 25%.  That was probably the reason it was possible to get better value for the Southill scheme when it shopped around.  I am not blind to the fact that others have expressed a difficulty in getting the same premiums they had last year or the year before, but I hope to see the 20% to 25% reduction filter through to all.

Only 5% to 8% expressed dissatisfaction.  In real terms, of the 120,000 people who have been assisted under the scheme in the past 18 months, 368 have made a complaint, which is a tiny proportion.

It is not working and there are serious problems in relation to what it was intially set up to do - to get long-term unemployed persons back into work - but it is not doing that.  One concern is that Intreo offices are now referring people who are weeks and, in some cases, days unemployed and certainly by no stretch of the imagination long-term unemployed to Turas Nua and Seetec.  Another is that people engaged in part-time work such as looking after children or other family members and so on, or other work that suits their needs and means and who only sign on for a couple of days a week are now being referred to JobPath and hounded by Turas Nua and Seetec.

I have had several discussions with the Deputy on this issue and I am always surprised by his view of an organisation that was contracted to activate persons on a long-term unemployment register and help them to find work and which is actually working, as indicated by the fact that jobs have been found for 14% of those who have attended JobPath programmes, significantly ahead of the 8% target.  It is paid only if it achieves a positive result.  If it does not find a person a job, it is not paid.  It is only paid when it finds a job for a person who has been long-term unemployed.  If the Deputy can find statistics which show me that it is working outside its remit, I will deal with the matter.  However, he cannot escape the fact that this activation programme was established and sub-contracted to two companies who employ 1,000 Irish people to work with other Irish people who are long-term unempoyed in order to find them jobs.

Substitute teachers who do not know the days they are going to be working and do not have contracts are being hounded by JobPath, Turas Nua and Seetec.

The question he did ask was about the remit of the Low Pay Commission.  <\/p>  <p>  The Low Pay Commission was established through the National Minimum Wage (Low Pay Commission) Act 2015.  Its principal function is, once each year, to examine the national minimum hourly rate of pay and to make a recommendation to the Minister regarding the rate, ensuring that any recommendations are evidence based, fair and sustainable, and do not create significant adverse consequences for employment or competitiveness.  The 2015 Act also allows the Minister to request the commission to examine and report its views and recommendations on matters related generally to the functions of the commission under the Act.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that Ireland's statutory national minimum wage and the living wage concept are not conflated.  The living wage is a voluntary societal initiative centred on the social, business and economic case to ensure that, wherever it can be afforded, employers will pay a rate of pay that provides an income that is sufficient to meet an individual's basic needs, such as housing, food, clothing, transport and health care.  <\/p>  <p>  In doing this, the living wage concept does not distinguish between types of earners, for example, between primary breadwinners and second earners such as students in part-time jobs. <\/p>  <p>  I currently have no plans to amend the remit of the Low Pay Commission.  On the basis that there was a significant difference between what it returned last year and this year I have made discreet inquiries as to how the deliberations take place, the exact listings for considerations put in place and how they differ from those of the body that deliberates on, considers and arrives at a living wage.  I am happy that members of the Low Pay Commission are working very effectively and strongly together.  Although I was in Estonia the week it was announced I welcome the 30 cent increase in the minimum wage this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000025#X01700","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1505924100,"counter":353,"content":"<p>I was not confused.

Last year there was a derisory 10 cent.<\/p>  <p>  It is almost 18 months since the Government was formed and it has yet to provide any guidance to the Low Pay Commission to even allow it work towards its target of &euro;10.50 an hour which is in the programme for Government, let alone a real living wage of &euro;11.70 an hour.<\/p><p>The Labour Party proposed that the mandate of the Low Pay Commission should be changed to target the minimum wage to 60% of the median wage by 2021 to deliver a living wage for all.

At the end of July 2017, approximately 54,000 people were in the category described by the Deputy as casually employed or in part-time employment.  The current days-based system can provide significant income supports to jobseekers who are casually employed.

The proposals contained in the Bill are the result of extensive consultations.  They include public consultation by the former Department, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, following the University of Limerick study of zero-hour and low-hour contracts, in addition to detailed dialogue with ICTU and IBEC for several months.  The Bill aims to address a number of issues that have been identified where current employment rights legislation can and must be strengthened to the benefit of employees, particularly low paid and more vulnerable employees, without imposing unnecessarily onerous burdens on employers and businesses.  Officials of my Department are working closely with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  I met the Attorney General last week to raise certain queries arising from the heads of the Bill to determine whether I could enhance them.

Therefore, I will be honest with the Deputy and tell him the current position.  No more than in the Deputy's own office, this issue comes across my desk in my office in County Meath quite regularly.  It has been raised by women in the past two years and will obviously accelerate in the coming years.  The women in question, on reaching pension age, are being told when they seek their pension that they are not entitled to what they expected to receive and they are seriously aggrieved about it.  When we consider the overall sum of &euro;20 billion that comes out of the Department every year, we note that &euro;7.5 billion goes towards pensions.  It is a sizeable amount.  An extra &euro;200 million was added to the pot this year just because of the number of people who turned 66 years this year.  The rate of payment, as the Deputy and all of us know, is based on a yearly average, a condition that was introduced in 2012. <\/p>  <p>  I will not read what is contained in my written response because the Deputy already knows what it states.

I am told that we will be able to have the public consultation process in a number of months.  A maximum period of 12 weeks should be sufficient to engage in public consultation with the industry, unions and affected individuals.  More importantly, it is question of starting the development of an IT system that will allow me to move everybody's pension payment to a total contributions pension payment.  The discussions we will have will involve some winners and some losers.  That will be politically difficult because nobody ever wants to see anybody losing.  We need to have a conversation collectively about how we will pay pensions, on what they will be based and how they will be calculated.  As we all know, the pot of money from which they come is in surplus, but it will not be for the next number of years.  It is a question of from where the funding will come.

In fact, the big gap in tax revenue by comparison with most of our European counterparts is precisely the shortfall in employers' PRSI contributions.  It is precisely the source from which one would want revenue to pay for pensions and to end what the Minister has accepted is completely unacceptable discrimination, mostly against female pensioners.  The position on the commitment made by the former Minister for Social Protection and now Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar, who he said he understood the issues involved, promised that we would move towards lifetime contributions and said that he would deal with the inequities resulting from the averaging system and that there would be a report within six months, is slightly alarming.

Hundreds of millions of euro are spent on pension reliefs for very wealthy people.  I do not mind such measures for ordinary people who are putting away a few quid for their pensions, but very wealthy pensioners - multimillionaires and so on &ndash; are putting money away and receiving significant tax reliefs for gold-plated pensions.

Rent supplement is a statutory means-tested scheme, paid at differentiated rates of payment according to an applicant&rsquo;s means and accommodation requirements.  It is normally calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of rent, has enough income at the rate of supplementary welfare allowance, SWA, appropriate to his or her family circumstances, less a weekly minimum contribution.  This ensures that the payments are targeted at those most in need of assistance.<\/p>  <p>  The standard weekly minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources is &euro;30 for a single person and &euro;40 for a couple.  Many recipients pay more than this amount as they are required, subject to their income disregards, to contribute any additional assessable means over and above their appropriate SWA rate towards their accommodation costs.  Income from employment and family income supplement in excess of the standard SWA weekly rates of payment attract an additional income disregard and are assessed as follows: the first &euro;75 of such additional income together with 25% of any additional income above &euro;75 is disregarded for means assessment purposes.<\/p>  <p>  Any changes to the rent supplement scheme can only be considered in a budgetary context and within the scope of the overall resources available, not just to my Department but to the Government.

It is given from one arm of the State in order to supplement a family's income.  From a HAP or rent supplement perspective, in assessing that payment it forms part of a family's income and cannot be disregarded.<\/p>  <p>  I take issue with the Deputy in regard to HAP.

There is an income disregard, but all of his or her income, regardless of whether he or she is working in a full-time or part-time job and in receipt of FIS, is taken into account.  The reason family income support is so effective is that it gives an income supplement to people who are on low incomes.  From a rent supplement perspective, we are not going to treat people differently, whether they have a full-time job and cannot manage to look for rent supplements without supports or whether they are in receipt of FIS as well as a low-paid job when seeking rent supplement.

In this way, income support payments such as disability allowance, invalidity pension and carer's allowance are designed to play an important role in addressing social exclusion and minimising the possibility of hardship for recipients.  The application and decision procedures reflect this overall objective.<\/p> <p> Evidence from national income surveys such as the CSO's Survey on Income and Living Conditions, SILC, shows that social transfers do play a very significant role in reducing poverty and hardship by cutting the risk of poverty for people with disabilities in half.  These results demonstrate effective social protection spending and Ireland continues to be among the best performing EU countries in reducing poverty and inequality through social transfers.   <\/p> <p> Nonetheless, I can assure the Deputy that a reduction in measured poverty rates for people with a disability is a key priority of the Government.  We will continue to keep the range of supports under review as well as implement the comprehensive employment strategy for people with disabilities.  I think the Deputy will be aware that we launched the Ability programme on Monday, a new structure is being rolled out in all of our EmployAbility services and the Make Work Pay strategy is implemented.

If people give all the information at the outset then hopefully they will never get to an appeal because if they are entitled to something, they should get it.  If they give all of the information required for a successful outcome, they will get a successful outcome.  I can say genuinely that some people expect to be refused so they hold something back for the appeal and when the appeal comes, they give the Department further information.  If I can do nothing else, it is to reiterate to people applying for any social welfare payment that it is their money and that they are entitled to it.  If they have made contributions, they will get the benefit and if they have not, they will get an allowance that will be mean-tested but it is taxpayers' money and it is a social contract that is designed to ensure that people are uplifted at a time when they need it most - be it through a disability or the loss of a job.

These measures were introduced to protect young people from welfare dependency.  In many cases, they have had a very positive outcome because our youth unemployment figures have gone from here to here, which is very positive.  I do not think it is just because the payments have been reduced but I do think it has been a factor.  In short, the answer right now is &quot;No&quot;.  The simple reason for that is because if young people under the age of 25 do anything else other than receive jobseeker's benefit or allowance, they will get the full payment of &euro;198 so if young people at home want to be carers or take part in a community employment scheme, back to education or training with their local ETBs, they have a variety of ways of increasing that payment from either &euro;100 or &euro;147, whatever the age happens to be, right up to &euro;198.  As of today, there are no plans to change that.  <\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House  <\/i><\/p><p>Should a young jobseeker on a reduced jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payment participate on an education or training programme they will receive a higher weekly payment of &euro;193 which is the maximum personal rate for jobseeker's allowance.<\/p><p>The CSO's August 2017 monthly unemployment report showed that the seasonally adjusted youth unemployment rate - persons aged 15-24 years - was 12.7%.  While this remains a high figure, it is notable that it represents a decrease of 4.5 percentage points from 17.2% in August 2016. <\/p><p>I am committed to ensuring my Department continues to identify effective measures to incentivise and support young people in finding and securing sustainable jobs.  The best way to do this is through engagement processes and by incentivising them to avail of educational and training opportunities thereby enhancing their employment prospects.<\/p><p>The National University of Ireland Maynooth is examining the effectiveness of the reduced rates in encouraging young jobseekers to avail of education, training, employment programmes and opportunities.  Initial results of the research were published as a working paper and these are being considered by the Department. <\/p><p>The 2017 Estimates for the Department provide for expenditure this year on jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance of &euro;2.16 billion.  The full year cost of increasing the age related reduced jobseeker's rate to the maximum jobseeker's rate of &euro;193 per week is estimated to be just over &euro;109 million in 2018.  This estimate is subject to change over the coming months in the context of emerging trends and associated revision of the estimated numbers of recipients for 2018.<\/p><p>From March 2017, rates of jobseeker&rsquo;s payments were increased for claimants of all ages as a result of measures introduced in budget 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000030#CC00900","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1505927100,"counter":429,"content":"<p>I have a very serious question for the Minister.

I know I would unable to do so and I dare say she would be unable to do so but the Government expects people of that age to live on that amount.  One of the consequences of this discrimination, which was introduced by Fianna F&aacute;il and presided over by Fine Gael and Labour, is youth homelessness, which is a growing problem.  According to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, in July, 826 people between the ages of 18 and 24 were homeless.  A total of 789 young people were homeless in January 2017.  There has been a 78% increase in youth homelessness over the past three years.  Those figures are provided by Focus Ireland.  It is a serious problem.

That person is then homeless if he or she cannot go home, or possibly is left in overcrowded conditions.

I was of the view that the Deputy has just described but I was very much surprised by the results that I got back.  I will outline an except and then I will discuss it with the Deputy.<\/p><p>In 2000, a national training fund levy of 0.7% was introduced by the then Fianna F&aacute;il Government and it was incorporated into the employer's social insurance contribution in classes A and H, with no charges for anybody else. Social insurance receipts up to the end of August 2017 were &euro;6.6 billion.  This was almost &euro;178 million or just under 3% ahead of profile.  The anecdotal story that we are told that there are millions of euro not being paid by employers because they are manipulating or controlling of certain types of employees does not add up to the figures that come in.  Then I have to delve deeper and say that we genuinely know that people are employed in very casualised environments.  The construction industry is probably the most obvious to us, but other industries are doing the same.<\/p><p>I have taken some time to look at how we can address those issues.  It is much more complex than I expected.  I expected to be able to introduce an employers' levy for people who are not self employed, because the easy way is to increase the employee's PRSI from a self-employed perspective, and that is the last thing that I am going to do.  While I am adamant that I am going to improve and expand all of the social insurance benefits that have been available to people on other classes to self employed people, and actually improve the social insurance benefits to everybody else, I am certainly not going to increase the employee's PRSI contribution.  I am looking at how I can best address the issue of probably a relatively small number of people or businesses in that space that are taking advantage of people and to provide some sort of levy or penalty to address the ongoing issue.<\/p><p>At the same time, and if the Leas-Cheann Comhairle can give me a little latitude, there are thousands of people who have never heard of Scope and do not have a clue that there is a body.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><\/p><p>This includes an amount of &euro;282 million for the national training fund.  This was &euro;7.8 million ahead of profile, also 2.7%.  Bogus self-employment is where employees and employers wilfully evade income tax and social insurance liabilities.<\/p><p>Social welfare inspectors carry out visits to a wide range of businesses, as part of their ongoing compliance operations.  Inspections are occasionally undertaken jointly with other State agencies such as the Revenue Commissioners and the Workplace Relations Commission.  Where evidence of non-compliance is detected, this will be pursued.<\/p><p>Officials will also investigate details of specific cases supplied to my Department&rsquo;s Scope section.  This section deals with employers, employees and the self-employed, who may apply to have an employment or self-employment status investigated and the correct class of pay-related social insurance, PRSI, determined.<\/p><p>Where the misclassification of workers as self-employed is detected, the correct insurability status of the person concerned is determined and social insurance arrears are collected.  Under the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, there are specific offences in regard to employment contributions, their remittance and the maintenance of prescribed wages and employment records.  On conviction, fines and or imprisonment can ultimately be imposed.<\/p><p>Any worker who has concerns about their employment and PRSI status should contact my Department and the matter will be investigated.<\/p><p>My Department has concerns that some types of employment structures may be being used to reduce the amount of PRSI and tax being paid, with a subsequent loss to the Exchequer and the Social Insurance Fund.  An interdepartmental working group, comprising officials from my Department, the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners has been examining the issue and I expect to receive a report shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000031#DD02200","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1505927700,"counter":456,"content":"<p>I will give the Minister latitude.

It is all very well to say go home and put it into the drawer and that one might never have to use it again, but it is worth noting what other Departments have to say about it.  What is the data to be used for?  The Department of Finance when talking about the Revenue Commissioners states that it is in line with Government policy to develop a single authentication mechanism for customers to access public services.  It goes on to talk about the PPS and MyGovID.  In terms of the Department of Education and Skills, it talks about MyGovID using the same data from the 2018 to 2019 academic year and it being mandatory at that stage.  The driver and vehicle online portals speak of using the same data.  The Passport Office also speaks of using the same data.

I appreciate the Ceann Comhairle selecting this Topical Issue.  It is an issue of huge concern in the Cavan-Monaghan area and in the general Border region, namely, the need to upgrade our infrastructure, particularly road infrastructure.  I welcome the fact the Minister, Deputy Ross, is here.  From my observations in this Chamber, in previous debates he is a very good attender and replies to the Topical Issues put to his Department.  That is a welcome development but unfortunately, it is not one that is followed by all Ministers.<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister will be aware, Cavan, Monaghan and Donegal are more heavily dependent on road infrastructure than other counties in the State because we do not have a rail service.<\/p><p>Allied to that dependence on the road network is the fact that the local economy is very heavily dependent on the agrifood, construction products and engineering sectors.  By and large, these are bulky products that are transported by heavy goods vehicles, HGVs, either to the domestic market outside Cavan and Monaghan or to ports and airports for export to foreign destinations.  Those HGVs, in transporting the finished products from our region, need proper roads and proper infrastructure to get the products to markets within Ireland and to the ports and airports in good time.  In previous debates in this House, through both parliamentary questions and topical issues, I have highlighted the need for additional resources for the Department's road works programme in the mid-term review of the capital programme.  In those debates I made a special appeal to the Minister to address the infrastructural deficits of the Border region.  This is particularly urgent in the context of the difficulties and challenges we face as a Border region.  If enterprises in Cavan, Monaghan and the general Border area are to have any hope of remaining competitive, the Government must invest urgently in infrastructure.<\/p> <p> Again, I refer to the fact that our local economy is very heavily dependent on the agrifood, construction and engineering sectors.  These are also the three sectors in our economy that are most heavily dependent on the British market for exports.  The economies of Cavan and Monaghan and North of the Border in Fermanagh and Tyrone are heavily dependent on these three sectors and in turn, these three sectors are most heavily dependent on the British market.  These sectors are already facing difficulties because of the serious decline in the value of sterling since the middle of 2016, following the Brexit referendum.  There is an obvious need to try to assist enterprises to remain competitive.  The Government, we as public representatives and non-governmental organisations, NGOS, will put the very best case forward to Europe and to the British in regard to the best possible deal and the fact that we cannot countenance the return of a border on our island.  Those issues are all up for negotiations but there is one decision that is totally within the competence of our own Government, namely the decision to invest in infrastructure and to provide additional financial resources to upgrade a road infrastructure that is deficient.  There are many historical reasons, as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will attest, for the deficits in the Border region, including the impact of decades of the Troubles on our doorstep and the lack of investment that followed on from that.  Thankfully, since 1998 we have had huge positive developments in all of the province of Ulster and throughout our State following the signing of the Good Friday Agreement.  We have had an increase in North-South trade and the development of enterprises on an all-Ireland basis.  Those enterprises that are based in the Border region face very serious challenges in trying to remain competitive.  We must ensure that at Government level extra investment is targeted at the Border region to try to assist those companies to remain competitive.  If we are to have any hope of those enterprises retaining their current complement of employees, not to mention creating much needed additional jobs, there is a huge onus on Government to prioritise investment in the deficient infrastructure in that region.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000032#EE01300","speaker":"1270","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505928900,"counter":474,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Smith for his tireless representation on this and other issues affecting his region, particularly through the raising of topical issues in this Chamber.  The impact of Brexit is a major concern for the country as a whole.  As regards road infrastructure, as the Deputy is aware, while I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in relation to the national roads programme, the planning, design and implementation of individual road projects is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, under the Roads Acts 1993-2015, in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.  Within its capital budget, the assessment and prioritisation of individual projects is a matter in the first instance for TIl in accordance with section 19 of the Roads Act.<\/p><p>  The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of each local authority, in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.  Works on those roads are funded from local authorities' own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.<\/p><p>The capital plan published in September 2015 outlined proposed transport investment priorities to 2022.  Maintenance and renewal of the road network will continue to be the main priority over the next period and the bulk of the roads capital budget, approximately &euro;4.4 billion, is earmarked for such essential work with a further &euro;600 million allocated for implementation of the public private partnership, PPP road programme which is already underway.  <\/p><p>The capital plan provides for significant investment in transport links impacting on the wider Border region including the N4 Collooney to Castlebaldwin upgrade scheme, the rolling schemes on the N56 from Dungloe to Glenties and Inver to Mountcharles, strengthening links in Donegal, and subject to necessary consents, the N2 Slane bypass on the Dublin, Monaghan route.  The capital plan also restates the Government's commitment to contribute &pound;75 million to the development of the A5 in Northern Ireland.  In addition TII announced in July that it is reactivating planning work on the N2 Clontibret to the Border scheme to narrow down the number of options to a single preferred route.  Further action being taken on the N2 relates to a safety review of the section between Drumgeeny and the Castleblayney bypass.  The draft engineering advisor&rsquo;s report concluded that the rate of fatal collisions on this single carriageway road exceeds the rate from a reference class of similar national primary roads.  The report also identifies a number of measures to improve safety on this section of the route.  Arising from this report, TIl has committed to provide additional funding to develop the recommendation for an online upgrade of the N2 extending from north of Ardee to the south of the Castleblayney bypass.  The intention is to progress the preliminary design and the achievement of planning consent as soon as possible.<\/p><p>  As I have said many times, as Minister I have to operate within the budget available to me and the capital plan allocations set the parameters for what I can do.  The review of the capital plan was initiated earlier this year and I put forward a strong case for additional funding.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe has now published a report setting out the conclusions reached in relation to the additional global amount available to boost capital investment.  While I was heartened to see transport identified as one of the priority areas for consideration for additional funding, decisions on specific allocations to Ministers remain to be made by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p><p>Deputy Smith makes a good case for his region.  In the present circumstances, obviously anything that is particularly affected by Brexit must get special consideration when funds are being allocated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000033#FF00200","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1505928900,"counter":475,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response, in particular his references to the necessary upgrading of the N2, the Border to Clontibret road design reactivation, the Castleblayney bypass and the need to implement safety measures there because unfortunately there has been a considerable loss of life on that stretch of road in recent years.  I have highlighted one particular route in this House previously.  In the early 2000s, the development of an east-west route from Sligo to Dundalk was identified.  At that time, it was concluded that the best route would be from Sligo, through Enniskillen, Belturbet, Cootehill, Shercock and Carrickmacross to Dundalk.  Substantial funding was provided to upgrade the route through the development of the Cavan bypass and the Belturbet bypass, both of which were integral parts of the proposed route.  Then, in 2009, Cavan County Council was identified as the lead local authority - to work along with Monaghan and Louth county councils - to plan and design the upgrade of the route.  Substantial funding was provided in the road works allocations in 2010 and 2011.<\/p><p>Substantial planning and design was carried out at that time, the details of which I will communicate to the Minister in writing.  I would like to see that project re-activated because there are many substantial employers on that route, including Abbott and a number of engineering companies in Cootehill, Manor Farm, the Carton Brothers poultry enterprise, in Shercock and a number of other major enterprises in Dundalk.  The time delay in terms of transporting the finished products from those factories and manufacturing facilities in Cootehill to Larne, Warrenpoint or the ports in this State, because roads are not up to the standard required for heavy goods vehicles, is a substantial additional burden on those enterprises.  It is a route that I would like to see upgraded.<\/p> <p> I recall that when planning was under way in respect of the development of the N3, I made a presentation at the then Oireachtas transport committee, which was based on research carried out by Glanbia.  One of the Glanbia manufacturing facilities is located in Virginia, Cavan, in my own constituency.

It has been communicated to the persons involved in the new school that the school will open in September 2018.  As the Minister will no doubt be aware, following a patronage process announced by his Department in early 2016, Educate Together was approved the patronage of the new secondary school.  Since then, in May of this year it was announced that the Department of Education and Skills had purchased the former greyhound track in Harold's Cross and it is to be used to accommodate new schools.  In terms of this Topical Issue, I am asking the Minister to consider the use of the land in Harold's Cross to accommodate the new Educate Together secondary school.  It is a priority in the area that this school is constructed as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  For the purpose of determining whether a new school was required, the Department carried out a report on the patronage of the school and what catchment area was suitable for a new school.  As I said, it was concluded that a school was needed to serve the Dublin 2, 4, 6 and 8 areas.  Taking that area of land, the meeting point in terms of the areas to be covered by the new school is an area near my constituency called La Touche Bridge.  It is the centre point of the catchment area.  In terms of the land available at the former greyhound track in Harold's Cross, it is the ideal location for the new school as it is only 1.4 km from La Touche Bridge.  I suggest that it would be an ideal location.  It is important that steps are taken to establish a new multi-denominational, co-educational, non-fee paying secondary school in the area.  Many of the secondary schools in the area are single sex fee paying schools.  They are all excellent schools but there is limited choice for parents who wish to send their children to a non-fee paying school or a secondary school that is multi-denominational and co-educational.  <\/p>  <p>  I understand that Educate Together has done a considerable amount of work in respect of assessing the demand for this school.  The demand exists.  There is ample land at the former greyhound track to facilitate construction of a school and playing fields.  There is an urgency around this issue in light of the announcement that the school will open in September 2018.  There are many stands beneath the former greyhound stadium that could be converted to classrooms on a temporary basis.  I urge the Minister to give consideration to constructing the new school on this land, which is in the centre of the catchment area, has been purchased by his Department, and would be hugely popular in the area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000034#GG00400","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1505929500,"counter":480,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy O'Callaghan for raising this issue.  This is a very significant purchase by the Department.  From our point of view, it is an area where it is difficult to get land and we were very pleased to get the opportunity to acquire this site.  As the Deputy will be aware, courtesy of Dublin City Council the land has been rezoned from recreational and part residential zoning to Z15 zoning, which is to protect and provide for institutional and community uses.  This rezoning, agreed by the city council only this week, will facilitate the provision of a school on the site.  Conveyancing and so on must be completed before plans for the development of the site can commence.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy is aware of how the system works.  There are 314 school planning areas across the country.  While this site is directly in the Dublin 6-Clonskeagh area, there are four other adjoining planning areas whose trends we would examine.  The expectation of the Department is that in the future there will be very significant requirement for additional school places at post primary level in these areas.  It is projected that as many as 5,000 places will be needed over the medium term.<\/p><p>Against that background, this is a very significant acquisition by the Department.  It will help us to plan for pressures both at primary and post-primary level.<\/p> <p> The precise usage of the school will have to be determined by the Department.  A demographic review is taking place.  If it reveals pressure for an additional school, that would go through the system the Deputy described under which Educate Together was selected for a post-primary school.  There would once again be an opportunity for parents' preferences to be expressed in regard to whose patronage should arise.<\/p> <p> I have carefully noted the Deputy's comments regarding the suitability of this site for a particular school.  As he can understand, any such issues will have to be carefully evaluated by the Department.  It will not be a political decision, rather it will be a decision based on the best interests of planning the future of the area.  Given the capacity of the site, although it is constrained, I believe the Department would hope it could have both a primary and a post-primary school on it, if it can be developed.  Good design of such a site would be the first matter the Department would examine, namely, the potential of the site and what are the best ways to deploy that resource to meet the needs.  I will pass on the Deputy's points about the particular patron and about the school that is developing.  As he will be aware, there is an early stage after a school starts up and builds up its numbers where there is usually time to anticipate what is the best way to meet the needs of the school as it develops.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000034#GG00500","speaker":"1293","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505930100,"counter":482,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response.  I appreciate that he cannot give a definitive answer in respect of whether the land will be used for this Educate Together secondary school, but I would urge him and his Department to bear in mind that a decision should be made on this as soon as possible.  The Educate Together secondary school is due to open in September 2018.  That is what the Department had indicated.  As a result of that, the patronage and the parents have indicated that it is already heavily subscribed.  It is already fully subscribed for its first year with a significant waiting list.  That reflects the level of demand and the necessity for such a school in the area.  I urge the Minister to take that on board in order that decisions can be made on a prompt basis.<\/p>  <p>  The new secondary school will ultimately provide up to 1,000 secondary school places.  I note what the Minister said about the intention being to perhaps house a primary school and a post-primary school there.  That would be an excellent idea.  There is a significant amount of land available there in an area of Dublin where it is hard to get land.  There would be a benefit in having a primary and post-primary school together but there is no reason that cannot occur with the Educate Together secondary school using that site on a temporary basis.  It would only start off with one year there and the works could be done at the same time.<\/p>  <p>  I know that individuals associated with this school are concerned about the fact that a decision has not as of yet been forthcoming from the Department as to where the school will be based.  I have spoken to Vanessa Barcroft, a representative of the school, who is anxious to ensure that it is up and running as soon as possible.  Educate Together is also anxious and is awaiting confirmation from the Department on the location of the new school.  As it is the case that the school is to open in fewer than 12 months but no confirmation has been received to date as to its location, it is incumbent upon the Department to communicate with the patron and the individuals involved.  <\/p>  <p>  This is a hugely positive project.  It is enormously supported by people in the locality, the Harold's Cross council, which looks after the issues affecting Harold's Cross.  It would be a great development for the future.  I urge the Minister not to let the potential for an Educate Together school to be on that site to be lost.

I previously raised my concerns directly with the Minister, and I thank him for his attendance here this evening.  I have also raised my concerns with the school management and the school patron regarding the welfare of pupils, the morale of the school and the danger that the school might close if the problems were not resolved urgently.  They have not been resolved and the situation has been made even worse.  We now have a situation where a once thriving school, which had more than 100 pupils, in Faughart now has no pupils left, and has effectively closed its doors.  The school has been a hub of activity for the local community for generations.  Grandparents and parents of today's children all attended that school.  No one wants to see the school closed.  There has been ongoing difficulties for a long period of time and for that to be allowed to happen is very sad and disappointing.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Education and Skills undertook an inspection earlier this year.  The whole school evaluation report, published in May, made a number of critical findings.  The inspectors reported that \"leadership for learning within the school was not prioritised sufficiently\".  The report stated that \"the oversight role of the Board of Management was not being discharged satisfactorily\".   It found \"a significant variation in the quality of teaching of certain subjects, ranging from outstanding to poor\".  We might ask ourselves what would we do if our children were attending that school.  The report stated that action should be taken as a matter of priority to \"rebuild trust within the school community and to improve enrolment\".  <\/p>  <p>  The whole school evaluation report confirmed the parents' concerns and as a group they took the decision to escalate their efforts to peaceful protest.  They have privately and publicly justifiably raised their concerns about their children's education.  They have engaged with the board of management, the school patron - the Archbishop of Armagh - and the Minister.<\/p>  <p>  As a result of a lack of a resolution, this has culminated in a decision for them to withdraw their children from the school and to seek alternative school places for them.  There are now no pupils left.  We are seeing the decimation of a rural thriving school community.  It is no exaggeration to say that those in the  community are devastated.  I have met and spoken to families directly affected and they have all told me that their hope against hope is that the Department and school management would resolve the issues at hand.  It is unacceptable that a rural school can close the way that Naoimh Br&iacute;d school has.  We can ill afford the closure of any rural school.  The people of Faughart deserve better.  <\/p>  <p>  This is a close knit school community within a wider community who feel let down.

It is disturbing and he has accurately outlined the backdrop to it.  <\/p>  <p>  A whole-school evaluation of the school in Faughart was conducted in March this year and the report was published in May on the Department's website.  As the Deputy indicated, the report found a number of significant problems with the capacity of the school to deliver on its mission and made a number of strong recommendations, including that the board of management, in consultation with the staff, the wider community and the patron, formulate, implement and monitor a strategic plan for the operation and development of the school in order that its mission statement could be implemented satisfactorily.  The report stated the oversight role of the board of management needed to be strengthened significantly and that within the school leadership for learning should be greatly developed and, to that end, leadership and coaching supports should be accessed by the principal.<\/p>  <p>  Following the completion of the inspection, senior officials of my Department held a meeting with the school management and the patron of the school on the issues identified during the inspection and the need to implement the recommendations made in the report.  Responsibility for implementing recommendations rests, in the first instance, with the management and patron of a school.  As section 15 of the Education Act makes clear, it is the duty of the board of a school to manage the school on behalf of its patron and for the benefit of the students and their parents.  The patron then began the process of dissolving the board of the school and appointing a single manager to manage the school on the patron&rsquo;s behalf.  However, the board resigned and a single manager was appointed by the patron in June 2017 to manage the school.  The manager is taking on the responsibility, acting on behalf of the school&rsquo;s patron, to take the steps necessary to address the issues identified.  I have outlined in the written reply the normal support provided to assist in that work, including follow-up by the Department and access to support services.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy outlined, despite having an enrolment of 55 pupils this time last year which would warrant a staffing complement of a principal and two mainstream classroom teachers, no students are now attending the school as their parents have opted not to send them to the school.  My Department is concerned about this.  It is not its policy to see schools such as this close, but, ultimately, these decisions do not rest with it.  The decisions and the authority to make them rest with the patron and the school community, but the Department is working to try to find a solution.  As recently as today, officials had a meeting with the school authorities and the patron.  We will continue to engage with the school management and the patron to address the matter.  It is our desire to achieve a solution, whereby parents will have the confidence to send their children back to the school.  I am informed that the school manager is taking this task seriously and I hope that, with the support of the wider community, we can find a solution that will protect the continuing role of the school which has a proud tradition dating back many years.  It is a difficult issue, but we are working vigorously with local interests to find a solution and open to continuing that work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000036#JJ00200","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"speech","time":1505930700,"counter":488,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response.  I do not envy him his job.  This is a small school in a small community and he has a huge Department to manage, but a solution to what is now a crisis should have been found months ago.  The Department had been aware of the problems in Faughart for some time and I had brought them directly to the Minister's attention, but the Department decided not to intervene and to leave it to the patron to manage the school.  The Minister has said the Department does not have authority in that regard, that it rests with the patron and the school community.  However, it is now a school without pupils and the mind boggles.  The school manager has a role to play in place of the board of management and although I have serious reservations about whether schools should have patrons - I certainly believe this issue should be reviewed to meet modern needs and ethos of our society and attitudes in a changing Ireland - the patron has a role to play, as does the community.  The Department, however, should be the driver in the relationship and I welcome the Minister's remark that it is engaging locally.  I sincerely hope we can save a school that has been in place and served the community well for generations.  There is a fabulous school community which comprises parents who want the very best for their children.  I appeal, as I did previously, to the Minister to meet the parents.  I note that he did not respond to me, but he should listen to them first hand and then use his common sense and goodwill.  If he was a parent placed in his dilemma, the last thing he would want to do is to remove his child from education.  That so many parents have done so to the point where the school has no pupils shows how seriously they feel about the issues involved.  As it would not take up much of the Minister's time, I ask him to take a hands-on approach.

We stand ready to provide the teaching resources required, the capitation grant and all of the standard supports.

We have long experience of doing so.  Ultimately, however, there has to be a desire locally to make this work.  We have to rebuild the parents' confidence at local level through the work of the school management supported by the professional staff we are making available to it.

It relates to the provision of the life-extending drug, nivolumab or nivo for short, by the HSE and the Department of Health.<\/p><p>Nivo is an immunology drug that can be used by oncologists to treat a range of cancers, such as melanoma, non-small cell lung cancers, renal cell carcinoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma and a host of other illnesses.  It is a drug that is readily available to patients in the United Kingdom via the National Health Service.  However, it is only available in this country to private patients who can afford the extreme bill of between &euro;100,000 and &euro;140,000 per year.  I ask for an urgent update on the status of the drug today.<\/p> <p> I thank the Minister for taking my recent calls.  From them he knows that a number of people throughout the country are currently sitting in hospitals and will die if they cannot access this drug soon.  In particular I will mention one patient from County Sligo who is suffering an advanced form of kidney cancer.  Mr. Peter Milne, a retired teacher, is a good person and has given his time and energy freely to so many good and worthy causes in Sligo.  He ran a youth theatre for young people in Sligo for many years.  Before his admission to hospital, he continued to teach English to asylum seekers, and he also helped to guide young people through their university applications process in his free time.  When Peter was told two and a half years ago his cancer was back and inoperable, he set about climbing the four highest peaks in the British Isles to raise thousands of euro for the cancer support centre in Sligo.  It is the type of person he is.  He is a good neighbour and friend to many and, most importantly, a loving husband and father.  As I speak tonight, Peter and his family desperately await access from the HSE to the only drug that can prolong his life.  I am not here tonight asking for the impossible or for the impossible to be done for Peter.  I am simply asking that he and other patients like him are given accurate and up-to-date information by the HSE after recent announcements as to when they can hope to access this drug.  I am assured by the HSE that this is very close to being made available.<\/p> <p> The Minister might recall that during May 2017, there was a positive update from the HSE on the provision of the drug for a number of different illnesses, bringing delight and happiness to many families nationwide.  The head of customer services at the HSE indicated in a letter dated 18 July 2017 that the nivo drug had been approved by the HSE as being effective for advanced renal cell carcinoma.  He stated that the HSE notified the Department of Health in July that it had completed its assessment of nivo for use in Hodgkin's lymphoma and advanced renal cell carcinoma.  I have since learned the Department of Health has sanctioned the funding for this drug and a decision on its reimbursement will occur shortly.  The Minister is aware the patient and family I mentioned need to know when the drug, announced as being effective by the HSE in May 2017 and which I am advised will be funded by the State, will be made available to Peter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000036#JJ00500","speaker":"1343","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505931300,"counter":493,"content":"<p>I begin by thanking Deputy McLoughlin for raising this issue and constantly advocating on behalf of the people of Sligo and bringing forward concerns of importance to them regarding health services to my attention.  I greatly appreciate that.  As the Deputy very eloquently outlined, medicines play a vital role in improving the overall health of patients and securing access to new and innovative medicines in a timely manner is a key objective of both the Government and Irish health service.  However, the challenge, as always in delivering on this objective, is to do so in an affordable and sustainable way.  Under the community pharmacy schemes alone, over 70 million prescription items will be dispensed in 2017 at an estimated cost of approximately &euro;1.7 billion, taking account of both fees and ingredient costs.  In addition, the HSE will spend in excess of &euro;500 million in 2017 on medicines through a range of other schemes in hospitals and in other care setting, including nursing homes.<\/p>  <p>  Expenditure on medicines represents one of the largest areas of expenditure across the health service and will continue to grow in the years ahead as our health service continues to meet the needs of our citizens.  In addition, the pipeline for new medicines is very strong and it is estimated that in the region of 45 new molecules are due to receive market authorisation in Europe each year over the next five years.  Innovation by pharmaceutical companies is delivering treatments and in some cases cures for diseases that were previously untreatable.  This is most welcome and can absolutely have a transformative impact on the health of patients.  However, as I have stated previously, the cost some companies are seeking to charge for their medicines may result in a position not just in Ireland but globally where certain treatments may never become available to patients.  This is not just an Irish phenomenon but one evident globally and we must find that spot where we can manage to purchase drugs and do so in a way that is affordable and means we can purchase many drugs that we wish to for our patients.  That is why it is essential that Ireland has a scientific, robust and evidence-based assessment process in place, rather than one where the Minister makes the decision.  The evidence should be followed closely and this ensures decisions on the reimbursement of medicine are made in an objective and scientific basis, recognising the health needs of our population.<\/p>  <p>  The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 provides the legal framework in Ireland for such a process.  This Act gives full statutory powers to the HSE to assess and make decisions on the reimbursement of medicines, taking account of expert opinion as appropriate.  The HSE follows the process set out in the Act passed by this House for the assessment of all drugs.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the specific treatments mentioned by Deputy McLoughlin, it is important to state, as I have outlined, that it is a matter for the HSE and not me or my Department, to make decisions on drugs.  However, in certain circumstances, as the Deputy correctly outlines, where the HSE wishes to fund a treatment but does not have the resources to do so, it may<\/p>  <p>inform my Department of its decisions.  The HSE has received separate applications for the reimbursement of nivolumab for eight separate indications, including for use as a combination therapy.  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that following an assessment by the HSE and consultation with the Department of Health regarding the funding implications, nivolumab has been approved by the HSE for the treatment of melanoma, renal cell carcinoma and Hodgkin's lymphoma.  I understand the HSE expects the reimbursement of nivolumab for these indications to commence in the coming weeks.  I know that is the information sought by the Deputy this evening.  In addition, it is important to put on the record of the House that the HSE has decided not to support its use in the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.  The remaining applications are currently being considered in line with the decision making criteria and are at different stages of the assessment process.<\/p>  <p>  I will be clear.  Each of the conditions that my Department was informed of by the HSE and for which it sought reimbursement has now seen reimbursement agreed.  The reimbursement for those conditions will take place in the coming weeks and patients should absolutely know that.  On the floor of the D&aacute;il I cannot determine any patient's clinical needs and that is a matter for doctors.

There is agreement between the HSE and my Department on the funding requirement for this and in that regard, the HSE has, in discharging its own legal responsibilities, now proceeded with the provision of nivolumab and eight other drugs and I expect that will be reimbursed in the coming weeks.<\/p>  <p>  I cannot comment on individual cases for very obvious reasons, nor am I qualified to make decisions about individual patients' clinical needs.  Obviously I send my best wishes to the constituent of Deputy McLoughlin and, indeed, any patient experiencing illness who wants to know about the availability of drugs.<\/p>  <p>  There is an important point to be made in the context of the reference by the Deputy to private hospitals.  The HSE provides drugs for the public health service.  If a patient is in a private hospital or, indeed, with a private insurance company, it is a matter for the individual private hospital or insurance company to engage directly with drug manufacturers in the best interests of its customers and there is no need whatsoever for it to wait for the HSE reimbursement to have those conversations.  There is absolutely no reason such engagement must await the HSE's finalisation of the reimbursement.  That issue should be raised with private hospitals and insurance companies by public representatives.  There is nothing to preclude a private entity making available a drug that is available in Ireland.  It does not need to wait for the HSE to resolve the reimbursement situation.  In such cases, it is important that hospital consultants and insurance companies should be clear and upfront with their patients that the availability of a treatment in the private facility is not decided by the HSE but is an individual decision that they could make in relation to their own facility.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to public hospitals, the public health service and public patients, I want to assure people that nivolumab will now be funded by the HSE for the conditions I have outlined on the record of the House and will be reimbursed by the HSE.

Molaim an Bille.  T&aacute; gach duine ar gach taobh den D&aacute;il i bhfabhar an m&eacute;id at&aacute; ann.  We are fully behind this Bill and it has cross-party support.  It addresses a significant problem that could arise and has arisen in some cases.  <\/p>  <p>  One of the provisions of this Bill will prevent employers stopping contributions to a pension scheme for a period of 12 months.  Until the legislation is passed, there is nothing to prevent employers from abandoning schemes with no notice or minimum notice to the scheme trustees, regardless of the financial position of the scheme or the damage to scheme members' pensions.  That is why this Bill is urgent, important and necessary.  It will allow time, which I understand will be a 12-month period, within which discussions, consultations and negotiations can take place so that there will be a better outcome, in particular for those who paid into pensions for a significant period of time.  Closing off that loophole is hugely important.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill also gives power to the Pensions Authority to impose an obligation on employers to resolve pension scheme funding problems where there is no plan in place to so do.  This must be done if schemes are to make their way back to a healthy position where they can pay members benefits.  Obviously as people get older their health does not necessarily improve and they look forward to their pension entitlements and the security of their old age.  That is what they are entitled to and that is what this legislation is supporting and making sure that, if anything acts against them in relation to their employer, the Government will take the necessary steps to ensure fair play.  It also contains a provision that will allow civil partners and same sex spouses who are members of occupational schemes with marriage age rules to obtain a spouse's pension in certain circumstances and there is, again, broad support for that.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the interest that the new Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Doherty, has shown in her brief and her willingness to listen to Deputies from all sides of the House.  I would like the Minister to listen to the voice of a constituent of mine, a female farmer, regarding pension equality for women.  She wrote setting out her concerns about the inequality and injustice experienced by women farmers and, indeed, many women within the current pension system.  Many women farmers are facing an old age in poverty because the State still fails to recognise their work as unpaid carers for both the families they have raised and for other relatives.  Many more are still disadvantaged by the historic legacy of the marriage bar which barred people from working in the past.  She says that the gender pension gap, which measures the gap between the value of pension payments to women and to men, is 37%.  It is the fifth-widest pension gap in the EU.  As our economy is improving and as more money is available, this significant inequality needs to be addressed, in particular for women.  It is clear the current averaging system discriminates against women in particular who may have worked within the PAYE system for a number of years and then left due to the marriage bar, to raise a family or to care for an older relative and returned to insurable employment in later years.   My constituent calls on the Government to address past injustices for Irish women at or near pension age by introducing a total contribution system in 2018 for the purposes of calculating the level of contributory pension.  In addition, the pension scheme must recognise the significant and crucially important role that women play in providing unpaid care.  Men also fulfil that role, and all Members know of such people in their constituencies.<\/p>  <p>  When pension contributions start is determined by the age of entry to work.  If one starts work at the age of 18, one's period of work until the age of 66 is much longer than that of a person who begins work at 30 or 40 years of age.  However, if, having started work at 18, one leaves work for ten years to look after one's family or for whatever good reason, one is at a disadvantage compared to other people.  I am sure the Minister is knowledgeable of this area, as are all Members.  We need to take steps to close the gap and ensure that women in particular, and also some men, do not continue to be disadvantaged.<\/p>  <p>  Contributions were changed in approximately 2012 when the country was in very difficult economic circumstances.  One previously could get a pension equivalent to 98% for the yearly average of 21 stamps but that was changed to 85% without any notice whatsoever, which was unfair and unjust.  That needs to be addressed because many people in that situation, women in particular, are at a significant loss of at least &euro;40 per week, which is unfair and unacceptable as the economy improves.  I was on the side of the Government at that time.  I acknowledge that very difficult decisions had to be made.  We must now start to address those inequalities.<\/p>  <p>  There is another inequality with which I wish to deal.  I thank the Minister for listening to this case and for the interest she and her staff have shown in relation to carer's allowance, which is an entitlement that only goes to those who look after family members or those in their community who are significantly ill and need full-time care and attention and need this allowance to help them cope with the cost and the effort  they put in to caring for their relative.  The case that has come to my attention involves a child who has been in an intensive care unit in a Dublin children's hospital for six months because the child is very ill.  Thankfully, the child's condition has improved.  Once the child had been in the intensive care unit for 13 weeks, the Department cut the carer's allowance of the child's carer.<\/p><p>It cuts the carer's allowance because the regulations governing the allowance state that if the person being cared for is in institutional care, which is understandable, or in an acute hospital setting, the carer loses the allowance.  For a person from the country to have a seriously ill child in intensive care in a Dublin hospital is a cause of huge emotional and personal trauma.  It is a trauma for the child, the family and indeed the whole town of Drogheda which supports this case.  How is the injustice righted?  If somebody spends 13 weeks in an acute hospital their carer should not lose their allowance.  That bar should be removed from that family.  That is fair and reasonable.  I have not yet tabled a question to find out how many people have suffered in this way but I have discussed it with the Minister.  I acknowledge her understanding and appreciation of the situation.  It must and should be addressed in the next budget.<\/p> <p> There is a human reason: the lives of people caring for family members who are in intensive care are turned upside down.  They have to travel more and spend money on meals they would not normally have to buy.  They are put at a huge financial and emotional disadvantage.  In the case I have raised the community welfare officer, CWO, assisted but why should somebody have to go to a CWO to get something he or she should be entitled to?  If the child or adult who was in intensive care had been in long-term care the barrier as defined to me would be understandable but not when he or she is in a life-threatening situation and need acute hospital care. <\/p> <p> I acknowledge the cut we made in the telephone allowance but it is having a serious adverse impact on services for those entitled to it.  Those people would not make many calls and one might ask why they could not use their mobile phone but most of the assistance services operate from a landline.  We did not appreciate the stress this cut would cause people.  Of all the issues we can address that is one the Minister could consider in the next budget.<\/p> <p> The economy is improving.  There is more money available in this republic of opportunity and I welcome that in the context of tax relief.  We need, however, to address the hurt visited on people who could not get up early in the morning because they were sick and on pensioners who did not have the capacity to work.  When we decided in 2012 to change the requirements for the 98% pension entitlement that affected a defined number of people who could not go back to work for the period that was left to qualify because they would have reached the age of 66.  The Minister should consider restoring the years which people could not avail of because that came out of the blue in 2012.  Someone who was aged 64 then could not possibly address the deficit he or she faced going into their golden years, unlike someone who was aged 50 or 55 at the time.<\/p> <p> I welcome the work the Minister is doing, her interest, knowledge and concern, which percolates through her office and staff.  The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is always extremely helpful.  The staff available on telephone hotlines to give information and help clarify an entitlement are extremely well trained and committed to helping people.  They are a beacon for how Civil Service, local government and all State services should be delivered.  The service is humane, person-centred, knowledge-based and easily accessible.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000038#LL00400","speaker":"1329","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505932500,"counter":500,"content":"<p>This is the first opportunity I have had to congratulate the Minister on her appointment.  The purpose of this Bill is to provide for amendments to the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005, the Pensions Act 1990 and the Civil Registration Act 2004.  Fianna F&aacute;il does not intend to oppose the Bill on Second Stage.  One of the main provisions of the Bill is to amend the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005 to allow for the publication on a quarterly basis of the names and addresses of persons convicted of social welfare fraud.  This made the news earlier in the year.  Fianna F&aacute;il does not condone welfare fraud in any shape or form but it will not condone the perception created by the Taoiseach when he was Minister for Social Protection in launching his \"welfare cheats cheat us all\" campaign that there is widespread social welfare fraud.  Most of those in receipt of social welfare payments, as all public representatives know, are genuine claimants.  Fianna F&aacute;il will table an amendment to this Bill to ensure that only those convicted of social welfare fraud in excess of &euro;5,000 will have their names published.<\/p>  <p>  Earlier in the year when the then Minister, Deputy Varadkar, launched his campaign to much fanfare he stated that anti-fraud and control measures saved the taxpayer &euro;506 million in 2016, a staggering sum of money.  It would be particularly staggering if fraud was involved.  We know however from answers secured through parliamentary questions from Fianna F&aacute;il that just 8%, only &euro;41 million, of the &euro;506 million savings claimed by the then Minister is actually attributable to fraud.  There is no place for fraud in our social protection system.  It needs to be weeded out and it can never be condoned.  As we know, however, there is a significant body of research available to the Department and the Minister, as there was to her predecessor, on the difference between fraud and error, deliberate or accidental.  I imagine that the complexity of the social protection system can lead to multiple genuine errors and I have a great deal of experience of dealing with that on behalf of constituents.  It is not always deliberate and I trust the Department to know the difference between the two.  We need to get around that kind of misrepresentation, the headline issue, the impression given when the Minister mentioned a figure of half a billion euro that there is widespread fraud, whereas the fraud amounted to only 8% of that headline figure.  It created the impression of the Department and Minister as gamekeepers, trying to catch people out whereas the role of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is to support people who need the State's assistance, generally at vulnerable times in their lives.<\/p><p>Yes, we need to crack down on fraud and ensure that the State's funds are used to support those who genuinely need help but we do not need to make a political virtue out of scapegoating an entire section of society.<\/p> <p> The legislation on public service cards that exercised the Minister's mind during the summer is an interesting matter.  I had sympathy for the Minster.  It happened during the so-called silly season and significant media attention was focused on it but it is something on which we need to spend some time.  We are not wholly opposed to the legislation but we are cognisant that there is widespread opposition to the introduction of a compulsory identity card and we will seek reassurances from the Minister that the questions raised by the Data Protection Commissioner will be fully addressed and there will be full transparency on how the data is collected, secured, who has access to it and whether it is shared with third parties, organisations or other State bodies.  That is critical.  Personally, the idea of a national identity card does not present any issue for me.  In the age in which we live it is a very useful thing, but when one delves into the matter, it is not a simple identity card with basic details, and people need to know what personal information it holds and who has access to it.  These are basic questions.<\/p> <p> I accept the card has been in operation for those who require social protection services since 2011 and this is not the first time that a national identity card was mooted.  In 2009, a report by the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs recommended the introduction of a national identity card to coincide with the development of a public services card.  I accept it is not a national identity card.  This is where some of the confusion needs to be clarified.  I have not got mine yet.  I keep meeting people who have them and I am intrigued as to why they have theirs and I do not but I assume that over time we will all have one and it will become an identity card by stealth.<\/p> <p> The use of biometric data being incorporated into the public services card in order to eliminate the possibility of fraud and to improve the efficiency of public services is bound to bring matters of personal rights, such as the right to privacy and personal liberty, into sharp focus so it is essential that both Houses are given the opportunity to debate it and consider the human rights and-or data protection implications of introducing such a system and particularly if it is extended to being a national identity card.<\/p> <p> There are advantages.  There are plausible arguments for and against this but many will vigorously challenge the possible infringements on a person's privacy.  We, as legislators, must determine if the concept of mandatory cards challenges the inalienable right to individual privacy which is protected by the Constitution.<\/p> <p> The Bill also provides for a number of amendments to the Pensions Act 1990 in relation to defined benefit pension schemes and I welcome this.  During the Minister's speech introducing this Bill on Second Stage, she indicated that she would introduce amendments to the legislation pertaining to that section of the Bill on Committee Stage.  This issue is particularly complex, with significant implications for employers and employees.  However, given recent events relating to the closure of defined benefit pension schemes, it is clear that more needs to be done to prevent solvent companies from walking away, leaving employees who had an expectation of a reasonable income in retirement high and dry.  In recognition of the problems we have witnessed with defined benefit pension schemes, where solvent and profitable companies walk away from their obligations, Fianna F&aacute;il has brought forward a Bill which has gone through Second Stage and has been referred to the Select Committee on Social Protection to amend the Pensions Act 1990 which would provide for an appeals mechanism where a pension scheme is being wound up by the trustees of that scheme.<\/p> <p> We need to have a serious debate on pension provision in Ireland.  Deputy O'Dowd referred to this earlier where we have a situation where many people, mainly women, are being denied a full State pension on retirement.  There is not an estate in my constituency, and I am sure it is the same in the Minister's, where one does not meet at least one woman who has suffered this predicament, having taken time out of service, in most cases to raise a family, she is denied the full pension.  We also have a situation where people are being forced to retire at 65 years but cannot access their entitlements to a State pension until they are 66 years.  We have what has often been described as the pensions crisis where the rate of supplementary pension coverage in Ireland is estimated at just above one third of the working population when the private sector is considered in isolation.  Fine Gael has been in office for six years and it is well past time that this was addressed.  We would welcome the opportunity to address this in the House.<\/p> <p> The Minister mentioned a number of provisions in the Bill.  I welcome that in the quarterly publication of those who have committed fraud the names of those who appeal successfully are not published.  On some of the administrative changes, the Minister has had a few weeks to mull over the difference between mandatory and compulsory and I look forward to hearing her clarification on this as will the public.  The Minister's remarks caused confusion among people who cannot see much of a difference between mandatory and compulsory, and her response seemed to imply that there was one.  Anything I have experienced which was mandatory seemed compulsory.<\/p> <p> Welfare fraud plays a significant part in the Bill.  The press release which accompanied the publication of the general scheme of the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill stated that while the outcomes of individual prosecutions for welfare fraud are covered routinely in local and national media, the publication of a list in this way will send a stronger message to the number of people who are prepared to risk defrauding the welfare system and their fellow citizens.  I deliberately left the word \"small\" out when I read this sentence in terms of the number of people who are prepared to risk defrauding the welfare system.<\/p> <p> I have had experience, particularly in the last eight or nine months, of vulnerable people, elderly people and not-so-elderly people who, having applied for services from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection have had an unannounced call to the house.  I understand why the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection does this, and it does so quite regularly, but it really frightens people.  It intimidates many people and unsettles and distresses people who are already on the back foot.  They do not know why the person has called.  I have written to the Minister on this subject and she was generous and sensitive in her responses but it happens.  If a social protection official arrived at my house unannounced my natural reaction would be to wonder what I had done wrong.  It has to be handled sensitively.  I also recognise that the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection officers are handling taxpayers' money and I appreciate that but there must be sensitivity.<\/p> <p> When we talk about fraud the context of the size of the Department's budget must always be considered.  It accounts for one third of the entire public expenditure which is &euro;58 billion.  The figure for fraud amounts to &euro;41 million.  If one does a very rough and crude calculation, that means there is &euro;20 fraud for every &euro;29,000 spent by the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000039#MM00200","speaker":"1311","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505933100,"counter":502,"content":"<p>The Department's budget is &euro;19 billion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000040#NN00200","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1505933100,"counter":503,"content":"<p>Does the Minister mean discretionary?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000040#NN00300","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speech","time":1505933100,"counter":504,"content":"<p>Sorry for interrupting but the social protection budget is just over &euro;19 billion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000040#NN00400","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1505933100,"counter":505,"content":"<p>Sorry, yes, that is one third of the &euro;58 billion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000040#NN00500","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speech","time":1505933700,"counter":506,"content":"<p>I would love &euro;58 billion.

To be correct, the Minister has one third of the overall State budget.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to speak on the difference between fraud and error.  We have fraud and corruption, which are intentional, and we have customer and official error.  It would be very helpful in the debate on this if the Minister could categorise what is intentional and corrupt and break down the amounts with regard to the figures on customer error and errors on the official side, as they have been included in the savings.  The Minister may not be in a position to do so now, but she may be able to at some point in the debate.  There is a significant difference between fraud and error.<\/p>  <p>  Moving into the various categories, how many examples of deliberate customer dishonesty are there, in terms of undeclared income or failing to report changes in material circumstances?  How many deliberate attempts at exploiting the system arise from year to year?  It would be helpful to know not just the monetary figures but the number of people involved.  This should be set against the context of the complexity of the social protection system.  Many people from various backgrounds find the social protection system difficult to navigate.  It has nothing to do with their level of education, background, upbringing or environment.  It can be very complex and people can make mistakes.  A narrative on this would help.  Available international research shows other errors.  Errors can be caused because staff have excessive workloads and very simple administrative errors can happen.  Errors can also arise because of the failure of a payment system or IT system, or problematic information management.  We need to know far more about this, and perhaps the Minister can address these issues, to reassure people she is not acting as gamekeeper but that she wants to ensure people are protected.  This is one of the reasons I made the points I did at the beginning of the debate, to which I will return.  Claimant error is quite significant.<\/p>  <p>  I would also like to know where is the fraud.  Can it be broken down into particular categories?  Is it predominantly in pensions?  It does not seem to be, because internationally people over the age of 65 are least likely to commit fraud.  Is it in income or employment supports?  Is it with regard to illness, disabilities or in the area of carer's allowance?  Does it concern children's payments or supplementary payments such as rent supplement?<\/p>  <p>  The Minister will appreciate we are dealing with people who are in a vulnerable position, particularly new entrants to the social protection system.  They can be at a new phase in their life, in terms of claiming the State contributory pension, but payments with regard to a disability, having lost a job or an illness benefit are related to a time in a person's life whey they are particularly vulnerable.  This means we are dealing with the most vulnerable of people.<\/p>  <p>  Perhaps I will table a parliamentary question on the system of departmental officers calling to people's homes and the rationale for this.  People need to know about this and it needs to be explained to people that they can expect this, not as part of a systematic approach to fraud or error but as part of the process.  The Department needs to call to a home to know people are real and exist and that they live at the address.<\/p>  <p>  We support absolutely the concept of eliminating fraud from the system.  We have demonstrated through parliamentary questions that the level of fraud in the system is quite minor, so only the names of those convicted of fraud in excess of &euro;5,000 should be published on the register, and we would like the Minister to take this on board in her consideration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000041#OO00400","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speech","time":1505933700,"counter":510,"content":"<p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle and the Minister for the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  I did not get a chance to speak before the summer recess.  The Minister and her predecessor stated it was their intention to try to get the Bill passed before the summer recess.  It was being pushed and rushed through, and at the last minute it was decided to stall the process and we are back here today.  The social welfare Bill affords an opportunity for the Minister and the Government to address issues of concern in the social protection system.  Certainly there is no shortage of issues to choose from in the social protection system.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill before us is completely different from the general scheme of the Bill presented to us in pre-legislative scrutiny a number of months ago.  I genuinely question the motives for this substantial difference.  If the Bill before us was what came before us in pre-legislative scrutiny there would have been a totally different reaction to its content.  After the contents of the Bill were broadly welcomed in pre-legislative scrutiny it was changed, and much of what was welcomed was subsequently removed without notice or notification.  This certainly does not look like, and is not, new politics.<\/p>  <p>  The glaringly obvious changes refer to the removal of a number of provisions regarding defined benefit pension schemes.  It was the intention of the Minister, who has left the Chamber, to introduce amendments to this area of the Bill on Committee Stage because it was not possible, given the complexities involved, to have these amendments included earlier.  I do not buy this.  The issues regarding defined benefit schemes are not new.  They were identified a number of years ago.  They have been widely spoken about, debated and publicised.  Issues on direct benefit schemes have been affecting employees for years.  There is no excuse for these provisions not to be in place at this stage.<\/p>  <p>  Any amendments to direct benefit schemes must tackle the root of the problem, which is healthy companies choosing to walk away from direct benefit schemes and choosing to renege on their pension obligations to employees.  Timeframes are well and good but they do not deal with the substantive issue.  They simply allow time to deliberate and debate when, in some cases, the direct benefit schemes simply should not be wound down or allowed to be wound down in the first instance.  We can take Irish Life as an example of this.  Its scheme has a huge surplus and has never been in deficit.  It is moving to close the direct benefit scheme and move to a defined contribution scheme.  This certainly raises serious alarm bells.  Many other profitable companies are actively progressing to close down their direct benefit schemes.<\/p>  <p>  The provisions in the Bill will do nothing for employees.  It will not act in their interests and it will not protect their pensions.  I ask the Minister who, unfortunately, is not here, to have a look at a Bill I introduced to the House in January when she is drafting her amendments.<\/p><p>I will be submitting my own amendments to reflect the Bill I introduced to the House.<br\/><br\/>This Bill consists of a number of tidy-up measures in various areas.  I welcome some of those measures.  I welcome, in particular, the changes being made for those in receipt of a disability allowance or the blind person's pension to remove the rule allowing the disregard of earnings only where employment is of a rehabilitative nature, as confirmed by the general practitioner.  I note this is in line with the recommendations from the interdepartmental report Make Work Pay.  I wholeheartedly welcome this move.<br\/><br\/>Another issue I want to raise concerns the provisions in the Bill on publishing the names of those convicted of so-called social welfare fraud.  There has been a lot of talk about this issue, much of it brought on by the current Minister's predecessor at a very opportune time when he was going for election in his political party.  As we know, that campaign, Welfare Cheats Us All, was based on all sorts of incorrect figures, offensive perceptions of jobseekers and calculations of savings based on assumptions.  I do not want to get into the numerous flaws and inaccuracies in that campaign but there were certainly very many.  It was very interesting to read some of the freedom of information material released to a journalist over the summer.  It showed the concerns of senior officials in the Department on the use of language, the material and the figures.  I and many others who saw this campaign for what it was saw the real motives behind it.  It was not about dealing with fraud, which my party and I want to stamp out, be it in respect of social welfare or the white collar sector.  There is substantially more fraud in the white collar area.  It is not being tackled or dealt with, and there have been no high-profile campaigns initiated by the current Taoiseach or his predecessors.<br\/><br\/>The flaws in the campaign have been well highlighted and discussed.  I wish to register my opposition to the publication of names, on the Department's website, of those who commit welfare fraud.  The actual evidence shows it is minimal.  First, there is no need for a second list of convictions.  The data are already provided.  There is no need for them to be duplicated.  Second, I am concerned about possible data protection breaches if this legislation is to be passed.  It is alleged the list will be left online for up to three months before being removed.  There is no stopping it being copied and used elsewhere.  Has the Data Protection Commissioner been consulted on the potential ramifications of such a measure?  The Minister has previously said that the names published will relate only to welfare fraud in excess of &euro;5,000, as put forward by her friends and colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il.  Again, I see no need whatsoever for the duplication of this list.<br\/><br\/>On the public services card, regarding which there has been much confusion, largely brought about by the Minister herself through her use of language over the course of the summer, we are still awaiting clarification.  There are numerous concerns raised by experts in the field, even including the Data Protection Commissioner and legal people.  I wish to ask the Minister in her absence about the 49 questions submitted by the Data Protection Commissioner in regard to the public services card.  They are critical because many of the concerns revolve around people&rsquo;s personal data.  It would be helpful if the Minister released and made public the 49 questions.  More important, how will she respond to the serious concerns that were raised by the Data Protection Commissioner?<br\/><br\/>The provisions included suggest the card is a national identification card.  I refer to the inscription of the date of birth and the confirmation of identity.  Big questions have been raised by many about how all the personal information will be stored, who can access it and the legislative basis on which registering for the card is required.  None of these questions has been answered.  There has been no debate on any of this whatsoever.  If this is an attempt to introduce a national identification card by stealth, it will be rigorously fought and opposed, certainly from these benches.<br\/><br\/>We have yet to see a comprehensive statement from the Government setting out in full the collective Government plan for the rolling out of the card and the legislative basis for its requirement across multiple Departments and agencies.  It is ridiculous that we are still waiting for answers on these provisions, yet we are being asked to support this legislation.  <br\/><br\/> In regard to enabling certain social welfare payments and benefits to be awarded online, can the Minister clarify exactly what payments and benefits are being referred to?With the domiciliary care allowance and the current waiting times in mind, I have written to the Minister.  Unfortunately, I am still awaiting a reply on what action is being taken to deal with the matter.  When we talk about the domiciliary care allowance, we are talking about the most vulnerable children in the State, those aged under 16 with a severe illness or disability.  The current waiting time for the processing of the domiciliary care allowance is 20 weeks, or five months.  I raised these concerns in May, at which time the waiting time was 18 weeks, which had jumped up from 15 weeks.  I raised this with the current Minister&rsquo;s predecessor, the now Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar, and asked him what measures would be put in place to tackle the serious delays in processing this critical allowance.  It is very apparent that nothing has been done to tackle this issue because the waiting times are increasing.  To me, that stinks.  It is appalling that the most needy children in the State and their parents and families, all of whom need this payment, are left waiting for five months or more.  I ask the Minister to revert to me, acknowledge the correspondence I sent to her and, more important, let me and the families who have been waiting for five months or more know what is being done to process the applications.<br\/><br\/>Having spoken to many families who are waiting and trying to obtain information on this, it now appears that the telephone lines for the domiciliary care allowance have been closed since last month, meaning that applicants can get no information whatsoever.  There seems to be a shut-down of all systems.  There is a blanket refusal to give any information to me or the families who have applied.  Answers are needed, and they are needed straight away.<br\/><br\/>I listened to Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd, who is not present at the moment, and found myself strangely nodding in agreement when he spoke about the inequality in our pensions system, particularly gender inequality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000041#OO00500","speaker":"1252","continuing":true}]
