The purpose of the redesign was to facilitate a new process within the Department whereby forms would be scanned rather than manually keyed into the new IT system.  Claims received on the new forms and certificates are being processed into the payment system on the same day as they are received.  That is a significant improvement on behalf or our clients.  The introduction of the redesigned form was discussed with the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, in advance.  The IMO advised its members, one month before its introduction, that they should co-operate with the use of the new forms.<\/p>  <p>  The Department subsequently communicated directly with general practitioners, GPs, as is our responsibility, shortly before the introduction of the redesigned forms.  Given the confusion that has arisen over the last couple of months, we have to accept that we should probably have communicated directly with the GPs more quickly than we did.  We accept that and we apologise.<\/p>  <p>  The majority of the certificates in the claim forms that are now being received each day by the Department are the new scannable versions.  These claims are being processed without any delay.  However, some GPs have continued to use the old forms after the changeover date.  To facilitate the continued payment of the illness and injury benefits to our clients, my Department has, to date, considered to accept those old forms.  While their continued use causes delays to our processing times, my Department is doing everything possible to ensure that customers are paid as quickly as possible.  There is currently a backlog of two days in processing the old forms and certificates.<\/p>  <p>  The introduction of these and other initiatives is the subject of ongoing discussions with the IMO.  A framework and timetable have been agreed with the IMO, during which intensive discussions are planned.  New processes will not be introduced until these discussions are concluded and advance notice, including details of any changes to payment arrangements, will be provided to the individual GPs directly from my Department.  It is important to note that the Department has had a long and positive relationship with GPs for many years.  We are committed to working hard to resolve any outstanding issues which cause concerns among our GP partners.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to put on the record of the House my immense gratitude to the people in the illness benefit section of my Department.  They worked tirelessly, including coming in at weekends, to ensure that the clients, who rely on the weekly payment and have no other form of income, did not have to wait due to a delay.  We had to find a work-around IT system because had already moved to the new system and the old system was therefore not working.  I say genuinely, and do not think it can be understated, that they worked their socks off to ensure the service we give to our clients is as good and reliable as it always is.  I, for one, am exceptionally grateful for their commitment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600003#A00700","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1537954200,"counter":15,"content":"<p>Since we are taking Questions Nos. 55 and 56 together, Deputies O'Dea and Brady have equal time, but their time is doubled, so they both have a fair crack at the whip.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600003#A00800","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1537954200,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I want to be associated with the Minister's remarks about the staff in the Department.

It is interesting that she said that one month before the introduction, the IMO was consulted and informed that it should co-operate with the use of these forms.  That is exactly what the Minister said, and that is certainly not consultation.  I also heard her apologise to the GPs.  That must be welcomed.  She needs to extend that apology to the people.  We are dealing with some of the sickest people in the State such as cancer patients and terminally ill people who, unfortunately, were caught up in this complete mess.  The National Association of General Practitioners, NAGP, to which Deputy O'Dea alluded, representing the vast majority of GPs, has tried to engage with the Minister and the Department in this entire process and has been completely ignored.

We have never, ever told anyone to get on with anything, so I do not know who is giving Deputy O'Dea his information but it is not quite accurate.  Our relationship with individual GPs is based on individual contracts.  There are no representative bodies with which we negotiate or mediate.  We deal directly with our GPs.  However, out of respect for the long-standing framework that has existed in this country, of which Deputy O'Dea is well aware, and which was established by Fianna F&aacute;il many years ago, and perhaps to flag potential issues we ourselves within the Department would not have seen, we did have discussions with the IMO.  Those discussions were fruitful and, notwithstanding other issues and other new efficiencies that will be discussed over the coming months, the IMO instructed its GPs that they should move ahead with the new, more efficient process being enabled by the Department to ensure the efficiencies provided by the GPs and the Department result in expedited claims and payments for the clients who rely on them.  This is exactly what happened for all the GPs who used the new forms that were scanned in.  Normally one must wait a week and get paid a week in arrears on an illness payment.  People are now getting paid on day two.  There are huge efficiencies, and I am very grateful to all the GPs who have come on board.  I apologise to the Acting Chairman for rabbiting on.

The Deputy cannot say on the one hand that one organisation represents 80% of the people it represents when, on the other, another organisation claims more or less the same thing because both sets of details cannot be true.  In the case of GPs, the representative body which is affiliated with ICTU and has been for many years is the IMO.  The NAGP is a relatively new body which is not affiliated with ICTU, and the Department's understanding is that its membership is less than that of the IMO.  Nevertheless, the Department is happy to take input from the NAGP and has had some contact with the organisation and will consider any input we receive from it regarding any efficiencies it might like to see in our system and our offering.  We will, however, continue to hold substantive discussions with the IMO as it is the body that is recognised as holding the representative rights for all GPs.<\/p>  <p>  If Deputy Brady wants to make stuff up as he goes along, that is his will, and it is probably a practice that is well engaged by Sinn F&eacute;in.  The reality of the matter is that the new forms and the new system have brought far greater efficiencies than were ever there before.  When we used to get an old form and it had to be manually inputted, people would have to wait perhaps five or six days for their illness payments.  Now when the form comes in it is scanned in on the same day and the client gets the payment the following day.  I do not know in what world Deputy Brady does not think that is a better system.  In our world, however, we think that having efficiencies is a good thing, not only in the Department, which ultimately saves the Department money and allows us then to spend that money elsewhere.

This included the policy to introduce the TCA model.  The consultation process was lengthy, thorough and inclusive and involved regional seminars, a national conference and consultation meetings with sectoral interests, as well as many written submissions.  The consultation informed the development of the 2010 national pensions framework, which set out the policy to introduce the TCA, indeed by Deputy O'Dea's party, which was in government at that stage.  This approach was subsequently endorsed by the OECD in its review of the Irish pension system in 2013.<\/p>  <p>  As the Government intends to introduce the TCA from 2020, I launched a public consultation on its design on 28 May.<\/p><p>This consultation is not about the policy concept or rationale, which has been well thought out, but the design and implementation of the TCA.  My Department invited a range of sectoral interest groups and the media to the formal launch at which we provided, I hope, an informative presentation.  More important, we hosted a series of workshops on the various aspects of the proposed reform and there was also a separate briefing for Members of the Oireachtas and their staff.  The consultation was hosted on the Department's website and it was open to everyone to submit responses and make submissions.<\/p> <p> The consultation lasted for over three months and we received almost 300 responses by the time it closed on 3 September.  These responses are being examined and considered and we will publish a summary of the outcomes on the Department's website when that work is completed, and I will also let the Deputy know the details.  The initial analysis shows the main areas of concern to respondents include the number of contributions required to receive a full pension, the amount of credited contributions that will be available and whether there should be a phase-in period for its introduction.<\/p> <p> I thank all those who made submissions.  I was at pains to ensure we did not just get representative bodies replying in an official capacity, given that is their job.  I was keen to hear from the people who will be affected by this.

How wedded is the Government to the 40-year baseline?

I am a told a Deputy made a similar submission, although I am not sure if it was Deputy O'Dea.  I am conscious it is one of the matters that has to be considered before we make the final decision.  Forty years is the norm for many pensions and it is the number that will be required under the TCA 2012 model.  When the legislation is passed in regard to those affected by the 2012 rate band changes, the Deputy will be aware that as the class S contributions were only introduced in 1988, it will be challenging for many self-employed people to qualify for a full pension by 2020 if the number of contributions at the time exceeds 32.  The early analysis from the consultation shows that, for some of those who responded, a more transitional model is preferred, whereby those qualifying in 2020 would have a lower bar than those qualifying in the later years and would have the opportunity to catch up by, say, 2028, given that the latter would have had more access to PRSI contributions than the people who were there beforehand.  The Deputy will appreciate that I cannot pre-empt any of the deliberations we will have on the outcome.  However, the reason we ask for submissions is to consider them exceptionally carefully.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the Deputy's other point, the number of paid contributions to qualify for the contributory State pension has increased over the years.  The most recent increase to 520 was agreed and passed in legislation by the Deputy's party in government in 1997 and implemented in 2012.  This was also raised in a number of submissions, including that made by the Deputy on behalf of his party.  Again, it is something that will be considered in the context of the new proposals.

Within this region, unemployment has fallen from a peak of 16.6% in 2012 to 5.8% at the end of July 2018.  Numbers in employment in the region have increased from 153,700 to 214,200 over the same period.  While data from the labour force survey are not available on a county-by-county level, trends in the live register can give an indication of underlying trends in local unemployment.  I am pleased that they are positive for Tipperary.  Overall, the live register in Tipperary has fallen by 46% in the five years to August 2018, which is close to the reduction of 48% nationally.  If the Deputy is under the impression his area is lagging behind the rest of the country, I am pleased to tell him it is not.  In the year to August 2018, the live register in Tipperary had fallen by 1,270 people, or 12%, again, closely in line with national trends.  In Tipperary town, the live register has fallen from 1,840 in 2012 to 962 currently, that is, by almost half.<\/p>  <p>  The Government's primary strategy to tackle unemployment is twofold.  First, the Action Plan for Jobs, which was originally led by the former Minister for Jobs Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, and is now led by the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Heather Humphreys, sets out to create an environment in which businesses can succeed and create jobs.  That success is evident and I wish continued success to all of those people.  This policy now includes a specific regional action plan relating to the former south-east region, covering south Tipperary.  The plan has resulted in more than 21,000 jobs being created in the region in the past three years.  Successful implementation of the plan is targeted at the creation of 25,000 additional jobs in the region by 2020.  The plan aims to achieve this through building on key sectors of potential for the region like technology, biopharma and tourism in the beautiful county of Tipperary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600005#C00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1537955400,"counter":45,"content":"<p>The Minister will be aware that one of the most accurate indicators of deprivation according to population statistics comes from the national census of population, as represented by the Pobal HP deprivation index.

The scheme currently supports more than 39,000 recipients and their almost 73,000 children and has played an important role in providing income support to lone parents since its introduction in 1997.  However, income support for lone parents was passive in nature in the past and involved limited engagement by the State employment services with recipients.  Research shows that being at work reduces the at-risk-of-poverty rate for lone parents by 75% compared to those who do not work.  This highlights that the best way to tackle poverty among lone parents is to assist them into education and then employment or directly into employment.  Access to activation supports is vital to achieve this objective and it is, therefore, imperative that the Department continues to engage with lone parents to assist them into good careers.<\/p>  <p>  The unconditional nature of the payment, which was unique in Europe, coupled with its long duration, has, over time, contributed to long-term social welfare dependency and, as the Deputy rightly describes, associated poverty among many lone parents and their children.  Reforms to the scheme were introduced to address the issue of poverty specifically.  The reforms provide enhanced access to the Department's Intreo service for lone parents once the youngest child turns seven years of age.   Access to the Department's range of education and employment support services is essential to facilitate lone parents to progress into sustainable employment and financial independence.  Budget 2018 contained a number of measures to support lone parents, including working lone parents.  For example, a lone parent on the jobseeker's transitional payment working 15 hours at the national minimum wage experienced an increase in his or her overall income of almost &euro;1,000 per annum.  The budget also increased the disregard and the qualified-child payment which changes saw some people being moved out of consistent poverty.  While I agree with the Deputy that we have a long way to go, it is only by intensifying the supports we give to those 39,000 lone parents that we will achieve fruitful careers and financial independence for them for the rest of their lives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600006#D01700","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1537956000,"counter":63,"content":"<p>I am honestly shocked that the words I hear the Minister speak today are the exact same words Senator Kevin Humphreys used when, as Minister of State with responsibility in this area, he introduced the cuts in a lone-parent's allowance when a child reached seven years.

I understand that the Indecon report, which reviewed the effect of the cuts, showed a 50% increase in poverty for those families.  I disagree fundamentally with the basic premise that parenting is not work, does not count, is passive and does not matter, and that one has to get people into the workplace to tackle social inclusion.  If the Taoiseach said after the recent abortion referendum that the key thing we had to do now was make Ireland the best place in the world to raise all families, what is being done with these most vulnerable families is wrong.  It is an opinion which is formed on an economic analysis that caring does not matter and that lone parents are a problem who must be got out of the home and into the workplace at all costs.  It is a fundamentally wrong approach and a tragedy that it is applying now, whatever about it applying in 2012 when we had no money.  It is ideological and that is why I have a concern.

I have made commitments to ensure I will continue to do that.  The Deputy has conflated the cuts that were made in 2012 and 2013 with the changes in policy.  I reiterate that the Indecon review on the one-parent family payment changes, which was worth every single penny we were charged, found that those changes resulted in an increase in employment among lone parents and a decrease in welfare dependency.  I am the first person to stand here and admit to the Deputy that the cuts were harsh, targeted and unfair.  That is why I am unravelling them.

There are always issues about figures in here, such as those we heard about housing in the last while.  Is the Minister aware of the South East Economic Monitor?  I do not know if the Minister reads it but the latest edition was published a couple of months ago.  This publication provides an analysis of the regional economy carried out by independent non-politically affiliated academics.  It is independent of the Minister's Department interpretation and independent of my interpretation of what might be happening in Wexford or the south east.  One of the points made by the monitor is that between the first quarter of 2017 and the first quarter of 2018 the number of people in work increased by 62,000 nationally, but in the south east the monitor maintains that the number actually decreased.  There were 2,400 fewer people working in the south east in that period, and therefore the so-called reduction in unemployment is accounted for primarily by individuals leaving the region's labour force.  If that is true it is pretty worrying.  I do not know if the Minister is familiar with those statistics but I am interested to hear what she has to say about them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600007#E01300","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speech","time":1537956600,"counter":80,"content":"<p>I am not but I will make myself familiar with those statistics later on and I will come back to the Deputy to either refute them or, if they can be substantiated, say that we have more work to do.

This means that people who were not on the live register actively seeking jobs decided to take up the jobs that were being created or that people are moving to Wexford to take up the jobs.

Only 2.2% of the Ireland 2040 capital investment in higher education is due to be spent in the south east.  I am aware that Wexford is different again; the live register figure for Wexford in July was 15.5%.  Wexford is by far the worse off of those counties in the south-east region.  I honestly believe that the statistics bear out the fact that we are one of the top three most deprived counties in the State currently.  There is a real need for cross party co-operation to address this.  There is a need for some really proactive work across the Departments to change that.  Wexford has been a deprived county for a long time and this is directly linked to the fact that we have the highest suicide rate in the State for the last three years.  The Minister will be aware that mental health challenges and deprivation are very strongly linked.  Might there be an appetite for cross-party co-operation to look at the realities of the situation in Wexford? It did not start with this Government: umpteen Governments have failed to do this.

There are tremendous amounts of supports available in Wexford and in recognising it is lagging a little bit behind the rest of the country.  There are 40 case activation officers looking at the people in the region on the live register.  There are a number of training initiatives that have been developed with the Waterford and Wexford Education and Training Board with a wide variety of courses to go to.  The Turas Nua offices there are helping people to find the real jobs that are being created.

In line with the then existing arrangements for unemployment assistance, including the smallholders and pre-retirement allowances, the income of farm assist recipients was exempt from class S pay related social insurance, PRSI, for self-employed workers.  Recipients of farm assist who had previously paid class S social insurance had the option of paying voluntary contributions to maintain their social insurance record, provided they satisfied all of the qualifying conditions.  Since 1 January 2007, the exemption from class S PRSI has been removed and those receiving jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and farm assist are subject to class S PRSI as self-employed contributors on their self-employed income, provided their annual income is &euro;5,000 or more.<\/p>  <p>  There are currently no plans to amend legislation relating to the State contributory pension to award a maximum rate of payment to pensioners who had a period between 1999 and 2006 when they were exempt from paying PRSI contributions.  However, a person aged over 66 with limited PRSI contributions over the course of his or her life may claim a State non-contributory pension if he or she has an income need and this entitlement is not based on the payment of social insurance contributions but on the basis of need.  The maximum weekly rate is &euro;232 which is over 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate.

She referred to the fact that farm assist was introduced in 1999.  At that time Deputies O'Dea, Durkan and I, as well as most Members of this House representing rural constituencies, were very strong in our advocacy for replacing the smallholder's allowance with farm assist unemployment assistance.  The Minister's predecessor at that time, Dr. Michael Woods and the late Joe Walsh, the then Minister for Agriculture and Food, were to the fore in introducing the new scheme which took account of present income circumstances, unlike the smallholder's assistance payment, which was very much based on historical income for the previous 12 months.  As we all know, farm incomes can change very suddenly if there is an outbreak of disease and a total or partial depopulation of a herd, for example.<\/p>  <p>  In the instances I have come across, those farmers who took up farm assist for a short time continued to make tax returns but were not informed by Revenue or by the Department that they needed to make a contribution to maintain their insurance record.

The cases with which I am dealing all involve people who did not employ an accountant to file their tax returns because they were not in a financial position to do so.

On 23 January last the Government agreed to my proposal that would allow pensioners affected by the 2012 changes in rate bands to have their pension entitlement calculated on a total contributions basis, including a provision for up to 20 years of a new home caring credit.  Legislation will have to be enacted to enable the implementation of these arrangements and a number of options regarding the best approach to passing that legislation are being considered.  In addition, a new information technology system must be developed in line with the legislation.  My Department is currently working on both of these projects and both are at a very advanced stage.  We must then design the procedures with which we will work.  We are currently recruiting some temporary staff who will conduct the reviews.  Once recruitment is completed, we will start carrying out the reviews.<\/p>  <p>  My Department will write to the 67,000 impacted customers in the next number of weeks to explain to them what is happening and how the review process will work.  As I have stated previously, it is still planned to commence these reviews before the end of this year, with the first payments being made in the first quarter of 2019, backdated, where relevant, to the end of March 2018, or later where a person attained his or her 66th birthday after that date.  I wish to reassure people that it is not necessary for them to contact the Department on this matter.  Once the legislation is enacted and the systems and processes are ready, my Department will write again to the people impacted and provide them with the opportunity to have their pension recalculated.  Once they are presented with the recalculation, they will then have the option of continuing on their old pension payment or moving to a new pension payment.  I have been asked on a number of occasions if there will be winners and losers in this recalculation process, as has happened on different occasions in the past but I can absolutely assure Deputies and those listening that there will be no losers.  Those whose pension entitlements are recalculated and are found to be smaller than their current payment will obviously choose to stay on the current payment.  That said, the anticipated outcome of the process is that the majority of the 67,000 people who were adversely affected will be positively impacted by the recalculation and will be moved to a new, higher payment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600008#F02000","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1537957200,"counter":106,"content":"<p>I will now invite Deputies to respond in the order in which their questions were submitted.

They are not employees of my Department or public servants.  There are currently 1,346\u00a0supervisors or assistant supervisors\u00a0employed with CE sponsor organisations.  My Department funds wages and training costs in respect of CE participants and supervisors.  It does not, and has not, provided provision for funding for CE supervisor pensions.<\/p><p>Employers, including CE sponsoring organisations, are legally obliged to offer access to at least one standard personal retirement savings account, PRSA, under the Pension (Amendment) Act 2002.  I am sure the Deputy is well aware of that.  On foot of the Labour Court recommendation, the issue of CE supervisor pensions is currently being examined by a community sector high-level forum, which is chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  A number of Departments, including mine, are represented on this group, as are the unions and Pobal.<\/p><p>A detailed scoping exercise was carried out with input from the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, IGEES, on the costs of providing Exchequer support for the establishment of such a pension scheme for employees across the community and voluntary sector.  The exercise clearly illustrated that this matter presents significant issues for the Exchequer, with a potential cost to the State of &euro;188 million per annum in respect of funding to enable an employer pension contribution in State-funded community and voluntary organisations, excluding any provision for immediate <i>ex gratia<\/i>lump sum payment of pension as sought, which could, depending on the size of the sector, entail a further Exchequer cost of up to &euro;318 million.<\/p><p>I am very conscious that while the issue relates to CE supervisors and assistant supervisors, such individuals comprise\u00a0just one small group within the wider community and voluntary sector.  Any provision of State funding for such a scheme in respect of those employees could potentially give rise to claims for similar schemes on the part of those in the broader sector, thus crystallising the level of liability.  Any solution to this issue will require careful consideration, in particular the implications for scarce Exchequer resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600010#H02275","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1537958400,"counter":145,"content":"<p>The final few points the Minister made are reminiscent of a familiar old mantra.

I am a director of a number of such community companies.  I was involved in them before I became involved in politics and have been all through my political career.  Wonderful work is carried out that benefits both the individuals themselves through the training provided and their work in communities.

Immediately, she revealed her main concern was the significant burden and cost education was placing on the household budget, which admittedly was limited.  I refer to the pressure owing to her children going back to school.  More important, the pressure of paying a voluntary subscription to the school was real because it was made clear that failure to do so would mean her children would not gain access to textbooks and materials centrally procured by the school.  The subscription had to be paid up front by the parent.<\/p>  <p>  This illustrates that the ongoing cost of education and going back to school is genuinely growing.  Schools have little choice but to raise funds voluntarily.  We know from the Grant Thornton report of last February that the average Government allocation to schools for operating costs, amounting to &euro;46,000 per year, does not cover the average expenditure, which is approximately &euro;91,000.  Lighting, cleaning, heating, insurance, equipment and printing add to the costs and increase the expenditure when running a school.  Small and medium-sized schools suffer even more.  DEIS schools, or disadvantaged schools, because they do not have the capacity to raise money, are particularly disadvantaged.  They cannot fundraise.<\/p>  <p>  The Oireachtas education committee, under the chairmanship of Deputy Fiona O'Loughlin, held valuable hearings in August on this subject.  The Catholic Primary Schools Management Association made a presentation to the committee and stated unequivocally that the current model is unsustainable.  It stated the issue is urgent and that many schools are running out of contingency funds and are running deficits.  The chief executive officer of the Irish League of Credit Unions, Mr. Ed Farrell, told the committee that the league's annual back-to-school survey results showed a rise in the number of parents in debt due to back-to-school-related costs.  Well over one third of parents in Ireland said they were getting into debt to cover back-to-school costs.  In particular, the credit unions were worried about the prevalence of moneylenders and the degree to which they are giving loans to parents to try to get through this difficult period.  Some 46% of parents said that the cost of going back to school was their biggest worry, and 67% said it represented a significant financial burden.  Four in ten said they would not be in a position to afford new shoes for their children, while seven in ten said extracurricular activities would have to be cut.<\/p>  <p>  One of the most effective ways to deal with this, among a number of measures, is to accept that the existing capitation grant is wholly inadequate to fund primary schools, particularly the small and medium-sized schools and DEIS schools.  Does the Taoiseach accept that?  Does he agree this must be a budget priority and that provision must be made for an increased capitation grant in the forthcoming budget, with a commitment to phased increases in subsequent budgets to try to reduce the pressure on parents who find their children's return to school presents a great difficulty?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600012#K00300","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1537959600,"counter":175,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter.  It is raised very much in my engagement with parents as I go around the country and on the occasions on which I knock on doors.  The cost of education can be an enormous burden on families.  Often, these are the same families who bear the high costs of childcare, school transport and, in some cases, rising rents or a large mortgage.<\/p>  <p>  Increasing capitation grants for next year is, of course, a budgetary matter.  No budget decisions have been made as yet but I know it is a priority that Fianna F&aacute;il has raised in negotiations with us on the budget.  In the letter I wrote to the Deputy last month suggesting that we continue the confidence and supply arrangement through to 2020, I specifically listed this matter as one that should be included as part of a future arrangement, should Fianna F&aacute;il choose to continue the confidence and supply agreement through to the summer of 2020, as I proposed.  It is also included in the programme for Government.<\/p>  <p>  It is always necessary to prioritise.  We have a budget of &euro;10 billion this year for education.  It is the largest budget for education in the history of the State.  That is making a difference.  It means we have hired 5,000 more teachers in the past two years.  It means we are building new schools all over the country and extending schools.  It means we are developing technological universities, in Dublin and hopefully soon in the south east.  It means we have more special needs assistants than we ever had in our education service.  It means the pupil-teacher ratio this September is the lowest ever for children attending primary school.  Therefore, we can see how the massive investment in education is making a real difference for children, their teachers and families.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge that, because we had to focus on other areas, we have not been able to increase capitation.  It is under consideration for this budget but Deputies should bear in mind that there are always competing priorities.

When the population increases, we will have more teachers.

That is a matter of fact; that happens.  What has not increased in recent years in any shape or form, however, is the capitation grant.  The cost of living is affecting people.  Many parents who have children going back to school face higher costs.  These individuals are not entitled to the back-to-school allowance or anything like that.  They face a higher cost than others in society.  Priorities, therefore, have to be targeted and focused.  It is clear from all the evidence given to the Oireachtas education committee in August that schools are the end of their tether and are running deficits.  Parents are under particular pressure.  It is embarrassing for them if they cannot pay.  The children come back from school and say the principal is saying they have to pay the voluntary subscription.  If we were honest about it, we would say it is not voluntary.  There is great pressure on parents to cough up.<\/p><p>Along with an increase in the capitation grant there must be a restatement of the guidelines around that.  Children are conscious of it.

We have already taken people on the lowest incomes out of the tax net altogether and we have relieved them of the burden of the USC, which Fianna F&aacute;il imposed on them.  Some 38% of the lowest earners do not pay any income tax.  Now the focus will be on those on middle incomes.  People on modest incomes of approximately &euro;40,000 pay the highest rate of income tax on some of their income.  We believe that is unfair.  We stand over our policy of taking the lowest paid out of the tax net altogether and now focusing on those on middle incomes.

However, we have done better than that.  If spending had only grown in line with demographics the pupil-teacher ratio would have stayed the same, but we have improved on that.  That is why we have the lowest pupil-teacher ratio ever this September.  There are also more resource teachers, 500 new guidance counsellors, 500 deputy principals to give schools better management, as well as junior cycle reform.

The national executive of the Psychiatric Nurses Association is also meeting today to consider the recent report of the Public Service Pay Commission.  For years nurses, midwives and their unions have highlighted the recruitment and retention crisis in the health service.  They have proposed reasonable and responsible solutions to address it, yet there has been complete disengagement from the Government on the issue.<\/p>  <p>  The Public Service Pay Commission report was supposed to independently analyse and assess the crisis, its causes and how to address the problems.  However, as the report conveys, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, met the commission in October 2017 to emphasise that its work \"is not a pay review nor can it be\".  It is clear that from the outset the Government was determined that a commission mandated to investigate both pay and conditions was to focus solely on conditions and to disregard pay.  It appears as if it was determined to establish the conclusions of the report long before the work had even begun.  In carrying out its international pay comparisons the report acknowledges the number of nurses and midwives who have chosen to work in Britain instead of Ireland.  While acknowledging the fact that pay and conditions vary across England, the report failed to address adequately differences in pay between Ireland and London specifically, a popular destination for our nurses and where entry pay is more than &euro;3,000 higher.  A pay comparison that fails to address adequately one of the most popular destinations for our nurses is flawed.<\/p>  <p>  Our nurses and midwives perform an invaluable service to patients in the health service and we should expect their jobs to pay well and to have high morale in their ranks.  However, that is not the case.  There is only one application for every four nursing and midwifery vacancies in the health service.  In the meantime the Government does not wish to talk about pay, but that is the conversation that must take place.  It wilfully ignores that this will only worsen the state of the health service and make it impossible to implement Sl&aacute;intecare fully.  All the while the bill for agency staff continues to spiral.  In April, the D&aacute;il passed a Sinn F&eacute;in motion calling for the introduction of recruitment and retention measures based on realistic proposals which would prioritise pay.  It called on the Government to work with the unions to draw up a roadmap for pay equality and how that would be achieved for nurses and midwives, with an implementation plan to deliver pay equality within a short timeframe and not the eight-year timeframe the Government now proposes.

That is the reason we have a public sector pay deal which was agreed less than a year ago.  That deal runs for the next three years and it applies to all public servants in the country.  It provides for pay increases every year for the next three years at a total cost to the taxpayer of &euro;400 million last year.  We made that agreement after engaging with unions and we intend to honour it.  We certainly hope all the unions honour the agreement they made with the Government and Irish taxpayer.  The agreement runs for three years and all public servants will receive pay increases every year.  There are over &euro;400 million worth of pay increases for public servants next year, which is about as much as we can afford.  We do not wish to repeat the mistakes of the past and to start borrowing money to pay for pay increases.  That is illusory.  It would mean going back to the cycle of pay increases followed by pay cuts down the line.<\/p>  <p>  The Public Service Pay Commission report is worth reading, and I am sure the Deputy has read it.  It is based on facts and puts forward solutions.  Those who are not interested in point scoring or exploiting industrial relations issues will find it very informative.  It is independent, incidentally.  It was not written by the Government or a civil servant or anybody in the Department of Finance.  Anybody could make submissions and many people did so.  The report sets out the facts.  One of those facts is that the number of nurses working in the public health service has been increasing year on year for the past three years.  It shows that pay is comparable with the UK and Europe and that Ireland has a high number of nurses per bed relative to other countries.  These are the facts, not my opinion.  They are set out in black and white in the Public Service Pay Commission report.  The report also points out that many countries are struggling to recruit and retain nurses because there is an international shortage of nurses.  Pay measures alone will not change that.  Just as there are Irish nurses in Australia and the UK there are nurses in Ireland from the UK, Spain, India and all parts of the world.  Those are the facts in the report.<\/p>  <p>  One of the most pertinent facts we should not deny, because it is set out in the report and in the OECD figures, is that Ireland has more nurses per head of population than most countries in the world.  It is in the top five or six.  If one reduces the number of nurses per bed it is even higher.  Any reforms must involve changes to how we deploy our nurses to ensure nurses are used in appropriate roles.  For example, in Ireland nurses are doing jobs that would be done by theatre assistants or scrub technicians in the United States and we have nurses doing jobs in outpatient departments that would be done by other grades.  Reform must involve those types of changes.  Of course we are willing to engage on that type of reform.  That is what Sl&aacute;intecare is about, reform and not more of the same.  If more nurses, more pay, more beds and more of the same was the solution we would be improving the health services now.  We do not need more of the same but a different approach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600013#L00400","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1537960200,"counter":181,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach is not contesting the fact that there is one application for every four nursing and midwifery vacancies in the health service.

As the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, often states - and he is right - there is only a set amount of money.  We have set aside approximately &euro;400 million for pay increases for public servants next year.  There is a point at which if we go beyond that, we either have to take the money out of public services, new schools, new hospitals and away from new medicines or borrow it and then pay later.

When the economy collapsed, Ireland's tax base was exposed as fragile and narrow.  Ten years ago, tax receipts fell by 30% in one year.  This did not happen by accident.  For a decade, Fianna F&aacute;il had riddled the tax system with all sorts of tax breaks and bought popularity at budget time by cutting personal taxes to a level far below those of other European countries.  The property boom meant that windfall tax receipts from stamp duties and VAT brought in the necessary cash for public spending.  This all ended with the economic collapse, leaving Ireland unable to pay for basic public services such as schools, hospitals and the Garda.  We all know the history because the people of Ireland suffered and endured it.  It is not clear that the current Government has learned the lessons of history.  I am determined that we will not return to a situation where our basic health and social services are vulnerable to collapse because our tax system is weak.<\/p>  <p>  Tax lobbyists are seeking cuts to income taxes, with comparisons being made with personal tax levels of ten years ago.  From my perspective, income taxes in 2008 were excessively low.  Government spokespeople have suggested in the last week or ten days that the local property tax should no longer be linked to property values, which totally undermines the logic of a tax on assets and undermines the economic benefits of such a tax in dampening the growth in property prices.  This Government is now, I believe, embarked on the same process of driving down income tax.  From what we have heard in terms of the kites that have been flown over the past ten days, its focus is almost entirely on the top 20% of income earners.  Reports from the Revenue Commissioners make it crystal clear that only the top 19% of taxpayers pay any tax at the higher rate, which means over 80% do not.  Yet the Taoiseach insists on calling this 19% of taxpayers \"the middle\", as he did again today.  They are not \"the middle\".  The Taoiseach obsesses about the marginal rate of income tax.  I remind him that I was directly involved in the negotiations in respect of which the Taoiseach referenced Fine Gael having taken the lowest paid workers out of the income tax system.  The Labour Party insisted on that.  I negotiated directly with the Minister for Finance.  Fine Gael's plan was to reduce the top rate of income tax but by agreement, we took the lowest paid out of the universal social charge.  Despite that almost all north-western European countries have higher rates of personal income tax than Ireland, the Government is talking about reducing income tax.  My point is there is a real risk of repeating the disasters mistakes of the past.<\/p>  <p>  Will the Taoiseach confirm that only the top 19% of income taxpayers pay tax at the marginal rate at present and will the Government confirm its intention to strengthen rather than weaken the overall tax base of this economy in the forthcoming budget to ensure we provide decent and sustainable public services into the future?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600014#M00600","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1537960800,"counter":188,"content":"<p>The Deputy raises some valid points.  In respect of our tax base, ten years ago we relied heavily on stamp duty, tax revenues from capital gains tax and tax receipts from the property sector.  Now, our tax base is much more broadly based.  We have a local property tax which, unpopular as it may be, has broadened our tax base.  We also have a sugar tax and a carbon tax and as such we have a much more broadly based system than we had ten years ago.  The area of vulnerability is corporation profit tax.  In the past couple of years, we have had a windfall in terms of big increases in taxes from big companies.  We cannot make long-term spending commitments with this money because we cannot be sure it will available to us in a year or two.  While I acknowledge the issue the Deputy raises, it is important to make that the point that we do have a much more broadly based tax system now.  If there is a vulnerability, it is not around income tax but corporation profit tax and whether we will be able to take in as much money from corporations in two or three years' time as we do now.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy also mentioned that there are a lot of people talking about a return to the low taxes we had ten years ago as if ten years ago, pre-crash, was somehow normal.  This applies to other areas as well.  There are people talking about a return to the pay levels we had ten years ago and to the house prices we had ten years ago, as if ten years ago was normal.  If we return to the pay levels, house prices and low taxes we had ten years ago we are heading for another crash.  This Government needs to be responsible and to try to contain the increase in house prices, the increase in demands for higher pay and the increase in demands for lower taxes.  If people think that what we had in Ireland ten years ago was normal, we are heading for another crash.  This Government will be responsible and make sure that does not happen on any of those levels - tax, pay, spending or property prices.  <\/p>  <p>  On income tax, I can assure the Deputy that our plan is to raise more from income tax in 2019 than we will in 2018.  This is largely due to increasing employment and higher incomes and not due to rising taxes.  We do not intend to cut the marginal rate.  Our focus is on average incomes.  The average person in Ireland working full-time, excluding students, earns approximately &euro;44,000 per annum, some of which is subject to tax at the higher rate.  I believe people who earn &euro;40,000 or &euro;50,000 are \"the middle\".

The issue is that people's incomes have not recovered, such that they are worse off in terms of affordability.<\/p>  <p>  What is demonstrable now is the priority for our economy must be to invest in quality public services.  This is what all of the people want.  The Government proposes to give a marginal tax break to 19% of taxpayers.  There will be no benefit for 81% of taxpayers.  A marginal tax break for 19% of taxpayers is not a tax break for \"the middle\".  I am sure that if asked directly, that 19% of taxpayers would prefer to have that money invested in health and education.  <\/p><p>I ask for that to be the priority as the Government approaches the budget, rather than falling into the notion that everything can be done at once and that it can give tax breaks and invest in quality public services at the same time.

We will reduce the deficit and our national debt will fall as a percentage of gross domestic product, GDP.  The first principle is to be prudent.<\/p>  <p>  The second priority is investment in public infrastructure and services.  We will increase spending on public infrastructure and services by &euro;3.4 billion next year at least.  There will be a 25% increase in capital spending on new homes, healthcare facilities, schools, transport infrastructure and broadband.  Anything more than that would probably drive up construction inflation and would not allow us to build any more.<\/p>  <p>  The third priority is that there will be a tax and welfare package which will put money back in people's pockets, not just middle income tax payers but also pensioners and people on welfare.

Earlier in the summer, the head of the Climate Change Advisory Council, Professor John FitzGerald, said that we are off course and heading rapidly in the wrong direction.  At last week's Joint Committee on Climate Action meeting, we asked for the Secretary General of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to appear in advance of this afternoon's committee meeting and if we could see a first draft of the plan that the Government has to present to the European Union by Christmas, only to be told yesterday by the secretariat that no such plan exists yet.  Ms Marie Donnelly, a former Irish civil servant in the European Commission set out a vision of how we could turn this into an opportunity for our country at last week's meeting.  By being ambitious and going for a zero-carbon Ireland, we could create jobs and opportunities right across the country.  We have to have the draft by Christmas but in truth this is a question for Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin as much as for Deputies McDonald, Howlin and every other Deputy in this D&aacute;il because the final sign off on this new climate action plan, which is the one we have to do, will not be agreed by this Government but by the next Government towards the end of next year.<\/p>  <p>  My question is whether we are able to make the leap that Ms Donnelly set out.  We have done it previously.  In the late 1950s, we went from a closed economy to an open economy and Fine Gael played its part.  The Taoiseach's party appointed Dr. T.K. Whitaker before Fianna F&aacute;il and supported Se&aacute;n Lemass when the D&aacute;il at that time collectively set our country on a new course.  That is the scale of the historic moment that we are in now and we must organise ourselves in the next 16 to 18 months.  Then we must repeat it for the subsequent six Governments because the reason that Whitaker and Lemass were successful was that there was a stable political agreement in this House to invest in education, join the European Union, set up the Shannon tax free zone and so on.<\/p>  <p>  That level of co-operation, ambition and joint effort is needed and the people are ready for it.  They are good at tackling climate change; they just need some leadership, help and support, which this D&aacute;il must provide.  In going green, which we can do as an island, it will be 40 shades of green.  We must change everything, including our transport system, energy system, food system and business system.  Work must be done in Killybegs, Galway, Shannon, Waterford, Cork, Drogheda, Dundalk, Belfast and Derry to turn them into ports that will bring us energy from our seas.  It will happen on every street where we change them from the current car-dominated streets to greenways such as the one in the Taoiseach's area of Blanchardstown which I am sure he knows.  It is a beautiful cycle path and we need those in every area so that our children can cycle to school and do not have get asthma growing up.  Similarly, instead of looking at the future of farming where the average age of a farmer is 67, let us be bold and ambitious and pay them properly for storing carbon and reduce the average age of farmers in ten years to 37.  This is the front-line of this global challenge, which is the biggest that humankind has ever faced.  We should engage Bord na M&oacute;na to retrofit our homes, double the size of the company and start immediately storing the peat in the ground.  We need to make that level of a leap.<\/p>  <p>  I ask the Taoiseach in the spirit of collaboration to follow the example of those who appointed Whitaker.  We need a Whitaker today within the public service and we need a Lemass in every party to get agreement on this climate leap we need to make.

I will await the report from the all-party committee, which is being ably chaired by my colleague, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton.  On the Government's commitment to climate action, it is important to put the kind of initiatives that the Government has committed to on the record of the House.  We do not need an all-party agreement to make the commitments that we have made.  Under Project Ireland 2040, the largest single bloc of investment is in climate action to the tune of more than &euro;20 billion in investment in infrastructure that will allow us to tackle climate change.  We have confirmed that Ireland will become one of the first countries in the world to ban the use of smoky coals, for example.  Moneypoint will be taken off coal in 2025 and we will be one of the first countries in Europe to come off coal as a means of generating power.  We will take peat out of electricity system by 2030, if not before.  From next year, any new buses that are added to our bus fleet will be either low emission or zero-emission vehicles.  The first few will arrive this year and we will buy no new ones from the middle of next year other than low emission or zero-emission vehicles.  We have agreed to begin electrifying more of our railways, including the Maynooth and Kildare lines.  When BusConnects is looked at, it is not just to do with busses; one quarter of the programme relates to cycling because along those high quality spines and bus lanes, there will be space for bikes as well.  The Deputy is right to acknowledge the enormous investment that this Government has put into greenways, not just in my constituency but also around the country in places such as Waterford, and there will be many more similar investments.  We also have plans to retrofit public buildings and homes to make them more energy efficient.  We have the new renewable electricity support scheme to deliver an additional 3,000 to 4,000 megawatts of renewable energy and we have renewable heat as well.

The director of the rape crisis centre, Mary Crilly, who has outstanding credibility in this field for many years and who has been running that particular centre said the young women involved were between 18 and 19 years of age.  The most alarming fact is the three women did not feel they could go to the Garda because of the circumstances of the sexual assault and the rape.  They went to the rape crisis centre.  They felt it was their own fault as alcohol was involved.  Two of the three women have already dropped out of college.  There is research and evidence to suggest that September and October can be the most dangerous time for young women, particularly first-year students, as they are going to college.  There are commitments in the programme for Government to legislation to reduce excessive delays in trials and court proceedings but this is beyond that.

Last night the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government survived a motion of no confidence as a result of the cowardice of Fianna F&aacute;il.  Despite that, the issue of demanding political accountability for housing and homelessness is not going away.  We need a huge change of direction and policy that delivers secure, affordable housing for all our citizens.  In the coming weeks, we will have a referendum on the issue of blasphemy.  I am sure it is a very worthy issue but it is not the most pressing one we face.  A more productive course of action would be to hold a referendum on the right to housing.  That would give effect to the decision by 80% of the participants in the Constitutional Convention that such a right ought to be enshrined in the Constitution.  It is not a novel idea.  In fact, over 80 countries across the world already have the right to a home enshrined in their basic law and their Constitution.  The Government could and should provide for the holding of a referendum to enshrine a citizen's right to a home and the right to housing in the Constitution and the Government should do it without delay.  It could be done on the occasion of the local and European elections in May if not before that.  Will the Taoiseach take that course of action?  We heard - and I agree with the Taoiseach - that empathy on this issue is not the sole preserve of any party in this House or any individual.

Putting something into the Constitution or law does not mean it will have any impact on people's lives.  There is always the risk that if something is put into the Constitution it may be interpreted in a particular way by the courts.  What if, for example, as in many of those 83 countries, it turned out to be a meaningless right?  What if it turned out to be a basis on which somebody could sue the State and instead of spending money building houses we would spend that money compensating people for not having a house?

The Bill will provide that people who suffered as a result of maternal ingestion of thalidomide are not excluded from pursuing their cases because of time limits in the Statute of Limitations Act 1957.  The Bill will amend the Statute of Limitations Acts of 1957, 1991 and 2000.  I am inserting into the Acts that: &quot;A person shall, in respect of injuries suffered by that person as a result of the ingestion of thalidomide by that person's mother during the person's gestation period, be deemed to be under a disability.&quot;<\/p><p>The background to this is that the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, and his Department have been trying to technically knock-out thalidomide victims and litigants and victims by using these limits in a case management action in the High Court.  New thalidomide victims who have emerged since the 1960s, as well as those not acknowledged as survivors back then, remain unacknowledged by the HSE and the Minister for Health.  They have never received any entitlements from the State associated with their injuries.  They should have the right to make their case if they can, and should not be locked out by a timing or technical issue.  The State, through the Irish Thalidomide Medical Assessment Board of the 1960s, failed to acknowledge many people who were injured by the ingestion of thalidomide by their mothers.  Fifty years later, sufferers are still emerging as there is a degree of cover-up associated with the existence of records.  The unfortunate situation is that my Bill is sadly too late to help two of these litigants, who have passed away since the action began four years ago.  I hope the Government will take this legislation on board so that those who have survived can proceed with their cases.  It is not right that they should be stopped from taking their cases because of the Statute of Limitations.  They deserve the right to pursue their action.  Even with my proposed change, those people will still have to prove their cases, which will not be easy, given the length of time involved.  <\/p><p>Thalidomide survivors have been subjected to threats - by way of court applications - that their claims will be struck out on the grounds of timing and for the failure to provide medical records details.  The State is being intransigent and difficult with thalidomide survivors, which is shameful given what befell those people.  Furthermore, this House is being told that the reason the litigation is not resolved is that any payments of compensation would become deductible from German or Irish state pension entitlements.  This statement is inaccurate.  These litigants have never received a penny of compensation or of pension entitlement, or any thalidomide-related benefit at all from the State.  A 2010 State Claims Agency report on the thalidomide controversy was fundamentally flawed, and the State has held on to an entrenched position because of that.  The report did not acknowledge that thalidomide remained on the Irish market for several years after the date of the knowledge that it posed a risk.  Like the cervical cancer cover-up of this century, in the previous century, pregnant women who ingested thalidomide were never told that their unborn babies could have been injured <i>in utero<\/i>.  Why Ireland neglected to withdraw and recall thalidomide in a timely manner back in the 1960s has never been properly explained.<\/p><p> Unlike in the aftermath of the cervical cancer controversy though, no provision of funding has been delivered to the HSE by the Minister for Health or his Department to enable it to provide the necessary medical records to thalidomide litigants.  The Minister of Health has a conflict in this matter.  One one side, he underfunds the HSE's facilities for the provision of medical records, with the consequent effect that thalidomide litigants are placed in a vulnerable position in that their cases could be struck out for failure to provide medical records.  On the other side, the Minister for Health is a defendant in the very same court proceedings.  It is therefore within his remit and that of his Department to cure the issue upon which advantage is being sought in regard to litigation.<\/p> <p> The Minister and his Department need to end the two-faced tactic of sympathising with victims on one hand and blocking their progress on the other.  In this action by the thalidomide survivors, more than 1,100 court documents have had to be filed so far.  Some 1,539 of the medical records have been sought by the defendants and the Minister from the survivors as well.  The hospital system's ability to deliver the records is very limited, so the litigants are in a catch-22.  It is important that the medical records are delivered to the litigants, and I would like to see collective agreement in this House so that this legislation can be progressed.  I welcome the thalidomide survivors who are in the Gallery today and want to see political progress on this.

During that visit, I attended and spoke at the event that formally launched Ireland's bid.  I also spoke at an event commemorating Ireland's record of 60 years of unbroken service on UN peacekeeping operations and met with representatives of more than 30 African Union member states to emphasise Ireland's commitment to partnership with the continent, and to highlight Ireland's Security Council campaign.<\/p>  <p>  I made a return visit to the UN earlier this week to represent Ireland at the Nelson Mandela Peace Summit, where leaders and representatives of more than 130 countries gathered to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the birth of Nelson Mandela as part of the week's events around the United Nations General Assembly.  The political declaration from the Summit reaffirms the signatories&rsquo; commitment to the three UN pillars: peace and security, development, and human rights.  It also reaffirms the importance of the multilateral system in preventing and resolving conflict.  Ireland and South Africa led the preparation of this political declaration.<\/p>  <p>  While at the UN this week, I had the opportunity to meet bilaterally with the Presidents of South Africa, Namibia, Columbia and Mozambique, the Prime Minister of New Zealand and the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Malawi.<\/p>  <p>  During each of these meetings we discussed our bilateral relations as well as Ireland's campaign for a seat on the UN Security Council.  I also had the opportunity to discuss these issues in informal conversations with several other Heads of State and Government, including the Cypriot President, Prime Ministers Trudeau of Canada, Muscat of Malta, and Ratas of Estonia, and with senior UN officials including Secretary General Ant&oacute;nio Guterres, Deputy Secretary General Amina Mohammed, and President of the General Assembly Mar&iacute;a Fernanda Espinosa Garc&eacute;s.<\/p>  <p>  Attendance at the United Nations also presents the opportunity to engage on an impromptu basis with many people in leadership positions in politics, international development and civic society.  Among others, I met informally with the widow of Nelson Mandela, Ms Graca Machel; the Secretary General of the Arab League, the Secretary General of Amnesty International, Mr. Kumi Naidoo, and representatives of the Governments of Monaco, Bahrain, Guyana, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. <\/p>  <p>  I am sure the House will agree that Ireland's credentials as a candidate for the Security Council are very strong.  Since joining the UN in 1955, Ireland has made a sustained contribution to the international community&rsquo;s efforts to tackle important global challenges like peace and security, human rights, international development, climate change and sustainable development.  Ireland&rsquo;s candidature for a seat on the UN Security Council will deepen our UN engagement at a time when the multilateral institutions which are so important for international peace and order are under pressure.<\/p>  <p>  Before I travelled to New York last weekend I had the opportunity to meet Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas during his short visit to Ireland.  We were joined by the T&aacute;naiste and by members of President Abbas's delegation including Deputy Prime Minister Abu-Amr, Foreign Minister al-Maliki, and chief negotiator Saeb Erekat.<\/p>  <p>  Our discussions covered the Middle East peace process, Ireland's support for the Palestinian people and challenges facing the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian people regarding peace, security, welfare and human rights.  I emphasised to President Abbas the Irish Government's continued and consistent support for the rights and aspirations of the Palestinian people.<\/p>  <p>  As regards further international engagements over the next six months, I will attend the scheduled meetings of the European Council in Brussels on 17 and 18 of October and 13 and 14 of December.  I will also attend any extra meetings of the European Council that are scheduled, including the one mooted for November.  I expect to attend the next meeting of the British-Irish Council scheduled for 9 November in the Isle of Man.<\/p>  <p>  I will also continue with my programme of bilateral meetings with other members of the European Council.

He has long-fingered this issue.  He says that he will do it in the context of a two-state solution, at a time when that looks very remote; a time of great trouble in the Middle East and particularly in Gaza.  It is the will of the Oireachtas to recognise the state of Palestine.  Rather than waiting for the solution, I argue that recognising Palestinian statehood is a necessary precondition and ingredient of advancing towards it.<\/p>  <p>  As the Taoiseach says, on Monday he addressed the Nelson Mandela Peace Summit in New York, held in honour of the centenary of the birth of Nelson Mandela.  That is a considerable honour and privilege, and I hope it was a productive engagement.  I read the speech in which the Taoiseach quite rightly held up our own peace process as a beacon for building peace and reconciliation.  The Good Friday agreement remains a triumph of hope over despair, and it is as relevant today as it was 20 years ago.  Of course it is regrettable that 20 years on, the political institutions of the agreement are not functioning.  In the context of Brexit, the actions of Tory hardliners, the denial of rights by the DUP and the actions of a British Government that in my view is undermining the agreement, it is absolutely essential that we recommit ourselves to the Good Friday Agreement.  Those institutions are what is best for all of us, for our economy, our public services and for building reconciliation.  The way forward is not to discard the agreement but to embrace it and to re-establish the Executive and the Northern Ireland Assembly on the basis of equality and respect as was intended.<\/p>  <p>  As the Taoiseach knows we have tried to do that over the last year.  We reached an agreement with the DUP leadership to do so in February.  They walked away and the thing collapsed.  Listening to some of the Taoiseach's Ministers last night, one would be forgiven for thinking that the impasse in the North was entirely to be blamed on Sinn F&eacute;in, that we were somehow behind the renewable heat incentive, RHI, scandal or that we were denying fundamental rights to citizens.  However, the Taoiseach knows the state of play and his T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Simon Coveney, knows it even better.  Yet the Taoiseach's Ministers, Deputies Ring, Doherty and Griffin engage in opportunistic sniping that is patently inaccurate and untrue.  The Taoiseach cannot be a statesman and rejoice in the benefits of the peace process one day, and then watch as his Ministers descend into the gutter with comments like those that were made last night.<\/p>  <p>  I think it would be useful for the Taoiseach to discuss this at ministerial level.  Perhaps it is the case that the Taoiseach is not actually briefing Cabinet accurately or fully.  If that is the case, I ask him to remedy that situation.  The only way we will find a viable pathway back to full power-sharing is with the active and fully informed engagement of everybody.  Crucially, that includes every member of the Taoiseach's Cabinet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600020#S01800","speaker":"1239"},{"type":"speech","time":1537965000,"counter":303,"content":"<p>I am interested in the discussions the Taoiseach has had about the application for Security Council membership.  This is an application I and the Labour Party strongly support and we have used our contacts to advance it.  In general, has it compromised our ability on the world stage to criticise countries as we look for their votes?  The Taoiseach met the secretary general of the Arab League.  That was an important meeting.  I had the privilege of meeting the secretary general last year when we were on the delegation to Egypt.  Are we inhibited from criticising Saudi Arabia's involvement in Yemen?  Are we clear in what we say internationally, that although we are looking for support we are not holding our punches in our normal role?  That would be a mistake.  It is important if we ask people to support us that they know we are honest brokers and we will call out violations of human rights where we see them, without fear or favour.  That is Ireland's strength in our application.  I am interested to hear the Taoiseach set out this in clear terms.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the point made previously about recognition of the state of Palestine, it is an important position for us to advance now.  Every time it has been raised, although it was supported by all parties in the House, the Taoiseach's general view is it is contingent on a two-state solution.  Things have moved remarkably badly in the wrong direction, particularly since the election of Donald Trump as President of the United States and the movement of the United States embassy to Jerusalem.  It is important that we are clear we support a two-state solution but in the interim that we recognise a state of Palestine and the legitimate aspiration of the Palestinian people to their own state, which would include, of course, a capital in Jerusalem on an agreed basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600021#T00100","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1537965000,"counter":304,"content":"<p>In the past when Ireland has succeeded in being elected to the UN Security Council at regular intervals, it has been through a relentless focus on diplomatic contacts.  We have all been involved.  I was involved in previous Governments in getting direction from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on the state of play.  This is why it caused some surprise that the Government decided to assign a marketing expert to the campaign.  There has been a lot more showboating and razzmatazz about this.  One gets the sense it is for a domestic audience as opposed to the international reality of how these things happen and how election to the Security Council is won.  People were surprised by how the former head of the strategic communications unit was by the Taoiseach's side in New York on Monday.  Will he explain to whom he reports and why the Taoiseach decided we needed marketing expertise in this bid?  Was there a competition for the particular post the person now occupies in line with normal procedure?<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the visit of President Abbas at the weekend, will the Taoiseach explain whether he is any closer to clarifying what appear to be entirely contradictory policies on Israel, Palestine and the occupied territories?  Ireland's position as a country, and the Oireachtas in particular, has consistently been in favour of a two-state solution as well as recognition of the humanitarian crisis especially in Gaza.  Mr. Netanyahu's Government has effectively made efforts to undermine any possibility of reaching a two-state solution.  That is where we are now.  It has been steady and consistent in reducing the feasibility of an eventual two-state solution.  There is a worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza, and we should acknowledge the negative role of Hamas in this deteriorating humanitarian situation.  The question is whether the international community acts or simply stands on the sidelines.<\/p>  <p>  Many states are now actively working to try to push back against Netanyahu's policies by recognising a Palestinian state and seeking new ways to combat illegal settlement.  At each stage the Government has been resistant to action.  In fact, we have been lectured - I do not like to use that word - by the T&aacute;naiste about how we are damaging his efforts to bring peace to the region.  I spoke with the T&aacute;naiste about the occupied territories Bill.  He is earnest, but he told me it could damage Ireland's peace role and the perception of Ireland by the United States.  He gave me the impression a peace initiative was about to happen, but what was done by the US Government was the antithesis of any movement towards peace, as it removed its funding from UNRWA, the United Nations relief organisation that does extraordinary work in Gaza and the West Bank to feed people and educate children.  I have been in the schools in Gaza where children are taught about the atrocities and horror of the Holocaust, but the one civilising and significant humanitarian response to the crisis is being steadily undermined and eroded by the US Government and President Trump.  I have made clear to the T&aacute;naiste that the bottom line is people's patience is running out with the response of this Parliament and the Government.<\/p>  <p>  Is it the Taoiseach's view that targeting goods from illegal settlements is a problem in terms of EU law?  What will he do to try to change this?  Will he take any steps to implement the clearly expressed will of the Oireachtas?<\/p>  <p>  On the peace process in the North, I must put on the record that the Sinn F&eacute;in Ard Comhairle at the time should not have contrived to collapse the assembly and Executive.  We now know from evidence that letters were written by Sinn F&eacute;in Ministers pleading for the extension of the renewable heat incentive scheme and that it would continue to be kept open.

I do not accept it.  Setting aside that debate, and the fact the two-state solution is falling apart anyway because of Israel's complete flouting of every elementary aspect of international law on human rights with regard to the Palestinians, what does the Taoiseach say in seeking nomination for Ireland to the UN Security Council about UN Resolution 194, which deals with the right of Palestinian refugees and their descendants to return to the homes from which they were expelled and to recover the property lost when they were expelled, whether in 1948 or 1967?  In answering this question, the Taoiseach should consider the appalling conditions of refugees in camps in Beirut.  I was there in July and it was absolutely shocking and worse then what we would see in the West Bank, Jordan or Syria.  As the Taoiseach seeks to get Ireland onto the UN Security Council, do these refugees have a right, as those on the Great March of Return demanded, to have that UN resolution vindicated and be returned to their homes in what is now called Israel?  If the Taoiseach does not believe this, his aspiration to be on the UN Security Council is meaningless because it is completely selective in its implementation of its own resolutions when it comes to the Palestinians.<\/p>  <p>  Will the Taoiseach look at UN Resolutions 55 and 56, which deal with the Kimberley process and conflict diamonds?  This is a process which the EU will chair and there will be a meeting from 12 to 16 November where reforms of the Kimberley process will be discussed.  There is a big demand in this regard by those who support the Palestinian people, and the Palestinian people themselves, because of Israel's flouting of international law, its suppression of Palestinian rights, its continuous use of violence, which we saw most recently against the Great March of Return and the killing of approximately 170 people, its use of administrative detention and the shocking national law passed by Netanyahu recently that states Israeli Palestinians no longer have the right to self-determination - another tenet of international law - in Israeli territory.  Will the Taoiseach champion this demand, that Israel is suspended from the Kimberley process and that its diamonds, in which there is a massive trade that finances the Israeli military, are suspended from the Kimberley process and labelled conflict diamonds as they absolutely are?<\/p><p>I will allow Deputy Ryan to ask a short question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600021#T00500","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537965600,"counter":309,"content":"<p>I welcome the Taoiseach's visit to the UN and signal our ongoing support of the UN.

That applies to all refugees and not just Palestinian refugees.<\/p>  <p>  I did not have a chance to hear President Trump's speech in full, although I heard some extracts from it.  I am always reluctant to comment on extracts of a speech because comments heard in their entirety are often different from soundbites.  I can comment on two matters.  I strongly disagree with his assertion that we should abandon globalism in favour of patriotism; the speech seemed to be in favour of nationalism as opposed to globalism.  The Government has a different outlook in that regard and we are globalists by nature.  We are very much in line with European colleagues in defending and supporting the Iran deal, which we believe has been successful in discouraging Iran from developing nuclear weapons.  We stand with our European allies and colleagues in that regard in disagreeing with President Trump's approach to Iran.<\/p>  <p>  The Government recognises the Palestinian people's right to statehood, self-determination and to be treated decently.  The programme for Government provides for the recognition of a Palestinian state as part of a two-state solution.  It is important to point out that Palestine has not yet been recognised by many other peer countries and many OECD countries do not recognise Palestine as a state.  They include Canada, Japan, United States, Australia and New Zealand, as well as most western European countries such as France, Germany, Spain, Britain, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.  One of the few exceptions in western Europe is Sweden, and as a consequence of its recognition of Palestine as a state, the Israeli embassy was closed, relations were downgraded and Palestinians did not benefit at all.  The country endured some criticism from the US for doing that, so we should bear that in mind when we make any of our decisions.<\/p>  <p>  When I met President Abbas, I had the opportunity to raise with him concerns about the protection of the Christian minority in the Palestinian territories, which has dwindled over the years.  I also raised the need to protect lesbian, gay, bisexual and transsexual, LGBT, Palestinians.  Decriminalisation has yet to occur in Gaza, although it has occurred on the West Bank.  I also raised the need to advance the rights of women.  I had a good engagement with the delegation on those points and they responded to my concerns.  I encourage other Members when speaking about Palestine not to ignore such matters.  We should support Palestinian statehood and self-determination but we should not allow ourselves to be silent when it comes to discussing the treatment of the Christian minority in the Middle East, particularly Palestine, as well as the need to promote women and decriminalise homosexuality in Gaza.  I am disappointed when people speak about Palestine but seem to turn a blind eye to such human rights matters.<\/p>  <p>  The delegation was also grateful to Ireland for some of its actions, particularly our support on the Jerusalem matter and voting in the interests of Palestine in the UN General Assembly in opposing the recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.  The delegation also welcomed our support for Palestine's observer status and membership in the UN and the fact that we increased our contribution to UNRWA after the United States reduced its contribution.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Martin asked about the trade Bill and our advice is that the legislation contravenes a European law and, therefore, cannot be implemented.  It would probably be struck down if challenged in the European courts.  The advice should not come as any surprise, as trade is an exclusive EU competence and individual countries cannot make their own laws with respect to external trade.<\/p>  <p>  Our UN Security Council campaign does not in any way inhibit us from raising concerns about human rights or objections to the actions of other states.  I am sure the countries with which we are competing - Canada and Norway - will take the same view that the fact we are campaigning for votes should not restrain us in saying what needs to be said.  The person Deputy Martin asked about is seconded to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and reports to the T&aacute;naiste.  As a communications professional, that person is involved with the communications aspect of our campaign for the Security Council.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the Northern Ireland institutions, Deputies now know that, unfortunately, Northern Ireland holds the international record for the length of time in which a government has not been formed.  It is something of great regret that we do not have devolved government in Northern Ireland and people do not have an Executive or Assembly to represent their interests.  It is regrettable that we do not have functioning North-South institutions, as they have been there for a number of years.  While governments are ultimately there to support parties, there cannot be an Executive formed in Northern Ireland unless Sinn F&eacute;in and the Democratic Unionist Party, DUP, are able to do a deal.  Both of those parties are involved in breaking the world record as they have been unable to do a deal and form a government.  It is deeply regrettable.<\/p>  <p>  To a certain extent, Deputy McDonald protests too much at comments from my Ministers yesterday.  It is a fact that Sinn F&eacute;in collapsed the Assembly and Executive over the renewable heat incentive, RHI, controversy.

All of these are welcome but there are some areas on which we will need further clarification and that we need to pause to consider.<\/p>  <p>  We have concern around the proposal to abolish the Policing Authority and to reassign some of its functions, for example, with regard to appointments to a new statutory Garda board and the Garda Commissioner.

The report is comprehensive and deals in a fundamental way with many of the issues that require reform in relation to security and in relation to Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I support, for example, its emphasis.  Many of the recommendations tally with much of Fianna F&aacute;il's submission to the review.  We had called for this review originally.  We were the first party to call for a fundamental Patten-style review of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and we welcome it.<\/p>  <p>  We are weak as a country when it comes to cybersecurity.  It is a vulnerability and I note that countries are telling the Taoiseach that Ireland is vulnerable to cyberattack.  We need more specialisms and we need faster routes to recruit specialists to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in cybersecurity and related fields.<\/p>  <p>  There are issues around the Policing Authority and the Garda Inspectorate.  I can recall someone articulating at one stage that there were five bodies to which a Garda Commissioner had to answer, including an Oireachtas committee, and there are question marks about that.  Simplifying and streamlining that is important.  I believe in a strong Policing Authority but there has to be a clear delineation of roles.  The operational responsibility has to be with the Garda Commissioner and his team.  A policing authority that is only about public commentary is not what I envisaged the authority to be about, for instance, every time an incident happens.  I do not like the look of that.  That is not where an authority should be.  I would look at the minority view in the report and accept there is a debate to be had on that.<\/p>  <p>  GSOC has not worked out.  There are garda&iacute; investigating garda&iacute;.  There are two many minor issues getting in GSOC.  Garda&iacute; are being sent to investigate every kind of complaint whereas their primary responsibility should be to continue to do their job.  I refer to a higher management rank in certain parts of the country.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, the sense of satisfaction with GSOC inquiries among the public does not seem to be high.  I base this on those who have come to my party seeking inquiries.  I find it difficult to recommend to such persons that they should pursue serious issues with GSOC.  I am reluctant because it could extend the trauma for the individual without any definitive sense of there being closure at the end of the GSOC process.  The process is far too long altogether.<\/p>  <p>  There has to be a radical look at GSOC.  Its operation should be concerned with more serious complaints as opposed to those that should be primarily dealt with by the internal governance structure within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which has not worked in practice for the past while.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600023#V00300","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1537966200,"counter":331,"content":"<p>Cabinet Committee F is a new committee, which I set up to deal with national security issues.  It is not designed to meet on a regular basis but on an <i>ad hoc<\/i>basis as needed.  A separate Cabinet committee deals with public sector reform, including justice reform.<\/p><p>My practice, as I have explained to the House in the past, is to deal with more issues in the Cabinet as a whole.  I believe in collective Cabinet responsibility and where important matters need to be discussed such as Brexit, I prefer to have them discussed by the whole Cabinet rather than a sub-committee of the Cabinet.  Sometimes that takes more time.  It is why we often must have two meetings a week or why meetings take longer than they did in the past, but, as much as possible, I prefer to have a matter, if something is of great importance, discussed by the Cabinet as a whole rather than a sub-committee.  I appreciate one needs different types of government and different styles of government for different times, but I certainly felt during the previous Government that many matters were decided by the party leaders or decided by the Economic Management Council, EMC, and then rubber-stamped by Cabinet.  I have tried to adopt a different approach, involving the Cabinet more collectively in making decisions.  For example, the O'Toole report was discussed by the full Cabinet first.  We got to discuss it as a whole rather than sending it to a Cabinet sub-committee, which would then just refer it on for a short discussion by the full Cabinet.  The same applied to the appointment of the Garda Commissioner.  That went straight to the full Cabinet rather than to a Cabinet sub-committee.<\/p><p>With regard to the commission on the reform of policing, I want to put on the record my profound thanks to Ms Kathleen O'Toole and her team for the good work they have done over the past few months to produce this report on time and to inform us regarding a roadmap for the reform of the police service between now and 2022.  The commission identified that date as the centenary of the creation of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and suggests that we set it as our target date for introducing a reformed policing service in Ireland.<\/p><p>Among points that are particularly appealing to me in the report are the acknowledgement that policing is about more than the Garda, the need for more of what we saw yesterday, for example, which was a joint approach between the Garda and social services to responding to crime, preventing crime and preventing recidivism, and some of the proposals in respect of GSOC.<\/p><p> I agree with Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin regarding some of the proposals in respect of GSOC.  It makes sense to move GSOC from being what it is now into an independent office as the police ombudsman, to use its permanent staff more and second garda&iacute; a little less, and have minor complaints dealt with at Garda level rather than at the level of the ombudsman.  It was correct to establish GSOC but it needs to be strengthened and modernised.  The report also allows for the Garda Commissioner to be allowed to do his or her job, which is also important.  The current accountability arrangements where there is a garda inspectorate, a Garda authority, GSOC and regular requests to appear before at least two committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas, namely the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality and the Committee of Public Accounts, are quite strange.  One must get the balance right between allowing people to do their job and being accountable for it and then spending all their time accounting, which can make it hard to execute the job.  The reports suggestions on the Garda Commissioner may be a step in the right direction in that regard.<\/p> <p> The Government considered the report at Cabinet, noted it and provided for its publication.  We have committed to study it, respond to it and develop a reasoned response and a timelined action and implementation plan before the end of the year, which is the next step.  The Minister for Justice and Equality will develop a reasoned response to the report and to each of the recommendations and then a timelined action and implementation plan, which will go to a Cabinet subcommittee and then to Cabinet.<\/p> <p> It would be useful and welcome to have a discussion on this very good report in the House.  I do not want any of my comments to be misconstrued as the Government not accepting the report or the vast majority of it.  That does make good sense.  There are one or two particular recommendations which are controversial and, as has been noted, on which there is disagreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600023#V00400","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537966800,"counter":333,"content":"<p>What about on national security-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600024#W00200","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1537966800,"counter":334,"content":"<p>No, we have not made any decisions in principle.

I thank the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, for coming to the Chamber for this debate.  I would like to outline three areas of significance that are contributing to people unnecessarily ending up homeless or being unable to access the services that have been put in place to prevent them from becoming homeless and help them to get into some form of semi-permanent or permanent accommodation.  I believe a policy change from the Minister or the Department will be needed to address some of the issues I am raising.  Perhaps a letter of approval can be sent to each local authority to clarify the position, provide more flexibility and assist in a positive way.  As a representative of the Kildare North constituency, I am speaking about Kildare County Council.  Everybody in this House wants to prevent people from becoming homeless and help them to secure a roof over their heads through the social housing allocation of each local authority or through private rental accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  The first area I will touch on is the homeless housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme.  The Minister put in place a placefinder service under the homeless HAP scheme to help people to find private homes to rent.  When a tenant who has received notice to quit presents himself or herself to Kildare County Council or any other local authority, he or she has to find a home so that he or she does not end up homeless.  We are finding that people in such circumstances are unable to access upfront deposits until very close to their eviction or get-out dates.  It can be extremely difficult for such people to find homes at short notice.  Some people do not get their deposits until three or four weeks before their eviction dates.  As it is very difficult to find properties in north Kildare, like everywhere else, through the private rental market, people need to be given as long as possible to try to source private rental accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  Having spoken to various groups about this issue, I am aware that when people present themselves to a local authority after receiving notice to quit - three or four months' notice is normally given, but it might be as little as two months in some cases - they aggressively pursue new properties in order to ensure they and their families do not end up homeless.  If people in such circumstances are able to prove that they have found a property, if they have confirmed to the homeless section of the local authority that they are going to be homeless and if the notice to quit is in order with the statutory guidelines, I believe they should be able to access a deposit and one month's rent to assist them in finding alternative accommodation.  It does not matter whether this happens a month or three months in advance of the eviction date.  As it gets closer to the eviction date, it gets far too tight to try to find a property.  That is how people end up in hotels.  I know of cases in which people from County Kildare are being accommodated in hotels in Carlow and Portlaoise.  This is not very practical for families when children are going to school and people are going to work.  People in these circumstances need all the time and all the supports they can get to try to find alternative accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  I can understand where the Department's 30% disposable income calculation comes from.  It is acceptable that people must have a disposable income to live on after they have paid their rent and made their top-up payment.  As I have said in this House previously, the difficulty is that even with the 20% discretion under the HAP scheme, there is still a gap with current rental market values.  I have asked for this discretion to be increased temporarily while we are waiting for supply and stock to come into the market.  In the absence of such an increase, the gap between the payment under the HAP scheme and the actual current rental market value needs to be made up so that families in these circumstances can find homes.  People are getting letters of support from reliable family members - parents, brothers and sisters - who are in full employment and are willing to help with their efforts to get homes and pay the balance.  Under Kildare County Council's current policy, unfortunately, it is unable to accept such letters unless it can get bank statements and letters from employers to confirm that the people in question are in permanent employment and can support their family members in making top-up payments.  That is adding to the substantial distress and concern of families.  It is very difficult to get a property.  If one is lucky enough to get a property, one should be allowed to get family support to make a top-up payment as long as one has a strong letter of support.  I believe it is unwarranted to require people to undertake needless tasks like getting personal details from those who are providing support to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600025#CC00300","speaker":"1324"},{"type":"speech","time":1537967400,"counter":343,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  I acknowledge his hard work and dedication on it.  We have been in contact on HAP and homelessness prevention measures on a number of occasions.  The Deputy has been working with my staff over recent months to bring various concerns to my attention.  He has explained his concerns about the terms and consistency of application of homeless HAP in his area.  I have heard what he has said.  HAP is operating as a flexible and immediate housing support and is available throughout the State.  It is playing a vital role in families and individuals that are eligible for housing supports.  More than 40,000 households are having their housing needs met via HAP.  Over 21,000 landlords and agents are in receipt of payments under the HAP scheme.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy knows, the rent charged for HAP accommodation must be within the limits set down for the household type in each local authority area.  HAP tenants pay a weekly rent contribution to the local authority, based on their income and ability to pay.  The HAP rent limits were increased significantly in July 2016.  They were increased by up to 60% in some areas.  The Government has given each local authority the flexibility to agree to make a payment under the HAP scheme of up to 20% above the maximum rent limit if that is necessary because of local rental market conditions.<\/p><p>The increased rent limits, together with the additional discretion available to local authorities to exceed the maximum rent limit where necessary, are allowing HAP households to find suitable accommodation and willing landlords.  At the end of the second quarter of 2018, excluding households accommodated under the homeless HAP arrangements operated by the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, 21.3% of households nationally were benefitting from the additional discretion.  In those cases, the average rate of discretionary payment was 15.7% above the relevant rent limits.  In a further reply, I can give more detail on this to the Deputy.<\/p> <p> In addition to the flexible and immediate housing supports set out, a significant dimension to homeless HAP was the establishment of the place finder service, to which the Deputy referred.  Homeless HAP is a targeted support for homeless households who may find it difficult to secure HAP tenancies and, under the place finder service, the local authorities can appoint new dedicated staff to assist individuals in emergency accommodation to find appropriate long-term housing solutions.  The place finder service has been in operation in the Dublin region since 2015 and the option to establish the service was made available to all local authorities from January 2018.  It was take up in Kildare earlier this year.  It is a matter for each local authority to determine the appropriate deployment of the place finder service based on local needs, including the point at which a household will be directed to the service.  I understand that many local authorities are focusing on those households who are already in emergency accommodation, assisting them to transition into HAP tenancies.  The place finder service recognises that, for a certain number of people, particularly those already in emergency accommodation, sourcing property and securing a tenancy, including the financial constraints around deposits and advance rent, might be very challenging.<\/p> <p> The provisions of the homeless HAP scheme provide local authorities with the discretion to assist homeless households by providing a deposit to secure property and paying up to two months' advance rent.  This discretion was provided as an exceptional measure for exceptionally challenging circumstances and, as such, must be applied only where necessary.  To broaden the provisions of advance rent and deposits is contradictory to the principles of the HAP scheme, and could undermine the careful checks and balances that are in the system to ensure the best use of public funds.  That said, the Deputy has been engaging with my Department on this matter.  I hope he will be able to have further engagement in which he can bring to light more specific issues that can be examined given what he has raised in the D&aacute;il today.<\/p> <p> The homeless HAP scheme has been successfully utilised by the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive across the four Dublin local authority areas since February 2015, supporting more than 3,600 households to date.  More than 1,600 new homeless HAP tenancies have been set up so far this year.  That goes for people at risk of homelessness or coming out of emergency accommodation.  Therefore, it is an important support for people in this crisis.<\/p> <p> We monitor HAP data on an ongoing basis.  I have a report to hand for the Deputy that he will be interested to see.  We also monitor other key information relating to the private rental market.  I am satisfied that the current HAP rent limits and the flexibility to exceed them in certain circumstances provide local authorities with the capacity necessary to assist households in securing rented accommodation that meets their needs.  However, I am grateful to the Deputy for raising his concerns.  I hope he will engage further with me and the Department over the coming days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600025#CC00400","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537968000,"counter":345,"content":"<p>To that end, I am meeting some of his officials tomorrow on these three issues, in Dublin as far as I know.  If there is clarity and flexibility in respect of the issues, it will assist positively.  I am not criticising the measures at all.  What I am saying is that the homeless HAP and place finder services put in place in Kildare County Council earlier this year were welcome.  This was a debate we had just before the summer recess.  Anything we can do to prevent people from becoming homeless is welcome.  The issue, however, is the timing associated with one's ability to gain access to the upfront rent and deposit.  That is the key and the point I wanted to tease out with the Minister.<\/p>  <p>  Departmental officials and the council are saying one has to be very close to one's eviction date before one can gain access to the upfront deposit and rent.  That is contributing to homelessness because one will not get the property the day one goes out looking for it.  If one is looking for a property before one can access the fund, one is competing with someone who has the money in his or her back pocket.  Therefore, if someone has notice to quit - a statutory document that meets the criteria - he or she is virtually on the home stretch to being homeless unless he or she gets another home.  If one has a notice to quit in two or three months, one will have to go into emergency accommodation unless one can find a home.  That is costly.  We want to avoid that.  Therefore, I suggest that tenants should be able to access the payment immediately on getting the notice to quit to help them to get another home between then and being evicted.<\/p>  <p>  On the 30% threshold related to disposable income and the letter of guarantee, the problem is that most families need a three-bedroom semi-detached house.  I know the HAP relates to the family unit but, rather than getting into that calculation, as we do not have time, we should note it equates in some cases to the rent for a three-bedroom semi-detached house.  With 20% discretion, the HAP in Kildare is about &euro;1,250.  The current market value is &euro;1,500 so a top-up is needed.  We need to be able to get the local authorities and Department to agree to accepting the letters of guarantee that are coming in without forensically subjecting them to post mortem analyses, which leads to further problems.<\/p>  <p>  The final issue concerns people on the housing list who are currently in HAP units.  They could be in them for one, two or three years.  Where these houses come up for sale, perhaps because the landlord or landlady is under financial pressure from banks or other personal reasons, is there a possibility that the Department could engage with the local authorities to ask them to purchase them?  They are not purchasing the units.  The families affected need to look for alternative accommodation but may not be able to gain access to any, perhaps due to the lack of supply, and end up going into hotels, not even in the county but perhaps in a neighbouring county.  That is a problem.  Can some clarity be brought to this?  Can approval be given to the local authorities such that if a property occupied by someone getting the HAP payment is being sold, it can be purchased either by the local authority or the departmental agencies?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600026#DD00200","speaker":"1324"},{"type":"speech","time":1537968000,"counter":346,"content":"<p>I welcome the fact that the Deputy recognises that the HAP is working.  Of course it can be improved.  Not every Deputy in this House recognises the considerable support the HAP is giving to people who are at risk of homelessness or coming out of emergency accommodation.  Tens of thousands of people throughout the country have been supported.  Some individuals, for ideological reasons, refuse to recognise that.  Therefore, I welcome the Deputy's comments.<\/p>  <p>  Let me address the three specific points the Deputy raised.  On the matter of when someone can access the deposit and the first month's rent, we should consider it.  I want the Deputy to engage on that.  I will tell my officials to engage with him to determine what is going wrong.  We do not want, for administrative reasons, to be putting people into distress when they should not be in distress.<\/p>  <p>  On the Deputy's second point, on the gap and letters of comfort, we should examine this also.  We are talking about taxpayers' money so we have to ensure appropriate checks and balances are in place.  I do not want to be taking discretion from local authorities.  Since they are at the front line of the services and at the coalface, they might have a better understanding of what they are dealing with themselves.  Of course we can examine it, however.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the third point, on the Department potentially buying homes or allowing the local authority to buy a home with a tenant in HAP and which might be sold, the difficulty concerns value for money and cost.  It may not represent value for money for the local authority to purchase the home.  That is a call it has to make.  It is based on the costs of the time, its own building programme, other acquisition programmes it has, prevailing market rates and everything else.  I appreciate the Deputy's highlighting of these issues.  We can engage positively on them through my Department over the coming days and through the meetings the Deputy is having.<\/p>  <p>  I will give the Deputy the official report being prepared for the Oireachtas joint committee tomorrow.  Let me give the Deputy a couple of figures on Kildare.  The total number of active HAP tenancies is 1,667, 355 of which were set up in 2018.  That is roughly 14 per week.  Therefore, HAP is helping people in the Deputy's county, which is great.  We want it to help more.  The average rent being paid in Kildare by the local authority to the landlord is &euro;916, which is above the national average.  Of course, Kildare is very close to where many people want to live and work.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy also raised the use of discretion.  About 42.6% of people getting HAP, or almost half, are getting the discretionary payment.  They are getting some uplift above the HAP rate.  With regard to the amount of uplift, they are getting an average of 14.1%.  The Deputy, when talking about the gap, should note that even those who are coming into the system do not need the full 20%.  Most of them are in this category.  Therefore, there is still plenty of flexibility and plenty of headroom in the 20%, notwithstanding the point the Deputy raised about letters of comfort and the additional payments.  We can consider these issues.  The HAP is working.  Anything we can do to make it work better, I will absolutely welcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600026#DD00300","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Staff Recruitment","time":1537968000,"counter":347,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600026#DD00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1537968000,"counter":348,"content":"<p>The Minister for Health is not present.  In saying this, I mean no disrespect to the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly.  I said this to him in March in respect of a similar topic when he came in to deputise for the Minister.  I understand the Minister for Health is very busy and I have no problem with that but he has never once come here to address one of my Topical Issue matters.  Normally all of the issues I raise are related to University Hospital Limerick.  Can the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, Ceann Comhairle or Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, raise my concern with the Minister so he might try to get here himself the next time one of my Topical Issue matters is selected for discussion?  By March, I had tried to get him in here 13 times.<\/p><p>Obviously, there have been more occasions since then.  It is quite disappointing that this hospital has the worst crisis in the State and has the highest number of people on trolleys every day, yet the Minister has been unable to appear on even one occasion.  I understand that he is busy but he cannot have been unable to attend on every occasion it has been selected as a Topical Issue.  It is simply not good enough.<\/p> <p> To be honest, I have lost count of the number of times I have submitted a Topical Issue on this matter.  There is an issue in the hospital every day and every week.  The full capacity protocol is used every day in Limerick even though it is supposed to be a temporary emergency measure.  That means staff are under huge pressure and elective operations are cancelled.  A number of them were cancelled this week.  There have been 166 people on trolleys already this week.  There were 46 on Monday, 63 on Tuesday and 57 on Wednesday.  However, I am astonished that I am obliged to ask the Minister for Health today, and the Minister of State might convey this to the Minister, to explain why there were not enough staff to feed patients in the emergency department in Limerick's largest hospital last week.  It is a crazy and outrageous situation.<\/p> <p> On Monday I was contacted by somebody who works in University Hospital Limerick.  That person stated there was only one attendant providing food for over 90 patients in the emergency department for the previous four days and, as no staff cover was available, some patients could not get food or even a cup of tea.  The agreed figure for such staffing at the hospital is a minimum of three.  This is inexcusable.  Today there are 57 people on trolleys in the hospital.  That is more than the number of patients on trolleys in 17 other hospitals across the State combined.  Can the Minister explain this situation?  I hope he or his Department will contact the hospital management immediately to ask what is happening.  What additional funding will be provided to ensure there are enough staff to feed the patients at least?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600026#DD00500","speaker":"1327","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537968600,"counter":350,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising the important issue of the challenges arising in University Hospital Limerick and, on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Harris, I welcome the opportunity to address the House on this issue.<\/p>  <p>  The emergency department in University Hospital Limerick, UHL, is one of the busiest in the country, with approximately 67,000 attendances annually.  Demand for emergency department services at the hospital continues to rise with an increase of 6% in attendances at the emergency department at UHL in 2017 compared with 2016.  I acknowledge the distress overcrowded emergency departments cause to patients, their families and front-line staff working in very challenging working conditions in hospitals throughout the country.  Behind every trolley number there is a patient in need of effective, timely and compassionate care from the health service.  That is why the Government is committed to breaking the cycle of overcrowding in the health service.  As emergency department attendances continue to rise, those departments are under increasing pressure to meet the new level of demand and ensure the provision of timely, safe and effective care for patients.  A considerable number of patients presenting to the emergency departments are frail or acute patients who often require admission.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the claim that some patients are not being fed, the University Limerick, UL, hospital group has advised that except for one catering attendant who is currently on leave there is a full catering staff complement.  UL hospital group has advised that it is managing this deficit from its relief pool.  At times there may be unscheduled sick leave that could create pressures on the service but full catering is available to all patients who are not fasting due to medical reasons.<\/p>  <p>  As regards patient experience, the House will be aware that overcrowding at the UHL emergency department has been a concern for some time.  The emergency department is frequently working above capacity using the full capacity protocol and this contributes to inefficient ways of working and poor patient experience.  In recognition of this high demand, funding of &euro;24 million was provided for the new emergency department at UHL, which opened in May last year.  The new facility is triple the size of the old emergency department and immeasurably improves the experience of patients in terms of their comfort, privacy and dignity.  Furthermore, against a background of increasing demand for unscheduled care services, an extra &euro;30 million was made available nationally to respond to winter pressures in 2017, with a further &euro;40 million being provided in 2018.<\/p>  <p>  To conclude, the UL hospital group has assured me that full catering is available to all patients who are not fasting due to medical reasons.  Regarding the overcrowding, I am acutely aware of the current situation and I am monitoring it closely.  The Department, the HSE and UL hospital group are carrying out measures to improve the situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600027#EE00200","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1537968600,"counter":351,"content":"<p>The Minister of State said the UHL emergency department is frequently working above capacity.  It is doing that every day.  The emergency measure has been in place every day this year and was in place every day in 2017 so it is not frequently but daily.  That leads to elective surgeries being cancelled and extra beds being put into wards, which is not safe.  When this measure was introduced by the HSE a number of years ago in consultation with the nurses, the nurses expressed huge concern but they were told at the time that it would be an emergency measure.  However, it is used every day in Limerick and that is not good enough.  It is not true to say in the House that it is frequently used as it has been used every day this year and every day in 2017.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State mentioned the new emergency department.  It is a good facility but, as I highlighted previously in this Chamber when the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, was in attendance as the Minister, Deputy Harris, did not turn up again that day, the nurses were concerned about the proposal to have 24 people usually on trolleys in the new department.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, rubbished that and said it would never be the case and would never happen.  The hospital in Limerick would almost be happy if there were 24 people on trolleys because the number is far more than that every day.<\/p>  <p>  I wrote to the Minister last January seeking a meeting with him to discuss ways to reduce the overcrowding problem in the hospital because it is abundantly clear that his plan for our local hospital is failing miserably.  I have yet to hear back from the Minister.  University Hospital Limerick is in a terrible state.  It is constantly overcrowded and operations are being cancelled all the time.  It is unfair to make nurses, doctors and staff work in such pressurised, overcrowded conditions and even worse to make sick patients lie on trolleys for days waiting for a bed.  How does the Minister expect to attract nurses home from places such as Australia to work for lower wages and in far worse conditions?  I was proud to stand with the nurses outside the hospital a number of days ago.  The full capacity protocol is being used every day despite it being designed only for emergencies.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister might refer back to me on my questions this time, although I was told previously that he would and he did not.  What plans does he have for the 96-bed extension?  When will it be built?  Is there any progress on speeding that up?

The House places many demands on the Minister's time, as do the Seanad and the committees, as well as the pleas for hearings from numerous lobby, interest and advocacy groups and representative bodies.  The Minister, like every Minister, has to make a judgment call between the amount of time to spend actively engaging one-on-one with complaints and issues and actually dealing with the problems behind the scenes, such as by meeting with UL hospital group, the management and getting one's head around the issues that exist.

There is a pattern emerging in that whenever there is an expos&eacute; in the media, such as \"Living on the Lists\", the Minister issues an apology and commits to ensuring things improve, and when there is no improvement and this generates further media interest, we get another apology.  The scoliosis waiting lists are not being dealt with in any meaningful way, particularly for those children who have complex medical needs.  More than 60 children with complex needs who have been on the waiting list for a long time have been moved to what is known as a \"suspended list\", in some cases because they have been on the list for so long their health has deteriorated to the point of them not being able to have the surgery.  <\/p>  <p>  The theatre in Crumlin children's hospital is not yet open five days a week.  It should be open seven days a week but it is not yet open five days a week as promised.  Children were also promised that they would be sent abroad for treatment.

I met Sophia McGuinness, who cannot speak but uses assistive technology to communicate.  The first thing she said to me was, \"I am in pain\".  She is in pain while she waits for surgery but she is not the only one.  There are other children in pain while they wait for surgery.

He has since told me that, in 2015, he wrote to then Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, who told him that no child would be waiting for scoliosis surgery for longer than 15 months.  At that time, Sophia had to wait 16 months following her initial diagnosis in 2013.  More recently, the Minister for Health said no child will wait longer than four months for surgery.  Sophia was placed on the urgent list in April 2017 and, without having had her surgery, she was removed from it in August 2018, which is 17 months later.  The Government, at the highest level, through the Taoiseach and Minister for Health, has let this young girl down.  Sophia suffers from scoliosis.  Her condition is deteriorating and she could face the possibility of emergency surgery because the screws in the rod in her spine, which goes into her hip, are loose.  Her internal organs are being affected and the curvature of her spine is worsening.  This deterioration may impact on her ability to undergo surgery.  It is not fair to put a child, and her parents, through that suffering and pain.<\/p>  <p>  As stated by Deputy O'Reilly, this is linked to the wider issue of 52 people having been removed from the surgery list, giving the impression that the list has reduced when in fact these people have only been moved to what is known as a \"suspended list\" and still need surgery.

The Minster for Health and I are sorry that any child and his or her family experience a long waiting time for treatment for scoliosis.  Improving access for these patients is a key priority for this Government and specific plans have been developed and funded in 2017 and 2018.  However, I fully accept there is room for further improvement in patients accessing timely scoliosis treatment.  The Minister has prioritised the development of a sustainable scoliosis service in Ireland and an additional &euro;9 million has been provided to the HSE in 2018 specifically to develop paediatric orthopaedic services, including further increasing access to scoliosis services.<\/p>  <p>  Last Monday, the Minister met the deputy director general of the HSE and the chief executive officer, CEO, of the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group to discuss their short-term and long-term plans to provide a better service for patients and their families.  The Minister sought assurance from the CEO regarding the management of children with complex needs, as a great deal of concern has been expressed by parents of children with such needs.  The CEO advised that there are a number of complex and difficult cases at present and that the hospital has provided all support and services required to children and their parents, and will continue to do so.<\/p>  <p>  Where a child has multiple clinical complexities and medical conditions, consultation between parents and a multidisciplinary team of specialist consultants is required to develop and manage a treatment plan.  Given the complex nature of the care required, this often requires extensive discussions and planning so that appropriate surgery can be scheduled in a timely manner, if clinically safe.  Notwithstanding that, the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group has made progress towards the development of a sustainable scoliosis service this year.  It published the scoliosis co-design ten-point action plan in July and an orthopaedic implementation group has been established to oversee its implementation.  The action plan was developed through the participation of professionals,<\/p>  <p>families and advocates.  Importantly, this has ensured that the voice of the child has been incorporated.<\/p>  <p>  This year, the group aims to deliver 447 procedures.  This equates to a near doubling of 2016 activity.  By the end of last week, 314 surgeries, of which 151 were spinal fusions, had been delivered.  Overall activity is slightly ahead of surgical targets.  Waiting list figures for 21 September show that there are 77 active patients waiting for scoliosis treatment, of which 35 have been waiting for more than four months, which is a reduction of 21 since the start of this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600028#FF00400","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1537969200,"counter":359,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply but it was an elaborate response to a question I did not ask.

There is a variety of challenges and difficulties, both in capacity of personnel and in a lack of theatre space.

There are many other waiting lists in the medical system competing for the same theatre space, skill set, time and resources.

I am speaking on the role of primary school principals - teaching principals and those who are walking principals.  I raise this after meeting the Irish Primary Principals Network and also from working closely with my colleague Councillor Alison Gilliland of the Irish National Teachers Organisation, INTO, which consistently raises this issue with me.<\/p>  <p>  Put simply, the working conditions of primary school principals are unbearable.  I know the Minister has set up a forum to deal with many of the issues I will outline but as part of the budget the Minister now has a unique opportunity to deal with these working conditions.  If he does not do so, the educational benefit for children at primary level, which is so important and where my own children are today, will suffer.<\/p>  <p>  I was gobsmacked to find out that the guidance on the role of principals has not been updated since a circular in 1975.  That was the year I was born and this is not acceptable.  There has been a range of missives and circulars issued on the role but the actual role has not been updated.  Principals are expected to be in charge of all education and teaching in schools but are also expected to be administrators and the administration has now grown to an insufferable level.  For instance, last year there were 84 circulars issued to primary school principals.  How in the name of God can principals be in charge of the teaching component of the school, which is so important, and be in charge of administration at that level as well with the resources that they have?<\/p>  <p>  Three people who I know well, one of whom is a good friend and all of whom are female, have resigned their jobs as primary school principals and teachers.  They are more or less the same age as me and a couple of them are younger than me so they are all in their late 30s and early 40s.  They are resigning as principals because they cannot bear the conditions they are working under.  It is a real issue for them that it is actually more difficult to get back into teaching because teachers do not really have any rights in that sense.  They do not even have panel rights so that is another issue the Minister needs to deal with.<\/p>  <p>  Given all of the responsibility that principals now have and the fact that in many cases they now have to work through the summer to deal with the backlog of administration, the Oireachtas, including the Minister, must now deal with these real issues.  They need more resources and they need greater pay and conditions.  They have to know that the Department will support them in their role because voluntary boards will not cut it in terms of picking up the slack.  There are so many good people on those boards and so many brilliant chairs of boards of management but it is still ultimately left with the principals to deal with having the best teaching conditions and to do all of the other administration, much of which is necessary but some of which could probably be better dealt with.  A model for helping these people and resources for doing it must be found or the educational opportunities and benefits for my children and the children of this country will be affected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600029#GG00800","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1537969800,"counter":369,"content":"<p>I welcome the Deputy's interest in this issue because the role of leaders in our schools is hugely important and I wish to give him some reassurance.  We have successfully recruited 6,000 additional teachers to our schools in the last three years and as the Deputy knows, the standards of reading and mathematics among our ten years olds are the best in Europe.  We have a great deal to be grateful for around the manner in which our schools are managed.  That does not mean that we should stand still and I have set an ambitious target that by 2026 we will seek to have the best education and training service in Europe.  That means improvements in literacy, digital technologies and the learning environment, breaking down cycles of disadvantage and reforming curricula to update them and make them more relevant to people.  That involves change and we of course rely on principals to be the leaders of change within their schools.<\/p>  <p>  I mention some of the measures we have taken, for example, last year we appointed 2,600 additional assistant principals.  Not only have we done that but we negotiated an agreement with the trade unions on a new approach to management which involves a more devolved and collective leadership.  It also involves reporting on the role that these assistant principals will take within their schools and will move away from appointments based on an approach of one's turn having come around.  We have also made a substantial investment in primary education which has helped principals in having additional resources at their disposal and I have mentioned some of these in the written reply.  We have reduced the pupil-teacher ratio to the lowest level ever in the history of the State and we have provided over 600 resource teachers and over 1,800 special needs assistants, SNAs.  Hundreds of schools are now operating innovative projects in clusters where principals and others within the school are taking on leadership roles in adopting technology and applying DEIS initiatives and creative initiatives.<\/p>  <p>  On teaching principals specifically, this year I allocated additional time off to allow them to manage their responsibilities more effectively.  I increased it by between two and four days depending on the size of the school as is outlined in the written reply.  Extra time off has been a continuing demand from teaching principals.<\/p><p>The other thing I did, which came directly from the INTO because its former president was impressed by the initiative, was to introduce clusters.  There were 14 clusters in existence which meant that more remote schools could come together in a cluster and pool their time off, which allowed them to employ a permanent position.  It has been really beneficial.  I have extended the number of clusters from 14 to 50.  <\/p> <p> The biggest thing, which the Deputy did not refer to at all, is the creation of the centre for school leadership, which is now investing in the leaders in our schools.  Each year about 1,000 principals get the opportunity to have mentoring or coaching or to gain postgraduate qualifications to improve their capacity to manage their resource.  They are very significant changes.  As the Deputy rightly observed, many principals feel there is too much coming at them.  They recognise the importance of child protection, new curricula and new ways of teaching.  All of these things are important.  We have set up a forum to look at the sequencing of those things to try to allow them to manage those issues.  In terms of pay, principals are benefitting under the pay agreement.  I absolutely support the Deputy's belief that investing in leadership is possibly the best bang for our buck we can get.  We have started to put in place measures that show our commitment in this area.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600029#GG00900","speaker":"1293","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537970400,"counter":371,"content":"<p>The Minister has not answered the question of why so many young principals are resigning from their jobs.  It has to be a concern for the Minister.  Will the Minister please update the guidance for principals, which has not been updated since 1975?  I am sure people will be shocked when the Minister outlines what their full role is.  A survey by the Irish Primary Principals Network showed that 89% of principals felt their mental health has been affected by the amount of work they have to do and 84% said they are considering stepping aside from their job.  I have a very good friend who went to school with me, has been working in a local school but has resigned from her job.  She does not have any rights.  Will the Minister address this situation in order that principals who choose to go back into the classroom, because of the volume of work, have some rights, given the amount of time they have given?<\/p>  <p>  The Minister also is not dealing with issues of pay parity.  Pay equality across all areas for teachers is required.  Commitments with regard to pay parity that were given to principals in 2007 should be addressed.  We need to look at the issue of the restoration of posts across the board in the primary sector.  My wife is a teacher.  Posts were suppressed and they need to be brought back in to help principals.  We need to understand why there has been a change on the appointment figure needed to get a mainstream teacher back.  Why is it higher than to retain a teacher?  It does not make sense.  We need an immediate increase in the ancillary grant allowed for secretarial staff, caretakers and cleaning staff.  Once and for all, will the Minister help those teaching principals who work in small schools?  A friend of mine who sat beside me in primary school is a brilliant teacher and a brilliant principal.  His name is John.  They deserve a day off a week to deal with what I have already outlined.  There are 84 circulars.  To be a working principal in a three-teacher, four-teacher or five-teacher school and to deal with this at the same time is impossible.  Is it any wonder that principals are resigning from their posts?  They want to stay teaching but they did not sign up to do this amount of work.  It is inconceivable to do the work.  They do not get paid well enough.  They cannot do it.  Will the Minister please deal with that issue as well?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600030#HH00200","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1537970400,"counter":372,"content":"<p>Deputy Kelly is long enough around the House to know the current Government, the previous Government and all Governments I know of have engaged in collective bargaining across the sector with the public service unions.

My party was in government at that time.  Some 80 town councils were abolished, which was a mistake.  I personally regret that the Government of which I was a member made that decision and that we did not stop town councils from being abolished at that time.  I spent the past three days at the British Labour Party conference trying to persuade the British people to think again on a matter of some importance to this country.  If one recognises that something needs to be done differently, it is important to put forward a solution.  Town councils were replaced by 137 municipal district councils which were essentially sub-committees of the county council.  Let us not pretend they were anything else.  They are sub-committees of the county council and are seen as such.  They were also replaced by public participation networks ,which were meant to involve local community groups and other civic society actors in discussing local concerns.  That was an extension of a proposal that I made many years ago when I was in the Department of the Environment and published a document called Better Local Government.  <\/p>  <p>  It is fair to say that five years later, this policy has not delivered an ideal system of local government.  I acknowledge it is not all bad.  Some public participation networks have successfully engaged with civic society and with their own communities but they are very much reliant on the presence of active citizens and organisations in particular areas.  In other places, public participation networks have not worked so well and that must be acknowledged too.  Municipal district councils have not delivered as a replacement for town government.  I say this as somebody who has been involved in the local government system since I was a town councillor.  I have been mayor of Wexford, a county councillor and Minister for the Environment and I have been involved in looking at the evolution of local government and at people attempting to alter local government.  One thing I have been clear on for a very long time is that for decades, the Department of the Environment was anxious to merge town government into a county structure.  As I have said, municipal district councils, as were created in 2013, have not delivered.<\/p><p>First and foremost, they operate across urban and rural areas in a way that undermines the concept of the urban centre, the town, the driver, the heartland of a community.  A town is a defined urban area, a place with clear boundaries, with deep municipal histories that in many instances, as both Ministers of State here will remember, go back a long time.  These are areas with an identity.<br\/><br\/>A clear focus on building towns lends itself to better planning decisions, more compact coherent settlement patterns, which in turn facilitates the delivery of public services, and which are more likely to deliver a stronger local economy.  Strong and vibrant towns drive local communities.  They drive not only the urban environment but also rural enterprise and they create jobs.  Towns are central to economic development.  They are the central focus of commercial activity up and down the country, and all of us who have had the opportunity to travel up and down the country know that.<br\/><br\/>There are approximately 100 towns in Ireland with a population of more than 5,000 people in what we describe as &quot;defined urban boundaries&quot;.  Some of them have had town councils for more than a century, and some for many centuries.  Others, notably places like Swords and Blanchardstown, never had a town council, despite in some cases having populations in the tens of thousands.<br\/><br\/>We propose changes to what existed in the past.  Our proposals are for a single type of town council which is a uniform system across the country, rather than the system which many of us remember, where there were town commissions, town councils, urban district councils and borough councils - each with not only varying membership but also varying powers.  In the past, there were also large towns which had no council at all for anomalous historical reasons.<br\/><br\/>I ask people to give our proposal a fair hearing because it is one of the most important democratic initiatives that we can take as a House.  We propose councils of nine members for every town with a population of 5,000 inhabitants or more, and councils of 15 members where the town population exceeds 25,000.  The restoration of town government is to be done on a cost-neutral basis using the existing local government resources, simply moving the personnel that was taken from the town councils back to them.<br\/><br\/>Town government is not primarily about the economy, however, important and all as that is.  It is about local democracy.  According to an Edelman global survey of people's trust in institutions, Ireland scores particularly low.  In 2018 just over one third of the people, 35%, reported trust in government.  A lack of trust in government, the media and so-called &quot;experts&quot; is a recurrent theme not only for Ireland but around the world.  It was a theme that helped elect US President Donald Trump, it was a theme that drove Brexit, and it has been a theme in the argument made by populist, nationalist parties across Europe, which continues to be made by them, as Mr. Steve Bannon and some of his cohorts arrive on our shores now to bang a populist drum.  The whole theme is best summarised in one of the Brexit slogans, &quot;Take back control&quot;, or in President Trump's election slogan, &quot;Make America great again&quot;.  They have all these empowering-sounding slogans.<br\/><br\/>What we want to do in the Bill that we are now proposing to this House is to give real power back to local people at local level.  One of the core principles of the European Unions is subsidiarity, which is the idea that decisions should be taken as closely as possible to the persons or people who will be affected by them.  It makes sense for the population of towns, that is, those most affected by the decisions of local government, to be directly involved and consulted.<br\/><br\/>What does &quot;Take back control&quot; mean?  It sounds mundane but it really is relevant.  If Deputies talk to people in their communities, they will find that the things most people get animated about are what we would call &quot;the smaller things&quot;, namely, the street lights, the footpaths, the vacant buildings, dog-fouling or minor things in the greater scheme of things but important things for people.  It is town councillors, who are clearly accountable to the local population, who address those issues most effectively.  Many people involved at local level do not know who their town councillors are because, as the Ministers of State know, the councillors in my area, for example, are drawn from a quarter of the entire county of Wexford.  It is just not working.  It is often the job of councillors to inform citizens about what is going on with planning permission, big development plans and to bring them around to some of the big ideas.  Citizens must know and trust the people they have elected to do that.  It is that interface or immediacy which is so important.  <br\/><br\/>This proposal is undoing a mistake that was made, and it goes much further than the <i>status quo<\/i>.  I am not asking people to go back to exactly what existed prior to the abolition of town councils, but to put in a uniform system where every urban centre will have the opportunity to elect its own council and restore the immediate connection of the community to the elected council.  I ask the Ministers of State present and the Government to give fair consideration to what is a truly important proposal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600030#HH01500","speaker":"1353","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537971000,"counter":386,"content":"<p>I thank the Ministers of State for coming in today.  The Labour Party proposes this Bill because we believe it is necessary.  My party colleagues around the country felt that getting rid of town councils was a mistake and that reforming and regenerating how they worked was the right thing to do, but we went a step too far.  I am thinking of people like Mr. Sean Counihan in Killarney, who has been chasing us on this issue for years.  It was a mistake, and it was one made by Fine Gael and the Labour Party.  We need to deal with it now.  I thank in advance Fianna F&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in and others who have said they would support such a change.<\/p>  <p>  This is a practical Bill to bring back town councils for towns that have 5,000 people or more, and it is necessary.  In my county, Nenagh, Thurles and other towns need town councils, because town councils are on the money when it comes to issues relating to real things that affect people in towns.  One can see how the municipal districts and the areas covered by the council at county council level do not get down into the detail as quickly as possible.<\/p>  <p>  Our proposal is cost neutral, which means it should be embraced even more.  It also gives the opportunity to right the wrongs of situations, such as Ballincollig and other towns, that did not have town councils when they should have had then, while other areas had town councils historically which maybe should not have.  The Government has an opportunity to right a wrong as well as dealing with something that is needed.  <\/p>  <p>  It is also apparent that it is needed when at various announcements and when dignitaries come to an area the representative is not from the area.  He or she could be from the other side of the county, doing his or her best, and be a good person across a whole range of different political views, but not actually from the area.  In a situation where there are town councils, they would obviously elect one of their own in order that if there were a major tourism initiative, a major announcement or a dignitary coming to the town, he or she would be able to deal with it and do so with local knowledge.  There would be no need to ask for directions or where the event was on.<\/p>  <p>  We recommend that a local government commission should have between nine and 15 members.<\/p><p>We are open to compromise in how that works but that is our proposal.  In fairness to the Minister, he has acknowledged that there is a need for a change.  I refer to the changes made to the local government boundaries.  I looked at my own local district municipal unit of Nenagh.  The councillors from all parties were expected to cover an area that extended from the Limerick border to the Clare border and all the way to the Galway border.  It was incredible, crazy and impossible for many councillors, paid &euro;17,000 or &euro;18,000 a year, to cover that area.  That has been acknowledged, as the councillors are in the same municipal area now.  The local electoral area has been changed and made more realistic for their area of coverage.  That was a step in a positive direction.  Now we need to go further when it comes to dealing with the return of town councils and add to the progress made in recent times.  When it comes to town councils, there may be some push back against this within the local government administration.  I know what I am talking about in this regard from previous jobs I held.<\/p> <p> Ultimately, Deputy Eoghan Murphy is the Minister and we are the people's forum. Town councils may have been a nuisance for some in local authority administrations.  I do not accept that.  I believe the decision was wrong and it is up to us, the Minister and the Government to be strong and to support this Bill because we know it is the right thing to do.  Walking around the corridors of Leinster House, the majority of Members in the Minister's party, my party and in Fianna F&aacute;il - no other party is represented in the House at the moment - know that we have to do this.  If the current Government will not do it, it will have to be done by a future Government.  I ask the Government to take the opportunity we have now to deal with this issue and show a bit of progressiveness and embrace what we are doing.  The Government can change it if it wants.

I am proud of the fact that I started there, as did my late father in 1967.  In government, we become part of a collective agreement and I was part of the decision that collectively agreed to abolish town councils.  I am glad that we as a party have taken a decision to seek to rescind that decision.  It was a grievous error and I acknowledge fully that I was part of that decision.  I support the legislation that we have put forward so that we can create again the front-line for representative democracy, that is, through our municipal or district councils.  People will argue that local authorities such as Cork County Council have the municipal districts.<\/p>  <p>  In my experience, since their creation, people have been a little removed from the decision-making mechanisms.  The resources of the local authorities have become more stretched in the allocation of engineers, housing staff and outdoor staff and they are covering a larger geographic area.  If we decide to implement this legislation as a Legislature and reinstate town councils, what we will put back into them is the core competency of staff who always looked after these towns.  Since the abolition of town councils, I have noticed a diminution of services in towns.  I am sure many Members find themselves doing council-related work more often.  We are all happy to do that because all politics is local and we will help everybody at every turn of the road, no matter how high up the food chain we go politically.  I believe though that having a coterie of town councillors again representing districts and towns would be another service.  It would mean a return to basics and to core principles in representative democracy and the people would welcome that.<\/p>  <p>  No matter what town a person comes from, when he or she walks down the main street as a public representative - whether as a councillor, a Deputy or a Minister - there will always be somebody on a Friday or Saturday afternoon that will ask why we abolished the town councils.  I am hard-pressed to give an answer.  This legislation seeks to address that.  People liked the idea that they had a local person they could go to who would represent their interests and advocate for the bread and butter issues that affect them.  I refer to getting the bread and butter issues or the simple things right because sometimes it is the simple things that exercise people.  The town council gave everybody access on those bread and butter issues.  There is now a sense of remoteness.  Citizens in towns do not feel that connectedness through the relationships in the municipal districts.  That is something that this legislation would address.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600032#KK00600","speaker":"1276"},{"type":"speech","time":1537971600,"counter":391,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<\/p><p>To delete all words after &quot;That&quot; and substitute the following:<\/p><blockquote><blockquote>&quot;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann declines to give the Local Government (Restoration of Town Councils) Bill 2018 a Second Reading in order that the issue of town councils can be considered in the context of the report &lsquo;Municipal Governance &ndash; Districts, Towns and Local Electoral Areas&rsquo; on potential measures to boost local government leadership and accountability, and to ensure that local government funding, structures and responsibilities strengthen local democracy, including the issues of town or borough council status and reduction in the size of local electoral areas, which is currently under consideration by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government.&quot;<\/blockquote><\/blockquote><p>I will go back to my council days as well to get the amendment procedures corrected.  I welcome this opportunity to discuss important issues relating to the local government system, to hear the views of Deputies, and to share with the House the Government&rsquo;s proposals for the future of local government in Ireland.  One thing that most of us value is the work of local government, be that in the former town councils or the existing local authority areas and local councils.  Most of us present served that apprenticeship and it is without doubt a major benefit coming into this House as a Deputy and going on to be committee chairmen or Ministers or Ministers of State.  The opportunity that one gets at local government level is second to none.  It gets a person ready for a proper career in politics and political representation.  We cannot value that enough.  Many of us have developed good working relationships at that level as well and that has benefits in this House because we carry that with us right the way through.  Local government has achieved much when it comes to politics and we all value that.  We might differ over the different versions of it and disagree with certain parts of it but we all recognise the importance of local government one way or the other.  It is important that we remind ourselves of that as well.  <\/p><p>The Bill proposes the re-establishment of town councils, as recommended by a Local Government Commission based on the census report on population distribution and movements published by the Central Statistics Office.  We are opposing the Bill, mainly for reasons of timing, as the matters raised are part of the report on local government matters and have been submitted to the Government and the Oireachtas under the Programme for a Partnership Government.  There are also parts with which we might agree with but for now we think the timing of it is premature. I am instead proposing that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann declines to give the Bill a Second Reading in order that the issue of town councils can be considered in the context of the report, Municipal Governance - Districts, Towns and Local  Electoral Areas.  This examines potential measures to boost local government leadership and accountability and to ensure local government funding, structures and responsibilities strengthen local democracy, including the issues of town or borough council status and a reduction in the size of local electoral areas.  That is currently under consideration by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government.  <\/p><p>The report is with the committee, having been submitted to it for consideration in April.  It is appropriate to allow the committee time to complete its deliberations before making any decisions.  The Government's, Action Programme for Effective Local Government - Putting People First, which was the platform for the wide-ranging reform programme implemented in 2014, set out an ambitious vision for local government to be the main vehicle of governance and public service at local level, leading economic, social and community development, delivering efficient and good value services and representing citizens and local communities effectively and accountably.We intend to further that objective, building on the significant improvements that have been made in recent years.  All of us can see how local government has stepped up in the past number of years to deliver a much wider range of services.<\/p><p>Local authorities have been involved in driving both social and economic development and have had some great success, and that should be recognised.  They are taking a greater role, and in my view are much more of an authority than they used to be and are much more relevant across the board in many aspects of the development of our towns and counties, and rightly so.  They are the key vehicle for making things happen at a local level.  I have certainly seen the benefits in recent years.  <\/p> <p> The next stage in that process is the report to the Government and the Oireachtas under the programme for partnership Government on potential measures to boost local government leadership and accountability and to ensure that local government structures and responsibilities strengthen local democracy.  The programme signals this process as the next wave of local government reform and indicates specific issues to be considered, including reducing the size of local electoral areas and the question of town and borough councils.  To date, several papers have been submitted to the Government and to the Oireachtas for consideration.  In addition to the paper on municipal governance, papers on local authority boundaries and local authority structures have also been completed.  Indeed, the recommendations in the local authority structures paper are the main substance of the Local Government Bill 2018 which will be before this House in the coming weeks.  My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Phelan, also will bring forward proposals on local authority leadership, governance and administration - the issue of directly elected mayors - in the coming weeks, and a final paper examining devolution of functions will also be presented to Government in the coming weeks.   <\/p> <p> To achieve the vision set out in the 2012 policy document, the structural framework must be fit for purpose.  Accordingly, a core element of the reform programme was structural reorganisation, involving the unification of certain city and county councils, and replacing 80 former town councils by municipal districts integrated with the county councils in a new, innovative, system of governance.  This builds on the Barrington committee report of 1991 which identified the need to overhaul sub-county arrangements including the replacement of existing town authorities and also highlighted significant concerns with the existing town council system, including the issue of double representation, where towns have separate councils in addition to representation at county level.  Outdated boundaries and other anomalies have now been removed.  The new system provides more effective and community-focused decision-making and implementation.  There is full integration of local authority resources across each county and elimination of duplication both in administrative and electoral terms.  The new municipal district system is also closer to the European norm, covering the entire territory of each county, in contrast with the previous unbalanced arrangement of isolated town councils, while rural areas, many town environs, and some larger centres lacked municipal status and local governance.  Indeed, a 2013 Council of Europe report specifically welcomed the decision to replace the town council system with the new municipal district arrangement, particularly because it ended the dual franchise in towns, which the report described as unfair.  <\/p> <p> An important benefit of the new system is a more appropriate assignment of local authority functions.  Local matters are dealt with at municipal district level, while those of wider strategic application are decided at county level, without duplication between county and district jurisdictions.  In effect, there is now a dual system of governance but an integrated administrative structure in each county, which maximises operational efficiency while ensuring devolved decision-making throughout the county.  <\/p> <p> Turning to the Bill itself, I must record that it has technical flaws, particularly the fact that it is linked to repealed provisions of the Local Government Act 2001.  Substantial redrafting would be required if it were to progress.  However, there are more fundamental issues in principle with the Bill.  Insofar as there are shortcomings and scope for improvement in current local government arrangements, these matters can, and will, be addressed without resorting to the re-establishment of an array of town councils, if that is what this House decides.  Nobody has said that everything is perfect.  Ongoing reform is required and we must constantly tweak the system to make it better.  The Bill relies on a local government commission to define the town councils.  The local government commission is provided for in sections 89 to 95 of the Local Government Act 2001, which have not been commenced and were repealed in 2014; the commission does not exist.  Even if the local government commission was in place, the Bill provides for the commission, and not the Minister, to make orders determining what constitutes a town, including defining the boundaries of a town.  The Bill proposes that each town council would consist of one local electoral area.  Having more town-focused local electoral areas was part of the terms of reference for the independent local electoral boundary review, which is now complete.  Local electoral areas will be now be provided for in legislation, in line with the boundary review report recommendations, and these recommendations do not align with the proposal in the Bill that each town council would consist of one local electoral area.  It would not be possible to implement the Bill's proposals based on the 2018 local electoral area boundary committee report.<\/p> <p> Arguments being made for restoring the town councils, such as a lack of investment by local authorities in towns, are not generally supported by facts.  My home town of Navan, for example, has been very well served by the municipal area approach, although I recognise that the boundary of the municipal area in that example is married closely to the new town boundary, as well as some rural areas.  It is one of the municipal areas we got right, and that has been recognised with the changes that have happened with the boundaries.  We have tried to recognise those larger towns and realign the boundaries to match up with some of those towns.<\/p> <p> Concerns about lack of urban focus, as well as geographically large municipal districts, have in the main been addressed by the local electoral area boundary review of 2018, published in June 2018, in line with its terms of reference to define distinct urban-focused local electoral areas as appropriate in respect of towns where the population was equal to or greater than 15,000.  This provision also applied to county towns where they did not meet the population criteria. <\/p> <p> There is little general support for the restoration of town councils, even among councillors, as has been confirmed on several occasions by comments from the Association of Irish Local Government.  We have met that group at various meetings and it has said that it is not interested in restoration, and has said the same publically.  We have to have this conversation, but-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600032#KK00800","speaker":"1264","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537972200,"counter":393,"content":"<p>The Deputy should talk to the town councillors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600033#LL00200","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1537972200,"counter":394,"content":"<p>We have to engage with everybody, but I am conscious there was duplication there as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600033#LL00300","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1537972200,"counter":395,"content":"<p>The Deputy has spoken to the winners of the system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600033#LL00400","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1537972200,"counter":396,"content":"<p>We went through a certain process in dealing with this matter.  There are different views out there, and unlike Deputy Sherlock, I do not have people knocking on my door to ask where the town council has gone.  That does not really happen.  Perhaps it happens in some cases, but I am being genuine and telling the truth.  I am not saying the Deputy is incorrect, but that there are different views out there.  I am not getting the feedback the Deputy is getting, although I recognise that Deputy Cassells will also have very strong views on this matter as well and might get different feedback.  We have to find a way of processing the different concerns that exist on different issues.<\/p>  <p>  The reasons for restructuring local government in 2014 are still valid, and if town councils are re-established, the flaws and weaknesses that gave rise to their dissolution will return and would, in fact, be increased because it would be necessary to apply much wider boundaries in many towns and create authorities in new locations.  In my county, for example, places such as Ashbourne, Dunboyne and Enfield did not have town councils.  The only councils we had were those in Navan, Kells and Trim.  It was not exactly a fair system.  Those boundaries had to be changed, and that process took a long time in some cases.  It was not perfect, and it is worth bearing that in mind.  The change to municipal areas makes it much more effective.  There also have been some benefits in terms of effectiveness and decision-making.  I often felt that a twin approach was required, between the council area and the town council.  Decisions were delayed, and in my experience, decisions delayed are often bad decisions.  If we ever go back to the town council system that should be borne in mind, because the opportunity for nothing to happen then arises.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600033#LL00500","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1537972200,"counter":397,"content":"<p>As the advancement of local government and the need to take centralised power from the Custom House is something about which I am passionate, I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this subject this afternoon.  Indeed, I introduced a Bill on behalf of Fianna F&aacute;il on the re-establishment of town councils last year, which was brought through Second Stage and committee scrutiny before Christmas, after which the Government tried to suffocate it with a money message.  However, we will persevere.<\/p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il is passionate about making sure that we can have an enhanced system of local democracy, because the model of the municipal district simply does not deliver that in a truly meaningful way.  It has conspired against our urban centres and means they are not provided with the powers to improve the lives of the people living in them.  We flagged this issue quite clearly, and indeed were joined in chambers across Ireland by members from other parties who shared our view.  We said clearly that if key powers, including budgeting and planning powers, were taken from local towns, the ability to positively impact the way these towns are governed would be neutered.  Each town is unique.  Each has its own challenges and its own strengths.  Accordingly, the ability for each town to set different commercial rates, rather than having one rate per county, was always helpful in bad economic times when councillors could use their discretion and judgment to help businesses survive.  Equally, in terms of the passing of town plans, councillors in a particular urban centre knew the area best and could produce stronger plans.  <\/p>  <p>  I spent 17 years as a councillor at town and county level, and our ability to get things done was far more effective at town council level, where we ran budget surpluses, had the powers to raise our own finance, take bank loans and pursue projects for the people of my town, Navan.  These plans were not subjected to a vote or a debate at county council level, where there was an inherently anti-town attitude from many members from other geographical areas.  We were already living in an over-centralised and under-represented system before the abolition of town councils, but it got worse after those councils were abolished.  We once had 1,627 elected councillors in Ireland.  It has been slashed to 950 in the name of reform.  Lest anyone think we had too many councillors before this, let us reflect on the hard facts.  <\/p><p>The average population per councillor in Ireland used to be 2,815 and even that was the highest in the EU in 2015, with the UK in second place.  We now have one councillor for every 4,838 persons, effectively 5,000.  Let us compare that to the rest of Europe.  In France, there is one councillor for every 118 persons.  France has 36,500 councillors.  In fact, across Europe the average of number of people per councillor is in the hundreds, yet here we have one for every 5,000.  Those issues might have gotten lost for the ordinary person in the street, but when ordinary people saw the impact hit home as their towns formed part of larger urban boundaries, in some cases the size of D&aacute;il constituencies, the net impact was realised.  As I said, the crucial issue of finance then kicked in and the revenue which had been raised in towns from commercial rates or parking charges was now pooled into a county council budget.  Our towns have suffered as a result.<br\/><br\/>Politically, it has to be said that it was the Labour Party which supported Fine Gael in government in implementing this disaster.  It was the assassination of our democracy and it was shameful.  I heard Deputy Brendan Howlin in the Chamber earlier today accusing Fianna F&aacute;il of buying popularity at election time, yet here we are debating the re-establishment of a much-needed layer of local government because Deputy Howlin and the Labour Party went along with a so-called &quot;populist&quot; move, culling 1,000 councillors in the name of reform to try to make it look to the public that they were doing something positive.  It was unforgivable because it centralised more power.  More devastatingly, it crippled the ability of small and large towns to run their own shows, to be free of the shackles of government and to progress their own plans.  It took away their ability to show how imagination could create urban spaces that are a pleasure to work and live in.<br\/><br\/>I read the email that Deputy Howlin sent around last week, with the <i>mea culpa <\/i>story about what they had done.  It was a like a fox going into a henhouse.  Having savaged all the chickens, he meets the farmer on the way out, and with a shotgun at his head says &quot;<i>Mea culpa&quot;<\/i>.  That is Deputy Howlin.  Here he is today, the Fantastic Mr. Fox, with feathers coming out of his mouth as he begs forgiveness for culling so many effective councils that represented the beating heart of our towns.  <br\/><br\/>I served on Navan Town Council and was honoured to have been mayor of my town on two occasions.  We achieved a hell of a lot.  Another town I know very well is Drogheda, located close to us, where the local government proudly held borough council status.  That town has felt the brunt of this decision very badly.  It is a town with a very proud Labour Party tradition, where I attended many meetings of the National Union of Journalists, NUJ, in the local union hall.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600033#LL00600","speaker":"1218","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537972800,"counter":399,"content":"<p>Deputy Cassells comes from a family with a very proud Labour Party tradition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600034#MM00200","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1537972800,"counter":400,"content":"<p>This morning the local newspaper in that town, the<i>Drogheda Independent<\/i>, has a front page story arguing that on this very issue it is time to get the power back.  That town has felt the loss of those decisions.  We will not oppose this Bill on Second Stage because as I said, we believe that any advancement of democratic institutions is to be welcomed.  We made a firm commitment to town councils in our own election manifesto, and we moved our own Bill in this respect last year.  However, we also believe that the model to be introduced needs to be different from what was there before.  I have no problem admitting that there were many ineffective councils that had previously been town commissions.  They had little budgetary power, if any.  I also believe, as I said during scrutiny of our own Bill on Committee Stage with Deputy John Paul Phelan, that we need to be brave and imaginative about what we want to see for our local councils in future.<\/p><p>I have had a lot of engagement with councils in Italy, in the towns of Bobbio and Broccostella with which I twinned Navan.  I gained huge insight from interaction with their elected administration.  Those towns effectively have mini-cabinets at council level.  Different councillors have portfolios concerning infrastructure, education or recreational facilities and the mayor has executive powers.  The most immediate impact I could see was that when the mayor walked down the street of his own home town, people knew that this man was responsible for the running of their town.  With that come all the perks and responsibility of that role.  Crucially, people can see who is responsible when things go wrong and indeed when they go right.  They have a sense of belonging to the administration in their town.  There is a starting point for accountability, and that is crucial.<\/p><p>I firmly believe we need to get to that stage.  We have the ultimate pass-the-can system in this country.  We should be brave.  We should look at enhancing the executive control of our own council chambers as opposed to the board of directors ethos that we have at present, whereby councillors come each month to simply receive a chief executive's report and toddle off again.  We need something more radical and imaginative, something giving real power to those who are accountable to the people.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600034#MM00300","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speech","time":1537972800,"counter":401,"content":"<p>I welcome Fianna F&aacute;il's support of this Bill.  It is similar to a Fianna F&aacute;il Bill that was produced last year.  Some 80 town councils and almost 750 town councillors were effectively abolished by the last Government.  This idea was not merely created or endorsed, it was actually championed as a populist move.  It fundamentally undermined democracy.  We were told it would save a lot of money.  That obviously never happened because every level of staff that was there before was kept on, and rightly so as they were needed.  The only thing that was taken out was one level of democracy.<\/p>  <p>  We heard from Deputy Cassells that there is now only one councillor for every 5,000 people and those councillors, especially those based in the towns, are massively overstretched.  One can see that from talking to any of the councillors dealing with those major towns.  Why is that?  It is because we used to have another layer of local democracy.  In those towns, councillors were councillors who had no ambition to be county councillors or Deputies.  They were solely and purely interested in their local town.  They were always on the ground and if there was an issue with lights or footpaths one could meet with them.  They knew who their engineer was.  They would meet their engineer later that day, and that engineer would be able to sort out the problem.  One now has to approach a county councillor who has to go to the town where the county council is based.  The request goes into the abyss and one may or may not hear about it again.  The council might have to contact some third party contractor, or Irish Water as the case may be, to solve the problem.  <\/p>  <p>  Local government spreads democracy.  It has been said that without local government we do not have democracy.  That is very much the case.  I very much want to see the return of our town councils.

I never served on a town council, but my late father served as chair of Ballina Town Council twice and before he went into public life served as town engineer, a position also occupied by my grandfather.  From that vantage, I note the debate we had last night is absolutely relevant to this debate.  Town councils, urban councils and borough corporations were the most effective providers of public housing in this country.  They delivered it and they minded it, when they were properly resourced.  This is a good step in the context of a housing and homelessness debate.  We are also holding this debate in the week of Tidy Towns.  Again, the urban councils, town councils and borough corporations were the initial providers.  They gave people the chance to take ownership of the issues and challenges facing their towns and to exploit their towns' cultural and economic opportunities.<\/p>  <p>  In the four years since that has been gone, towns have weakened.  I heard Deputy Howlin say the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment wanted this for years.  The Department got its way.  Deputy Howlin does not see the damage that has been done on a daily basis in towns throughout the country because he got his way.  We do, because we are the people on the ground.  This year, that damage resulted in community groups in towns in Mayo, such as Tidy Towns, graveyard management and tourism bodies being forced to wait until July to get their community funds because the county executive decided to use the town budgets as pawns in a budget battle with councillors.  Organisations suffered because of that.  That would not happen if we had town councils with their own planning powers, made up of nine people known in their communities, or whatever the figure in this Bill is.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister's lack of ambition for towns throughout the country is ridiculous.  He seems to be afraid to restore their power because Fine Gael does not like town councils.  It never did well in them because it never understood them.

One of the town council's most vital roles was regular liaison with the local area office of the local authority on issues such as grass cutting, road and footpath maintenance, signage, area enhancement and weed control.  These are all the simple things that go unnoticed unless they are not done.  For example, Lismore, a stunning heritage town, was dependent on its town council to promote tourism, interact with the tidy towns group and liaise with the local authority.  The loss of the town council was widely felt by the local community.  In Ireland, towns were used to electing representatives to represent them at local level.  In 1898, local government in Ireland was recognised.  The county town of Dungarvan, which has a population of 10,000 people, became an urban district in 1898.  This system worked well and contrary to the idea peddled at the time of its abolition that we had too many elected representatives, we had the lowest number of councillors relative to population in the EU.  The seaside town of Tramore, with a population of 12,000 residents, lost its town council and the right to make local decisions.  We need local solutions for local problems.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600034#MM00800","speaker":"1220","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537973400,"counter":407,"content":"<p>T&aacute; an-&aacute;thas orm taca&iacute;ocht a thabhairt don r&uacute;n seo chun go mbeadh na comhairl&iacute; bailte tabhartha ar ais m&oacute;rthimpeall na t&iacute;re.

More than five years ago, more than a dozen town councils and 100 town councillors in my county were dismissed.  Those town councils had provided a voice in their areas.  They provided a leadership role and a platform not just for local issues but for how national issues impacted the local community.  Macroom residents, for example, would have reasonably expected to be able to walk down the street any day and meet a number of councillors if they wished to raise an issue with them.  They also have expected to be able to go into the town council office to discuss a housing application but this is not available to them under the current system.<\/p>  <p>  The town councils were able to advance housing with a local emphasis.  I will focus on one example where people in Macroom lost out as a result of the previous Government's abolition of town councils.  Macroom Town Council was ready to start construction of seven houses in Masseytown.  The town council was dismissed and at county level there was a different focus on bigger schemes.  Time was lost having to retender and we have ended up with the houses being under construction only now, five years after the town council could have progressed them.  It means people in Macroom have missed out on the opportunity of having those houses over recent years.  I have no doubt that if Macroom Town Council had continued in existence families would be facing into their third or possibly fourth Christmas in those houses but they are not yet finished and it does not look like they will be finished this side of Christmas.  It was a mistake to end the town councils and the Minister of State needs to look at a way to bring back an upgraded variation of them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600035#NN00200","speaker":"1284"},{"type":"speech","time":1537973400,"counter":408,"content":"<p>It is a very rare occurrence in politics that people will admit they got something wrong.

At least in this instance the Labour Party has recognised how ill-judged that decision was and is now advocating the restoration of our town councils.  The decision at that time showed a complete lack of understanding of how local communities function.  It prioritised the saving of a paltry amount of money over the empowerment of local communities.  Our 2017 Bill, proposed by my colleague, Deputy Cassells, sought to right that wrong.

I saw at first hand the incredible unpaid efforts of community groups, such as tidy towns, community games groups and many others, working to help one another.

Local government is a driving force behind towns and communities because it is at the heart of job creation, democratic representation, civic participation and local service provision.  Town councils ensure real issues pertaining to local matters that affect people in west Cork are tackled head-on.  It is important that people engage with local communities and participate in local government.  The town council structure is conducive to allowing this to happen.  Issues such as housing, vacant premises, commercial rates, increasing rents, water, road infrastructure and antisocial behaviour need to be addressed urgently but, more importantly, they need to be addressed continuously.  In this regard I welcome the principle of the Bill and we in Fianna F&aacute;il will work with all parties to revitalise local democracy.<\/p>  <p>  Town councils were the bottom rung of the ladder and when they are taken away it is very difficult to jump up to the next step.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600035#NN00400","speaker":"1262"},{"type":"speech","time":1537973400,"counter":410,"content":"<p>Sinn F&eacute;in has always been in favour of retaining town councils.  This is why we voted against the Bill, introduced and passed by Fine Gael and the Labour Party, to abolish them in 2013.  Sinn F&eacute;in believes in the retention of properly functioning local democracy that provides for better engagement with citizens and improved accountability at local level.  There is nothing new in this and it remains our view.  The Local Government Reform Act did not reform town councils.  It abolished 75 town councils and five borough councils, including the borough council in Drogheda.  In 2012, the Labour Party and Fine Gael Government published Putting People First, which acknowledged the importance of town councils.  It was a big glossy brochure but despite it the Labour Party and Fine Gael went ahead and abolished town councils anyway.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill represents the height of hypocrisy.  The Labour Party was in government when town councils were abolished.  It voted for the abolition of the councils and the then Minister, Deputy Kelly, enforced the policy when he took over responsibility for local government.<\/p><p>There is a list the length of my arm detailing how Labour sold out during its time in Government.  It cut the respite care grant, lone parent's allowance and social welfare for young people, and introduced water charges and the local property tax.  Abolishing town councils was just another item on that long list.<\/p> <p> Section 10 claims that the re-establishment of town councils will be met from existing resources and there will be no additional cost to the State.  Will Deputy Howlin explain how re-establishing 80 councils could be done cost free?  How will additional councillors be paid, for example, and how will councils run without additional resourcing or budgeting?  I can only assume this section was included because of the obvious fact that establishing 80 town councils would cost money, and Opposition parties cannot enact legislation that costs money.  The Labour Party is now in opposition but when it was in power, it got rid of councils.  The Labour Party talks the talk in opposition but sells out the country when in power.  The people know this, as was made clear in the last election.  Every argument made by Labour today for the reinstatement of borough councils was known in 2012 and 2013 but the party still went ahead to abolish them.<\/p> <p> This Bill also only states that the Minister \"may\" resurrect councils if he or she so wishes.  The Minister knows that and it is only up to him or her.  There is an onus on the Minister to reinstate borough and town councils.  The Bill, unfortunately, would achieve nothing but the Deputies know that.  The Labour Party had the opportunity to reform local government as part of the national Government but it did not do so.  It just got rid of councils.  Labour does one thing in opposition and the complete opposite in power, so why would anybody trust the Labour Party after all it did?  Why in God's name would anybody give the party the time of day?

I spoke to a very similar Bill in 2017 introduced by the Deputy across from me, and, needless to say, my position has certainly not changed.  The decision in 2014 to abolish our town and borough councils was a sad day for Ireland.  It left a deep democratic deficit that has not, and will not, be filled unless this policy is reversed and these councils restored.<\/p>  <p>  We can speak today about the destruction of rural Ireland and the breaking of the social contract between citizens and the State but the extent of power and decision making removed from urban communities at the time was fundamentally wrong.  In my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, we lost eight town councils.  County Cavan lost councils in Cavan town, Belturbet and Cootehill, and County Monaghan lost Monaghan town, Clones, Castleblayney, Carrickmacross and Ballybay.  There were 72 elected members from all parties and none on these councils.  They were entrusted by their local communities to make the right local decisions to make their town the best place in which to live, visit, grow up, work and invest.<\/p>  <p>  This form of local government worked.  It was a short-sighted and ill-thought out decision to remove this tier of local democracy and administration.  Of course, at the time we did not have as much revenue to spend on public services but this has changed.  Now that it has changed, we must reconsider how best to reflect ordinary people's opinions in the democratic decision-making process.  It has been my consistent position, and that of Sinn F&eacute;in, that the best means of doing this would be through the restoration of town councils.<\/p>  <p>  At a meeting of the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government last May, the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy John Paul Phelan, who is present, addressed the committee on the matter of local government reform.  He quoted a published report on municipal governance relating to districts, towns and local electoral areas, which \"sets out a range of proposals to strengthen the current municipal district system within local authorities and to address identified shortcomings rather than re-establish town councils\".  He also indicated that stronger powers would be preferred for municipal district members, which would involve strengthening the role and capacity of elected members at municipal district level, particularly in budgetary and local development matters, with financial capacity being of particular importance.  These proposals are welcome, as they indicate consideration is at least being given to restoring some powers to municipal areas but I still do not see any impediment whatever to restoring town councils.  The boundary changes announced over the summer period complement their restoration.  Local people and representatives make the best decisions for their local areas.  Fighting for investment, facilities and resources as part of municipal areas and their budgets simply will not deliver the same results.<\/p>  <p>  As others have said, the Labour Party has done an about-turn on the disastrous and short-sighted decision it made in government.  It is now attempting to rectify the disaster by introducing this Bill today.  I, for one, welcome this.  Ultimately, Fine Gael must do the same and admit a mistake was made.  I have made my own so it is not the worst thing to stand up and be man or woman enough to acknowledge it.  The Government should return power to the people and restore town and borough councils at the earliest opportunity.  I support this Bill and I welcome it wholeheartedly.  I commend it to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600036#OO01000","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1537974000,"counter":421,"content":"<p>Ar an gc&eacute;ad dul s&iacute;os ba mhaith liom bu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leis an Teachta Boyd Barrett and his group for allowing me this time.

He left ruin after him.  The Government, with the Labour Party a part of it, supported him.<\/p><p>Deputy Howlin was a Minister at the time.  I described him as being like the high priest because he would not listen to anyone.  Deputy Howlin had a close family member who was a senior member of the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland, AMAI, and consequently, Deputy Howlin above all should have been best advised as to the fatalities of this measure.  However, this was not the case and I do not know what medicine he was trying to dispense to people.  In Tipperary, Clonmel was a proud borough council and the Labour Party was founded there.  As a result, the Labour Party could not go back there to celebrate when the party's centenary came around, which was a pity.  I decried those who objected to the Labour Party.  It should have been welcomed back anyway to Clonmel, but to protests and everything else.  There is Carrick-on-Suir, as I said, Clonmel, Thurles, Templemore and, indeed, Nenagh, Cashel and Tipperary town.  Cashel of the kings has been renowned for centuries.  Now the council building, that was only opened a few years beforehand, is locked up to the people.  There is not a place to host a civic reception for all kind of dignitaries who come from far and near.<\/p> <p> We retained the town hall in Clonmel with great difficulty because Mr. MacGrath, the chief executive officer, CEO, of the council - they are not called county managers any more - wanted to close that as well.  He gave us a lucky-bag chain of office, while we have a noble chain, worth &euro;50,000, that is locked away in a vault.  It is an insult to the town of Clonmel.  That is what we have and a lucky-bag would be better.  We are in and out to - I was going to say \"fishmongers\" and I might as well - jewellery shops to get it fixed every time it is worn.  Those chains of office were a disgrace and those for all the counties were all the same.  They diminished and rubbished the people and the dignity of those offices.<\/p> <p> Almost three years ago to the month, I highlighted the necessity of a constitutional challenge to the Local Government Reform Act 2014 as well as the urgent need for a judicial review of the legality of the Act, which led to the eradication of more than 80 town and borough councils throughout the country.  It was high-handed in the extreme.  We can all talk, as Sinn F&eacute;in is talking there now as well.  On the last day of that Bill's passage here, I was the only Deputy standing - there were other parties representing - to challenge the then Minister, Mr. Phil Hogan, to tell him how fatal it was and that we would be meeting in another forum.  The following day, thanks to Former Local Authority Members &Eacute;ire, FLAME, and former Councillor Niall Dennehy, a former mayor of Clonmel, I served Mr. Hogan with a summons in the D&aacute;il canteen - probably the first ever.  Of course, Mr. Hogan was laughing because he knew where he was heading.  He did not care about the ordinary people.  We are only minions.  It was to hell with the people and \"Croppies lie down\", as Cromwell was back in a different guise.<\/p> <p> At the time, the statement provided by Government sources suggested that the merger of Cork County Council was also a solo run by the then Minister, Deputy Kelly.  Where is he today?  He is not even happy with his Labour Party colleagues.  He wants them all gone.  He would run the party himself.  I told the Labour Party at the time it would come back in a car but they came back in a seven-seater.  If they get Deputy Kelly in charge, God knows, I do not where they will end up.<\/p> <p> At the end of 2015, the then Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, properly described the abolition of 80 town councils as his single greatest policy regret in four years of Government.  I acknowledge that and fair dues to Deputy Howlin for that.  It was the worst thing that ever happened.  Those comments were then backed at the Labour Party conference by Deputy Kelly.  The Deputy was backing Deputy Howlin at that time - now he is snapping at his heels.  They wept tears for local government but did nothing to try and reverse that disastrous decision.  When they were in government, they could have seen the folly of their way sooner and tried to change it.<\/p> <p> In the intervening years, however, we have had no meaningful political debate about the implications of those admissions by the two then senior Ministers, Deputy Howlin agus An Teachta Kelly.  This has, in turn, exposed a chasm of political indifference at the heart of Government concerning the threat to democratic structures in the State.  It was absurd for this matter to continually go on without debate and for it to be relegated to the margins of political conversation.  I stood here on countless occasions in that four-year period on the Order of Business questioning when the Government would return them but they were all happy to forget about it.<\/p> <p> I fully supported the work of FLAME, which, at the time of the so-called Local Government Reform Act, challenged the constitutionality of the decision to axe the councils.  It was unconstitutional, as far as I am concerned.  FLAME advanced the view that the Act was repugnant to the Constitution, specifically, that it violates Article 28A of the Constitution, and the European Charter of Local Self-Government.<\/p> <p> At a committee earlier, I was talking to the EU representatives celebrating 45 years membership.  I note that our Commissioner is due to retire soon.  I told them to bring him to another country and not to send him back here, even to stand for any town council because he would not get elected to it.  As I stated, the 80 town and borough councils had 744 members.  These were decent people working for a pittance.  They were the servants of the people on the ground.  They were members of the joint policing committees, JPCs.  They were able to help An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na solve crime.  They were able to help with the Tidy Towns competitions.  They were able to help with planning matters and many other issues.  Most of them did not do it for money.  They were committed to better their own places.<\/p> <p> As I said, the Fianna F&aacute;il election manifesto, and indeed, the programme for Government, want to restore those with populations over 7,500.  Why is that not being acted on?  We are fooling around.<\/p> <p> The Labour Party has suffered seriously over this.  There were funds then as well.  I have asked questions about that.  There were funds in the relative organisations of the members such as the AMAI and others.  Where did that money go?  I am not saying anybody took it but it was amalgamated and sucked in somewhere.<\/p> <p> We talk about savings.  There were no savings.  We talked about &euro;5 million in Tipperary with the putting together and although the British could not rule Tipperary when it was such a long county, Big Phil, the enforcer, thought he could push us all in together and we would get &euro;5 million.  We got zilch savings and we got anti-democratic decisions.  The decisions are being stripped away as late as last week by reserved functions being taken off the members in Clonmel borough districts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600036#OO01300","speaker":"1347","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537974600,"counter":425,"content":"<p>What is wrong with the north Tipperary people?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600037#PP00200","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speech","time":1537974600,"counter":426,"content":"<p>There is nothing wrong with them at all.

I very much welcome that the Labour Party, Sinn F&eacute;in and the Independents, and I would hope the Minister of State, agree that a mistake has been made, it is time to rectify it and now is the time to do that.<\/p>  <p>  Local decisions are always best made locally.  Issues around housing, planning, street maintenance etc. are best dealt with at a local level.  One will get much better value for money by letting local democracy return to a local level.  For example, since the abolition of the town councils, Tralee and Killarney recently passed town plans and the level of engagement in both of those plans was significantly less than would have been the case, were the town councils doing the work.  Already, less than a month after they have been passed, significant errors are beginning to show and will now have to be rectified.  The reason is because of the lack of engagement from the public.  When one has a healthy local democracy with people providing an input and local councillors who know their own area dealing with the issues, one will get far better results.<\/p>  <p>  There are improvements that can be made to the town council structure.  There are lessons that can be learned.<\/p><p>I hope the Minister of State, having the full support of the House, will consider reinstating town councils, particularly in towns with larger populations, and reintroduce local democracy where better decisions can be made.  I will not repeat what my colleagues said, but local democracy is best dealt with locally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600037#PP00500","speaker":"1321","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537975200,"counter":430,"content":"<p>In the limited time available, I welcome the introduction of this Bill.

I will upset the Minister of State, Deputy John Paul Phelan, when I say that his former colleague, Phil Hogan, made an outrageous error of judgment when Minister in what he did to local authorities and town councils.  It has been stated here time and again that many of the urban councils were the strong voice of the people.  I take the town of Ballinasloe in my constituency as an example.  There is no doubt that the town of Ballinasloe with a population of 7,000 has suffered significantly because of the loss of that town council.  That is why we will not look at this figure of starting to put back town councils where there is a population of 10,000.

When one looks back at what happened, there was a little snobbery involved because the guys and girls in the town councils were seen as bits of idiots that one could not really have representing their town or area.  That was very wrong, but it existed.  I hope the damage done and the hurt caused to people will now be reversed as quickly as possible and town councils for a population of 5,000, as Deputy Howlin just told me, will be restored to their rightful position.

I say this in a magnanimous and sincere way because it is important when one realises that something is wrong that one says so.  I also recognise my colleague, Deputy Shane Cassells, who brought forward a similar Bill which passed Second Stage not long ago.  It is a very important measure.  We know that decisions are best made by those closest to them.  The principle of subsidiarity has been recognised for millennia, since the first city charters.  The famous Irish American politician Tip O'Neill spoke of all politics being local and they are.  That is why it is so important that we recognise the role.  There are anomalies, such as the poor maligned town of Ballybay - I am looking around the Chamber for any colleagues from Cavan-Monaghan and see Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in is present - was an example of where there were 900 residents and nine councillors, so it had a ratio of one to 100 whereas the towns of Celbridge and Maynooth in my constituency have 20,000 residents and not a single councillor because it did not have a town council.  It is important that if we re-establish them, and I hope that we do, it is done in such a way that it is uniform and balanced across the country.<\/p>  <p>  We have heard much criticism of the former Deputy Phil Hogan.  When the abolition took place, the cost savings amounted to &euro;15 million over the 72 town councils abolished.  It reminds me of the 132 Garda stations that were closed for a cost saving of &euro;2 million.  There was a general populism at the time, which we might put at the door of Fine Gael.  It was a kind of anti-quango talk, of which the current Taoiseach was to the fore, calling for the abolition of various agencies, when all he was doing was abolishing public services.  It was a populist, anti-expert kind of mood because the figures do not bear it out.<\/p>  <p>  There was an idea a few years ago that Ireland was over-represented and had too many politicians but if we look at local government, France has one councillor for every 118 people, Denmark has one councillor for every 115 people and Ireland has one councillor for every 4,800, so we are actually at the opposite end of the scale.  We are hugely under-represented in local government.

It will address the democratic deficit that arose with the abolition of town councils.  It is a political correction for democracy.  It represents a return to a form of democracy whose loss we now understand.  The pendulum has swung too far away from local democracy.  This Bill attempts to allow local towns and councils to make decisions for themselves.  The centralisation of local government into county councils drew politics too far from people, including in substantial towns.  In Clare, Shannon, Ennis and Kilrush lost their town councils and Kilkee lost its town commissioners.  This Bill would restore to County Clare town councils in Ennis and Shannon which would be welcome because we are suffering a sustained attack on rural Ireland and rural life.  The withdrawal of local democracy was another example of that.  We in rural Ireland are losing our services, including medical services and post offices, and we need to restore local democracy which would help to redress that balance.<\/p>  <p>  It also allows towns to make decisions specific to themselves, develop local amenities and cultural activities but also maintain services within the towns and the integrity of those communities.  Council councils have now divided into municipal districts which often means a huge area being covered by a small number of councillors.  Often many areas have no representation at all.  The restoration of this democracy, this correction of local democracy, is extremely important and I commend this Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600038#QQ00900","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1537975200,"counter":438,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak this evening.  The previous Government abolished the town council tier of local government.  The abolition of the tier which focused on urban centres was clearly a mistake and must be rectified by the restoration of our town councils.<\/p>  <p>  I strongly argue for the reintroduction of an urban focus.  There is disconnect between the municipal districts and urban towns.  People in the towns of west Cork no longer have ready access to the same number of councillors or what used to be the town hall, and we must restore that.  In my constituency, when the town councils were abolished, Clonakilty set up a mayoral council.  Volunteers such as Anthony McDermott, John Loughnan, Gretta O'Donovan, Colette Twomey and Cionnaith &Oacute; S&uacute;illeabh&aacute;in have given tirelessly and continuously to their community.  There is an annual mayoral contest and the mayor attends between 150 or 160 functions.  I commend them for giving their time to the people. <\/p>  <p>  Some of the decisions around rural Ireland of the previous Government and the current one beggar belief.  Take the community voluntary forum and how it struck them off.  The way the last Government was going, we were lucky it could not get its hands on local community councils or it would have struck them out too.  It wanted to make sure it did not give a voice to anyone but has anything changed?  The recent boundary changes in Cork, which include the transfer of Cork County Council areas with large populations from the county council into Cork corporation, will have a detrimental effect on the county.  The loss of revenue from areas such as Glanmire, Blarney and Ballincollig will result in a huge drain in revenue from the county in the long term.  Once again, it is dictation from the top.  I represent rural areas in west Cork, some of which are the most disadvantaged in the county, including the peninsulas and islands which cannot afford any loss of revenue.<\/p>  <p>  Has anything changed?  When we consider the new county council boundary changes, there was no consultation with the people of Courtmacsherry, Barryroe, Timoleague and Darrara.  They do not want to be pushed into the Bandon electoral area but the Government has pushed them into it.  It is dictation from the top again.   <\/p><p>Nothing has changed.  The Government got rid of town councils.  It is seeking to erode anything to do with community as much as it can.  All of this is being led by a political party that has another agenda.  While I agree with the restoration of town councils, I do not trust this Government to do it.  In my view, it will be doctored in some way to suit its own needs.  The Government needs to start taking the people of rural Ireland seriously.  It should give the people of rural Ireland back their voice.  The reintroduction of town councils would be a step in that direction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600038#QQ01000","speaker":"1263","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537975800,"counter":440,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Michael Healy-Rae, fresh from his new role as a TV presenter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600039#RR00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1537975800,"counter":441,"content":"<p>If one lives long enough, a Cheann Comhairle, one will get to see everything.

I welcome this Bill and hope it will be passed.  I am calling on the Minister to withdraw his amendment to allow this Bill to be scrutinised on Committee and Report Stages.  Local decisions should be made at local level, as near as possible to the people affected by them.  Local government was working well.  There was no need to fix it because it was not broken.  I have seen at first hand the workings of town and borough councils.  I was a member of Clonmel Corporation and Clonmel Borough Council between 1985 and 2004.  I served as mayor of Clonmel from 1994 to 1995.  Clonmel is a significant and substantial town.  It used to be the biggest inland town in the country.  Councillors across all political parties, including independent councillors, worked very well on the corporation and the borough council in Clonmel.<\/p>  <p>  County Tipperary was very badly hit by the abolition of the councils, which has been a disaster and obviously has failed.  I welcome the introduction of this Bill.  It is a pity that it has to be introduced, but so be it.  County Tipperary lost Clonmel Borough Council and the town councils in Carrick-on-Suir, Cashel, Tipperary, Thurles, Templemore and Nenagh.  It is important to get a flavour of these towns, which have been stripped of local representatives and local government.  Carrick-on-Suir is known for the only existing manor house of its kind in the country.  It was visited by Anne Boleyn, who was the wife of Henry VIII at one stage.  Carrick-on-Suir was the home of the first president of the GAA, Maurice Davin.  It is the home of Se&aacute;n Kelly and Sam Bennett.  It was the home town of the Clancy brothers.<\/p>  <p>  Clonmel, which is the capital of south Tipperary, defeated Cromwell in May 1650 with the help of our northern neighbours, Hugh Dubh O'Neill and his people.  The mayor of the day - Mayor White - negotiated a deal with Cromwell that saved the town and its people, and the soldiers who were supporting the town.  Clonmel courthouse was the scene of many high-profile sessions, including the trial of the Young Irelanders in 1848.  Of course, the Labour Party was established in Clonmel town hall in 1912.  Clonmel has been the seat of administration in the south of the county for many years.  Musicians like Frank Patterson, Mick Delahunty and M&iacute;che&aacute;l &Oacute; S&uacute;illeabh&aacute;in came from Clonmel, which is a Quaker town.  Charles Bianconi, who was mayor of Clonmel on two occasions, set up his first transport system in the town.<\/p>  <p>  Cashel is famous for the Rock of Cashel, which was once the seat of the kings of Munster.  Tipperary town is known in Irish as Tiobraid &Aacute;rann, or the well of Ara, and may be described as the nucleus of the War of Independence.  Se&aacute;n Treacy, Dan Breen, S&eacute;amus Robinson and S&eacute;an Hogan started the fight for Irish freedom in nearby Soloheadbeg in January 1919.  Nenagh, which is the capital of north Tipperary, is a Norman settlement.  Nenagh Castle was built in the 13th century.  A great-grandfather of mine - Michael Healy, who was a Fenian - was incarcerated in the county jail in Nenagh for some time in 1867.  Semple Stadium is in Thurles, which is the birthplace of the GAA.<\/p>  <p>  Roscrea, which is a heritage town, has 600 years of the finest Irish architecture at St. Cronan's cathedral and a Norman castle that dates back to 1280.  Cahir is the location of Cahir Castle.  I could also mention Templemore.  This kind of history gives towns their identity and makes them communities.  These towns should not have been stripped of their local government.  There is no doubt in my mind that we should restore the town and borough councils as quickly as possible.  It appears that the Minister and his Government colleagues, who abolished these councils some years ago with the help of the Labour Party, intend to put this off again.  I hope they do not do that.  I ask them to withdraw their amendment and to allow this Bill to go forward for scrutiny on Committee and Report Stages.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600039#RR02100","speaker":"1348"},{"type":"speech","time":1537975800,"counter":460,"content":"<p>I am glad to have an opportunity to support Deputy Howlin, who has introduced the Bill.

I am delighted with the support coming from all quarters.  We feel this Bill could probably be improved and put together with the Fianna F&aacute;il Bill, brought forward and put into the committee.  It was the colleague of Minister of State Deputy Phelan who led the charge.  I was not there at the time.  I was not even a member of the Labour Party.  I did not have the Whip when this happened but I still assume responsibility, unlike some, because I was a Member of the House.  I suppose I could have spoken out with greater clarity against the proposal.<\/p>  <p>  We are now proposing that every town with a population of more than 5,000 and at least 1,000 dwellings, and with a clearly defined urban centre, should have its town council restored.  In other words, there is critical mass.  There should be nine councillors elected from one electoral area, but if the town is larger, as in where Deputy Lawless represents, there should be 15.  This could be changed or reconsidered, of course.  Deputy Cassells's idea may well be better.  Let us bring the two ideas together.  Let us not be afraid of this.  Other Deputies, including Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, have other points of view.  The central point is that the town would elect its own councillors to serve the needs of the town.  People do feel remote from their public representatives at present.  The proposal would remedy this.  Councils would have the ability to set their own rates.  They could be lower or higher than those set by the county council.<\/p>  <p>  The restoration of the town councils for Mullingar, Athlone and Longford would enable them to be in control of their own development plans, budgets, planning applications and finances.  In Mullingar, the town council could promote the local industrial park at Marlinstown, which has 27 ha, so it could be sure to get an industry there.  It is centrally located, well appointed, has planning permission and three-phase electricity, yet IDA Ireland has failed to secure an industry for the area.  We could do more.  Athlone and Mullingar both have well over 20,000 people, heading towards 25,000.  Longford has 10,000.  All of those areas would qualify.  That is important.<\/p>  <p>  The decision to abolish councils in wholesale fashion was stupid, driven by a false narrative that abolition would lead to significant savings.  What happened as a result was that the reduction in the number of local public representatives, who are the fulcrum of representative democracy, just heaped work and pressure on a smaller number of public representatives, many of whom were not local to the area to be represented and who had to carry an extra load with no pay.  The pay is absolutely useless.  Let us call a spade a spade: the big problem we will face in the coming years is trying to get people to actually run for those offices.  We bow to the lowest common denominator.  Someone in the media makes a point about public representatives and we immediately rush in.  We in this House are kings and queens of it.  We condemn every public representative and lacerate ourselves in here.  I have seen it.  The deterioration over 26 years is frightening.  When I came in here first, we respected one another.  We had our political arguments, no more than the way in which I might now disagree with Deputies Cassells or &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, but ultimately there was respect.  If we do not have respect for one another, we should not expect anyone outside to have respect for us.  One might think one is gaining the upper hand by some snide or glib remark but one is only playing to the gallery and denigrating one's fellow representatives.  We should argue the political toss vehemently and strongly but we are all colleagues, and I am sure we are in politics for the best motives &ndash; 99.9% of the people I have served with were always motivated by public service and I was proud to be one of their own.  After the next election, I clearly will not be but I will be proud to leave and say I was part of that House and that it was a great honour.  We should not run around denigrating one another because it is only fuel for somebody else to continue the denigration.<\/p>  <p>  In the last week I have heard stories from across Ireland on the impact of the loss of the town council and why it should be reintroduced.  Mr. Liam van der Spek, our representative in Cavan, is urgently seeking the restoration of his town council.  He told me that Cavan town, with its population of more than 10,000, has been noticeably underdeveloped since losing its town council.  The main streets and housing estates are suffering.  The town has been dropped from the top spots in the league of Irish Business Against Litter.  Owing to the lack of representation, Mr. van der Spek doubts the town could now host the Fleadh Cheoil like it did in 2010.  I was very proud to be at Cavan's three fle&aacute;nna, bearing in mind that I am a great Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann man, as most people know.  It would be difficult to attract such events now because all towns want them.  We are spending &euro;3 million in Mullingar and hope to get the Fleadh Cheoil in 2020 and 2021 because it was founded in Mullingar.  We want it in Mullingar for the 70th anniversary.  Let that go out to everyone, including Deputy Howlin, who is seeking to have it in Wexford.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600040#SS00200","speaker":"1370"},{"type":"speech","time":1537976400,"counter":465,"content":"<p>Wexford is also a bidder.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600040#SS00300","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1537976400,"counter":466,"content":"<p>Mr. Ian McGahon from Bray, County Wicklow, told me the town has lost direct decision-making powers on housing and planning as well as direct finance and budgets.  Towns have lost out greatly because of the 2014 legislation.<\/p>  <p>  Mr. Seamus Ryan from Ennis, County Clare, told me communities took pride in having their local councils for their towns, and that the councils were a vital avenue for advocacy for people in small communities across the entirety of the country and they gave people a local focal point.  People are being badly represented because of the changes introduced in the municipal districts, where it can literally take hours to cross from one end to the other.  Ennis, a town of 26,000, effectively has three councillors as the other five are all rural.  Shannon, which has a population of 13,000, has one councillor from the town.  This shows the imbalance that can arise.  I mean no disrespect to the rural councillors.  They are fighting tooth and nail.  Every councillor is travelling miles and getting damn-all for it.  I was a rural councillor myself, in an area 12 or 14 miles from Mullingar.  I was representing rural areas but the councillors elected in Mullingar knew intimately every pothole, ditch, hedgerow, light, pavement and manhole cover.  I could not know those.  This is where it all fell down.  We need to give back a voice to the councillors and not be afraid to do so.<\/p>  <p>  Mr. Aaron Byrne from Kells, County Meath, is a neighbour of Deputy Cassells.  Mr. Byrne told me the removal of the town councils has created a deficit of representation for people in smaller towns and villages around the country.  In his area there are three towns - Kells, Athboy and Oldcastle, which neighbours my county - that have all lost town councils and are now represented at county level by the shared seven councillors.  This means seven voices among 40 on Meath County Council fighting for resources for three towns in a large municipal district.  Kells is listed in the county development plan as having only a support function to Navan, which is in a different municipal district.  As a result, there are seven councillors trying to vie for funding across a huge area of the county against seven councillors specifically elected to serve Navan town, backed up by a county development plan.  That is the type of imbalance that happens because of the structure.  While I might represent Mullingar and Deputy Cassells represents Navan, we represent everyone but it is important that the large towns have representatives.  Kells needs representatives who can prioritise the needs of Kells and focus on developing the town and hinterlands in their own right and not as supporting entities of larger towns in the county. <\/p>  <p>  Mr. Johnny Walsh from Ballinasloe, County Galway, listed eight reasons a town council is needed in the town.  First, the town could set its own commercial rates, which were 30% lower than the county rate.  The increase is hitting the town hard.  Second, it would restore personal contact with local council officials instead of people having to travel 40 miles to the closest office.  Third, it would reconnect the general public in our towns with the political process, which is important.  Fourth, it would restore our budgetary, planning and housing functions to our town, giving people local control. Fifth, it would restore the discretionary community fund in respect of which the town council had the relevant local knowledge for allocating money to projects that needed it. Sixth, it would ensure proper services for people in the town for council housing maintenance and the upkeep of council green areas.  Seventh, the previous town council had an affordable council rent scheme but the county council scheme is a more expensive scheme for tenants, even if there is no increase in their income.  Eighth, it would restore a sense of civic pride in that the town would have its own local mayor to officiate at important local events.<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister of State can see across the State, people who care about their towns want the opportunity to make their urban areas better.  Their specific concerns are getting lost.  Diversity is essential.  It allows towns to experiment with new ways of doing things, to try out new projects and specialise based on the attributes they have.  It gives towns a voice &ndash; a voice they now lack.  I support the returning of those voices to the local councils. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600040#SS00400","speaker":"1370"},{"type":"speech","time":1537977000,"counter":467,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies who contributed to the debate.  It was very interesting, and I am something of an anorak about matters relating to local government.  I cannot support the legislation drafted by Deputy Howlin.<\/p>  <p>  Nineteen Deputies spoke in the debate and they gave some good reasons as to why they feel the changes were not suitable and have not worked in some areas.  My fundamental principle is that when people vote in local elections, they should have one vote, as in national elections.  The previous Victorian system, introduced by the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898 and referred to by Deputy Butler, created a situation where certain individuals who lived in certain urban centres had two ballot papers at a local election.  There is much work to be done in this area and perhaps there is not much between my view and those of other Members as to how we develop an integrated system of local government.  We can all agree that the county as a unit, outside of the larger cities, is the primary identifiable geographical division by which local government should be implemented.  Is there a method of ensuring that our towns can be more strongly or better represented within the county structure?  Our current system has 30 local authorities, which is enough.<\/p>  <p>  I note the contributions regarding representation from Deputy Lawless and others.  Deputy Cassells spoke about a councillor for every 118 people in France.  It would be interesting to have that in this country, although that proportion is perhaps too low.  Our system is undoubtedly on the higher end but we are also over-represented at national level.  Perhaps we should cut the number in the D&aacute;il in half and double the size of local authorities to bring us more into line with international norms, or we could have our own proper integrated system of local government<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600041#TT00100","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speech","time":1537977000,"counter":468,"content":"<p>Get rid of the Fine Gael Members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600041#TT00200","speaker":"1323"},{"type":"speech","time":1537977000,"counter":469,"content":"<p>I do not say that the current system is perfect.

What offices are open and not open are matters for Tipperary County Council.  The idea is that because the British could not rule Tipperary - I do not know if they could rule Deputy Mattie McGrath - the county was divided in two and should be kept frozen in aspic in perpetuity.  Deputy Penrose made the best contribution when he spoke about people not denigrating each other.  I do not dismiss any of the arguments made by others but I cannot understand how people who are supposed to be democrats in this House think that some people should have two votes in a local election and others should have one.

However, I am changing that.  There is a committee, which will have legislation shortly on how Members of the Seanad should be elected in the future.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to deal with other specific issues.  Members spoke about this Bill being cost neutral.  It is not cost neutral.  Deputy Howlin spoke about 100 towns with a population of 5,000 or more.  Interestingly, Deputies Butler and Aindrias Moynihan said they were supporting the Bill because it would bring back Lismore Town Council and Macroom Town Council.  Those two towns are far below the population threshold of 5,000 so perhaps they should have read the Bill before they contributed.<\/p>  <p>  I believe the reason Deputy Cassells's legislation, which was passed by the House, has not been discussed since then is that there was a report due before the Cabinet on local government and local leadership.  That was approved by the Cabinet.  I find it frustrating, as the spare leg in the Customs House who is not directly involved in housing, that most of the issues discussed by the housing committee relate to housing, which is natural given that it is the biggest national issue at present.  It is difficult to get time to discuss local government matters.  I would prefer if there was a separate local government committee, and most Members here have served on local authorities, or if there was a subgroup of the joint committee to examine local government. We could have a proper and full discussion there, without shouting at each other, as to how we wish town councils, county councils and local authorities to progress in the future.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Browne said there were no savings.  There have been savings.  Some &euro;21 million was saved following the mergers of Tipperary, Waterford and Limerick local authorities and between &euro;18 million and &euro;20 million was saved through the abolition of town councils.  It is not necessarily a huge amount but it is untrue to say no savings were made.  I was struck by Deputy Cassells's comment that there was an anti-town attitude in county councils across the country.  Perhaps that is the case in Meath but I never encountered it.  Perhaps Kilkenny was unique.  There was one urban centre and everything else around the county was much smaller but there was never a sense of anti-urbanism.<\/p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il's deputy leader, a man for whom I have great respect, made a strange contribution in which he spoke about his ancestors being town engineers.  He let the mask slip a little when he said Fine Gael never did well on town councils and was always opposed to them, the corollary being that Fianna F&aacute;il always did well on them.  I do not believe that this is behind Deputy Howlin's contribution or behind most of the contributions to the debate but there is an element of patronage involved in town councils.  It offers a role for local party activists, who can be paid by the rate payer or the property tax payer, to become involved in the political activities of an organisation or as an independent in seeking election.  I got a strong whiff of that from Deputy Calleary's contribution, which is unusual for him.<\/p>  <p>  There was nothing much from Deputy O'Loughlin.  Deputy Murphy O'Mahony spoke about town councils being the bottom rung of the ladder and said that people could stand for further elections after being on town councils.  They did serve that function to an extent but that is not necessarily a good enough reason for them to exist in the future.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to Drogheda, it is in the same boat as my own part of the world in Kilkenny where the borough council was abolished.  The new Drogheda borough district was drawn up and most Members who contributed to the debate have acknowledged that the recent review of local electoral areas has made an attempt to make them more manageable geographically.  It has also made an attempt to make them more manageable in terms of the focus on towns.  Deputy Howlin has spoken to me several times about Wexford town.  The new Wexford borough district corresponds to Wexford town and its immediate hinterland.

This being Private Members' business, the Bill has had one of the largest number of Members contributing that I can remember in recent times.  Everybody in the House has an affinity to the democratic system.  We all strive in our own ways to try to make it better.  There have been various attempts to do so, including by me during my tenure more than two decades ago in the Custom House when I produced the Better Local Government plan.  The idea then was not only to strengthen local government but to link it to community activity for the first time.  There was great resistance to the notion that unelected community groups should be involved in strategic policy committees and in shaping policy, although the majority of every committee would be, of course, the elected members.<\/p>  <p>  The former Minister, Phil Hogan, also produced plans, in respect of which I do not attribute any malice to him.  There have been various contributions to this debate, most of which were very constructive and measured.  There are some Members from whom one never expects anything more than vitriol and they never disappoint.  I am taken aback by the ungraciousness and lack of generosity in the comments of Deputy Cassells.  It is important for politicians to recognise that mistakes were made and to come into this House and say that and to change their minds.  As I said in my opening contribution, up to last night I had spent three days in Liverpool trying to persuade the British people to think again about what I believe is a grievous mistake in Brexit.  We must have the ability to say that we should think again on the basis of how things work out.  Whatever the merits people argued for a more integrated type of local government, it has not worked.  <\/p>  <p>  I would like to make a couple of points on the contributions of the Ministers of State, Deputies English and Phelan.  The Minister of State, Deputy English, said that the municipal system is working.  It is not, although I acknowledge that the revised boundaries will improve matters.  We all know our own areas best.  The new municipal district of Wexford, which is essentially Wexford town and its immediate environs, will be immeasurably better than the old one which encompassed one-quarter of the county because as people from Kilmore Quay to Rosslare Harbour had no affinity to the town and mayors elected from those areas had no urban tradition, it did sunder the district.  There needs to be an urban driver.  While I acknowledge that an attempt has been made in the new boundaries to bring about improvements, I believe we need to have a stand-alone urban council and not one that is merely a sub-committee of the greater county council, which is what it is now.<\/p>  <p>  I am anxious to have this Bill enacted and I am determined to ensure it proceeds.  I acknowledge the campaigning work of Deputy Cassells on the issue but his Bill did not seek to create the new councils.  If this Bill is passed new councils will be created.  Deputy Cassells's Bill sought to create a process that would consider the creation of the councils, which was welcome and we supported it.  There will be a lot of work to be done on this Bill in Committee if it passes Second Stage.  I would like to see this legislation in place in time for the next local elections.  This is not an impossible task.  The Minister of State, Deputy English, also said that Government proposes to commission another report on the issue, but that will probably be subject to a further report.  This is not the way to deal with this critical issue.  We want a debate.  If the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, wants a debate then let us set aside a Friday or a Monday for a full debate on local government issues.  I would be delighted to map out my own time to contribute to such debate and I am sure all Deputies who spoke this evening would do likewise. <\/p>  <p>  On the contribution of the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, I think the Minister will regret talking about the patronage issue.

They work really hard and they have ideas.  I served for many years on Wexford Borough Council.  I also served on Wexford County Council.  I can say with clear conscience that far more constructive work was done at Wexford Borough Council than at Wexford County Council.  Perhaps because of the scale of Wexford County Council, not everybody was interested in every issue but on the borough council everybody was interested in every issue and it was of great moment.  An awful lot of time was wasted all well.  I recall that one rates process took ten meetings even though we were dealing with relatively small sums of money.  People were passionate about their roles and the issues and the wider public knew it.  The public was aware that their councillors often met until 10 p.m. or 11 p.m. arguing for their issues, such as whether &pound;20,000 should be allocated for a local playground.  It was about small money but really important decisions for people.  I regret that we no longer have such a system and I would like to put that right.<\/p>  <p>  I have taken note of what everybody said.  What I found most damning about Deputy Munster's contribution is that she clearly had not read the Bill.  One expects that people would know what they are talking about, even if fairly general terms, before they make a critique.  Deputy Munster was obviously motivated by whatever is going on in her own constituency.  Perhaps because Senator Ged Nash is championing this and has traction on it, because he is right on it, the Deputy feels she has to put her oar in.  If her general thesis is that it is fundamentally wrong to change one's mind, Sinn F&eacute;in is in a sorry state.  I welcome people changing their minds.  I welcome people admitting they did not get something right, that they made a mistake or that they could have done something better.

I ask people to assist in making this transformation, which I believe will be an important restoration of our local government system and a real important step in reconnecting people who are increasingly disenfranchised and disconnected from the things that matter most to them.<\/p><p>When talking to people at the doors they speak about the small things such as anti-social behaviour, the state of the footpaths, the lights, the signage, the grass verges and all the issues that are the bread and butter of local government which people want to be able to contact their local representatives about.  I ask the Minister of State to withdraw his amendment and allow this Bill to pass.  I think that it will pass in any event and I thank all of the Deputies who supported it.  Let us then make our best collective effort to do something right for local government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600042#UU00900","speaker":"1353","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537978200,"counter":488,"content":"<p>That concludes our discussion on the Local Government (Restoration of Town Councils) Bill 2018.

All reasonable steps is a formula widely found in the Statute Book.  It is the same test used by the Department of Health on the offence of selling tobacco products to children under 16.  The reference to information society services reflects the EU terminology used to define services such as websites, email, search engines, Twitter and YouTube, etc., and it is the terminology used by the Department of Health in its ban on e-cigarettes.<\/p><p>Section 6, subsection (2), then sets out factors to be taken into account in determining whether reasonable steps have been taken to ensure that advertising cannot be viewed by children.  The reference to the court or jury reflects the fact that the offence could be tried on indictment before a jury.  The subsection is not proscriptive as to what constitutes &quot;all reasonable steps&quot; but I expect that it would effectively require the following: age gates which would at least consist of a user-entered date of birth or similar; the use of any demographic targeting tools provided by advertising networks to limit viewing to users over 18; and registration of websites with internet filtering software providers and a restriction on retweets, send by email and similar tools where these would have the effect of exposing an advertisement to a new audience which could potentially include children.<\/p><p>The reference to &quot;state of technological development&quot; is borrowed from the Data Protection Acts 1998 and 2003 and it is intended to have the effect that the duty to prevent viewing by children will become more stringent as time progresses and access controls become more effective.<\/p><p>Subsection (3) provides that the offence only apply to audiovisual media services originating in Ireland.  This is done to reflect the country of origin principle in the Audiovisual Media Services Directive, AVMSD, which prevents Ireland from imposing these rules on services originating in other European Economic Area, EEA, jurisdictions.

I have discussed it with the Minister in some detail and it has been explained to me that for a bunch of what sound like reasonable and material legal reasons it cannot be done in this way.  However, the point raised is incredibly important because one of the things that this Bill does is to try to prevent advertising of alcohol in areas such as sport, particularly with children.  As we know, advertising is moving online and my understanding is that more than 50% of advertising revenue spent in Ireland today is spent online and, therefore, we are going to great efforts to make a difference in terms of billboard advertising near schools and so forth but to miss online advertising is a real problem.  I understand that it could not be brought through this Bill because it requires changes to European legislation and so forth.  While we will not support the amendment as it is, I wholeheartedly agree with the point that Deputy O'Reilly raised, namely, that whatever prohibitions and protections we are bringing in, particularly for young people and children, we must figure out how to bring that into the online space as well as a matter of urgency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600043#VV01300","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speech","time":1537978200,"counter":499,"content":"<p>Opposition amendments Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive and amendments Nos. 6 and 24, as Deputy O'Reilly outlined, create a framework for age restrictions on alcohol advertising on the Internet.  Like Deputy Donnelly, I fully support the intention of these amendments, as I discussed with Deputy O'Reilly and in the Seanad and as my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, would have said on Committee Stage because one of the primary objectives of this Bill is to delay the initiation of alcohol consumption by children and young people.  I wish to be clear that there is no disagreement between myself and Deputy O'Reilly on the intent of what she is trying to achieve.<\/p>  <p>  These amendments propose the creation of an offence if a person advertises or causes to be advertised, an alcohol product on an information society service unless all reasonable steps are taken to ensure that the advertising cannot be viewed by children.  An example of what constitutes a reasonable step is whether age verification controls have been used to prevent access by children to an advertisement.  My concern with this approach, which will not be news to the Deputy, is that these amendments use the framework of the Audiovisual Media Services Directive, which is within the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten.  My officials have previously consulted with that Department and the Department of Justice and Equality on this matter because the issue is an important one.  I am informed that the Audiovisual Media Services Directive is a sector-specific directive for television and services that are similar to television and I am informed that the intention of its scope, as would happen with these amendments, to include any audiovisual content on any Internet platform, would cut across several EU directives and other legislation.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to these legal concerns, there is a difficulty with the enforcement of the proposal.  For example, if it was introduced for websites hosted in Ireland, advertisers could simply move to websites which are not hosted in Ireland in order to avoid the necessity to comply with these proposed restrictions.<\/p>  <p>  On a practical note, I am unclear as to how effective age verification controls are in terms of their implementation.  If it is a matter of clicking a button to confirm that the viewer is aged 18 or over, children may simply be able to click that button and access the alcohol advertising.<\/p>  <p>  I fully support the intention of the amendments and I am very willing to work with colleagues across this House and with colleagues in Government to see how Ireland can endeavour to address this and to play a role in addressing it in Europe but according to the advice available to me, it is likely that European legislation will be necessary to address issues of online platforms due to the cross border nature of the services involved.  That is not to say we should not do it, but this vehicle is not the best place for doing so.  This issue needs to be addressed at EU level and for that reason, I do not propose to accept these amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600043#VV01400","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1537978200,"counter":500,"content":"<p>The information I have directly contradicts the information the Minister has just given.

As Deputy Michael Healy-Rae said, the safest place to consume alcohol, tea, coffee, MiWadi, orange drinks or lemonade is in a respectable public house, where there are measures in place and where there are licences up behind the counters so that members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can come in and check it.  Publicans have to keep their house in order, and 99% of them do that.  However, we are literally closing those places down by virtue of this kind of ridiculous legislation. <\/p>  <p>  Are we going to put labelling onto meat products, sweets or boxes of Milk Tray?  If we leave out a bottle for Santa Claus will we have to put a warning on it to tell him that he cannot drink it because it might make him sick before he gets back to Lapland?  This is crazy stuff.  The legislation we are passing here is so regressive, so anti-work and anti-business it is frightening.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Kelly had a Bill earlier in the year which sought to allow small craft brewers - of which there are many in Tipperary -  to let people taste their products and purchase some of it while visiting the breweries.  I supported that Bill.  However, the same day, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, passed a Bill that would mean people would be punished if they even had a whiff of alcohol, if they even opened a bottle.  This is farcical.  We need joined-up thinking.  Our industries and pubs have served us well throughout the centuries, and have to be supported rather than destroyed.  We have gone over the top with regulation.  We are going to become a nanny state, telling citizens that we cannot do this or that.  There is an illicit and illegal trade already in place in this country, and if there is a hard border after Brexit, goodness knows what will happen.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle knows that better than anyone here.  <\/p>  <p>  We must have common sense at all times.  I heard my former colleague and good friend, Professor John Crown, on the radio yesterday.  He made the valid point that it is excessive drinking that causes damage to one's health, and we are not doing enough in schools and through the education system to educate people about that.  If anyone here seriously thinks that putting labels on the neck of a bottle will change-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600047#ZZ00300","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1537980300,"counter":523,"content":"<p>If I may interrupt, this amendment seeks to remove the word &quot;and&quot; from the section.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600047#ZZ00400","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1537980300,"counter":524,"content":"<p>Yes.

I go to many functions where free drink is available.  I attend many openings and many football matches.  There is a thing called choice.  I have been a pioneer for the past 40 years or so, but I do not have a problem with drink.  I do not want to drink, but I do not have a problem if other people drink.  People should not be pressurised to take alcohol.  My wife would take the odd glass of wine.  We have been married for 35 years, and I have seen her take perhaps ten glasses of wine in that period.  She takes a glass, and she enjoys it.  People have to take responsibility for their drinking.

That is what should be done.<\/p>  <p>  There is an idea out there that this is a blame game.  Like everything else, people have to start standing up for themselves.  I have heard this for years.  I managed football teams and businesses.  When someone is caught drinking and driving or taking too much drink there is always someone else to blame.  I believe it is time we stood up to that.  The main emphasis here is over-consumption, and my main concern is underage drinking.  If functions are giving out free drink to people who are underage those responsible should be prosecuted.  However, there is too much emphasis placed on blaming people.  In Dundalk and in County Louth there are many distilleries.  I love to visit distilleries.  I do not drink but I love seeing how the drink is manufactured.  It is fantastic.  When I go to these distilleries for a tour the first thing I am offered is a cup of tea or a scone.  They do not push drink into people.   <\/p>  <p>  We have to learn to say no, to take responsibility, and to stop blaming people.

In rural Ireland there is also something called a station, where mass is said in a house.  Each house's turn comes around after four or five years.  A few drinks are provided.  However, as the Deputy said, to take a drink or not is a person's choice.  I do not drink but I have nothing against those who do.  The word is \"moderation\".

One of the key indicators of the level of harm caused by alcohol misuse is alcohol-related presentations at health facilities.  There are three alcohol-related deaths in Ireland every single day.  Alcohol currently places a huge burden on our health service, taking up an estimated 1,500 hospital beds in this country every night.  According to the Health Research Board, HRB, &euro;1.5 billion was spent on hospital discharges in 2012.  This does not include the significant costs incurred by our emergency departments, which often bear the brunt of our excessive alcohol consumption . <\/p><p>We believe that in any consideration of the Bill or sections thereof the Minister should therefore have regard to the data from the health services relating to alcohol presentations at health facilities, as these can provide us with important routine information on the health harms due to alcohol, as well as the impact on the health services themselves.  I understand that the Minister has included sections related to health and social factors but we believe that the collation of these data is particularly relevant.  Alcohol-related incidents and presentations from alcohol-related illness have a significant cost to our health service in resources, beds and staff.  Given that we are legislating and making a public policy decision on alcohol, we believe that these considerations must be taken into account.<\/p><p>I urge those Deputies who have an interest in this to think long and hard before they interrupt or try to delay this legislation.

The problem is that if they cause harm and no account is taken of that harm, society is unbalanced.  We have not accounted for the negative externalities within public policy.

As I said to him directly, I know he put down these amendments in an effort to improve the Bill with respect to labelling and notification, and not for any other motive, as I saw wrongly attributed to him.  As I already mentioned to Deputy Donnelly, amendment No. 8 relates to the requirement to have the health information on the labels of alcohol products in Irish and English.  I am conscious that in order to achieve the objectives of the Bill, the provisions in it must be workable.  We need to maintain the balance between what is beneficial to our citizens for the protection of their health - this is a piece of public health legislation and a new departure relating to alcohol - and the new obligations being placed on our commercial operators.  The balance is to promote public health in a way that is proportionate.<\/p><p>We are asking businesses to work with us in changing our products and providing health information for the very first time.  We are moving from a position where today there is no health information on the product to adding six new pieces of information.  I understand this is a new approach and it will bring new burdens for business.  If a requirement is added that information must be in two languages - Deputy Harty's point is valid - we will need different fonts and there is the potential to distort what we are trying to do in putting very clear information out there.<\/p><p>There is a further practical reality that is the main reason I am not in a position to propose accepting amendment No. 8.  It is a reality referenced by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.  If we were to make any changes to the requirement for health information on the labels to be in Irish it could delay the passage of the legislation through the Oireachtas and the enactment of the Bill.  It would not affect the labels.  Any additional requirement relating to labels would have to be notified and assessed at an EU level before enactment.<\/p><p>Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v suggests that either I or perhaps the Government of which I am a part do not care for the Irish language, which he of course knows not to be true.  Nonetheless, in addition to the practical concern I am conscious that we must in a public health Bill ensure that information on the label is clear and effective.  It must be the paramount objective.  A study was commissioned from Am&aacute;rach Research in August 2015 to provide recommendations on how to best communicate critical information through labelling on the risk relating to alcohol consumption.  There must be an evidence base to this and we must ensure this is an effective way of communicating.  The research indicates that the inclusion of the information in another language on labels served to confuse the message being relayed.<\/p><p>There are practical reasons arising from the EU's standstill period and we would not be able to pass the legislation as a result.  It is something Deputy Donnelly and I have discussed.  I do not propose to accept amendment No. 8.  However, in the interests of compromise and accepting exactly what Deputy Donnelly is trying to do, I propose to accept amendments Nos. 10 and 13.  These are sensible amendments and they require health information to be available in Irish as well as English on notices in licensed premises and on websites where alcohol products are sold online.  I have also discussed with the HSE through my Department's own website, <i>www.askaboutalcohol.ie<\/i>, and all the relevant information there will also be included in the Irish language.  I genuinely accept the importance of the Irish language and giving it prominence in the discussion.  I propose the compromise would be that it would not be on the labels but on the website and the notices.<\/p><p>I have done a legal check on Deputy Donnelly's point about previous court cases.  The very clear legal advice available to me is that the case was different because tobacco warnings related to an EU directive and what we are doing tonight is pioneering.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 14 proposes that data from health services and alcohol-related presentations at health facilities should be taken into account when making regulations on the health warnings and information.  It is Deputy O'Reilly's amendment and the idea is that we would take that into consideration on labels, notices in licensed premises and websites that sell alcohol products.  This amendment is very much the same model she used with regard to the minimum unit pricing discussion we had only a few minutes ago.  It is a sensible amendment and I propose its acceptance.  Therefore, I propose we accept amendments Nos. 10, 13 and 14.  I am not in a position to accept amendment No. 8, with the most important reason being the practicalities involved in getting this legislation passed.  There is also the concern about clarity of messaging on labels.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600050#CCC02400","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1537982700,"counter":582,"content":"<p>If the Minister analyses what he said-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600051#DDD00100","speaker":"1312"},{"type":"speech","time":1537982700,"counter":583,"content":"<p>I do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600051#DDD00200","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1537982700,"counter":584,"content":"<p>-----he will realise just how extraordinarily ignorant it is.  For example, what the Minister stated here today is that were the European Union to bring in an directive, following his good lead, to the effect that this had to be done across Europe, suddenly the label would become non-effective in Ireland because it would have to be then bilingual.  The directive that forced it on the cigarette packages would force it here.<\/p>  <p>  Supposing Belgium decided tomorrow to follow the good example of Ireland - as the Minister will be aware, Belgium is a rigidly bilingual society in terms of such matters - the Minister is stating the label would have no effect, that it would put everybody astray and that it would not work because it would be in French and Flemish.

It is only in Ireland that the Minister's argument washes as being a cogent one.<\/p>  <p>  I certainly agree with my colleague that because of the Minister's carelessness in this issue and his attitude, which is that we love the Irish language but will not do anything practical for it, we have no choice because none of us want to hold up this Bill.

We all acknowledge that alcohol is a major problem right around the country.  Most families, including my own, have been touched by problems with alcohol.  However, there is being realistic and unrealistic.  The reality is I did not drink Heineken because I saw the Heineken Cup.  However, some members in my family had a problem with alcohol and I thank God that I do not.<\/p><p>The Minister may correct me if I am wrong.  I spoke to members of the legal profession and the European Union controls the food and drink regulations in respect of labelling.  If we are being honest around this House, we will be aware that putting this cancer label on it will not end up being legal.  Secretly, when one talks to people around this House, many admit that it will not happen.  We are running down a road.  Do we move then to every bit of processed food, to sweets and to everything else where the same risk is involved because there is evidence that too much of all these other things causes cancer as well?<\/p><p>The other side of it is that there are breweries around this country.  Everyone around the House supported the Bill Deputy Kelly brought in to help those in rural areas who set up microbreweries.<\/p><p>For those breweries to put one label on bottles they sell in Ireland and not on others will be a fiasco.  Something of the order of 850,000 Yanks and people from other countries are coming here.  They will look at this and say \"My God, I will never touch this again in Ireland\" while the same product is exported to their countries with nothing on it.  What we are trying to do in respect of our own bit of employment is unbelievable.  The nub of the issue is whether we are going down a road where every item we eat or drink will need to carry a warning.  Too many minerals are bad for a person.  The same is true of sweets so we had better put a warning on sweet packets.  We had better put warnings on every single thing or else nothing.  I know the Minister is straightforward.  He knows that the legal opinion and the attitude in Europe is very questionable and it does not appear that this will be a runner.  We are going to come to this House, therefore, put it to a vote and then decide a few months later.  This will be in the balance for three years.  We are in between the devil and the deep blue sea.  We do not know what will happen.<\/p> <p> The Minister should row back on this until we have clarification one way or the other.  I am concerned about small businesses, especially the small breweries.  Are we targeting them?  Are we leaving ourselves open?  It is fine if the Minister is going to say that this causes cancer but in respect of how many things will we be obliged to do this?  Will we have to do it in the context of meat, sweets and every other thing?   One cannot have one thing different to others when there is proof that too much of anything, as Deputy Michael Healy-Rae said earlier, causes problems for everybody.  This is the one thing I would ask the Minister to reconsider.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600051#DDD03100","speaker":"1341","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537983300,"counter":614,"content":"<p>The purpose of the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill is to tackle alcohol misuse, underage drinking and overall consumption.  It is in no one's interest to see alcohol products misused.  I support the overall objective of the Bill but I have a difficulty with a small number of provisions, including that relating to the cancer warning. This label will destroy the reputation of Irish products which compete globally.  Consumer warnings should be accurate.  A general warning against excessive consumption of alcohol makes more sense than mentioning one disease.<\/p>  <p>  It is vital that the Government invests in public information campaigns and, in particular, education programmes targeted at young people.  The HSE has a low-risk drinking guideline and it is important that we raise awareness of this among people.  This should be done before introducing a cancer warning on alcohol products.  The Bill already provides for a general health warning on alcohol products that is separate from the cancer warning, the pregnancy warning and other mandatory labelling.  Focusing on one health issue, namely, cancer, does not give a full or accurate picture to help consumers make informed choices about their drinking.  As previous speakers noted, although the cancer labelling only applies to alcohol in this Bill there is a risk that cancer warnings will then be extended to other Irish food products such as processed meat, red meat, bacon and smoked fish, which is a major concern to the food and drink industry as a whole.<\/p>  <p>  I am disappointed that no debate took place in the Seanad on Fifth Stage.<\/p>  <p> Has the Department of Health supplied a scientific file to the European Commission to justify the introduction of cancer warning labels?  The Minister has stated that this provision will not come into effect for three years after the point at which the European Commission approves the labels.  This means that the European Commission must approve the labels and then it will be three to five years before they become compulsory.<\/p>  <p>  We need to have a conversation about where we are going from here and its impact on small breweries and distilleries especially.  As I said earlier, we do need to combat the abuse of alcohol.  Imposing a cancer warning on Irish products will harm the reputation of Irish producers and Ireland's reputation as a nation known for producing high-quality food and drink and will denigrate Irish products on the global market.  No other country in the world has done this.  This Government is also busy encouraging distillery and brewery tourism because it knows the importance of this for rural development.  I have visited breweries and distilleries in my county, Louth, including Cooley Distillery, which is located only ten miles from Dundalk and which has been in operation since 1987.  It employs over 70 people directly, and more indirectly, in an area where employment is limited.  The company has invested &euro;14 million since 2012 and has increased its shipment by 400% since 2011.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome two things.  The Minister assured me that there would be no issue with directional signs to promote breweries and distilleries to tourists.  It is good news especially for my home town of Dundalk and the Great Northern Distillery and Cooley Distillery.  I also welcome that the labelling requirement will not apply to export products.  I realise that there is not a family in this country that has not had experience of cancer.  It is an awful disease and I agree that every effort must be made to destroy it.  My job is to represent my constituents and I am not going to make any apology for it.  I am a very health conscious person but I think that this is a step too far.  The one thing I like about the Minister is that he is approachable and a man of his word.  As a Fine Gael Deputy, I am disappointed with what is happening but I also respect what the Minister is doing.  I appreciate the two commitments given to me this evening by the Minister in respect of exports and directional signs.<\/p>  <p>  I am a firm believer that one's health is one's wealth.  The mere mention of the word \"cancer\" sends a shiver down my spine.  However, people must take responsibility and sometimes say \"No\".

I welcome the targeted and evidence-based measures that will help us to address these issues.  I would like the Minister to help us along the way by answering a number of questions as part of my process of obtaining an understanding of the right way to finalise this Bill.  I do not want to delay it.  There is a perception that people who have problems with the Bill want to delay it.  I see no reason why this Bill cannot go forward tonight if some of the issues that concern us are addressed.  I am also enough of a realist to know that democracy reigns.  I have no doubt that when the vote is held in this House that the Bill will be passed so let us start from there.  In the interests of democracy, as Deputy Fitzpatrick noted, we have an obligation to represent those in work and, equally, those who may have issues with alcohol abuse.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to put two questions to the Minister.  Will he clarify his belief regarding the timing of the introduction of this labelling?  Will he clarify the position regarding the warning comprising one third of the printed material on labels?  I have not been informed as to whether this stipulation has been removed from the legislation.<\/p>  <p>  I refer to the knock-on effect of this on producers, especially the small producers to whom Deputy Fitzmaurice and others referred.  In the past two years, ten microbreweries have set up operations in my constituency.  These are in addition to the larger ones mentioned by Deputy Fitzpatrick and their owners are seriously concerned about the costs that might come into play.<\/p>  <p>  I want to make something clear.  Those of us who are debating this issue - and I can certainly speak for myself in this regard - are not seeking to stall the process.  I will support the Bill but I want reassurances about the outcome.<\/p><p>Imposing cancer warnings on alcohol products will affect people in my constituency.  I will name one microbrewery - Listoke - which is employing 14 people.  It is one of ten microbreweries established in the past ten years to which I just referred.  Nobody should doubt that the reputational damage which will result from the requirement to put these labels on certain products will cause a problem for this country's drinks industry.  I have said publicly that if a product is sold without a label in our airports and the same product on a shelf somewhere in Ireland has a label on it, anybody with common sense who is in opposition and who wants to promote their product will display the two items and ask what in the name of God the Irish people are trying to do by telling people in other countries that the product is not carcinogenic and telling their own people that it is.  I have a difficulty with that.  No other country has taken such a step.  We have played a pioneering role in many other instances.  I refer, for example, to introducing the plastic bag tax and the smoking ban.  We are entitled to a level playing field.  I do not believe this Bill will do that for us.  I am concerned about it.  That is why I am speaking this evening.<\/p> <p> While I do not want to be repetitive, I have to remind Deputy Fitzpatrick that we already have warnings in relation to pregnancy and other issues.  People generally know that excess use of alcohol will harm their health.  The reality of this legislative process is that minimum pricing will help to stop the type of binge drinking that is happening.  It would have been preferable if the Government had stuck to its original commitment to include a general warning.  I am a realist with regard to what will be the outcome.  Sometimes a whip is cracked in that regard.<\/p> <p> As I stated when this Bill was being debated some time ago, it makes a laugh when we talk about the Irish language, which I fully support.  It could be some help.  Whiskey is called uisce beatha or the water of life.  We demonise drink - and rightly so when taken to excess - but the producers of the products we are talking about have been demonised as well.  There is a conflict.  As others are saying, the reality is that we have choices to make.  Ultimately, people have to make those choices.  It is important for this House to legislate to protect those who are not able to make choices.  In that respect, I fully support the Bill, but I am concerned that the Minister needs to provide details of the timing of the introduction of these measures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600052#EEE00300","speaker":"1332","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537983900,"counter":617,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600053#FFF00200","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1537983900,"counter":618,"content":"<p>Those involved with breweries need to be given an opportunity to prepare for the new regime.

They believe there are other ways in which we could be tackling this problem and working to make sure our young people understand the effects of extreme drinking.  We tend to take the easy and sensational route.  We want to pat ourselves on the back and say that Ireland will be the first country in the world to put cancer labelling on bottles, instead of doing the real work that is needed to tackle underage drinking, a matter about which I am more worried.<\/p>  <p>  When I listened to Deputies talking about cancer labelling in English and cancer labelling in Irish, I was afraid that before we finish there will be a requirement to have a little booklet hanging onto every bottle.  The way we are going, a person will have to read such a booklet before he or she can buy alcohol.  There is no common sense.  There is not one bit of common sense going on in here.<\/p>  <p>  I do not know when the last time I took a drink was.  Maybe it was three weeks, a month or six weeks ago.  I cannot remember.

That will not be seen in his or her own country.  All we are doing is making a mockery of ourselves and damaging an industry that creates a great deal of employment for people.  I think we have forgotten all about it.<\/p>  <p>  I wonder whether democracy is going out the window here.  From what I gather, people have been gagged inside here.

I am sure we have all seen it at first hand inside or outside our families.  At the same time, we have to be reasonable.  Below-cost selling is part of the problem.  I was in a shop the other day where one could buy two cans of lager for the price of one bottle of coke.  It cost &euro;2.50 for a bottle of coke and &euro;2.50 for two cans of lager.  If that is not creating problems, I do not know what is.  It is something that really needs to be addressed.<\/p>  <p>  I do not think cancer labelling will stop people drinking.  Somebody asked me to get two packets of cigarettes the other day and take them out into the country where I was going.  Thank God I stopped smoking 15 years ago.  When I got the cigarettes, I saw the pictures on the packets depicting what cigarettes can do when they lead to cancer.  I asked the person for whom I was getting the cigarettes whether he had looked at the pictures.  He said he does not pass any heed of them.  My God above, if that type of warning does not frighten people, I do not know what will.  In that context, I would like to get clarification on the requirement to divide the label into sections of one third and two thirds.<\/p><p>Since 2011, the only jobs that came to my home town in County Sligo were those created by two young men who started a microbrewery.  Today, they employ 30 people.  The product is not sold very much in this country but it is being exported.  It is doing very well and the company hopes to increase the number of staff by 20.  In Drumshanbo a man took a chance on buying a closed-down jam factory and started making gin, Gunpowder Gin.  The distillery employs over 30 people today.  The man intends to employ many more.  The product is sold across Ireland and in 50 countries globally.  This is the current position on small breweries and distilleries.  In Sligo, on the shores of Lough Gill, there is a proposal for a distillery.  In fact, the whiskey is there already.  There is to be a &euro;25 million investment, which is to create at least 100 jobs.  I am making these points because of the economic benefit of microbreweries and distilleries in the area I represent.  There is another brewery starting out in Sligo and it currently has 15 staff.<\/p> <p> We need to have a balanced approach to labelling.  On the one hand, the Government is encouraging new distilleries and whiskey-related tourism, seeing it as an important driver of rural development.  It is and there is no doubt that it means significant growth for the economy.  Some 2.5 million visitors visited distilleries and breweries right across the country this year.  In my home town, there was an open day at the brewery.  Irish Rail ran a special train and 1,500 people turned up at the small brewery.  To be quite honest, I do not understand it.  I do not know what the people see in it but it is a growing tourism business.  We should not do anything that would do any damage to that.<\/p> <p> I fully accept the damage alcohol does.  As Deputy Peter Fitzpatrick said, people have choices.  While 99.9% of people can go out and enjoy a drink, there are those who cannot.  Unfortunately it takes a grip on a percentage of people and causes havoc in houses across the country.  I ask the Minister for clarification on the two thirds&ndash;one third ratio on the labels that will be put on bottles.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600053#FFF00900","speaker":"1344","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537984500,"counter":626,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the presence in the Gallery of Senator Frances Black.  We all know she has done fantastic work on this issue.<\/p>  <p>  The point has been made that we are all aware of the damage alcohol causes, yet in the same breath people say they do not really want to take the measures necessary to do something about it.  It is a little shocking to me that people need to be reminded but this Bill is called a Public Health (Alcohol) Bill.  \"Health\" is the key word.<\/p>  <p>  For the information of people who might not be aware, alcohol is classified as a group 1 carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer because there is a proven causal link between alcohol and several types of cancers.  Alcohol consumption can cause cancer of the mouth, pharynx, larynx, oesophagus, liver, bowel and female breast.  All of these cancers show evidence of a dose&ndash;response relationship.  The risk of cancer increases steadily in line with greater volumes of alcohol consumption.  When we say we are all aware of the harm that can be caused by alcohol, we need to name it and acknowledge it, and then we need to take steps to reduce it wherever we can.<\/p>  <p>  In this State, the proportion of alcohol-related deaths from cancer is higher than the European average.  That suggests we may need to take more measures than others in Europe or perhaps that we should not be ashamed of being able to provide a little leadership on this issue.  Research has shown that alcohol is associated with approximately 900 new cancer cases and 500 cancer deaths annually.  More than half of all head and neck cancers and 12% of breast cancers in Ireland were found to be associated with alcohol consumption.  As one of the Deputies pointed out, when we see or hear the word \"cancer\" we shudder.  That is the point of the labelling.  It is to ensure that people consider before having a drink what they might be doing.  People can make an informed choice.  I am very proud to support the idea of providing people with the information they might need so they can make an informed choice.<\/p>  <p>  Despite the demonstrated links between alcohol consumption and ill health, alcohol continues to be advertised heavily as though it were not a toxic substance.  It is assumed that consumers have access to the information that they require to make informed choices.  The debate here this evening proves that more information is indeed required.  In numerous studies and journals published by the British General Medical Council, it was found that providing detailed warnings about cancer risk and alcohol products was a viable means of increasing public awareness of the health risks associated with alcohol consumption.  In one study, responses to the cancer statement were neutral to favourable, indicating that they were unlikely to encounter high levels of negative reaction from the community if introduced on alcoholic beverages.  Females, younger respondents and those with higher levels of education generally found the statements to be more believable, convincing and personally relevant.  Therefore, cancer warning statements on alcoholic beverages constitute a potential means of increasing awareness about the relationship between alcohol consumption and cancer risk.  We should be able to agree that this is one step we very definitely need to take, and we should support it.

I support the objectives of this Bill.  I am very aware of the culture and difficulties we have with alcohol.  We are all very aware of them.  It is condescending and downright disingenuous to assert that we are ignorant of that fact; we are not.  What we are saying here, however, is that part of this Bill lacks common sense.  Many of us here are from rural counties.  We have stated quite clearly the serious impact that labelling will have on businesses and on our industry, including breweries, right across this country.  The Minister is not taking that on board.  If the label goes on, will it be extended to our food sector?  Will it severely damage our agrifood sector, which is already under tremendous strain with the onset of Brexit?  The proposal lacks common sense.  It is not well thought out.  Somebody thought it would be a good idea to include the labelling proposal.<\/p>  <p>  It is very unfair to accuse us here of being detached or disconnected.  We all have families with alcohol problems and family members who have had or have cancer.  It is downright disingenuous to accuse us of being ignorant of that fact.  We are very well aware it.  We have been pragmatic and reasonable here, and we are just putting to the Minister the idea that cancer warnings on labels will not have an impact.  We need to look to our education system and develop programmes through it.  There should be more programmes run by the HSE.  We need more of these if we are to tackle this issue.<\/p>  <p>  Numerous studies have been conducted to ascertain links between alcohol and cancer.  Like every single person here, I welcome that research.  Despite numerous attempts to establish cause and correlation, in many cases there has been an absence of scientific evidence to substantiate the assertions.

I do not believe we will tackle the problems we have through crude, misleading and perhaps downright untruthful health warnings on our alcohol products.  There is every reason to believe that this proposal is doomed to fail at EU level.  That has been said by some people in the Minister's Department so let us deal with that.  Why bring forward a provision in a Bill that is doomed to fail?  Deputy Harris is the Minister for Health so surely he can make a good call on this.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to mention briefly the impact these measures will have on the distilleries and breweries that have diversified in recent years to become visitor centres.  We have heard many Government Deputies talking about breweries and, indeed, we have seen them photographed at the opening of many breweries and distilleries throughout the country.  Now the Minister is trying to destroy them.  In recent years we have built our national tourism strategy on visitor experiences rather than tourist destinations.  The Irish food and drink experience has now become an internationally traded tourism message and many small breweries and distilleries have diversified to incorporate visitor centres and the tasting experience.  These operations are not primary alcohol wholesale or retail outlets yet they are at risk of being caught in a legislative net that never set out to trap them.  Parts of this Bill have not been thought through properly.  Derogations must be made to protect these visitor centres, many of which are a living history interpretation of age old crafts.<\/p>  <p>  These centres have become important ingredients in the development of tourism activity in rural locations.  We are depending on this.  Our local economies are dependent on it and they will collapse, not that people in Dublin appear to care anyway.  The centres have become a vital contributor to rural economies.  In my constituency of Offaly, Tullamore Dew employs 120 people between the distillery at Clonminch and the visitor centre in the town.  It attracts approximately 45,000 visitors.  It was a huge investment project.  I do not wish to see these positive developments impacted in a negative manner by sections in this Bill pertaining to misleading labelling and signage constraints, which will be dealt with later.  These sections lack common sense and could do irreparable damage to the local economy of many rural counties.  The Minister is here to represent rural Ireland as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600055#HHH00700","speaker":"1440"},{"type":"speech","time":1537985100,"counter":636,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the presence of the previous Minister of State, Deputy Corcoran Kennedy, who had a role prior to the Minister in bringing this Bill to the House.  I have been a Member of the House for a couple of years and this was one of the first Bills brought before us for discussion.  We sent it to the Seanad and I assumed that what was sent there would return as more or less what it was with regard to some of the items, until this issue of the labelling and cancer wording arose.  I acknowledge that the purpose of the Bill was to tackle alcohol misuse, underage drinking and overall consumption.<\/p>  <p>  Everybody can go into detail about how much alcohol creates cancer.  Only a few months ago a tax levy was imposed on sugar.  Sugar now has a health warning.  We did not put tax on sugar because it was a premium product but because of a health issue and to prevent obesity.  Obesity, unchecked, can lead to death.  That is a fact.  However, are there warnings about taking sugar in moderation on the packets?  That is what will happen.  Other products have been mentioned and meat could be the next target.<\/p>  <p>  I am trying to suggest that there be some fairness and consideration.  The Minister referred to signposting in public premises and pubs.  Will it serve a purpose?  I doubt that it will serve any purpose in the main pubs in Dublin because they are so packed the people would not get a chance to look at the walls.  In rural Ireland, however, the pubs are closing every day.  Since 2005, 25% of the pubs in County Cork have closed.  Are we trying to put up more barriers to people going into these pubs to have a couple of drinks?  We passed the Road Traffic (Amendment) Act which ensures that anybody caught driving while over the limit is penalised.  What other penalties are we going to put on our rural pubs to deter people from going into them?  The Minister will have to clarify where the signage will be if this Bill is passed.  Will it be inside the front door - \"Do not come in here for a drink or you will get cancer\"?  That is just with regard to rural pubs.<\/p>  <p>  Most of my colleagues have referred to those not on the prohibition side.  I respect the Members who tabled the amendments.  It is ironic that in the last couple of weeks the Members who have introduced amendments to delete something or insert something in favour of relaxing how drink is treated have been castigated in the national press for delaying the Bill.  Before we discussed these amendments other Members of the House were delaying the Bill because they wanted to sweeten it more for themselves and to play to some gallery.  I am talking about common sense here, not political correctness as might be the case.  Perhaps I will be corrected on that but we are using the democratic process to ensure that a fair Bill is eventually signed by Uachtar&aacute;n na h&Eacute;ireann and that it can be implemented for the well-being of the people of this country.  However, it must be at a respectable level.  We cannot go over the top.<\/p>  <p>  How can we have a Minister for Health promoting cancer signs on drink bottles in his office while elsewhere in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and probably in the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation Ministers are jetting around the country giving grants to open distilleries and microbreweries?  We have the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine jetting abroad to promote drinks, which are not labelled, beverages and food.  Back home, emerald Ireland is like Colombia.  We can produce the cocaine but let the world suffer the consequences of it.  That is what we are trying to tell the world.  People can drink our drink abroad but they cannot drink it in Ireland because it will kill them.  Using the analogy of Colombia might be a little too extreme but that is a fact.  I heard last week that the Colombians have increased their cocaine production because they have markets throughout the world for it.  I know that it is killing people.<\/p>  <p>  In my backyard there are both types of industry, micro and large scale.  Irish Distillers has grown tremendously over the last number of years.  It provides jobs.  It also provides a premium income for tillage farmers.  This year the yields from tillage might have decreased a little because of the drought but those who supply Irish Distillers and Heineken Ireland are lucky enough to get a premium price for their grain and it ensures they make a living.  We could be jeopardising all of that.  Irish Distillers is growing fast.  At present, there is a rumour that it might be thinking about relocating to another site, not just for storage but for another distillery because the capacity of its current location is limited.<\/p><p>There is a town in east Cork near Youghal that has been devastated by job losses down through the years.  In fairness, Governments have tried to secure replacement jobs but they have had no success.  As mentioned by some of my colleagues, rural Ireland will be forever dependent on indigenous industry, including micro-breweries and distilleries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600055#HHH00800","speaker":"1278","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537985700,"counter":638,"content":"<p>The Deputy must conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600056#JJJ00200","speaker":"1332"},{"type":"speech","time":1537985700,"counter":639,"content":"<p>I ask for the Chair's indulgence as I have not spoken too much on the Bill before now.

However, I am not happy with the labelling measure, particularly the inclusion of the word \"cancer\" on labels.  A lot of people dread the word \"cancer\", particularly those who have had it.  I am a survivor of cancer.  It is a word that instils dread in people.  I do not believe we need to go as far as including the word \"cancer\" on alcohol labels.  I would accept a warning to the effect that alcohol damages health but the word \"cancer\" is too severe.  I ask the Minister to reconsider the use of that word as the mere mention of \"cancer\" causes fear in people, particularly people who have had cancer.  One would need a barrel sized label if we were to put on it all of the illnesses caused by excessive drinking.  There is such a thing as self-control.  Most people know how much alcohol they should consume.  What we are doing now is demonising alcohol.  One would get the impression from this debate that if one takes a drink one is a bad person.  Millions of people around the world enjoy a drink and do not drink excessively.  Some people have a drink with a meal, on their way home on a Friday evening or when they go out on a Sunday night.  I come from rural Ireland.  Most people in rural Ireland enjoy a pint or two of Guinness and a chat in the pub on a Saturday night.  If this provision is passed the labels on alcohol will state that drink causes cancer.  This is not necessary.<\/p>  <p>  The question as to why are we doing this has been asked already.  Even if it is passed here, it could be refuted in Europe.  If that happens it could be three years before it comes into force.  Ireland is becoming a nanny state and a dictatorship.  We are deciding how people are to live their lives, what they can do and what they cannot do.  This provision will take the pleasure out of drinking alcohol if done in the right quantity.  Alcoholics and excessive drinkers will not take any notice of the labels on bottles.  This measure will not help address the issue of excessive drinking.  I ask the Minister to pull back from using the word \"cancer\" and to include only the phrase that drink can cause damage to one's health.<\/p>  <p>  I am also concerned about the proposed signage in pubs.  We are hypocritical in Ireland in that we will be serving alcohol here with a label saying it causes cancer while only half an hour away and across the Irish Sea people will be able to get the same drink with no such warning on it.  This is hypocritical.  It is also uncompetitive in that Irish companies will have to bear this cost.  There is no labelling of this sort in any other place in the world.  There is a need for commonsense in this regard.  All over the world, people will be able to buy a bottle of Jameson, Paddy or brands made in Ireland and not have this labelling on it but when they come to Ireland it will be on every bottle of alcohol they see.  We are becoming a nanny state.  We are dictating to people how to live their lives, what they can and cannot do.  That is not our role.<\/p>  <p>  I accept the we need to tackle excessive drinking but this is not the way to go about it.  There are micro-breweries in many parts of Ireland.  There are two start-up distilleries in Carlow and Kilkenny.  In bringing in this excessive law, we are putting them at a disadvantage.

Elected representatives must do everything they can to protect those jobs and that is what we are attempting to do and will continue to try to do.  We are elected to make sure the Government is aware that what it is doing is wrong.  There is no necessity in the world for this measure.<\/p>  <p>  We all want to tackle the problem of harmful and underage drinking, which was the purpose of the Bill when introduced a number of years ago but it has now deviated from that objective in terms of the labelling provisions and what is proposed for supermarkets and so on.  No other country in the world has mandatory cancer warnings on alcohol products.  This measure applies a stigma to products made in Ireland and damages our reputation as a country that produces recognised quality products of international standing.  The reputational damage to this category could be huge in Ireland and in export markets, undoing all the hard work of recent years.  Several foods such as red meat, sausages, bacon and ham have been classified as carcinogenic by the International Agency for Research on Cancer.  If Ireland requires the inclusion of cancer warnings on alcohol it is likely that similar requirements will be introduced for foods, which is of serious concern to Irish food processors.  It is about everything in moderation.  Alcohol in moderation does no harm to anybody.  Will this measure stop people who drink excessively?  It will not.  It is a gimmick on the part of the Minister for Health and the Government to make people think they are doing something about excessive drinking.  This measure will not stop underage or excessive drinking, which is what we started out to do, but we have now moved away from that.<\/p><p>People have drunk alcohol for years and drinking plays an important role in sustaining socially supportive friendship networks, improving happiness and combating loneliness and isolation.

I lost two brothers, two first cousins and many more people to cancer. <\/p>  <p>  While the Bill may be well intentioned, including this amendment, it has crossed the line of common sense and understanding.  We are trying to deal with the detrimental effect of ill health but no impact analysis was carried out on the adverse effect this legislation might have on the economy, especially in rural areas but also in urban areas.  I regularly visit Bray in the Minister's county where I go to a few hostelries the Minister frequents himself and I see a host of craft beers from Wicklow, including the town of Bray.  Thankfully, every county now has craft beers.  We are trying to encourage the spirit of entrepreneurship and encourage people to have the courage to become self-employed and to get local enterprise offices, LEOs, and county enterprise boards to support these businesses to create employment in rural towns and villages and in the countryside.  We must continue to do that.  Another speaker I heard earlier referred to Ministers turning up to launch new breweries.

Labelling will have a terrible impact.  We fought very hard in the programme for Government for rural-proofing of legislation and we are passing legislation here that is not in any way rural-proofed but is anti-rural and also totally anti-work.  I am supporting the man or woman who earns a day's pay.  I hear the Taoiseach saying he wants to support people who get up early in the morning.  These people get up very early.  They put their hands in their pockets to invest in the site, restore old buildings and breweries and get some funding.  It is not easy to get funding and planning permission and get through the strict regime that applies to the selling of alcohol and craft beers.  It is right that this has to be regulated.  These people sometimes go without wages to try to get a company off the ground.  The number of microbreweries has mushroomed.  I mentioned earlier Deputy Kelly's Bill last year to allow craft breweries to sell their products on site.  We all supported that but legislation but this Bill is the direct opposite of that.  It proposes placing labels on bottles and in premises and installing barriers at the entrance to off-licence areas of shops.  I am not in favour of shops having too much access when it comes to alcohol.<\/p>  <p>  We are not tackling the issues we should tackle.  For probably seven or eight budgets now I have made submissions seeking the introduction of a capping charge.  Vintners and others want such a charge.  For example, two dozen cans or bottles are being sold for &euro;18.  Deputy Danny Healy-Rae said that according to international research we are the most expensive country in Europe to buy alcohol over the counter in the pub, yet we will not support these pubs.  Why do we refuse in budget after budget to try to increase the price of alcohol sold in off-licences and shops, which is readily available to young people because unscrupulous older people buy it for them.  There are also younger people working in shops who are unable to resist the pressure to sell it to their peers.

We are going after the wrong area and this proposal will make a serious and negative impact on employment, production, businesses and people who want to be entrepreneurs and workers and get the job done.  We are not focusing on the major problem of young people drinking.  They are drinking on the streets and in fields and causing public order offences.  There is teenage drinking with taxis collecting alcohol and dropping at houses for teenagers to drink.<\/p>  <p>  We have gone down this road in a hurry to be the best boys in Europe.  I do not know what kudos we are trying to get but we are doing this without a proper analysis of the damage and destruction that this is doing and the benefits that we will get from it.

It will have negative repercussions on microbreweries, pubs and other outlets.  Pubs are an endangered species now.  We give different status to different groups.  We will have to give some kind of an ethnic status to the publicans because they are disappearing like snow off a ditch and we are passing legislation to close them down.  They always pay wages, rates and VAT and give employment.  Above all, they provide a place in many areas for functions to take place, whether after a funeral, engagement party or a match.  In many areas there are no function rooms apart from in the pub.  Publicans in many areas kept their lounges insured and paid rates on them to support the community.

Those who are making their views known are representing what they believe to be the best interests of their constituencies.  Fianna F&aacute;il's position is that we are supporting the inclusion in primary legislation of cancer labelling.  Why are we taking that position given there are strongly held views in the Chamber?  We have heard from Sinn F&eacute;in, Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il.  There are a number of questions we have to ask.  Is there a material risk of cancer associated with alcohol consumption or is it a marginal risk?  Are we talking about burnt toast or are we beginning to move into the realm of cigarettes?  Is it a material risk?  If it is a material risk, is it a known material risk?  How many people know?  If it is materially carcinogenic, do people know it is?  I do not mind saying in the Chamber that I did not know it was.  When I first heard about this amendment I thought it was nanny statism at work.  Are they going to start putting labels on rashers and telling me if I burn my toast I am eating it at my own risk?<\/p><p>I did some research and spoke to clinicians.  The figures I got back shook me.  They showed that 500 people die every year in this country from alcohol-related cancer.  That is about three times the number of people who die in this country every year on the roads, which is a number of tragic fatalities that gets a huge amount of investment and warnings and rightly so.  Three times more people die from alcohol-related cancers.<\/p><p>Then there is the question of whether this only applies to excessive drinkers and everybody else should be absolutely fine?  The data I was presented with indicate it is not fine for everybody else.  There are many data and many Members have them.  I will mention the increased risk of breast cancer or association with breast cancer.  On average, for every 10 g of alcohol consumed per day a woman's risk of breast cancer increases by 7%.  What does that mean?  It turns out that the average daily consumption of alcohol is 30 g.  The average consumption of alcohol in this country would therefore be associated with a 21% increase in the risk of breast cancer.  That is a material risk and it applies at average consumption levels.  The idea that we are in the world of rashers and burnt toast is not true.  The idea that a person has to be drinking ten pints a day for it to be associated with a risk of cancer is not true.  It is a material risk and that risk begins at low levels of alcohol consumption.  That answers the first question.  <\/p><p>Let us now discuss the second question.  Do people know that alcohol is carcinogenic?  I will move from data to anecdote, which always makes me a little bit nervous but I will do it anyway.  I asked friends about this when I got the data.  I asked them if they knew alcohol was carcinogenic.  The answer pretty much across the board was &quot;No.&quot;  I spoke to one friend who had a family association with cancer and she became upset when I gave her the facts.  One's genetic disposition is a factor and there are significant variables and complexity involved but if one is drinking the average amount, the data indicate that one will increase the risk of getting breast cancer by more than 20%.  She got very angry.  The idea that we would know this and not tell people in order that they can make an informed decision is not one I agree with.  Maybe I just know many people who do not know much about healthcare.  There was a tweet yesterday from a nurse called Laura.  It struck me because it summed up the question of whether people know.  I thought perhaps non-clinicians did not know but doctors and nurses knew.  Laura said: <\/p><blockquote>32 students attended my nurse triage clinic today &amp;amp; were asked about their usual intake.  Only 1\/32 [nurses] were aware that alcohol is a carcinogen!<\/blockquote><p>The answer to the second question about whether it is widely known that alcohol is associated with cancer would appear to be &quot;No, it is not widely known.&quot;  Is it a material risk?  Yes, it is.  Does the public know about it?  No, it does not.  Do many clinicians know about it?  I am going on one tweet but if we are to accept it, they do not know.  I apologise to all the clinicians who do know.  <\/p><p>The position we are taking is to support the inclusion of cancer in the primary legislation.  There are legitimate counter-arguments, including around hierarchies of diseases.  There were concerns about the EU's potential response and they, too, are legitimate.  My view is that the EU should accept this.  It is our business, our country and our public health.  If we, as the democratically elected Parliament, believe it is in the public interest to do this, the EU should respect that.  If it does not and we find ourselves in some position where we are boxed in legally, the Minister can bring forward a short miscellaneous Bill.  Let us not forget there is probably a four-year lead-in before this labelling will appear, which means there is ample time for a miscellaneous Bill, if necessary.  The risk to the progress of this is eminently within the powers of the Minister to deal with.  For that reason, we believe the cancer warning needs to be in the primary legislation.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600058#LLL00200","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speech","time":1537986900,"counter":675,"content":"<p>I commend the Minister on what he did over the weekend.

It would have undermined the science and the facts, which are what we need to hold true to.<br\/><br\/>People have been making spurious claims.  One Deputy said that the legislation does not try to question the cancer claim, and I commend the Chair on that.  The reality is that alcohol causes cancer of the mouth, the pharynx, the larynx, the oesophagus, the breast, the liver, the pancreas, the bowel and colorectal cancer.  Most people know somebody affected by these issues.  A recent <i>New York Times<\/i>article revealed that some of the national institutes of health receive much funding from the alcohol industry, trying to shape their studies in order that moderate drinking will be made to appear safe, to try to normalise it and inject that doubt into people's minds.  We need to send out a strong signal as a Parliament, and I am glad there is collective support on this.  Alcohol causes cancer, and we would be negligent not to tell people that.  Some people have mentioned toast, red meat and smoked salmon.  I urge the House to check the <i>British Medical Journal<\/i>, where there are 13,861 entries for alcohol and cancer.  In <i>The Lancet<\/i>, to which most people refer when it comes to science and evidence-based research, there are 25,048 references to alcohol and cancer.  They are the facts and that is the evidence.  <br\/><br\/>One person in the Chamber said that alcohol and loneliness are somehow inextricably and positively linked.  My colleague, Senator Swanick, did a good study on loneliness, and one will find the word &quot;alcohol&quot; is not mentioned in it as a positive impact for people living in rural Ireland in isolation with problems.  This is an attempt to try to create policy solutions to help rural Ireland, rather than going back to alcohol, which is the thing Deputy Danny Healy-Rae says solves every problem.

We need to deal with facts here, and that will not be the case.  It does not matter where that bottle came from, be it Scotland, America or anywhere.  It will have a label.  Every bottle sold on a shelf will have the same label, regardless of whether it was brewed in Dingle or in Edinburgh.  That is a fact.<\/p>  <p>  What is also a fact is the proven casual link between alcohol and certain types of cancer, which is based on research done by the International Agency for Research on Cancer.  That is a fact and one cannot dispute it.  I heard another Deputy tonight say that putting these labels on bottles will kill rural Ireland.  That is an opinion and not a fact.  It is a fact, however, that there were 500 cancer-related deaths last year due to alcohol.  That is a fact and not an opinion.  <\/p>  <p>  Deputy Chambers put it well when he said that this is not about telling people they should not drink or they cannot drink.  It is about giving them information in order that they can make informed decisions.  I do not drink or touch alcohol, but if I did I would like to have the information before I decided whether I wanted a drink.  Similarly, with cigarettes, which I smoke, there are warnings on the packets that I buy that inform me of the dangers.  I know what the dangers are and I make a choice based on the information given to me, and I am grateful for that because it is my decision and it is based on facts.  <\/p>  <p>  I do not know what the big argument is against this proposal.  One Deputy asked why we are the first in the world to do this.  Why not?  Why should we not be the first?  We are talking about tourists coming here who will get the impression that if they drink Irish whiskey they might get cancer but if they drink Scottish whisky they will not get cancer.  It is ridiculous.  When this legislation passes, if this amendment stays as it is in order that the cancer label remains within the primary legislation, it would be a good day, not only for this House and this country but for everyone because we will inform not only our own citizens but also the thousands of tourists who will visit.  We are educating people in this country but also further afield, which is something we should be proud of.  Rather than asking why we will be the first, I ask why not?  I am proud that we will be the first.  Many decisions made in this Chamber through the years have not benefitted citizens and have had untold effects on their physical and mental health, but this is one which will not do that.

We are all aware of excessive alcohol intake and its effect on society and people, on their physical and mental health, as well as the social effects that alcohol has.  We are all aware of people who developed cirrhosis of the liver, and we think that is the only physical illness that alcohol will cause in people.  People are not aware, however, that alcohol causes cancer.  The most important part of this legislation is to educate people that cancer is a real risk if they drink alcohol.  Less is best.  We will not eliminate the consumption of alcohol but we must let people know that if they drink alcohol to excess they have a higher risk of developing cancer.  The purpose is not to stop people drinking; we will obviously never do that.<\/p><p>We do, however, want people to drink sensibly and to drink within the recommended limits.  For a male, the recommended limit is for 17 units of alcohol a week and, for a female, it is 11 units per week.  A pint is two units, a glass of wine is one unit and a bottle of wine is eight units.  We can work out ourselves how many units we drink in a week.  If we stay within those limits, the likelihood of developing cancer is reduced by 50%.  The risk of cancer will never be eliminated and we are never going to eliminate the consumption of alcohol.  We are trying in this Bill to educate people so they are aware that if they drink sensibly the risk of cancer will be reduced.  It will never be eliminated and that is not the purpose of the Bill.  It is to try to reduce the toll that alcohol takes in the form of cancer.<\/p> <p> There are 900 cancer related illnesses diagnosed every year, starting from the mouth, the throat, the oesophagus, the bowel, the liver and also including breast cancer.  Several Members have outlined them.  Of those 900 illnesses diagnosed, 500 will die every year.  This Bill has been in the D&aacute;il or the Oireachtas for more than 1,000 days.  If we work out the mathematics, that is 2,700 people who have developed an alcohol related cancer and 1,500 who have died from an alcohol related cancer since this Bill was introduced into the D&aacute;il.  Every day this Bill is delayed is taking a toll on someone's life.  Cancer is a risk.  We all know that.  That risk cannot be eliminated, but we have to educate people.  It would be remiss of us if we put labels on alcohol that had the calorific content and a bland health warning but that did not mention cancer.  It might give a touch of cancer but do not mention cancer.  There are small diagrammatic pregnancy warnings on alcohol, but nevertheless it is important that people are aware of the damage that alcohol can cause if it is consumed during pregnancy.  There is a significant entity called foetal alcohol syndrome where the baby of a person who drinks excessively during pregnancy can be affected developmentally because of the alcohol that mother has consumed.<\/p> <p> There is no sense in putting warnings on our bottles if we exclude cancer.  There would be a case to be taken against the alcohol industry if it was known, as the World Health Organization has said, that alcohol is a grade 1 carcinogenic and that warning was not put on its products.  The alcohol industry is leaving itself open to litigation if it did that.  We must not underestimate the power of the alcohol industry.  There has been intense lobbying over recent months.  We have all experienced it.  It is, unfortunately, the power of that lobby that has led to the length of this debate.

In the same way as the reduction in our road traffic deaths was not the result of one particular initiative but of many, reducing our incidence of cancer will be multifaceted.  As we identify carcinogens and come across them, it is very important that we are aware of them and that we make the public aware of them.  The public has a choice then to drink excessively or not.

I felt in conscience the more I listened to the debate that I did need to say something.  I listened to some of the amendments proposed by Deputy O'Reilly and to many of the speakers in this Chamber, but for me what made up my mind not to oppose this Bill were the opinions of the two medical people in the Chamber.  Neither I nor any other Deputy has any right to question - and I mean this - people who have the medical experience, who deal with patients and who know the danger of excessive drinking.  For me, Deputy Harty and Deputy Chambers were the two people in particular who were the reason I said to myself quite clearly that I cannot oppose this Bill, even though I have some minor reservations about it.<\/p>  <p>  I also acknowledge that the Minister has medical experts.  This debate, however, has been somewhat clouded because one could be forgiven for thinking that someone was going to be policing the door of every public house and that it would not be possible to get into some of them.  That is not what we are about.  We are trying to control the abuse of alcohol in this State and, regardless of whether we like it, we have a major problem.  If we are honest, we have all had times in our clinics where families have pleaded and begged for their relatives badly affected by alcohol.  I do not drink but I go into public houses and I mix with people who have a drink.  I have no difficulty with moderate drinking but this society has to accept that alcohol is a major issue.<\/p>  <p>  I am inclined to agree with Deputy Jonathan O'Brien.  Why not be the first in the world to do this?  Remember when Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin took on the smoking lobby and the way he was hounded and abused?  If we went out now and did a survey today, I would say 98% of people, even those who still smoke, would say that was the right decision.  We were the first in the world to do it and now many other nations have followed us.  I have some sympathy for some of the breweries and the family businesses.

Some 2,823 men and 1,700 women died of alcohol-related cancers and we are saying it might be a good idea to stick a label on a bottle to let people know.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy is correct to say that, on its own, this measure will not fix the problem.  There must be a multi-facetted approach to address the issue and this is a part of the solution.  It has always been the intention of the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill 2015 to have labels on bottles.  That has never changed.  It was also the intention when my friend and colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy, was guiding the Bill through the Seanad.  The debate has been about whether it is better to provide for it in primary legislation or leave it to the Minister of the day to provide for it via regulations.  We have never disagreed - contrary to what I have read - on whether there should be a cancer warning.  The disagreement has been about the mechanism we should use.  A motion was passed unanimously in the Seanad in November last year which stated it should be done via primary legislation.  In recent days I have engaged with stakeholders to establish the best way to do this.  I have decided that we should lead in this area and that it should be done via primary legislation which should be sent to the European Commission and we will see what it states.  If Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin had adopted the approach advocated by some in this House, we would not have had a smoking ban, for which I give him credit.  Many of the arguments being hurled at me are the same arguments that were hurled at Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin when he introduced the smoking ban.  Public health legislation is never easy to introduce.  It causes discomfort and us to change the way we do things.  <\/p>  <p>  I have shared the thought with members of the Opposition that there is a risk in the approach we are taking.  We must share that risk and take it with our eyes wide open.  The European Commission did not issue a negative opinion on the issue of cancer labelling when it was notified, but it made ot very clear that a final decision could not be reached until the relevant regulations had been notified and scrutinised.  People have asked when labelling will commence.  The legislation is very clear in stating it will not happen until after three years have elapsed once the Commission has approved the label.  As people have said to me this week, if the Commission comes back with a negative opinion, we will have a period in which to work out how to deal with it.  However, that is not a reason not to do it.  <\/p>  <p>  I propose that we oppose the amendments which try to remove the spotlight that, collectively, we wish to shine on the fact that there is a causal link between alcohol and cancer and that citizens are dying as a result of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600061#OOO00600","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1537988700,"counter":694,"content":"<p>Amendment put.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1537988700,"counter":695,"content":"<p>V&oacute;t&aacute;il.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600061#OOO00800","speaker":"1320"},{"type":"speech","time":1537989000,"counter":696,"content":"<p>Will the Deputies claiming a division please rise?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600062#PPP00100","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1537989000,"counter":697,"content":"<p>Deputies Michael Collins, Michael Fitzmaurice, Danny Healy-Rae, Michael Healy-Rae, Mattie McGrath and Carol Nolan rose.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1537989000,"counter":698,"content":"<p>As fewer than ten Members have risen I declare the amendment lost.

Irish Distillers is a big employer, employing 600 people across four sites.  As I said, whiskey tourism is a growing offering as part of the greater tourism spend.

For those who applied for planning permission for visitor centres, who built up businesses and who perhaps have breweries with the relevant directional signage outside,  anything that is passed by the D&aacute;il should not impede, restrict or take away from the right of those people to advertise, direct or show individuals where their operations are located.  As Deputy Fitzmaurice stated, people have had to develop these businesses wherever they could, wherever they owned the property and in whatever locations were available to them.  We cannot go moving the goalposts now.  If they have their permission and their operations are in place, we want them to stay there.  We want them to be able to attract the visitors to their places and to continue to give employment.  To do anything else would mean shutting them down and that would obviously be a retrograde step.<\/p>  <p>  We have to be mindful that the power of legislation is all-consuming and that is why we have to be so careful about what we are doing here.  That is why I have such concerns over what we are doing here.  However, that is people's right and entitlement.  The Bill will proceed but the Minister can be sure on one point, namely, that where I think it is wrong I will say it is wrong and where I think it is right I will say I think it is right.  However, I am very worried about the signage aspect of existing businesses, breweries and visitor centres.  There is a massive attraction for tourists and visitors who come here and who want to see how master craftsmen brew beer and distil whiskey, and who want to sample both.  This is a niche market that was not there a number of years ago and we have to be so careful that what Deputies do here tonight will not be detrimental to those businesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600065#SSS00400","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"speech","time":1537990200,"counter":740,"content":"<p>As stated earlier, and I do not want to be repetitive, it is vital that we do not do harm to existing and fledgeling businesses.  We must also avoid doing harm to proposed businesses, one of which I will name.  In my town of Clonmel, what used to be Bulmers - the drink is still called \"Bulmers\" - is now owned by C&amp;C and the latter has a huge vacant property in Dowd's Lane.  I remember, as a buachaill &oacute;g, going to Dowd's Lane with the apples my brothers and sisters and I had been involved in picking.  The apples were transported there by a tractor and trailer.  Then, in weather such as today's, although a bit later, normally, in October, with the frost and cutting of the apples and the fermenting process, one would get the smell wafting up the town.  One would know about it.  People would not need signage to find the Bulmers factory because the wonderful smell of apples being crushed to guide them.  It was an aroma that people grew up with and loved.  It became part of the heritage of An Cluain Meala, the vale of honey.  That building, unfortunately, has been in disuse.  However, we launched the Applefest - a new festival that we have to commemorate the cider industry in Clonmel - about a month ago and it is opening on Saturday evening, and we succeeded in getting part of that building open to show the public, especially the daoine &oacute;ga who do not remember it, the big vats that are still there.  That will be part of the Applefest, which is a two-day festival for the weekend in Clonmel, trying to extend the tourist season.  We have groups there.  The Leader company has supported this and so have other groups, and the private sector, such as Con Traas's Apple Farm, which is a wonderful farm that many people know of, and other producers.  We have LongWays Cider Company in Carrick-on-Suir as well.<\/p><p> We hope to develop the centre of Clonmel and many other towns.  We are seeking more schemes in the budget for the rejuvenation of our rural towns. This is an integral part of it.  This building is falling down.  We are dealing with tough cookies in C&amp;C.  They do not have a great commitment to the heritage of the town.  They are about pounds, shillings and pence, or rather euro and dollars.  They lost their shirts in America and have lost badly in England, but the Bulmers plant is very profitable in recent years thanks to the workforce which has taken huge cuts and seen great changes to keep it.  We have been promised &euro;500,000 from C&amp;C - live, horse, and you'll get grass - to do this tourist trail of the industry's heritage.  There may be some employment for people as tour guides.  This heritage centre connects to the back of the town hall and down a narrow street.  A visitor can go on down to the bottom of the town and then down to the Bulmers plant on the Waterford road.<\/p> <p> Countless hours, weeks and months of work have gone into it by enthusiastic people who are interested in history and our heritage.  We salute them.  It is so important that we do not pass some legislation here that would damage this or stop it in its tracks.  We do not have the live crushing of the apples and the scent and aroma which many people loved.  We got used to it.  We know what stewing apples is like in a kitchen or inside here in the D&aacute;il canteen, but that happened on a massive scale.  The aroma would make one's mouth water.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600065#SSS00500","speaker":"1347","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537990800,"counter":742,"content":"<p>We are getting hungry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600066#TTT00200","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1537990800,"counter":743,"content":"<p>He is getting hungry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600066#TTT00300","speaker":"1320"},{"type":"speech","time":1537990800,"counter":744,"content":"<p>I am saying it was wonderful.

It is a whole part of our heritage in Tiobraid &Aacute;rann Theas, in Cluain Meala.  I hope that all the Members will come on tours just as Deputy Danny Healy-Rae said that he sees people visiting the distillery in Kerry.<\/p>  <p>  Perhaps the Minister was present at the launch of craft beers in Bray, Wicklow, Roundwood or Greystones.  I recall an occasion some two weeks after the general election.  It was on a Friday before we were travelling for talks in Athlone about the formation of a Government.  The now T&aacute;naiste, then Minister, came and launched Tipperary Whiskey for a good family, one of whom the Minister is trying to get elected for his party in Tipperary, and a Scottish brewer who was connected to the family came and showed his talents.  The whiskey certainly tasted well.  That is still there and being supported by enterprise and Leader grants.  I understand that it is now moving to the renowned Dundrum House hotel.  Many Members here may have been at weddings there.  That is in a fledgling state.  There was the then Minister, now T&aacute;naiste, promoting that, and rightly so.<\/p>  <p>  Are we now to pull the rug from under his feet such that no one can find this place because they cannot advertise it?  This is loo-lah stuff.  It is kindergarten stuff.  It is legislation that is not being examined and certainly not rural proofed.  It has not been industry proofed or audited as to the likely negative impact it will have on, first, the volunteering aspect of the people in Clonmel and south Tipperary, second, the entrepreneurial skill of those who would come on board, and third, C&amp;C, which might have given us the money but will not be that interested now that the legislation will have changed and it cannot happen.  Bulmers is renowned the world over.  The orchards, the big tanks and the lovely films the company has made to advertise it are there to be seen.  It has been part of Clonmel's heritage for many generations.  It was home grown.  It started small and grew to be a huge industry, which was then taken over by the conglomerates, unfortunately, but it is still there, as are the growers.  They are depending on it because they give employment to people picking the apples, pruning the trees, fertilising, replanting and so on.<\/p>  <p>  I am asking Members to think about what we are going to pass here tonight.  Deputy Donnelly spoke about burning toast or sausages or rashers.  Think about the jobs for the people.  That is what is more important.  The Government is in a confidence and supply arrangement and, if it gets its way, we will not be able to eat an apple or drink a bottle of Cidona or anything else.  To have labels on top of all of that is folly.  It is ill-advised, ill-thought-out and ill-judged.  The idea that there cannot be signage because people would see it and be directed to it is doing the exact opposite of what these volunteers in the local group are trying to do to rejuvenate our towns which have become dilapidated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600066#TTT00400","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1537990800,"counter":745,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Michael Collins to speak on signage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600066#TTT00500","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1537990800,"counter":746,"content":"<p>We are speaking about signage and our amendment.

We are trying to create a bit of employment in west Cork and in other places with these distilleries and visitor centres and they will find it difficult with all these rules and regulations.

I spoke earlier in my deliberations about trade delegations that go abroad.  The Minister, Deputy Creed, who is responsible for food and beverages in this jurisdiction, regularly goes overseas with trade delegations.  These people make deals abroad.  When we meet purchasers in other countries, they often want to come back to the country where the product originated to see where the product they are purchasing is made and to go through the process.  We will be sending one type of bottle abroad but when these delegations come into this jurisdiction, they will see bottles that are subject to our laws, which will provide that it must be stated that one should not buy drink because it is carcinogenic and bad for one's health.  We will probably be saying the same thing outside our jurisdiction.  That is a big concern.  It is like talking out of two sides of one's mouth.<\/p>  <p>  I think the Minister should be a bit lax on these proposals.  The Irish Distillers visitor centre, which is a major tourism attraction in my constituency, has been mentioned already.  Over 100,000 people visit the centre each year.  We must maintain the advantage of marketing, which is done by signage and advertising.
