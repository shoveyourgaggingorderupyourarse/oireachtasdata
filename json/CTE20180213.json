I am accompanied today by Mr. John Ward who has worked as a unit driver on a number of productions for more than 20 years, Mr. Thomas O'Meilly, who has worked as a facility driver for more than ten years and Mr. Liam Neville who has more than 20 years experience as a driver.  GMB is a general union operating in the UK and Ireland with more than 700,000 members in public and private sectors and in a variety of workplaces and environments.<br\/><br\/>GMB became involved with the film industry around two years ago.  Our membership is just below 300 and is mainly drawn from the construction, props and driving crews.<br\/><br\/>From the outset of our engagement with the workforce we became aware of issues of serious concern to any trade unionist.  These included bullying and harassment, mistreatment of workers, breaches of health and safety and unsafe working practices, which includes the length of the working day and week.  No one has a permanent contract, many have worked in the industry in excess of 20 years yet still have no provision to acquired rights or even a pension.<br\/><br\/>It became obvious that those who spoke out for their rights or the rights of their fellow workers were prejudicing their future employment and today we have representatives present who are not employed because they stood up for those entitlements.  We have numerous members who should today be working on sets, who have worked on previous jobs for many years without any disciplinary action or criticism of their working ethics or performance, not working because they have raised concerns or asked for their due entitlements.  <br\/><br\/>The precarious nature of the employment leaves open the path to the culture of &quot;keep your head down, do not object and do what you are told&quot;.  Your current job and future employment seems to be based solely on whether your face fits rather than your past employment record.  To challenge the <i>status quo <\/i>has led GMB activists and members among others effectively to being blackballed on current productions.  These members have asked for no more than respect for their limited rights, such as holiday pay, overtime pay or the correct rate for the job or they have raised genuine concerns on the treatment of workers.<br\/><br\/>Continuity of employment is an issue which can and must be resolved to secure the successful future of the industry and the rights of the crew members.  The use of the special purpose vehicle, SPV subsidiary company circumvents the production company's responsibility and relationship with those employed by it.  Gaps within production time should be considered as lay off periods and subject to normal legislation for continuity of employment, future employment rights or redundancy.  This is an industry which receives millions of euro annually in loans and grants and very generous section 481 incentives to create quality employment, yet we see no evidence of quality employment on the ground.<br\/><br\/>Heads of department are PAYE employees and often oversee the recruitment process of their relevant department.  We have seen this job given to a person who is also a contractor, supplying goods, services and manpower.  This has led to under employment of regular crew, reduction in the negotiated rates for the job and what can only be deemed as a massive conflict of interest where this person is effectively awarding contracts to themselves.  The subject of how and who will be employed is clearly open to abuse.<br\/><br\/>All employees and workers are committed to working at least a 55 hour week.  The Organisation of Working Time Act stipulates that an employer shall not permit an employee to work, in each period of seven days, more than an average of 48 hours, that is say an average of 48 hours calculated over a period that does not exceed four months.  Part 11 of the Act further stipulates the daily rest period.  An employee shall be entitled to a rest period of not less than 11 consecutive hours in each period of 24 hours during which he or she works for his or her employer.  This legislation is in place to ensure the health, safety and wellbeing of those working.  GMB do not believe that the practice of working for periods in excess of the 48 hour week is healthy or safe, particularly for those employed to drive either heavy goods vehicles or passengers or for those engaged in manual labour or in control of machinery.  Drivers are regularly expected to work in excess of 12 hour days, breaching both mainstays of the legislation.  The fact that productions may last less than the maximum average of four months cannot form part of the argument that it is okay and necessary to work these hours and cannot be used when productions run beyond the four month period as seen on productions such as &quot;Vikings&quot;.  It is reasonable for the average to be calculated over the duration or intended duration of the production.<\/p><p>While this may prove difficult in certain circumstances, the calculation of the 11-hour rest period is simple and yet often ignored.  My colleagues here with me today have been employed as drivers and have first-hand experience of this on a regular basis.  The production managers, transport captains and heads of departments would have clear insight into the length of the working day planned ahead and would know that they are forcing people to work beyond the safe legal limit and without adequate rest periods.  Drivers raising objections and concerns are told they will not be re-employed or they will be let go if they refuse to work the hours.<\/p><p> In addition to the Organisation of Working Time Act, the RSA guidelines on the Road Transport Working Time Directive are also being breached.  This poses a major health and safety risk, not only to the drivers and their passengers but to other road users.  We accept that productions require a degree of flexibility and the need to maximise the working day, but there is no need to have one person working excessive hours when this work could effectively be split amongst more crew and lead to further job creation.  This is particularly relevant in the types of crews that we represent.<\/p><p> The presentation includes copies of the contracts that would be issued to prospective workers which, in addition to compelling them to a 55-hour week, commit them to exclusivity, etc.  Failure to agree to these terms would exclude someone from employment.  It also clearly demonstrates that the person taking up that position is under the control of another person who directs him as to how, when and where the work is carried out; receives a fixed hourly, weekly or monthly wage; cannot sub-contract the work; works set hours or a given number of hours per week; and receives expenses payments to cover subsistence and-or travel expenses.  All of these points are met by the individual and would clearly define him or her as an employee, yet many are operating as self-assessed or, indeed, self-employed, and this runs contrary to the Revenue guidelines.<\/p><p> GMB welcomes and supports employers who are investing in their workforce through proper training.  We welcome the practice of introducing trainees to the workplace where those trainees are valued, have recognised training pathways and prospective employment within the company.  We do not accept that the current practice of employing trainees within the film industry to simply meet the demands of the section 481 incentive is either satisfactory or appropriate.  In other jurisdictions, training within the sector is highly rewarding and leads to the proper skilling of the individual, offering him or her the potential to work in the industry and hence add to the secure future of the sector.  The industry currently cannot even track the progress of trainees or substantiate the type and quality of any supposed training.  It appears purely a mechanism to meet the requirements of section 481 and provide a cheaper source of labour on set.  We have experience of members who have been employed as trainees having had ten years or more experience within the industry in their particular field.  In one example, an individual had previously worked as a qualified props master for a number of years but when a new production - for a producer the individual had worked with - started up, the individual was advised that the only job available for the individual would be at a trainee rate.<\/p><p> The funding has created many problems within the industry.  We welcome the ongoing investment in the industry but we want to see the sector grow and prosper.  We call for serious consideration to be given to the reform of how funding is made going forward.  This reform must seek to eradicate abuse and waste of taxpayers' moneys.  At a minimum, proper scrutiny must take place to ensure that funded projects create clearly defined quality jobs and this must be rigorously monitored.<\/p><p> GMB has fought an uphill battle for the past few years trying to secure proper rights and working conditions for our members in the film industry.  We are committed to building and strengthening jobs in this sector but not at the expense of workers' rights.  Reform is needed and worker participation is paramount to ensure that the voices of those who have helped build the reputation of strong, talented and dedicated crews in Ireland and the Irish Film industry are heard.  There must be proper and ongoing dialogue with elected representatives from within the workforce - people with first-hand experience of the industry and its problems who can assist in reforming the industry for the better.  It is also essential that proper worker participation is secured on the Irish Film Board to represent workers.  While we have concentrated today on the many things that are wrong within the industry, we must ensure that proper recognition is paid to the many dedicated crew members who have contributed to date to make the sector a success.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018021300002#D00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Denise Walker","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518519600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>As nobody else from GMB is seeking to make a presentation, I call on John Arkins to make his presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018021300002#E00200","speaker":"1235"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1518519600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>Hopefully, the Chairman and members will have had an opportunity to read the submission we furnished to the committee on 31 January 2018.<\/p> <p>  My name is John Arkins.  I am general secretary of the Irish Film Workers Association.  I am accompanied by my colleague, John Purdy.  The association represents all grades of workers of the film industry, the majority being of the set craft grade.  In this summary of our position, we will address some of the key aspects of the previous presentations by the Irish Film Board, Screen Producers Ireland and SIPTU which are also dealt with in our submission.<\/p> <p>  The issues break down into three key categories &ndash; funding, employment and training.  On funding under section 481, the legislation follows at Appendix 3, page 150, of our substantive submission.  The committee will note that an authorisation shall not be given by the Minister under section 481(2) of the Act of 1997, that is, the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, in relation to a film unless: (a) the film is within a category of film set out in Schedule 2, and (b) the Minister is satisfied that the film will either or both: (i) act as an effective stimulus to film making in the State through amongst other things the provision of quality employment and training opportunities, and (ii) be of importance to the promotion, development, enhancement of the national culture including where applicable the Irish language.  Film making in Ireland, we would suggest, never meets the requirements of either subparagraphs (i) or (ii) of the Act.<\/p> <p>  SIPTU in its submission to the committee described employment in the film industry as \"precarious\".  The union further put forward a view that freelance contracts are favoured by some workers.  A union official went on to suggest that this issue could be addressed by engagement with the parent company.  It is our understanding that those on freelance contracts are not covered by the legislation and do not meet the definition of \"worker\" under any of the various pieces of employment legislation.  We believe it is an absurd proposition from the largest trade union in Ireland to engage in dialogue with the producer company which is the recipient of section 481 funding in respect of \"precarious\" employment or outsourcing key functions.<\/p> <p>  We, film workers, are engaged on fixed-purpose contracts.  This atypical working arrangement was recognised by the European social partners and resulted in major reform with the introduction of the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003.  To put it in context, some 15 years after the introduction of the legislation, SIPTU is proposing to allow producer companies abdicate their responsibilities to both employment legislation and section 481 funding notwithstanding that SIPTU, in the first instance, by way of collective agreements, provided the mechanism to the producer companies to continue the abusive use of fixed-term contracts with what is known as a 50\/50 nomination system, that is, the union proposes a member for a job and management proposes the next member.  Apart from the constitutional issues which arise, there is a belief that we, as workers, were taxed by the union to go to work.<\/p> <p>  It has long been recognised that precarious or atypical employment undermines the stability and continuity of employment which is central to the funding legislation and, indeed, actively conspires against the effective functioning of the industry.<\/p> <p>  It was also most disappointing to hear Screen Producers Ireland confirm to the committee what it has been telling us for some time, that is, that its members do not employ anybody, yet they seek to engage with SIPTU to conclude collective agreements.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Collins of Screen Producers Ireland also informed the committee that producer companies are custodians of section 481.  The effect of being a custodian means that they are guardians and overseers of how the money is spent.  We would suggest they are doing a very bad job, as there is no return on the investment for the taxpayer.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Collins, speaking as a member of Screen Producers Ireland and as spokesperson for the producer company members, put forward an argument as to why they could not have crew.<\/p><p>He used an analogy that if he hired a director of photography who did not want to use his camera technician, then his technician would have no work and that would give the technician an unrealistic expectation.  The reality is that producer companies should have a crew and the director of photography should be directly employed as it is a grade that only has an application in the film industry.  It seems that Screen Producers Ireland seriously believe that this kind of glib comment is helpful to their members.  We respectfully suggest that when one is in a hole, one should stop digging.<\/p><p> Another issue was the submission to the committee, again by the union, in respect of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997.  The Act provides a maximum working week of 48 hours.  The averaging period is four months, 16 weeks, not 17, as stated by the union.  Producer companies are aware that if the duration of the production is less than the averaging periods, then the working week cannot in any circumstances exceed 48 hours.  There are no exemptions from the legislation for the film industry.  That this was acknowledged by the union came as a total shock to us as workers given that the union yet again provided the mechanism to the producer companies to breach the Act by way of a collective agreement.  This agreement is forced on workers by way of an appendix to our contracts. <\/p><p> Senior union officials have unfortunately overlooked the organisation of working time consolidated legislation which provides that if a collective agreement were to take workers outside of the legislation, it could only be concluded between a worker and his or her employer, the statutory consequences of opting out having been explained in plain language.  The legislation requires that such an agreement cannot be negotiated by representative bodies.  This should be obvious to both the union and Screen Producers Ireland as the provisions of employment legislation are individual rights of entitlement.<\/p><p> We know the union is familiar with this piece of legislation and we know it is familiar with the case law as set down by the European Court of Justice.  We know this because we have told it in correspondence on numerous occasions and we were ignored.  Senior officials did point out that workers who are in breach of the legislation could be penalised if they go to work on another production, which is correct, but neglected to say that the net effect of this breach is that workers may be prevented from taking another job and neither could they avail of unemployment assistance because they could not be available for work.<\/p><p> How are workers supposed to live if the union&rsquo;s collective agreement renders them unable to work?  It is truly shocking that a most senior official ignored their own role in this injustice by implementing the collective agreement that provides for a 50 hour, up to a 66 hour, week before overtime.  To further compound this injustice, this official has just entered into another such agreement with Troy Studios in Limerick again in the full knowledge that it is a breach of legislation.  There is no reason that film production cannot abide by the legislation and organise the work over 48 hours.<\/p><p> Our submission to the committee sets out the reality of the issues facing trainees.  The CEO and chairperson of the Irish Film Board along with the union acknowledged that there were issues with trainees and training, but nothing has been done to address these issues.  Our submission deals with the Crowe Horwath report.  We do not believe it complied with its terms of reference and feel it is not capable of being implemented.  There was another major report which was referred to by the CEO of the Irish Film Board going back as far as 1995, the STATCOM report, which proposed the registering and certification of trainees.  To date, none of its recommendations are in place.<\/p><p> Screen Training Ireland is, in our view, a major drain on the taxpayer and should be returned to SOLAS from where it came.<\/p><p>What is the value to taxpayers of throwing more money at Screen Training Ireland which has no QQI accreditation, does not engage with trainees, in an industry which determines its own training needs and which has fundamentally failed to implement the key recommendations of previous training reports?  Screen Training Ireland held an open day in Troy Studios in Limerick two years ago and promised jobs in the film industry yet there were no employers recruiting workers because there are no jobs.  The production which is now under way in Troy Studios has at least 80% of the crew having been brought in from New Zealand and the UK.  Irish crew must go down as local crew, even though they are not local.  Workers are brought here from abroad even though there are experienced film workers and trainees sitting at home.  Who is responsible for carrying out the labour market needs test which is required when hiring non-EEA workers?  Was such a test carried out? <\/p><p> In order to determine training needs or to devise training courses, two essential ingredients are fundamental to the process without which the process is irrelevant, namely an employer, an employee.  Section 10 of the fixed-term work legislation places an obligation on employers to provide access to training, so here we have two pieces of legislation placing obligations on employers under section 481 and the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003.  Therefore, the question arises as to what useful purpose can be served in granting Screen Training Ireland extra resources other than to give the impression that there is a career in film, when we know to our cost there is no such thing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018021300002#F00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Arkins","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518519600,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Arkins.  I will begin the questions myself.  Several groups have come before the committee on this sector.  It is an important sector for many reasons, economically, in the provision of work and because of the way in which it allows our country to tell its own story.  If we do not do that, there is a danger that we could become a cultural satellite of other, larger countries.<\/p> <p>  I have been examining this issue in the last six months.  There seem to be significant structural problems within the sector regarding how workers are treated.  This is the first time this committee has had before it non-actors working in the sector, people working in the clerical and other grades.  It is important to facilitate this.  <\/p> <p>  It is also important because the State gives considerable money to the sector, whether through loans or tax breaks.  Most sectors in Ireland will say that precarious working conditions tend towards the abuse of the rights of workers.  If there is an equal balance between worker and employer, one is likely to get fair treatment of the employee, but where there is a major imbalance, through precarious work, it leads to major difficulties.<\/p> <p>  I want to ask the witnesses their opinions on some ideas that I have had.  I think there should be a need for a member of the craft sectors to have a representative on the Irish Film Board, which is not now the case, and they should be nominated by the Minister so they can help steer future development.  The Irish Film Board can initiate an Irish film forum where all stakeholders can participate.  I have asked for this to happen and, to be fair, the Irish Film Board has said it would be interested in it.  What are the witnesses' views on this?<\/p> <p>  Bogus self-employment was raised.  Views differ on the prevalence of bogus self-employment in the sector.  There is a view that there is a need for some level of self-employment to allow flexibility and some people choose it themselves.  How prevalent do witnesses think is bogus self-employment in the sector?<\/p><p>Is it a case that 20% of people in sector are forced into bogus self-employment, or is it far more widespread than that?  We often hear there is good employment legislation in the State and regulatory bodies such as the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, to oversee it.  Obviously, that is difficult to use if one is in a precarious working environment.  Are there examples of it being used where it has successfully underlined the concerns that witnesses have, or is it the case that it is nearly impossible to use those sectors?  The witnesses might address those four questions, whichever of them would like to choose one of them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018021300002#H00200","speaker":"1235","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1518519600,"counter":18,"content":"<p>On the Chairman's question on whether the mechanism of the WRC operates for this industry, during the past two years since the Irish Film Workers Association was formed as a registered trade union, we have taken cases to the WRC on a number of issues.

We believe the mechanism can work, and we will be back to the court this month again dealing with a case involving a beneficiary of section 481 funding who has said he is not the employer.  There is an issue if one does not know who one is bringing to court and people are not willing to acknowledge they are in receipt of this money and that they are the employers.  It is not that hard for us to identify the employers.  If the Chairman's reads our submission, he will note that the beneficiaries of all the section 418 funding is set out in the category on the left-hand side of Appendix 5.

Some situations are not covered by the agreement but we are working on the matter as we speak.  There has been interference and people have come up with the bogus argument that the Irish Film Workers Association does not have a negotiation licence.  I do not need a licence to talk to my employer and no group of workers needs a licence to talk to their employer.  However, Screen Producers Ireland and Troy Studios need licences to negotiate and to set terms and conditions.  Neither has a licence, so neither can set the terms and conditions for employees who do not work for them.  The Irish Film Workers Association is doing what has to be done and our employers have stepped up to the plate.<\/p> <p>  There are some huge issues within the industry.  My colleagues who are seated on my left have some major problems and my organisation is trying to address them with the employers in the industry.  That is why we cannot go down the route of negotiating an industry agreement with Screen Producers Ireland because it is not an accepted body under the Act.  I can quote the Act and what is required.  If an organisation is not an accepted body or a trade union, then it cannot set terms and conditions for people who do not work for the organisation.  Any trade union that enters into an agreement with a body that has no licence and cannot get one is misleading people.  That is where the problems stem from.

I was very struck when I met some of the workers to whom Mr. Ward and Mr. Neville introduced me.

This is the mechanism from which those figures come.  This was a 2011 report called the Creative Capiral report.  Every five years, a report is prepared by vested interest groups, usually at the time of a change of Government.  Now we have the Crowe Horwath report.  This is how they come to these figures.  This is what lay people need to hear, before deciding what they think .<\/p> <p>  The report claimed that crew are employed on a 38-hour week, and work 232 days per year.  It found that the 38-hour week average is derived from a 39-hour week average for manual workers and a 37-hour week for clerical professionals and technical workers.  The 232-day working year is derived as follows.  From 365 days, 104 are subtracted for weekends; a further nine for public holidays; 20 days are then subtracted for average annual leave.  This leaves 232 days. <\/p> <p>  We and our colleagues work for up to 70 or 80 hours a week.  That has been reported as a 38-hour week.  All of the hours worked have been counted.  That is how they arrive at an figure of 17,000 people in full-time jobs, working 1,365 hours a year.  They calculate the hours, not the people.  One can do that all one likes, but that is the reality.  Those were the findings of the Creative Capiral report from 2010.  That is their contention, not ours.<\/p> <p>  The report did avert to industrial relations issues, and following its publication the then Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, appointed a man named Mr. Peter Cassells to investigate industrial relations in Irish film.  He would not take the job, and it was given to a lovely man by the name of Mr. Finbarr Flood, whom I was privileged to meet.  He started his working life as a 14-year-old boy at the Guinness brewery.  Over his working career, he ended up becoming the managing director of the company.  He was also the chair of the Labour Court.  Mr. Flood said he could understand that after 27 years working in the industry, I am still humping timber.  The man on my right is still humping timber.  There is no career path, because no one takes responsibility.  No one has to.<\/p> <p>  That is how they came up with the figures, and that is how they come up with the figures today.  As a group of workers, we have been excluded.  We are habitually employed by my employer and associate employers.  I refer to the McHenry brothers.  This is law adjudicated on by the court.  We cannot be treated any less favourably than full-time workers, but we have been excluded from our workplace by agreements.  The employers do not hire get union members; they get conscripts.
