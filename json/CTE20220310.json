Deputy McAuliffe sent his apologies and Deputy Catherine Murphy sent her apologies in regard to this afternoon's session.  In order to limit the risk of spreading Covid-19, the Service encourages all members, visitors and witnesses to continue to wear a face mask when moving around the Leinster House campus and when in close proximity to other people.  I ask members and witnesses to respect social distancing.  Covid-19 has not gone away just yet.<\/p> <p>  Members attending remotely must continue to do so within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the place where the Parliament has chosen to sit.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee and is accompanied by Mr. Andrew Harkness, director of audit at the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.<\/p> <p>  This morning we will engage with officials from the HSE and  examine expenditure on mental health services in the context of the HSE's 2020 financial statements, with a particular focus on child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.  The HSE has been advised that the committee may also wish to examine the following matters: expenditure in terms of the Owenacurra Centre in Midleton in County Cork; and HSE recruitment targets, budgeting delivery and departmental oversight.<\/p> <p>  Attending remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House are the following HSE officials: Mr. Paul Reid, CEO; Ms Anne O'Connor, chief operations officer; Mr. Stephen Mulvaney, chief financial officer; Mr. Jim Curran, national director of capital and estates; Ms Yvonne O'Neill, national director of community operations; and Dr. Amanda Burke, child and adolescent consultant psychiatrist and executive clinical director for Galway Roscommon mental health services.  Also attending remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House are the following officials from the Department of Health: Ms Louise McGirr, assistant secretary; Ms Margaret Campbell, principal officer; and Mr. Seamus Hempenstall, principal officer.  They are all very welcome.<\/p> <p>  When we begin to engage, I will ask those attending remotely to mute their microphones when not contributing in order that we do not pick up any background noise.  As usual, I remind all those in attendance to ensure that their mobile phones are either in silent mode or switched off.<\/p> <p>  I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses in respect of reference witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  As they are within the precincts of Leinster House, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation they make to the committee.  This means that they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they may say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Cathaoirleach to ensure that it is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue and it is imperative that they comply with such directions.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  I call on the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022031000002#A00300","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646904600,"counter":8,"content":"<p>The annual financial statements of the Health Service Executive are presented in the form directed by the Minister for Health, as provided for in the Health Act 2004.  The direction requires the HSE's expenditure to be split between what is referred to as \"revenue\" or current expenditure and \"capital\" expenditure.<\/p> <p>  Within the revenue income and expenditure statement, spending is broken down into pay and non-pay, with further analysis of non-pay spending under a mix of resource type and national scheme categories.  However, the amount spent on mental health services in 2020 is not disclosed in the audited financial statements.  Separately, the HSE&rsquo;s annual report discloses an unaudited figure of just over &euro;1 billion of current spending on mental health services in 2020.<\/p> <p>  What is referred to as an indicative appendix to the revised Estimate for the health Vote includes some budgetary information by service type.  This indicates that for 2020 there was an original budget of &euro;1.057 billion in Exchequer funding for mental health services, including a capital allocation of &euro;26 million.  The capital allocation was subsequently increased to &euro;44 million.<\/p> <p>  The indicative appendix also sets out a range of output and activity measures and performance targets for the mental health services.  However, the appropriation account for the Vote does not report the outturn for the mental health services, either in terms of delivery performance or of service-related expenditure.  Reconciling the budget figures for mental health funding to the HSE&rsquo;s annual report spending figure for mental health is further complicated because of the different bases of accounting used.<\/p> <p>  The framework of accountability for public expenditure on our health services is therefore very complex.  The committee may be aware of a briefing paper prepared by the Parliamentary Budget Office in 2018 which examined the systems in place in the HSE and the Department of Health for budgeting, performance measurement and financial reporting.  That paper concluded that there is a requirement for a significantly better alignment of the programmes of Vote 38 with the HSE&rsquo;s internal allocations, to make the relationship between what the Oireachtas approves and what is spent on the ground more transparent.  The HSE will be able to update the committee on developments in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022031000002#A00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1646904600,"counter":9,"content":"<p>Mr. Reid is very welcome.

The Chair has introduced my colleagues so I will not repeat the names.<\/p> <p>  The range of mental health services delivered by or on behalf of the HSE is extensive and ranges from promotion of positive mental health, HSE-funded services provided by our partner organisations and mental health in primary care, to specialist inpatient and community-based mental health services.<\/p> <p>  As requested by the committee, I refer to the briefing notes submitted in advance of today&rsquo;s meeting, which provide a detailed breakdown of all HSE expenditure on mental health services and associated governance and oversight arrangements, as well as expenditure and associated spending decisions with regard to the buildings at Owenacurra Centre in Midleton in County Cork.<\/p> <p>  Owenacurra Centre currently provides mental healthcare, rehabilitation services and accommodation for 11 service users.  The building is, regrettably, no longer fit for purpose and it is not viable to bring it to a standard that will meet the needs of our service users and staff.  Mental health services in Cork Kerry community healthcare organisation work in close collaboration with the affected service users and their families to find more appropriate accommodation.  The process will be handled with sensitivity and with regard to the wishes and preferences of each resident.<\/p> <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s annual financial statements for 2020 reported total expenditure of &euro;20.2 billion for the provision of health and social care services while also dealing with the unprecedented Covid-19 pandemic.  Mental health services expenditure in 2020 was more than &euro;1 billion or more than 5% of total expenditure reported.<\/p> <p>  Over the past decade, mental health services have seen a significant budget increase.  Since 2012, &euro;325 million have been made available to support priority service enhancements.  These targeted investments have been directed by national mental health policy in Vision for Change 2007, Connecting for Life 2015, and Sharing the Vision 2020, and in line with the Sl&aacute;intecare reform programme.<\/p> <p>  Developments have, in broad terms, been aimed at modernising services that historically were centred on institutionalised care by building our workforce and investing in fit-for-purpose infrastructure; promoting positive mental health; intervening early when problems develop; and providing accessible, comprehensive and community-based services for those who need them and supporting the recovery journey of each individual, based on clinical advice and best practice, while recognising the importance of lived experience.<\/p><p>Funding for new developments has been invested in building our community teams for children and young people, for adults, and for older persons; expanding youth mental health services; developing specialist services and clinical programmes; driving forward our national suicide prevention strategy; strengthening mental health services in primary care; empowering service user involvement; and modernising forensic services.<\/p><p> The availability of skilled staff is a significant issue in mental health services where demand outstrips supply and where our workforce, particular younger staff, are availing of employment opportunities outside of Ireland.  We continue to have a strong focus on mitigating these risks, among other things by building a service that is attractive to work in, by offering flexible working arrangements and by fully utilising opportunities offered by telehealth solutions.<\/p><p> Notwithstanding our recruitment challenges, this continued investment has enabled mental health services to progress the shift from institutional to community care and to improve the overall quality of services.  Since 2012, mental health services have seen a net growth of 1,441 wholetime equivalent posts, while increases in agency staff and overtime equals an additional 789 wholetime equivalents into the workforce.  In parallel, significant capacity has been built into primary care and community services to relieve pressures on specialist mental health services, including CAMHS.<\/p><p> The clear outcomes from this investment can be seen in the following: an additional 18 CAMHS teams since 2012, and generally enhanced capacity in CAMHS; between 2020 and 2021, the number of accepted CAMHS referrals increased by 21%; enhanced inpatient CAMHS capacity and reduction of young people admitted to adult acute units; enhanced capacity within our adult community mental health teams, which has significantly reduced admissions into acute inpatient units; an additional ten community-based teams for older persons; more developed upstream mental health services, including funding for partner organisations such as Jigsaw; greater access to talking therapies, including establishment of counselling in primary care, which has seen more than150,000 people referred for treatment since 2013; development of a new national forensic mental health service in Portrane, which will incorporate a new ten-bed forensic CAMHS unit; design and implementation of four national clinical programmes; establishment of a mental health engagement function nationally and within each community health organisation, as well as recruitment of peer support workers; and expansion of suicide prevention, mental health promotion and health.<\/p><p> An additional &euro;24 million has been made available to enhance and build new mental health services in 2022.  This will allow the HSE to continue our implementation of the national clinical programmes, build out-of-hours services, crisis response teams and crisis caf&eacute;s, and bring forward a recovery approach into all services.<\/p><p> In collaboration with the Department of Health, next month we will launch a three-year implementation plan to drive forward delivery of Sharing the Vision, which will complement the Connecting for Life implementation plan already in place.<\/p><p> These detailed multi-annual plans will provide a clear roadmap for the continued development of mental health services in Ireland.  Implementation will be driven by a strong outcomes focus and a shared commitment to report on progress against these plans in an open and transparent manner, among other things by making progress reports publicly available.<\/p><p> In delivering these work programmes, the HSE will work in partnership with staff, service users and families to achieve our goal of a modern and fit-for-purpose mental health service that meet the needs of those who require our services.<\/p><p> This concludes my opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022031000002#A00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646904600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank Mr Reid.

In addition, the HSE provides a profile of its cash requirements and its projected expenditure on an accruals basis.  The profile is submitted to the Department and much work is done to understand the cash and the I&amp;E spend and where they sit together.  Obviously, the HSE also provides draft annual financial statements to the Minister for Health.  A significant volume of work goes on throughout the year.<\/p> <p>  As for improvements relating to financial transparency and the visibility of information, I am on the board relating to the IFMS, the new financial management system.  The Department and the HSE work closely together on the development of the new systems, which are crucial.  I refer to both the HR and the financial management systems.  In addition, many improvements have been made and much work done with colleagues in the HSE, despite some of the limitations on the systems, to improve the reporting.  We are continuously engaged in that process with our colleagues in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to improve transparency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022031000002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Louise McGirr"},{"type":"speech","time":1646904600,"counter":44,"content":"<p>I thank Ms McGirr for elaborating on that.

It was a very simple question and the response I got was comprehensive, which was to the credit of Mr. Ryan.  The response was that the total number of persons waiting for CAMHS nationally was 3,357.  When I submitted a further parliamentary question, asking for a breakdown of services provided by CAMHS, specifically the number presenting to CAMHS who were waiting for psychology services, the reply, which was from Mr. O'Regan, the head of operations, gave a universal figure of 9,554 for psychology services alone.  If I break it down further in relation to CHO 4, the CHO I am most familiar with, I get a total of 682 people waiting.  For psychology services, I get a figure of approximately 3,000 for CHO 4.<\/p> <p>  What is deeply frustrating for us in representing families and children awaiting appointments or trying to get into the system of CAMHS is that it is very hard to get accurate information in real time in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  When we table parliamentary questions, it is very hard to give families real-time information based on their children's needs and their expectations.  I have no criticisms whatsoever of the individuals who work in CAMHS, who are trying to do their best and work through all the needs of families daily, but Mr. Reid has to acknowledge that there is a serious issue in respect of CAMHS and his datasets in respect of interrogating figures in that regard.  It is Kafkaesque that systems within the HSE organisation are not talking to each other properly.  If Mr. Reid cannot even come up with proper figures for me when there are glaring contradictions, how can we expect to have confidence in his approach?  In fairness to him, he has taken a national lead on the Covid pandemic, but we want him to devote the same energy to dealing with CAMHS, its management and, ultimately, the delivery of services to families.  We remain to be convinced that appropriate resources are being deployed.  From Mr. Reid's level of management down, more needs to be done.  How does he answer this critique - I do not call it a criticism - of how we as politicians interface with the service?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022031000002#D00200","speaker":"1514"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646904600,"counter":61,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

I will briefly describe - I do not want to over-labour this point - the circumstances related to oversight of all our services.  The executive management team reports to our board setting out not only the targeted objectives in our corporate plan but equally the targeted objectives in our national service plan every year.  One of the strengthening processes that I, as CEO, put in place with the executive team is one whereby, on a monthly basis, we report monthly to the board with a national scorecard for every aspect of our national service plan, every aspect of all targets in the national service plan, our progress and the issues and risks in respect of each of the targets.  That is new and different.  I reassure the Deputy that it is not just about oversight in respect of Covid over the past two years.  Throughout the process and since 2019, we have had very strong oversight of all aspects of our services, including mental health services, and direct reporting on a scorecard related to CAMHS.  I just wanted to give that general assurance.  I ask my colleague, Ms O'Connor, to give some of the specifics.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022031000002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646904600,"counter":62,"content":"<p>On the waiting lists the Deputy referred to, the figure of 3,357 is specific to CAMHS.

In theory, for us the waiting-beyond target figure is the 1,700.  The larger number the Deputy referred to in relation to psychology concerns psychology for children across mental health and disability primary care.  In the mental health area, we have invested in primary care psychology to support children because we know that when we are talking specifically about CAMHS, we are talking about children who have gone into the specialist mental health service.  Our priority needs to be to support children earlier in their pathway in primary care or if they are in disability services.  The 9,000 pertains to psychology for children across the different specialties; it is not specific to CAMHS.  This relates to what has consistently been our challenge.  It is now something we are trying to work through in implementing Sharing the Vision and recommendations on youth mental health and in all that good work that is going on.

That is what \"unaudited\" means in that context.<\/p> <p>  The appropriation account, which the Department looks after, is based on certain legal requirements, as is the HSE's annual financial statement.

We have to start there and say that if we have guidance that took a lot of development, we have to assure ourselves it is being used by the teams.  That is one step.

Part of the challenge for people when they look into our system, as we have previously flagged, is the complexity of it and ensuring that people&rsquo;s needs are met.  There are people who are no longer in CAMHS, who have moved into adult services or who are not in services at all.  It is critical, and I fully accept that we have to ensure that services are available.  There are vacancies in that area.

It is a measure to centralise service costs in St. Stephen's Hospital and St. Catherine's ward.  We have decided to move 19 people 30 km away from their homes.  I spoke to a man on Monday who was crying because he is so distressed.  He has never left Midleton and never lived anywhere else.  None of the people are going into community settings as far as I can see, despite the fact that community settings are being used as a reason to close down Owenacurra.  At the end of this process, only one person will be in a community setting.  The other 18 people will be in congregated settings or nursing homes.  Is the Department overseeing this?  Is it happy with this type of capital cost decision-making?  Is there any accountability in the east Cork area?  Is there any accountability for the decision-making on mental health facilities in Cork in the Department?  East Cork will now have not one 24-hour high-support bed, not one.

Mr. Curran's colleague from HSE estates was there.  It was a reasonably positive meeting.  In excess of &euro;4 million went into the Abbeyleix nursing unit, we are told, or what is referred to locally as Abbeyleix hospital.  There are 42 or 43 staff and the site is five acres.  Up to last week, seven beds were occupied.  That has increased this week.  I want to say very directly to Mr. Reid that we have to get better at using resources in this State.  The HSE has to get better at it.  Here is a fine facility on a large site with a very committed and dedicated staff.  Those in the county who are looking to get people into nursing home beds would give their right arm to get their relatives into that facility.  That needs to be brought back into full use with the staff used.<\/p><p> Will Mr. Curran respond on the utilisation of those beds and of the full premises?  Will he address the situation around the day-care centre?  It was closed during Covid, understandably, but then a decision was taken during Covid to move it away from Abbeyleix hospital where it was located for years.  There was an integrated healthcare hub there.  The plan was to relocate it in a separate building and perhaps even a different town.  I know that the HSE had looked at buildings in Mountrath ten miles away.

We are all well aware of that.  The actions we have taken since the cyberattack have primarily been around security 24-7, increased access controls and increased authentication controls where people might have to type a double entry to access a system.  There are some specific recommendations around the recruitment of, in particular, two key specialists.  This is a role around a chief technology and transformation officer and a chief operations officer with a speciality in cyber.  We have set out the process to recruit for those two roles.  That will probably take some time.  We have issued a tender for someone to come in and support us in that process in the meantime.  We are just finalising that detail.  In summary, it will be a significant recruitment of resources and strengthening of 24-7 monitoring, which we currently have place now and which was not in place previously.  There will be a whole set of increased controls in governance and oversight.  There is one particular recommendation around business resilience or, in our case, service resilience in terms of strengthening capacity to the best extent we can when something like this happens.

In the period since the closure decision was made, no information has been provided on the building that is relevant to the closure.

At this stage, however, Eir has been a private company since 1999.

Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  The next item on the agenda is the work programme.  Next week is a non-sitting week due to L&aacute; le P&aacute;draig.  The week after that, on 24 March, we will engage with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.  As usual, if there are any particular matters of interest to members that they would like to receive a briefing on in advance of the meeting, please let the clerk know.<\/p> <p>  On 31 March, we will commence a series of justice-related meetings for which the following engagements have been confirmed: An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on 31 March, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission for the morning of 7 April and the Policing Authority for the afternoon of 7 April.  There are then two non-sitting weeks scheduled for Easter, which means that the next meeting after Easter will be on 28 April.  That will be with the Department of Justice - there are a good few justice-related issues coming up - and will examine the appropriation account of the Department and the Irish Prison Service.  That is the last confirmed meeting.<\/p> <p>  We previously agreed that we will engage with the University of Limerick, the Department of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform after the meeting with the Department of Justice, but these meetings have not yet been scheduled.  On matters in the public domain regarding the Department of Health and the HSE, we previously agreed that we would examine any prior year's adjustment to the HSE&rsquo;s accounts once the Comptroller and Auditor General has audited the HSE&rsquo;s 2021 financial statements and they are laid before the House.  The committee did that for a good reason.  Some of the stuff in the media did not reflect that or the intentions of the committee.  The committee's intentions were not represented and, to some extent, were misrepresented.<\/p> <p>  In respect of other issues we have identified from reports in the public domain concerning the Department of Health and the HSE, we have yet to decide whether to address them as part of our engagement on the HSE&rsquo;s 2021 financial statements or to hold a separate hearing before the summer.  The next available date is 5 May.  We could look to schedule the University of Limerick, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform or the Department of Finance in May as well.  I will open it to members, including Deputies Dillon, Carthy or anybody else who wants to come in on that.  What order do members wish to take those meetings in?  Does anybody have any views on that?  Okay.  The next available date is 5 May.  We could schedule a prior hearing with the HSE and the Department of Health for that date, if it is the wish of the committee.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  We then have the University of Limerick and the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance in May as well.

We will leave that with the secretariat and ask it to get dates that are suitable for all involved and that fit in with our work programme.<\/p><p> Are there any other matters members wish to raise regarding the work programme?  If not, that concludes our consideration of the work programme for today.<\/p><p> The final item is any other business.  Do any members wish to raise any other matters?  No.  The committee will now go into private session before adjourning until 24 March 2022, when it will engage with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland regarding its 2020 financial statements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022031000002#Z00800","speaker":"1491","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1646904600,"counter":535,"content":"<p>The committee went into private session at 1.41 p.m. and adjourned at 1.46 p.m. until Thursday, 24 March 2022.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
