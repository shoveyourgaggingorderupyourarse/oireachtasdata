Deputy McAuliffe sent his apologies and Deputy Catherine Murphy sent her apologies in regard to this afternoon's session.  In order to limit the risk of spreading Covid-19, the Service encourages all members, visitors and witnesses to continue to wear a face mask when moving around the Leinster House campus and when in close proximity to other people.  I ask members and witnesses to respect social distancing.  Covid-19 has not gone away just yet.<\/p> <p>  Members attending remotely must continue to do so within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the place where the Parliament has chosen to sit.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee and is accompanied by Mr. Andrew Harkness, director of audit at the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.<\/p> <p>  This morning we will engage with officials from the HSE and  examine expenditure on mental health services in the context of the HSE's 2020 financial statements, with a particular focus on child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.  The HSE has been advised that the committee may also wish to examine the following matters: expenditure in terms of the Owenacurra Centre in Midleton in County Cork; and HSE recruitment targets, budgeting delivery and departmental oversight.<\/p> <p>  Attending remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House are the following HSE officials: Mr. Paul Reid, CEO; Ms Anne O'Connor, chief operations officer; Mr. Stephen Mulvaney, chief financial officer; Mr. Jim Curran, national director of capital and estates; Ms Yvonne O'Neill, national director of community operations; and Dr. Amanda Burke, child and adolescent consultant psychiatrist and executive clinical director for Galway Roscommon mental health services.  Also attending remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House are the following officials from the Department of Health: Ms Louise McGirr, assistant secretary; Ms Margaret Campbell, principal officer; and Mr. Seamus Hempenstall, principal officer.  They are all very welcome.<\/p> <p>  When we begin to engage, I will ask those attending remotely to mute their microphones when not contributing in order that we do not pick up any background noise.  As usual, I remind all those in attendance to ensure that their mobile phones are either in silent mode or switched off.<\/p> <p>  I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses in respect of reference witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  As they are within the precincts of Leinster House, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation they make to the committee.  This means that they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they may say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Cathaoirleach to ensure that it is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue and it is imperative that they comply with such directions.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  I call on the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022031000002#A00300","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646904600,"counter":8,"content":"<p>The annual financial statements of the Health Service Executive are presented in the form directed by the Minister for Health, as provided for in the Health Act 2004.  The direction requires the HSE's expenditure to be split between what is referred to as \"revenue\" or current expenditure and \"capital\" expenditure.<\/p> <p>  Within the revenue income and expenditure statement, spending is broken down into pay and non-pay, with further analysis of non-pay spending under a mix of resource type and national scheme categories.  However, the amount spent on mental health services in 2020 is not disclosed in the audited financial statements.  Separately, the HSE&rsquo;s annual report discloses an unaudited figure of just over &euro;1 billion of current spending on mental health services in 2020.<\/p> <p>  What is referred to as an indicative appendix to the revised Estimate for the health Vote includes some budgetary information by service type.  This indicates that for 2020 there was an original budget of &euro;1.057 billion in Exchequer funding for mental health services, including a capital allocation of &euro;26 million.  The capital allocation was subsequently increased to &euro;44 million.<\/p> <p>  The indicative appendix also sets out a range of output and activity measures and performance targets for the mental health services.  However, the appropriation account for the Vote does not report the outturn for the mental health services, either in terms of delivery performance or of service-related expenditure.  Reconciling the budget figures for mental health funding to the HSE&rsquo;s annual report spending figure for mental health is further complicated because of the different bases of accounting used.<\/p> <p>  The framework of accountability for public expenditure on our health services is therefore very complex.  The committee may be aware of a briefing paper prepared by the Parliamentary Budget Office in 2018 which examined the systems in place in the HSE and the Department of Health for budgeting, performance measurement and financial reporting.  That paper concluded that there is a requirement for a significantly better alignment of the programmes of Vote 38 with the HSE&rsquo;s internal allocations, to make the relationship between what the Oireachtas approves and what is spent on the ground more transparent.  The HSE will be able to update the committee on developments in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022031000002#A00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1646904600,"counter":9,"content":"<p>Mr. Reid is very welcome.

The Chair has introduced my colleagues so I will not repeat the names.<\/p> <p>  The range of mental health services delivered by or on behalf of the HSE is extensive and ranges from promotion of positive mental health, HSE-funded services provided by our partner organisations and mental health in primary care, to specialist inpatient and community-based mental health services.<\/p> <p>  As requested by the committee, I refer to the briefing notes submitted in advance of today&rsquo;s meeting, which provide a detailed breakdown of all HSE expenditure on mental health services and associated governance and oversight arrangements, as well as expenditure and associated spending decisions with regard to the buildings at Owenacurra Centre in Midleton in County Cork.<\/p> <p>  Owenacurra Centre currently provides mental healthcare, rehabilitation services and accommodation for 11 service users.  The building is, regrettably, no longer fit for purpose and it is not viable to bring it to a standard that will meet the needs of our service users and staff.  Mental health services in Cork Kerry community healthcare organisation work in close collaboration with the affected service users and their families to find more appropriate accommodation.  The process will be handled with sensitivity and with regard to the wishes and preferences of each resident.<\/p> <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s annual financial statements for 2020 reported total expenditure of &euro;20.2 billion for the provision of health and social care services while also dealing with the unprecedented Covid-19 pandemic.  Mental health services expenditure in 2020 was more than &euro;1 billion or more than 5% of total expenditure reported.<\/p> <p>  Over the past decade, mental health services have seen a significant budget increase.  Since 2012, &euro;325 million have been made available to support priority service enhancements.  These targeted investments have been directed by national mental health policy in Vision for Change 2007, Connecting for Life 2015, and Sharing the Vision 2020, and in line with the Sl&aacute;intecare reform programme.<\/p> <p>  Developments have, in broad terms, been aimed at modernising services that historically were centred on institutionalised care by building our workforce and investing in fit-for-purpose infrastructure; promoting positive mental health; intervening early when problems develop; and providing accessible, comprehensive and community-based services for those who need them and supporting the recovery journey of each individual, based on clinical advice and best practice, while recognising the importance of lived experience.<\/p><p>Funding for new developments has been invested in building our community teams for children and young people, for adults, and for older persons; expanding youth mental health services; developing specialist services and clinical programmes; driving forward our national suicide prevention strategy; strengthening mental health services in primary care; empowering service user involvement; and modernising forensic services.<\/p><p> The availability of skilled staff is a significant issue in mental health services where demand outstrips supply and where our workforce, particular younger staff, are availing of employment opportunities outside of Ireland.  We continue to have a strong focus on mitigating these risks, among other things by building a service that is attractive to work in, by offering flexible working arrangements and by fully utilising opportunities offered by telehealth solutions.<\/p><p> Notwithstanding our recruitment challenges, this continued investment has enabled mental health services to progress the shift from institutional to community care and to improve the overall quality of services.  Since 2012, mental health services have seen a net growth of 1,441 wholetime equivalent posts, while increases in agency staff and overtime equals an additional 789 wholetime equivalents into the workforce.  In parallel, significant capacity has been built into primary care and community services to relieve pressures on specialist mental health services, including CAMHS.<\/p><p> The clear outcomes from this investment can be seen in the following: an additional 18 CAMHS teams since 2012, and generally enhanced capacity in CAMHS; between 2020 and 2021, the number of accepted CAMHS referrals increased by 21%; enhanced inpatient CAMHS capacity and reduction of young people admitted to adult acute units; enhanced capacity within our adult community mental health teams, which has significantly reduced admissions into acute inpatient units; an additional ten community-based teams for older persons; more developed upstream mental health services, including funding for partner organisations such as Jigsaw; greater access to talking therapies, including establishment of counselling in primary care, which has seen more than150,000 people referred for treatment since 2013; development of a new national forensic mental health service in Portrane, which will incorporate a new ten-bed forensic CAMHS unit; design and implementation of four national clinical programmes; establishment of a mental health engagement function nationally and within each community health organisation, as well as recruitment of peer support workers; and expansion of suicide prevention, mental health promotion and health.<\/p><p> An additional &euro;24 million has been made available to enhance and build new mental health services in 2022.  This will allow the HSE to continue our implementation of the national clinical programmes, build out-of-hours services, crisis response teams and crisis caf&eacute;s, and bring forward a recovery approach into all services.<\/p><p> In collaboration with the Department of Health, next month we will launch a three-year implementation plan to drive forward delivery of Sharing the Vision, which will complement the Connecting for Life implementation plan already in place.<\/p><p> These detailed multi-annual plans will provide a clear roadmap for the continued development of mental health services in Ireland.  Implementation will be driven by a strong outcomes focus and a shared commitment to report on progress against these plans in an open and transparent manner, among other things by making progress reports publicly available.<\/p><p> In delivering these work programmes, the HSE will work in partnership with staff, service users and families to achieve our goal of a modern and fit-for-purpose mental health service that meet the needs of those who require our services.<\/p><p> This concludes my opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022031000002#A00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646904600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank Mr Reid.

In addition, the HSE provides a profile of its cash requirements and its projected expenditure on an accruals basis.  The profile is submitted to the Department and much work is done to understand the cash and the I&amp;E spend and where they sit together.  Obviously, the HSE also provides draft annual financial statements to the Minister for Health.  A significant volume of work goes on throughout the year.<\/p> <p>  As for improvements relating to financial transparency and the visibility of information, I am on the board relating to the IFMS, the new financial management system.  The Department and the HSE work closely together on the development of the new systems, which are crucial.  I refer to both the HR and the financial management systems.  In addition, many improvements have been made and much work done with colleagues in the HSE, despite some of the limitations on the systems, to improve the reporting.  We are continuously engaged in that process with our colleagues in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to improve transparency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022031000002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Louise McGirr"},{"type":"speech","time":1646904600,"counter":44,"content":"<p>I thank Ms McGirr for elaborating on that.

It was a very simple question and the response I got was comprehensive, which was to the credit of Mr. Ryan.  The response was that the total number of persons waiting for CAMHS nationally was 3,357.  When I submitted a further parliamentary question, asking for a breakdown of services provided by CAMHS, specifically the number presenting to CAMHS who were waiting for psychology services, the reply, which was from Mr. O'Regan, the head of operations, gave a universal figure of 9,554 for psychology services alone.  If I break it down further in relation to CHO 4, the CHO I am most familiar with, I get a total of 682 people waiting.  For psychology services, I get a figure of approximately 3,000 for CHO 4.<\/p> <p>  What is deeply frustrating for us in representing families and children awaiting appointments or trying to get into the system of CAMHS is that it is very hard to get accurate information in real time in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  When we table parliamentary questions, it is very hard to give families real-time information based on their children's needs and their expectations.  I have no criticisms whatsoever of the individuals who work in CAMHS, who are trying to do their best and work through all the needs of families daily, but Mr. Reid has to acknowledge that there is a serious issue in respect of CAMHS and his datasets in respect of interrogating figures in that regard.  It is Kafkaesque that systems within the HSE organisation are not talking to each other properly.  If Mr. Reid cannot even come up with proper figures for me when there are glaring contradictions, how can we expect to have confidence in his approach?  In fairness to him, he has taken a national lead on the Covid pandemic, but we want him to devote the same energy to dealing with CAMHS, its management and, ultimately, the delivery of services to families.  We remain to be convinced that appropriate resources are being deployed.  From Mr. Reid's level of management down, more needs to be done.  How does he answer this critique - I do not call it a criticism - of how we as politicians interface with the service?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022031000002#D00200","speaker":"1514"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646904600,"counter":61,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

I will briefly describe - I do not want to over-labour this point - the circumstances related to oversight of all our services.  The executive management team reports to our board setting out not only the targeted objectives in our corporate plan but equally the targeted objectives in our national service plan every year.  One of the strengthening processes that I, as CEO, put in place with the executive team is one whereby, on a monthly basis, we report monthly to the board with a national scorecard for every aspect of our national service plan, every aspect of all targets in the national service plan, our progress and the issues and risks in respect of each of the targets.  That is new and different.  I reassure the Deputy that it is not just about oversight in respect of Covid over the past two years.  Throughout the process and since 2019, we have had very strong oversight of all aspects of our services, including mental health services, and direct reporting on a scorecard related to CAMHS.  I just wanted to give that general assurance.  I ask my colleague, Ms O'Connor, to give some of the specifics.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022031000002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646904600,"counter":62,"content":"<p>On the waiting lists the Deputy referred to, the figure of 3,357 is specific to CAMHS.

In theory, for us the waiting-beyond target figure is the 1,700.  The larger number the Deputy referred to in relation to psychology concerns psychology for children across mental health and disability primary care.  In the mental health area, we have invested in primary care psychology to support children because we know that when we are talking specifically about CAMHS, we are talking about children who have gone into the specialist mental health service.  Our priority needs to be to support children earlier in their pathway in primary care or if they are in disability services.  The 9,000 pertains to psychology for children across the different specialties; it is not specific to CAMHS.  This relates to what has consistently been our challenge.  It is now something we are trying to work through in implementing Sharing the Vision and recommendations on youth mental health and in all that good work that is going on.

That is what \"unaudited\" means in that context.<\/p> <p>  The appropriation account, which the Department looks after, is based on certain legal requirements, as is the HSE's annual financial statement.

We have to start there and say that if we have guidance that took a lot of development, we have to assure ourselves it is being used by the teams.  That is one step.

Part of the challenge for people when they look into our system, as we have previously flagged, is the complexity of it and ensuring that people&rsquo;s needs are met.  There are people who are no longer in CAMHS, who have moved into adult services or who are not in services at all.  It is critical, and I fully accept that we have to ensure that services are available.  There are vacancies in that area.

It is a measure to centralise service costs in St. Stephen's Hospital and St. Catherine's ward.  We have decided to move 19 people 30 km away from their homes.  I spoke to a man on Monday who was crying because he is so distressed.  He has never left Midleton and never lived anywhere else.  None of the people are going into community settings as far as I can see, despite the fact that community settings are being used as a reason to close down Owenacurra.  At the end of this process, only one person will be in a community setting.  The other 18 people will be in congregated settings or nursing homes.  Is the Department overseeing this?  Is it happy with this type of capital cost decision-making?  Is there any accountability in the east Cork area?  Is there any accountability for the decision-making on mental health facilities in Cork in the Department?  East Cork will now have not one 24-hour high-support bed, not one.

Mr. Curran's colleague from HSE estates was there.  It was a reasonably positive meeting.  In excess of &euro;4 million went into the Abbeyleix nursing unit, we are told, or what is referred to locally as Abbeyleix hospital.  There are 42 or 43 staff and the site is five acres.  Up to last week, seven beds were occupied.  That has increased this week.  I want to say very directly to Mr. Reid that we have to get better at using resources in this State.  The HSE has to get better at it.  Here is a fine facility on a large site with a very committed and dedicated staff.  Those in the county who are looking to get people into nursing home beds would give their right arm to get their relatives into that facility.  That needs to be brought back into full use with the staff used.<\/p><p> Will Mr. Curran respond on the utilisation of those beds and of the full premises?  Will he address the situation around the day-care centre?  It was closed during Covid, understandably, but then a decision was taken during Covid to move it away from Abbeyleix hospital where it was located for years.  There was an integrated healthcare hub there.  The plan was to relocate it in a separate building and perhaps even a different town.  I know that the HSE had looked at buildings in Mountrath ten miles away.

We are all well aware of that.  The actions we have taken since the cyberattack have primarily been around security 24-7, increased access controls and increased authentication controls where people might have to type a double entry to access a system.  There are some specific recommendations around the recruitment of, in particular, two key specialists.  This is a role around a chief technology and transformation officer and a chief operations officer with a speciality in cyber.  We have set out the process to recruit for those two roles.  That will probably take some time.  We have issued a tender for someone to come in and support us in that process in the meantime.  We are just finalising that detail.  In summary, it will be a significant recruitment of resources and strengthening of 24-7 monitoring, which we currently have place now and which was not in place previously.  There will be a whole set of increased controls in governance and oversight.  There is one particular recommendation around business resilience or, in our case, service resilience in terms of strengthening capacity to the best extent we can when something like this happens.

In the period since the closure decision was made, no information has been provided on the building that is relevant to the closure.

There are then two non-sitting weeks scheduled for Easter, which means that the next meeting after Easter will be on 28 April.  That will be with the Department of Justice - there are a good few justice-related issues coming up - and will examine the appropriation account of the Department and the Irish Prison Service.

On matters in the public domain regarding the Department of Health and the HSE, we previously agreed that we would examine any prior year's adjustment to the HSE&rsquo;s accounts once the Comptroller and Auditor General has audited the HSE&rsquo;s 2021 financial statements and they are laid before the House.  The committee did that for a good reason.  Some of the stuff in the media did not reflect that or the intentions of the committee.  The committee's intentions were not represented and, to some extent, were misrepresented.<\/p> <p>  In respect of other issues we have identified from reports in the public domain concerning the Department of Health and the HSE, we have yet to decide whether to address them as part of our engagement on the HSE&rsquo;s 2021 financial statements or to hold a separate hearing before the summer.  The next available date is 5 May.  We could look to schedule the University of Limerick, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform or the Department of Finance in May as well.  I will open it to members, including Deputies Dillon, Carthy or anybody else who wants to come in on that.  What order do members wish to take those meetings in?  Does anybody have any views on that?  Okay.  The next available date is 5 May.

Agreed.<\/p> <p>  We then have the University of Limerick and the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance in May as well.

The Bill is extremely important and it will change the culture in our health services in a very positive way.  I acknowledge the broad support the Bill received on First and Second Stages.<\/p> <p>  When things go wrong, patients and their families expect at least three things.  They expect to be told honestly what has happened, what can be done to deal with any harm that has been caused and what will be done to prevent a recurrence of such harm to anybody else.<\/p> <p>  In every health service the world over things will, of course, occasionally go wrong, and what matters when they do go wrong, when mistakes and errors occur, is how the health service responds and deals with these situations.  Much has been done to advance open disclosure in our health service.  The HSE introduced a national open disclosure policy in 2013, and there are many examples of open disclosure occurring as it should in our health service.  Unfortunately, it does not always happen.  All of us here today are aware of these tragic cases.  This Bill provides for mandatory open disclosure of serious patient safety incidents.  It provides for the notification of those reportable incidents to the relevant regulator and extends the remit of HIQA to private hospitals.  It also contains provisions supporting clinical audit in the health service.  This Bill will lead to a safer, better health service by placing patients and their needs front and centre.<\/p> <p>  As my colleagues are aware, the Government approved this Bill in December 2019, subject to certain amendments, and it passed First and Second Stages in the D&aacute;il on 12 December 2019.  It was due to proceed to Committee Stage in early 2020 but events overtook us with the arrival of Covid-19.  I would like to outline a number of amendments, some of which were part of the Government decision when the Bill was approved in December 2019.  I will first seek to clarify the amendment to section 9 of the Health Act 2007, which will strengthen the ministerial powers to request an investigation by HIQA into ongoing patient safety risk in Ireland&rsquo;s health and social services.<\/p> <p>  I am also proposing an amendment to section 12 of the Bill, which addresses openness and transparency.  As previously drafted, section 12 set out that both health service providers and health practitioners, when making an open disclosure under this Bill, must provide all relevant information to the patient or their relevant person.  Where appropriate, they must also inform other health services of a notifiable incident.  I have now added further draft provisions to section 12 that expand the impact of this section and ensure these provisions are enshrined in the relevant policies set by the HSE and national standards set by HIQA.  It also ensures they are enshrined in the codes of professional conduct or practice set by the relevant regulatory authorities.<\/p> <p>  Schedule 2 to the Bill contains a list of amendments to the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017.  These amendments are purely technical.  They aim to align the two pieces of legislation with specific reference to the organisation of the open disclosure meeting, the provision of information to the patient and their family, and the procedure to follow should a patient not wish to participate in an open disclosure meeting.  These amendments do not introduce any new substantive provisions to either Bill.<\/p> <p>  These three amendments are given effect in a number of sections throughout the Bill and I will outline the detail of the amendments as they arise.<\/p><p> I wish to flag two amendments I will be introducing on Report Stage.  First, I propose to give the HIQA chief inspector of social services a discretionary power to carry out a review of certain serious patient safety incidents that occur during the provision of healthcare where some or all of the care of the patient is carried out in a nursing home.  This proposed amendment will seek to support patients and their families when something goes wrong with the clinical care they received in a nursing home.  It will ensure appropriate external processes are in place to review serious patient safety incidents.  The amendment follows the report of the Covid-19 nursing home expert panel recommendations that call for suitable structures to be put in place for external oversight of individual care concerns arising in nursing homes.  This power will not replace the responsibility of nursing homes to address concerns that are raised by patients and families.  It will put in place an appropriate escalation pathway to ensure these concerns are addressed in a way that will provide answers to families and patients.<\/p><p> Second, the overarching intention of the Bill is to embed and support a culture of open disclosure.  It is fair to say that many aspects of the Bill have been informed by the learnings from CervicalCheck, particularly the need to ensure accountability by service providers and clinicians in carrying out open disclosure to patients and families.  I, together with my Department and the national screening services, have given a significant amount of consideration to these learnings and the work of the expert reference group on interval cancers.  These expert reports were commissioned as part of the Scally review in 2018.

I certainly will be supporting the speedy passage of the Bill through the Oireachtas.  All present know its importance.  There are many related issues with which we also need to deal, including safeguarding legislation, which I hope the Minister will be in a position to bring forward this year.  There are issues relating to the rights of social care teams and safeguarding teams to investigate allegations of abuse and neglect.  There are issues of accountability at management level when there are failures.  Such failures have been highlighted time and again.  All of these issues are related to what we are trying to achieve in the Bill.  I welcome this element of it.  Mandatory reporting is important.  I wish to put on record that my thoughts are with Vicky Phelan, R&oacute;is&iacute;n Molloy and many other men and women who were victims of a lack of mandatory reporting and mandatory disclosure.  In my view, we are here today to improve systems for them.<\/p><p>The Minister made a point in his opening statement that is relevant to the amendment I am proposing to the Bill.  He stated the Bill should ensure safer and better health services for patients.  Of course, I hope that is what the Bill will do.  Any improvement in that direction is welcome.  The patients, however, will be the judges of whether it does what it needs to do, whether the Bill, once implemented and operational, will make health services safer and more fit for purpose and, as the Minister stated, engender a new culture of reporting within the health service.  All present hope that is what will happen.<\/p><p>The amendment seeks to establish a patient council.  The reason for that is obvious.  Patient advocates and patients themselves should have a voice in respect of the supervision of the Bill when enacted.  It calls for, at minimum, a report to be published each year by the patient council.  Obviously, it will meet as often as it deems necessary to review the operation of the legislation, but also to make recommendations.  As the Minister stated on Second Stage, the notifiable incidents under Schedule 1 may well be changed.  The Minister has the power to do so as time progresses.  If there are other incidents that need to be included in that Schedule, that can be done.  Surely, however, patients should have a voice in that process as well.<\/p><p>I tabled the amendment in good faith.  I know many patient advocates and patients who have been through a very difficult time.  It pains me to say it but there is a significant amount of distrust in the system simply because many people quite rightly believe there is not just a lack of a culture of open disclosure but also a lack of a culture of accountability within the health services at a senior management level.  I am not pointing a finger at any individual; it is a culture issue.  One just has to look at all the scandals there have been.  I will not go through them all.  We know the full range of scandals involving patients being let down and becoming victims of a failed process.  Establishing this council would be a very important message to send in the context of giving them a sense that they will be part of this process and journey.<\/p><p>I will leave it there.  In the spirit of getting through all the amendments, it is important that I do not labour the point.  I have made the argument for the amendment and I ask the Minister to consider accepting it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2022031000002#B01500","speaker":"1615"},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":556,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  I agree with the intention of the amendment and everything he has just said.  I will not be accepting the amendment because there is an independent patient safety council in existence.  The council provides advice and guidance to the Minister for Health on a broad range of perspectives on the development of patient safety policy.  It was appointed by the then Minister in 2019 and held its first meeting on 27 February 2020.  By engaging a broad range of perspectives in patient safety policy, including those of the patient and the service in question, the work of the council leads to enhanced policymaking.  The council members bring a wide variety of expertise and experience, which is important, including citizens, education, patient safety, health policy, healthcare leadership and more.<\/p><p>The council is chaired by Ms Noeline Blackwell who we are all very aware of.  She is a person of excellent standing and CEO of the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre.  To the Deputy's point, the council obviously needs to meet and does so two to three times a year.  It also agrees on an annual work programme.  As part of the 2020 programme, the council was asked by the then Minister to carry out some work in the area of open disclosure.  Last year, it provided me with recommendations on a national policy framework for open disclosure in healthcare in Ireland.  I would be very happy to share that report with the committee.  I will check if it has been published, but I certainly see no reason why we should not provide it.  This framework is very much to assist organisations and clinicians to apply the principles of open disclosure and to communicate with patients where healthcare does not go to plan.  The framework is now being drafted and it will sit along this legislation to give guidance to healthcare organisations.<\/p><p> In short, I agree with the Deputy's points.  We have quite a robust council in place under an excellent chair that is already looking at open disclosure.  I propose, because I agree with everything the Deputy said, that the committee or I could write to the Independent Patient Safety Council and ask it in whatever the appropriate period is, possibly a year after operation, to do a review and report back to the Oireachtas and me with its findings.

I do not see why.  I cannot see how the amendment would have incurred a cost to the Exchequer to the point that it was ruled out of order but that is not for the Minister and I to have a discussion on.<\/p> <p>  I will speak very briefly to this point in the section and on what I was seeking to do, which is that any individual who is employed by the health services should be mandated to report incidents under Schedule 1.  If it is left to only some clinicians and not others, the difficulty is some of them may not report.  There are robust procedures and processes for failure to report but it is possible some incidents may not be captured in instances and situations where others working in or around an individual who is mandated to report are also aware of a notifiable incident, which should be reported by that individual.  It is very important we get this right and that any individual who has a sense that something is wrong and works in the healthcare service should be mandated to come forward.<\/p> <p>  I have spoken to a number of advocate groups on this matter and we do not want a situation where there is over-reporting.  I appreciate there is a balance to be struck but, at the same time, we can put safeguards in place to protect the rights of healthcare staff who may well come forward, which is why the amendment allows for people to report an incident to HIQA, for example, as an alternative and added protection.  Nobody should have any fear about coming forward in respect of his or her job or standing in the health services.  We are doing this because it is about patient safety and it is the right thing to do.  Incidents should be reported and followed by fair processes to investigate any notifiable incidents or complaints made under the mandatory reporting process.  Anyone in the health service needs to be properly protected when he or she comes forward.<\/p> <p>  The point I am making is what I was seeking to make in the amendment.  As that has been ruled out of order, I can only speak to it in the section, namely, that we should broaden the scope of who should be making reports and who should be mandated to make reports.  It should be all those who work in healthcare settings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2022031000002#C01200","speaker":"1615"},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":567,"content":"<p>Is the Deputy speaking to amendment No. 5 as well?

For someone who has no experience of advocacy or of how to navigate through what can be the maze of the HSE, the system, reporting systems and so on, the role of a patient advocate, as the Minister knows, is very important.  With this amendment we seek to place an obligation on the provider to ensure that it is mandated to provide information to a patient on how to engage the services of a patient advocate, rather than simply leaving it to a patient to have to try to find all of this out, sometimes by having to employ the services of legal representatives and incurring more costs.

The good news is we now have a patient advocacy service that is growing.  The Patient Advocacy Service, PAS, was set up to provide exactly what the Deputy is, quite rightly, calling for, which is free and independent advocacy for users in the acute system who intend to make a formal complaint regarding the care they receive.  The complaints come through the HSE's Your Service, Your Say process.  PAS is also there to help those who have been involved in a patient safety incident, which is obviously the topic of the legislation before us.  It was established for public acute hospital users.  However, since June of last year, we have extended that to HSE-operated nursing homes as well.<\/p> <p>  Since its establishment, the service commenced operations nationally.  There are hubs in centres with the highest activity, namely, Dublin, Cork, Limerick, the midlands and Galway.  The service goes to all locations to meet patients and service users as required.  Currently, 20 staff are employed by PAS and recruitment is ongoing.  Last year, it received 1,200 new contacts so it is doing an awful lot of work.  That is required advocacy arising from more than 3,300 separate complaints.  PAS is there, it is very active and it is working around the country.<\/p> <p>  While I will not accept the amendment, since we already have the service in place, I am happy to commit to asking my officials to engage directly with the HSE to make sure there is a very wide understanding that PAS is there, that it is free and that it is very responsive.  I agree entirely that there are many cases where patients need advocates.  PAS provides that expert advocacy service.<\/p> <p>  Section 7 is a very important section.  It establishes the obligation of mandatory open disclosure.  While amendment No. 4 has been ruled out of order, I will address some of the issues through discussion of the section.  The view is that it is very important a clear responsibility and accountability is placed on the service provider and the most relevant senior clinician.  That is what this is about.<\/p><p>The Deputy referred to protected disclosure.  He is correct.  Those protections are afforded under different legislation, namely, the Health Act 2004 which was amended in 2007.  The protections for people coming forward are very important and real but covered under separate legislation.  I looked at what other countries do.  We cannot find any other country where there is an obligation on everybody.  There is a concern where there could be someone in a hospital ward, for instance, with no clinical training or not the right level of clinical training who might see something that they are not really qualified to know whether it was a serious incident or whether should it have happened.  It might be that it is part of normal care or maybe it is not but it could create anxiety for them that they feel legally obliged to report all of these.  That is why Ireland and other countries keep it to the organisation.   This would introduce an offence with serious penalties.  The legislation lays out who the lead person is and there is back-up for the next person if that person is not available.  That is how the section is structured.  That is the right way to go rather than putting an obligation on everybody.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2022031000002#C02000","speaker":"1623","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":578,"content":"<p>I want to raise a couple of points under this section.

Given the extent to which the State depends on private nursing homes and that they are largely funded by State money, is there an intention to extend the remit of the patient advocacy service to private nursing homes?<\/p> <p>  There is a wider point on the section relating to clinical accountability.  Separate to this, there is a recommendation in the context of the regionalisation of the HSE to introduce legally binding clinical accountability where there would be regular reviews.  The Minister referred to what happens in other countries.  I remember Professor Tom Keane talking about this in relation to his own role in Canada, for example, where at the end of each year there was a kind of performance assessment which he and all other consultants had to undergo.  Is it intended work will start on that proposed legislation, which would be part of a piece with this legislation, to ensure it is not only when there are adverse events but that clinical assessment would be carried out on an ongoing basis by the hospital concerned?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2022031000002#D00200","speaker":"1567"},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":579,"content":"<p>I want to respond to some of the Minister's points.  First on the patient advocacy service, yes, it is a service that is available.  As Deputy Shortall rightly said, it is under-resourced.  It does not apply to private nursing homes.  I accept the Minister's bona fides that he will engage with the patient advocacy service in the context of the passage of this Bill and will look at resourcing and staffing issues, but I will press the amendment.  However, I will not call for a vote on any of the amendments because I want the Bill to pass as quickly as possible for the obvious reasons.<\/p> <p>  Returning to the broader point around the section, the Minister spoke on who would be obliged or mandated to make a report.  I accept much of the logic of his response.  That is why I said we have to be careful.  There has to be a balanced approach.  I tabled an amendment and I am pleased the Minister has looked at the matter to see how it operates internationally.  However, we must also be honest.  I do not want to prejudge reviews, processes and audits which are now in place around CAMHS in Kerry.  However, some of the senior officials were before the committee some weeks ago.  There was a failure in clinical supervision at the very top.  It is accepted by the HSE.  There were failures at management level and at very senior clinician level.  I understand that in CAMHS in Cork it was a social worker who made disclosures, not because she was mandated to do it but because she felt it was the right thing to do.  I just have a fear here.<\/p> <p>  While there is some logic in what the Minister said and you do not want to create the anxiety that he spoke about where everybody feels they have to report everything, that is not what the Bill does.  Schedule 1 sets out very clearly what is a notifiable incident.  Clearly any mandated report has to be under that Schedule by using this Act.  We can improve in this area.  This goes back to where I sought a separate patient council that would look at the operation of this Bill given its sheer importance that this is something that as part of that review process would be looked at.  I hope it is not the case, but I fear that we could end up, after the passage of this Bill, in one, two or three years' time, where we have had a number of incidents where those senior clinicians or relevant senior clinicians the Minister spoke about may not have reported what should have been reported.  Then there will be a failure in that area.  Yes, there are processes to deal with that but there may be other staff members in and around that clinician who were aware of incidents but were not mandated to report them.  We will then ask why not?   We will find the reason they were not making the reports is that they were not mandated to do so.  If that is the case, then the Act will have to be amended.<\/p> <p>  I very much hope this Bill will work and that we do not have those kinds of situations but the possibility of those arising is very real.  We can look at examples of failures at management and senior clinician level.  It very rarely happens.  We have excellent staff in our health service.  The senior clinicians are really good at what they do and it is very rare that we have these kinds of failures.  However, they occur and when they do and there are failures on the part of a senior clinician, there should be responsibility on the others to come forward.  My amendment might not have been the best way to do it and maybe there is a happy medium or a balance between what I was proposing and what is in the Bill.  For the purpose of moving this debate on, I will leave it at that.  I welcome the Minister's response but I fear it is an issue that we may have to return to in the future.  I hope that is not the case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2022031000002#D00300","speaker":"1615"},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":580,"content":"<p>Deputy Shortall asked if we will extend the remit of the patient advocacy service.

I fully agree.<\/p> <p>  There is much overlap in the points made by Deputies Cullinane and Shortall on the really important question of clinical accountability.  I will try to decouple them slightly.  When I was discussing the Bill with Department officials, we were teasing out some of these points.  It was put to me that they are linked.  We are trying to strike a very delicate balance between fostering a culture of openness, which is what this Bill is all about - it is all about mandatory open disclosure  - and a culture where people are afraid, whether they should or should not be, to disclose because of what might happen to them.  The advice we have from looking around the world at systems that do this better than we do is to try to keep them separate insofar as possible.  For example, this Bill rightly contains requirements around apologies.  However, they cannot be used as part of court cases or admissions of liability.  My understanding is that Canada, for example, had a similar system.  We are trying to strike a really delicate balance.  First, we are telling people that under the 2004 Act they have protections if they want to come forward under protected disclosures.<\/p><p>Second, there are clear guidelines in place regarding mandatory open disclosure.  Now this Bill adds another serious layer to that.  It states it is a legal requirement and it is an offence if one does not do what one is meant to do in terms of mandatory open disclosure.  At the same time, to refer to the points of both Deputies, which I fully agree with, there has to be accountability.  There has to be clinical accountability and there has to be managerial accountability.  We can refer to numerous examples, including south Kerry.  We are trying to find a very fine line, or trying to walk the right balance, and get this balance right.  This Bill is about the mandatory open disclosure part, not the accountability part.<\/p><p> However, we are proceeding with the regional health areas, RHAs, for many reasons.  I was in Galway last week looking at the emergency departments and various other services.  The case for the regional health areas from a patient service perspective is clear as day.  We have many patients with delayed transfer of care and delayed discharge.  Patients in emergency departments need those beds, yet there are separate organisations running the hospitals and running the community side of things.  Obviously, it should all be the one organisation.  The RHAs are very important from a continuity of patient care perspective.  It is also through the RHAs that we will put the systems of accountability in place at the clinical level and at the managerial level.  That work is ongoing.  Not only is the work ongoing, I have also appointed an advisory group to me on the implementation of that.  This is one of the areas on which that group will be providing feedback to me, to make sure that we get the right balance and that we have accountability, which we must have, but it does not come at the cost of creating a culture where people are afraid to step forward and admit when things have gone wrong.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2022031000002#D00400","speaker":"1623","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":582,"content":"<p>We are committed to open disclosure, but we still do not have open disclosure.

If a decision is made and people think they will all be in trouble if it is disclosed, to my mind the answer is that they will all be in trouble if it is not disclosed.  We have to find the right level at which to intervene and the right level of incentives to ensure that the purpose of the Bill is served.  The culture is not going to change overnight and we could be here six months hence, a year hence and five years hence.  The Bill is as good as it operates and works and identifies the issues as they come along and are dealt with.  Some issues have been dealt with in various institutions over the past six months, but some issues have spectacularly not been dealt with.

I realise we are talking about accountability in respect of mandatory open disclosure, but I will outline my experience of the HSE.  When the Minister was in the Opposition and on this committee, he had to deal with a lot of scandals and crises in health.  Many people who have come before this committee have had to testify to failures at management level, clinical governance management, standards, quality care and so forth.  There is a sense that nobody is held to account at management level.  We have reviews and processes, but at the end of it people do not see that there has been accountability at senior management level.  Obviously, we will have separate conversations on the wider areas in that regard when the Minister comes forward with his plans for regional health areas.  We have all sorts of concerns in that regard as well, to which we will return.  Everybody on the committee wants that to be right.  However, to get accountability right, there must be accountability at senior level at the core of an organisation.  If there are very senior clinical failures, nobody is ever held to account that I can see.  I will not attempt to talk the Minister through all the incidents.  I referenced some of the most recent ones but we could go back over many years.<\/p> <p>  Can the Minister talk through - people will want to hear this to better understand from the Minister's perspective how this is going to work - what the sanction is if a senior relevant clinician does not report something that the authorities then deem should have been reported and there was an obligation on the clinician to report it?  Separate from that, the Minister might take the opportunity to talk about his view on accountability at management level.  When I deal with organisations such as the Irish Association of Social Workers, Safeguarding Ireland and others, the one issue they continually come back to is that if one does not deal with cultural problems where there is a lack of accountability at senior level in the HSE, we will have these incidents happening repeatedly.  I know that it is a tricky area and I appreciate it is not an easy area to resolve, but it is one we have to start addressing.  We can start to do it in this Bill, certainly when it relates to mandatory open disclosure.  Can the Minister outline exactly what the sanctions would be for somebody who fails to report and who should have reported?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2022031000002#E00300","speaker":"1615"},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":584,"content":"<p>We are in agreement about the need for formal structures and the culture as well.

Deputy Cullinane referred earlier to our experience in this committee with the south Kerry CAMHS issue.  At that meeting, we were trying to get to the point where we could identify who was in charge and who was responsible.  It was impossible to do that because there was no clear chain of command at all.  There were various different management bodies.  There was the administrative one within the CHO, but then each of the different disciplines have their own management structure and they report up through that, whether it is physiotherapy, public health nurses or whatever.  The RHAs will assist in devolving power and responsibility down through the service.<\/p><p>The existing management structure is completely dysfunctional even within each of the CHOs.  The Minister made the point about having a single budget and that it makes sense as it means we do not have delayed discharges because there is no money for home care.  All of that is very important but equally important is having a clear chain of command and a management structure so that when something does go wrong, the buck stops with identifiable people.  When the Minister quotes section 49, he refers to how a health service provider that may have committed an offence can end up being fined and so on but what is a health service provider?  The HSE is a health service provider but there is no point in fining the HSE.  It must be tied into legal accountability for named posts within the management structure.  This is what concerns me.  I have made this point a few times when problems have arisen within the HSE.  You get the sense that everybody is responsible and yet nobody is responsible.  I think the term \"health service provider\" is a very wide and ambiguous one.  It does not fill me with confidence that there will be a way of identifying whether that the buck stops with \"X\" be that at a clinical or administrative level.  This is what we need to do.  If people are employed on very high salaries, responsibility must come with that.  This is the only way.  There must be consequences for individuals concerned when the job is not done properly or responsibly.  The fact that it is still quite loose concerns me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2022031000002#E01000","speaker":"1567","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":592,"content":"<p>The definition of a \"health service provider\" is detailed in section 3.  It could be an individual hospital, for example.  While I understand the points being made, I think they are probably beyond the scope of this legislation.  This legislation is around trying to instil in law an obligation for mandatory open disclosure.  It is one that will be taken very seriously by the healthcare providers and clinicians.  What it is doing is backing up.  It is another layer of defence because the HSE mandatory disclosure guidelines are already in place and are taken seriously.<\/p> <p>  There is a broader conversation into which we have very understandably moved around accountability generally.  As I said earlier, the process by which that needs to happen, and I agree with the Deputies that it needs to happen, is through the regional health areas because we will be creating the one organisation in each region that is responsible for end-to-end patient care.  I go to Galway, meet the nurses, doctors and managers and look at a situation that is not acceptable for patients or our healthcare workers.  I am meeting some emergency medicine nurses shortly and I know the committee has been engaged in the same thing.  As Deputy Shortall rightly said, the CHO has some responsibility in terms of stopping people from going into hospital in the first place and the GP network has some responsibility in terms of out-of-hours GP cover.  Some community hospital care that is under the CHO has responsibility to ensure beds are available.  The hospital group has a responsibility to make sure there is correct load balancing and so forth across the different hospitals.  The individual hospital is responsible for patients coming in the door but it is reliant on the CHO and nursing homes to a large extent to make sure patients can be discharged.  There is no single organisation that I and the committee can meet to ask what the head of organisation is doing and what its executive team is doing to sort this out.  I agree with Deputy Shortall but it is well beyond the scope of this legislation.  However, I would be very happy to discuss it with the committee on an ongoing basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2022031000002#F00200","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":593,"content":"<p>I agree with the Minister that it is beyond the scope of this Bill and is a much broader issue.

It seems everybody was and nobody was, as has been said.<\/p> <p>  As it is not relevant to the scope of this Bill, it might be useful if the Minister could give a commitment that some time over the next number of months, he will come back to this committee regarding the regional health areas, specifically the area of accountability and the changes that might come about.  We all had concerns.  I know the Minister rejected some of the concerns we expressed when the two senior officials in the Department and the HSE appeared before us concerning regionalisation.  I have concerns about that process, as have other members, but accountability is critical to it.<\/p> <p>  Integration of healthcare is critical but accountability is also critical.  It speaks to one of the areas of this Bill.  It is one area of it with regard to mandatory reporting but accountability is much bigger than that and it is a much broader debate that we should have.

Rather, it will be able to be done by way of a regulation brought in by the Minister, as opposed to an amendment to the Act itself.  It is better from the point of view of the legislative process to give the Minister that flexibility in order that if there is a change in the type of management system that is in place and if NIMS is to be changed or replaced, the logic of this group of amendments will mean that can be done by way of regulation, rather than require an amendment of the Act, which would not be a good use of our time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2022031000002#G05700","speaker":"1615"},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":662,"content":"<p>I looked carefully at this proposal to see its implications because I appreciate what the Deputy is seeking to achieve, namely, to provide flexibility in regard to the ability to change the system.  There are a few issues to consider, one of which relates to how the current system is going.  The reports that have come back are good.  The Deputy rightly referenced the HIQA review of May of last year.  It examined the information management practices for NIMS throughout the HSE.  It recommended improvements in the system, as the Deputy highlighted, and the review acknowledged the importance specifically of the NIMS.  The review states:<\/p> <blockquote> \t  \tIncident management plays a vital role in patient safety surveillance and learning.  NIMS, as the system underpinning incident management across the public health and social care system in Ireland is therefore an extremely important national health data collection. This review recognises the progress made by the HSE in its efforts to embed NIMS as the single designated national information system for incident management, patient safety, and learning across the HSE and HSE-funded services. HIQA also acknowledges the examples of good information management practices highlighted throughout this review, particularly in relation to information governance and use of information.  <\/blockquote> <p>The Deputy quite rightly pointed out that there is more to be done.  HIQA carried out a very good report on NIMS last year and the HSE is looking to expand it.  My concern with the amendments, which is why I cannot accept them even though I fully appreciate the Deputy&rsquo;s intent, is that they could undermine the prospect of us having an all-encompassing national system to be used throughout the country.  It is important that the entire HSE and all the publicly funded services use the same system.  There is a concern that one unintended consequence of the amendments is that they would give service providers freedom to say they will use something else.  I appreciate that is absolutely not what the Deputy intends, but it is a concern.  One of the main challenges we have, as has been discussed by all of us at previous committee meetings, relates to the importance of having a single integrated national data management system, rather than the multiplicity of systems we are currently using throughout the health service.<\/p><p>Accordingly, I cannot accept the amendments, although I fully appreciate the intent of them.  It is essential to ensure there is no room for individual providers to decide they will adopt a new system, in order that everyone will use the same one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2022031000002#G05800","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":663,"content":"<p>The unintended consequences the Minister mentioned are, obviously, issues we do not want to see happen.  I thank him for pointing them out and thank his officials for having studied the amendments.  More broadly, NIMS is very important and will continue to be important once the Bill passes and becomes operational.  The Minister mentioned the HIQA report of last year.  In constructing the Bill and taking account of the issues I have flagged by way of these amendments, has he or any of his officials engaged with HIQA specifically on its views regarding NIMS?<\/p><p>I understand it has concerns.  Whether those concerns can be addressed through changes in how NIMS operates may be the issue of debate.

I may be wrong but my understanding is that HIQA would have a view on that matter.  I will not speak for HIQA as it is important it speak for itself.

I am introducing an amendment to section 9 of the Health Act 2007 to clarify and strengthen the powers to direct an investigation into Ireland's health and social services by the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA.  Section 9 of the Health Act 2007 gives the Minister for Health and Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth the power to direct HIQA to undertake a statutory investigation to address serious ongoing risks to patient safety in Ireland's health and social services.<\/p><p>In the National Maternity Hospital <i>v<\/i>. the Minister for Health in September 2018, the court quashed a decision by the then Minister for Health to direct HIQA to carry out a section 9 investigation into a maternal death that had occurred at the hospital.  The central difficulty in this case addressed in the judgment and by counsel throughout was the very high bar set by section 9 of the Health Act for ordering such an investigation under this section.  It is clear from the judgment and from legal advices received that the current discretion for the ordering of an investigation under section 9 is extremely limited and impractical in terms of allowing for an appropriate response to ongoing risk to patient safety within our health and social services.<\/p><p>The proposed amendments to section 9 of the Health Act 2007 will ensure that when directing an investigation into Ireland's health and social services, the Ministers and-or HIQA must believe on reasonable grounds that there may be serious risk to the health or welfare of people receiving services that will be the subject of investigation.  This replaces the previous requirement for a belief there is a serious risk.<\/p><p>Second, there may be a section 9 investigation into a specific service, notwithstanding that a similar risk may exist in another service.  Third, the purpose of the investigation will include a public interest element where a need for learning and improvement of services will form part of the rationale for requiring an investigation under section 9.  The provisions are repeated for both the Minister for Health and Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  References in the Bill are to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and these will subsequently be updated with the new title.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2022031000002#J01400","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1646870400,"counter":717,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":718,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 38:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 50, line 20, to delete &ldquo;and&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2022031000002#J01600","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1646870400,"counter":719,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":720,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 39:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 50, to delete lines 21 to 29 and substitute the following:  \t&ldquo;(ii) by the substitution of the following paragraph for paragraph (a): <blockquote> \t&ldquo;(a) there may be a serious risk&mdash;

They relate to things that clearly happened and it is clear to see what they are.  Delayed diagnosis is quite vague.  Its inclusion would essentially create an unsupportable administrative burden on the entire system.  It could cover anything from relatively minor delays to much more serious ones, including those such as the ones the Deputy referenced.  As it stands, the current list of notifiable events is specifically designed to cover the most serious reportable events, that is, those that cause death or serious injury.  These notifiable patient safety events set out currently in the Bill are clearly defined and provide clear direction to health service practitioners.<\/p> <p>  However, as I stated in my opening remarks, I will bring forward on Report Stage an amendment that deals with the incidences we all discussed at great length and that were flagged through everything that happened with CervicalCheck.

Unfortunately, we have direct experience in this State of how women were failed.  One of the reasons open disclosure and mandatory reporting is on our agenda is because of what happened to many of those women in terms of failures to report and issues relating to open disclosure.  There have been many more incidents.  Obviously, it was not only related to CervicalCheck, although it was cited in Dr. Scally&rsquo;s report in the recommendations he made that we move to implement in this area.  I accept what the Minister is saying that he has got advice, that it would not be appropriate to add it to the Schedule and that he will bringing forward an amendment on Report Stage that will deal with this and with broader issues relating to the failures that happened in CervicalCheck.  I look forward to what that means, what it will look like and what it will do.  We will evaluate that when we see it.  For me, this is a really important area.  If I were to push any amendment to a vote, it would be this one.

The Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017 will continue to outline the process for open disclosure for clinicians who wish to avail of the legal protections that legislation extends to them while the Patient Safety (Notifiable Patient Safety Incidents) Bill will provide for mandatory open disclosure and external notification of certain serious patient safety incidents outlined in Schedule 1 to that Bill. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2022031000002#L01700","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1646870400,"counter":786,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":787,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 52:<\/p> <p style=\"padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px\">In page 59, to delete lines 13 to 16 and substitute the following:<\/p> <p style=\"padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px\">&quot;<\/p> <p style=\"padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px\"> <table>    <tr>       <td>3.<\/td>       <td>Section 7(1)<\/td>       <td>The insertion of the following definitions:<br \/><br \/>&ldquo; &lsquo;notifiable incident&rsquo; has the meaning assigned to it by the <i>Patient Safety (Notifiable Patient Safety Incidents) Act 2022<\/i>; &lsquo;other than in person&rsquo;, in relation to an open disclosure meeting, an additional information meeting or a clarification given under section 19, means holding such meeting or such clarification by means of the telephone or the internet (or other similar method of communication); &rdquo;<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p> <p><pli57>&quot;.<\/pli57><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2022031000002#L01900","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1646870400,"counter":788,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":789,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 53:<\/p> <p style=\"padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px\">In page 64, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following:<\/p> <p style=\"padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px\">&quot;<\/p> <p> <table>    <tr>       <th>10.<\/th>       <th>Section 15(1)(f) <\/th>       <th>By the substitution for paragraph (f) of the following paragraph: <br \/><br \/>&ldquo;(f) having regard to the information available, make arrangements for the preparation of the statement referred to in section 16(5), that is to be provided, in accordance with section 16(2)(c) to the patient or relevant person (or both of them).&quot;.<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>11.<\/td>       <td>Section 15A (inserted by <i>section 53<\/i>of the <i>Patient Safety (Notifiable Patient Safety Incidents) Act 2022<\/i>)<\/td>       <td>By the insertion of the following section after section 15: <br \/><br \/>&ldquo;<b>Open disclosure meeting generally to be held in person <\/b><br \/><br \/><b>15A.<\/b>(1) An open disclosure meeting shall, subject to subsection (2), be held in person with the patient or relevant person (or both of them). <br \/><br \/>(2) A patient or relevant person (or both of them) may, when contacted by a health services provider pursuant to section 16 to make arrangements to meet with it for the purpose of making an open disclosure, request the provider that the proposed meeting be held other than in person. <br \/><br \/>(3) A request under subsection (2) may be made orally. <br \/><br \/>(4) Where a request under subsection (2) is made orally, the health services provider shall make a record of the request in writing and maintain it with the records referred to in section 21.&rdquo;. <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>12.<\/td>       <td>Section 16(1)(b)<\/td>       <td>To substitute the following paragraph for paragraph (b): <br \/><br \/>&ldquo;(b) where a patient or a relevant person has (or both of them have) made a request under section 15A, to hold the meeting other than in person,&rdquo;. <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>13.<\/td>       <td>Section 16(2)(c) <\/td>       <td>To substitute the following paragraph for paragraph (c): <br \/><br \/>&ldquo;(c) shall, in accordance with section 20A, give the patient or the relevant person (or both of them) a copy of the statement referred to in subsection (5), and&rdquo;. 14.

There is nothing in building control regulation or enforcement or in planning law that empowers any agency of the State to prevent someone from building again in the future if he or she has a proven track record of being in breach of building control or planning.  I made this point at the end of the last session but I wish to repeat it because it is important to understand where I am coming from.<\/p> <p>  Take, for example, the developer that built Priory Hall, the developer that build Beacon South Quarter, the developer that built Br&uacute; na Sionna or whatever.  The Minister of State knows them as well as I.  These are houses, apartments and duplexes that hard-working families spent considerable sums of money on to purchase as homes.  In each of those cases, even if building control had been taken to its absolute limit, which it was not in most cases with the possible exception of Priory Hall, and the building contractor, developer or other associated construction professionals had been found to be in breach of building controls, fined or even imprisoned &ndash; breaches of the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations can carry custodial sentences &ndash; none of that would have prevented the very same builders, developers or contractors from starting up the next day, creating new companies and getting back in the game.  In fact, the developer of Priory Hall is back in the building game in another jurisdiction.  That is a matter of public record.<\/p> <p>  I accept that what I am proposing is outside the scope of what the Government is bringing to us, but my argument is that we have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to provide a level of deterrence to ensure that construction industry professionals operate with the level of competence that this register requests them to have.  I know that the Minister of State will not accept my amendment, but this is one where I wish to at least try to reason with him to go away and consider the proposition.  If we do not do this, either in the form of my amendment or some other amendment that his team comes back with, we will essentially be saying &ndash; because the Government has no other plans to deal with this dilemma in any other part of the legislative programme &ndash; that we do not believe that people who build defective buildings should be prohibited from building more buildings.  The Minister of State referred to a failure of competence.  What better example is there of a failure of competence than building Priory Hall, Br&uacute; na Sionna or Beacon South Quarter?<\/p> <p>  I appeal to the Minister of State to extend the scope of this legislation beyond what it is currently being proposed to do.  This would give a level of comfort to people, be they signing a contract for a home extension or buying an apartment, duplex or house.  Yes, there are building controls and people could make formal complaints to the building control authorities, which could instigate an investigation and pursue the matter.<\/p><p>In parallel, they could take a case to this register and if they could demonstrate a failure of competence and compliance with building control regulations, that person would be struck off.  I will give one example and then I will conclude.  The example I will give is in the public domain and well established.<\/p><p> There is a former Ben Dunne gymnasium on the Coldcut Road in my constituency.  A developer bought it and successfully applied for planning permission for 37 apartments.  That was a good thing because the area needs apartments.  He decided not to proceed and applied for 48 apartments, was refused by the local authority, appealed to the board and yet fitted out the 48 apartments and got tenants for all of them.  They are all fully occupied today.  Not a single certificate under the building control (amendment) regulations was submitted to the local authority.  There was no commencement notice, fire certificate or completion certificate.<\/p><p> The developer is flagrantly in breach of building control regulations and planning permission but is permitted to continue to develop on a case-by-case basis subject to getting planning permission and all the rest of it.  Even if South Dublin County Council concludes a successful building control enforcement action against him, which is a big if, and gets the maximum fine of &euro;5,000 per breach of the building control amendment regulations, which is what that legislation stipulates, he can still go out the next day and continue the same practice.  That must be outlawed and this legislation provides us with an opportunity to do that.<\/p><p> The Minister of State can see I am genuinely passionate about this issue having worked with many of these issues, as has Deputy Cian O'Callaghan.  I know the Minister of State will not accept this amendment now.  I urge him to discuss the matter with his officials and find a way of ensuring that someone who has been found to be in breach of the building control regulations will not be allowed to be on this register.<\/p><p> In the case I am talking about, the developer in question, who is also a landlord, took a bunch of tenants to the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, over rent arrears.  In the case in the RTB - again this is on the public record - I testified and demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt that he had not complied with building control (amendment) regulations.  He had not supplied any certificates for the 48 apartments.  He accepted that on the record of the RTB hearing.  It is a matter of fact, established in the legally binding determination that is published.  That should be sufficient evidence for somebody to make a complaint to the construction industry register, outlining that as this individual has accepted they flagrantly broke building control (amendment) regulations and building control law, they should be struck off and never be allowed to build again.  That is what I am urging the Minister of State to do.<\/p><p> This legislation provides an opportunity to do this, although perhaps not with the wording or in the section I have proposed.  If the Minister of State does not accept this, he will be missing an opportunity to make a profound change to our building regime and construction sector, and I think people will not forgive the Government.  People will look on this as a lost opportunity to do something really significant.  Whatever the Minister of State might say in response to me, I urge him to go back to the Department and consider this because it could be a really positive step if it is done in the right way.<\/p><p> People will thank the Minister of State personally and the building industry would also benefit from it because it would help to flush out the rogue operators and ensure that good, professional, high-quality construction industry professionals would be able to operate in a much cleaner environment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022031000002#A00600","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":808,"content":"<p>Is the Deputy suggesting that someone should be struck off for any breach of building control regulations?

This section is about individuals having the right to make a complaint against someone who is registered and for that complaint to be investigated.  Just because breach of building regulations is one of the grounds for complaint, if it is minor, it does not necessarily mean that the person would be struck off the register.  If there were serious breaches of building control regulations, people could raise a complaint and they could be struck off the register which would then mean they would no longer be able to build; it would not be legal for them to do so.  When that is said out loud, I am very confident there is agreement in all parties across the Oireachtas.  I do not believe anyone thinks it is in any way tolerable for people to have flagrant breaches of building control regulations on an ongoing basis, especially given recent history in this country and the massive costs we have talked about already.<\/p> <p>  As Deputy &Oacute; Broin said, people in the industry want this.  Some of the most vocal people on this are builders.  We often hear of builders who have experience of working in the UK, for example.  They come back here and cannot get over how lax some of these things are and why it is tolerated.  Most builders take pride in their work and they do not want a minority of rogue builders who create enormous damage and reputational damage for everyone working in the industry.  People who are serious about the industry, which is most people engaged in it, want this addressed.  At a political level, across all parties, I presume everyone wants this addressed.  The public want it addressed.  If it is not done in this legislation, it will not be addressed.  There is a very strong case for it.<\/p> <p>  I understand the rationale that this is constructed on the basis that people can only make complaints on the technical side related to registration.  However, this section deals with competence, criteria and compliance with the building control regulations on a consistent basis.  It is a very important form of competence and is highly relevant in that sense.  If it is not included in the legislation, especially now that an amendment has been proposed on it, it almost implies that there is a view in the Oireachtas that that would not be an important part of competence for a builder.  Clearly, we would all have the view that it is.<\/p> <p>  I agree with what Deputy &Oacute; Broin has said.  I ask the Minister of State to see if this can be done in a way that he is happy with.  He may be able to introduce an amendment on Report Stage.  If we do not do that, it could be years before this is addressed elsewhere.  We appreciate that there is other legislation relating to building control, but we must be able to make it illegal for people who were in flagrant breach of building control regulations to build; they must be struck off.  The whole point of having a register is that people like that can be struck off.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022031000002#B00700","speaker":"1550"},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":814,"content":"<p>I again thank the members for their contributions.  We take any breaches of the Building Control Act and the planning Acts very seriously.  Some of the examples mentioned have caused heartbreak for people, which is the last thing we want to see happen.  It is part of a broader response.  Section 44 sets out the grounds for complaint and competence is referred to in section 44(1)(d).  Section 28(2)(b) refers to building control regulations in terms of grounds for competence which is important.<\/p> <p>  Any convictions relating to building control, notices from the court or enforcement notices will be published on the register.  That information is available for consumers engaging contractors who may have been convicted in the past or had an order enforced by the courts in the past.  That is a very strong safeguard for consumers who are engaging building contractors.<\/p> <p>  Having a number of State bodies potentially adjudicating on one single case can be a difficulty.  In the wider spectrum, including procurement law, many other parts that deliver public infrastructure need to be looked at regarding past performance of building contractors to protect individuals.

Let us imagine I am a developer and following an enforcement by a local authority, I have been found in significant breach of the building control regulations and I have been fined.  Let us imagine some other legal binding documents, such as RTB determinations or planning decisions, reflect that.  Publishing that but allowing me to continue to trade would be the equivalent of somebody who is convicted in the courts for serious drink driving offences not losing his or her licence but simply publishing that he or she has a conviction for serious drink driving and causing, for example, damage to persons as a result.  The idea that we are saying it would still be permissible to trade for those egregious breaches is a fundamental weakness of our system.  I will not labour the point.  We have a lot of business to get through.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State does not understand the opportunity that he is giving up here.  I appreciate that his officials will advise him to stick to the text.  That is their job.  I am appealing to him at a political level, not at a Civil Service level.  I mean no disrespect to the officials, who have done a good job in bringing the legislation to this point.  I am appealing to him as a politician to go away and think about this.  What of people who are guilty of egregious breaches of building control regulation that have had devastating impacts on people's lives, including, for example, in the case of Priory Hall?  A man took his own life because of the stress and strain.  To the credit of a former party colleague of the Minister of State, the former Taoiseach, Mr. Enda Kenny, at that point in time intervened and ensured the problem would be resolved, but it took that loss of life.<\/p> <p>  I am politically appealing that the Minister of State goes away and thinks about this.  If we do not do it in this Bill, I guarantee I will come back to him in a few years stating that we missed an opportunity and we will not have that again, unless there is a change of Government or there is a change of policy.<\/p> <p>  I will press these amendments and I will call votes on them.  I am appealing to the Minister of State to think hard about this before he discards the central proposition my party is making because we will return to this on Report Stage and in the Seanad.  I would much prefer him to bring forward a much more competent and appropriate form of amendment to deal with the matter.  If we do not do it here, what we are essentially saying is that people who egregiously break building control regulations and planning conditions can still trade.

In this entire process, the onus is put on individuals to come forward and make complaints.  That can be quite off-putting and onerous as it is.  Many people just will not do that.  Even if these processes are relatively easy to navigate, if people are not used to doing that they can find it very off-putting and stressful.  If people have made a complaint and the complaint is deemed to have been sufficiently serious that it at least warranted mediation or other processes, if that does not work out the complaint should not simply drop with the onus put on the individual to have to resubmit it.  At that point, even though the complaint might still be serious, many people will drop out of the process and we will lose serious complaints.  That is the intention behind the amendment.<\/p><p>While it still means the system puts the onus on individuals to make complaints, it just means that when they do that it is less likely that their complaint will be dropped or lost if the mediation processes do not work out.  It takes their complaint that bit more seriously, makes it a little more user friendly in that sense and places a little less of a burden on individuals who come forward to make complaints.  It also means that if the complaint is initially put into a mediation process or some other informal process, the individual is not put at a disadvantage just because that does not work out.  Those types of processes should never put somebody at a disadvantage.  There should always be an additional means of resolving things rather than something that might mean the complaint effectively runs into the ground.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022031000002#E01800","speaker":"1550"},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":870,"content":"<p>I concur with the Deputy, and my amendment is trying to achieve the same objective.  I find subsection (4) very odd.  If I make a complaint to the Residential Tenancies Board today about my landlord breaching the terms of the tenancy agreement, the first thing the RTB will do is recommend mediation.  As I always recommend to constituents, always go for mediation.  It is the reasonable thing to do.  If the mediation takes place and it does not provide a suitable outcome, the Residential Tenancies Board automatically moves to adjudication.  It has its hearing and its decision.  It would be nonsensical to say that if mediation breaks down because, for example, the building contractor does not participate or is just obstructive, the complainant has to go and make a fresh complaint.  Unless I am misinterpreting section 44(4), it is essentially suggesting that it has to go back to the start.  Deputy Cian O'Callaghan's amendment is probably better drafted than mine in the sense that it refers back to the board for investigation.  However, one way or another, if mediation fails for whatever reason, it should automatically go into the adjudication phase rather than requiring somebody to step out of the process and start again.

I know they are not the same but the point I am going to make will be clear to the Minister of State when I make it.  The inspectors are the people who sift through all the information, talk to the relevant parties and consider all of the matters at hand.  If they are not empowered to make a recommendation in terms of the sanction, who is?

The inspector is the person who goes out and assesses the planning application and goes through all the files.  Because of that knowledge, the inspector then makes a recommendation as to whether the board should proceed or not.  It is up to the board, as we know from An Bord Plean&aacute;la, not to accept the recommendation of the inspector.  It is unusual in the case of the Residential Tenancies Board for the recommendation of an adjudicator not to be accepted but I cannot see how the board could make a better decision without a recommendation from the person who knows the finer grain of the complaint and the information pertaining to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022031000002#E02900","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":882,"content":"<p>I will now address amendment No. 42.

Such a recommendation might be that the matter is for the board to decide.  It may be that a particular case is finely tuned and the inspector is not in a position to make such a recommendation.  However, I see no reason not to allow the inspector to make a recommendation because the inspector will have spent far more time sifting through the fine grain of the case.

Does the Minister of State mind me asking why?  This is an issue we often have.  If one considers the Residential Tenancies Board, for example, that board would certainly not issue fines of &euro;500,000.  Certainly when one is getting to that level of fine, there is an argument for a court prosecution.  The Residential Tenancies Board can, however, impose fines of up to &euro;20,000 on foot of a determination approved by the board.  It does not require any recourse to the courts.  There is a reason I say this.  It relates to my amendment, which I will come to shortly after we have dealt with this one.  Clearly there is a view, and the current Attorney General is on record as being of this view, that administrative justice is disliked.  Those who hold this view believe that any level of fine should always go to the courts.  Surely there should be some provision for a level of fine that can be issued by the board, which would then allow for certain levels of sanctions to progress much more quickly.  Clearly, the person against whom that sanction is imposed could then decide to appeal it to the court.  If all fines have to require a level of prosecution, does this not create an unnecessary delay, particularly for low to mid-level orders of fines or sanctions rather than for the very high level the Minister of State has just outlined?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022031000002#G02300","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":927,"content":"<p>I hear the Deputy's case.  It is the gravity, when compared to the Residential Tenancies Board, in the context of someone earning a livelihood and potentially, their reputation.  There is a higher threshold to be looked at in going for a prosecution, as opposed to making a fine.  It is a more significant issue.  We can look more into this and I can commit to having another look at it with the officials and perhaps checking with the Attorney General's office about it again.  I can see, however, that the gravity is very different in terms of the two instances..<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022031000002#G02400","speaker":"1595"},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":928,"content":"<p>Absolutely.  I will outline the only reason I would encourage the Minister of State to look at it.  Let us go back to the discussion we had earlier about the building control amendment regulations, BCAR.  The maximum fine for a breach of BCAR is &euro;5,000.  It might be &euro;10,000 but from memory, I believe it is &euro;5,000.  That is lower than some of the upper ends of the Residential Tenancies Board fines, for example for landlords not adequately addressing the issue of antisocial behaviour and criminal activity of their tenants.  We have seen a range of such fines of &euro;15,000 to &euro;20,000 imposed by the board without recourse to the courts.  That can be quite a stiff penalty.  If a person is a sole trader and out doing dodgy extensions for people, the idea of getting hit with a fine of &euro;10,000 or &euro;20,000 just on foot of a decision by the board, could be a much nimbler instrument then a formal court prosecution.  I am not in any way arguing that the board should be allowed to impose fines of &euro;500,000.  That should be in the courts.  One of the weaknesses of this section of the Bill is that there is not enough flexibility in some of the sanctions that could be applied.  I ask the Minister of State to consider this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022031000002#G02500","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":929,"content":"<p>The Minister of State has said that he will consider that.

The difficulty is that we are dealing with such a broad range of suppliers, from very small operators and specialist operators right up to larger providers.  I absolutely hear what the Minister of State has said about the level of sanction.  I would want that to be a court proceeding.  I also hear what Deputy &Oacute; Broin has said about wanting to give the legislation teeth and making sure it is doing what all of us in the room want it to do.  A key issue is how it interacts with other regulations.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Cian O'Callaghan has raised the issue of the submissions many Deputies have received from the Heating and Plumbing Association of Ireland.  They are an example of suppliers that provide both labour and materials.  They are subject to their own specialist registered employment agreement.  It is recognised that there is a difference between what they do and what many other suppliers in the construction industry do. This is recognised by the different registered employment agreement.<\/p> <p>  There is a balance to be achieved in what the Minister of State and Deputy &Oacute; Broin are playing out here in front of us.  Some of those mechanical contractors are registered with a whole range of different regulatory bodies, for example the gas installer in a planned extension may be registered with the Oil Firing Technical Association, OFTEC, or the Register of Gas Installers of Ireland, RGII. There are a range of different regulatory bodies.  For smaller and specialist type providers we must ensure that we get this balance right.  Perhaps the solution is under section 4(b).  Deputy O'Callaghan had said the issue was raised after the amendments deadline had closed.  Perhaps, rather than changing the argument that the Minister is making, it would be better to go back to change the definition in section 4(b)  where gas works refers more to mechanical building services instead.  Given that we are past the deadline, however, perhaps the Seanad could deal with this.  It is a good example of how we need to be careful about getting that balance, which both the Minister of State and Deputy &Oacute; Broin rightly argue for.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022031000002#G02700","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":931,"content":"<p>Even though it does not neatly fit into this Stage, as both Deputies have mentioned it, I will highlight the fact that I may bring forward an amendment on Report Stage.

Section 53 relates to the application to the High Court to confirm a decision to impose a major sanction so we are saying a major sanction is to be imposed or is recommended by the board.  A person against whom that sanction has been applied does not appeal it and does not appeal it to the courts so he or she has had two opportunities to challenge it.  In that instance, the board still has to proceed for a court confirmation of the sanction.  I have no difficulty with the idea of a court confirmation of the sanction but would it not be better to place the responsibility on the person or entity who is being sanctioned to take that case and challenge the decision in the courts rather than the responsibility falling on the board and, ultimately, on the taxpayer?  If I was a company or sole trader and the board imposed a very heavy sanction, of course I am going to challenge it but if I do not challenge it, surely then there is an argument to say that for the board to go to the courts is not necessary.  I will not press this very strongly but I am interested to understand why even where the sanctioned entity does not appeal it to the court, the board still has to go to court.

What the Minister of State is really saying is that it is not the severity of the fine that is the issue.  Any fine would fall foul of the Zalewski judgment in the view of this Attorney General because this Attorney General is against any form of administrative justice, so it is not about administrative justice at a certain point of scale.  Rather it is about any administrative justice.  The only reason I want to put this on the record is that it does relate to the issue of fines.  I suspect that if the Minister of State has a chat with the Attorney General and asks him whether we can have some level of fine, the Minister of State will probably find the same argument coming back, namely, that the determination of issues of justice shall be for the courts.  However, there are many areas where certain levels of administrative justice are permissible under the Constitution and this is one case where I think it would be valuable.

This part of the Bill states that the board will set a fee that will not exceed the standard fees of registration.  On face value, this seems fair enough.  The issue though is there could be considerable cost for the board in terms of taking action against people who are suspended from the register for a while.  Their actions or failings create costs for the board.  Under this provision, those costs will, therefore, be paid by all the people who have been compliant.  They will carry the costs because the board will not be able to set a higher fee for someone to re-register to get back on to the register following a suspension.  It is not that the board should have to set a higher fee but I would like a situation where it could set a higher fee to effectively recover some of its costs for dealing with people who are not being compliant.  This provision means that the fees paid by compliant builders and traders who never end up having compliance issues with the board will have to be increased to cover the cost of dealing with the non-compliant entities and individuals.  That wording is placing a prohibition that is not necessary.  It does not provide the board with flexibility so that if it wants to set a higher fee, it can do so.  There is a penalty element to it but it is really a justice element.  Those who are non-compliant should have to bear some of the cost of non-compliance rather than all the compliant traders and builders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022031000002#H02800","speaker":"1550"},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":977,"content":"<p>While I can understand the Deputy's intention, I do not think punishing someone is the correct mechanism.

I acknowledge his flexibility on that, which is very welcome.  As he said, advice is included in the list of minor sanctions in section 8 and he makes a reasonable point on that.  It can also mean a reprimand, a caution or a combination of those.  What happens if a contractor receives a series of reprimands or cautions?  \"Prime Time\" did a significant piece of reportage on an individual trader who does home extensions and has left a trail of devastation behind him.  It may be that a registered person has received a series of reprimands or cautions but the cumulative impact of those would be relevant to somebody considering whether this is the kind of trader he or she wants to contract to carry out works.  My understanding is that the Residential Tenancies Board publishes all determinations, good, bad or indifferent and serious or light, and these are a matter of public record.  I know the Minister of State will look at this but I urge him to also consider Deputy O'Callaghan's amendment.<\/p> <p>  To return to a point we made at the start of the meeting, one of the great values of a statutory register, notwithstanding some of the fundamental weaknesses in this Bill, is that it protects the good traders and contractors and helps to clean up the industry.  For too long, as we know, it has been negatively affected by a portion of contractors, both legal companies and individual sole traders, who have behaved recklessly.  To ensure the maximum level of public confidence is restored, everything should be published.  It would then be up to individuals to decide if they want to take on somebody.  For example, if Deputy O'Callaghan and I were both contractors and the Minister of State was deciding which of us to choose to do his home extension, and I had a litany of minor sanctions but Deputy O'Callaghan's record was a clean as a whistle, who would the Minister of State choose?  I would prefer him to know that I had received all those sanctions or reprimands and Deputy O'Callaghan had done nothing wrong.  I urge the Minister of Sate to consider that in the context of his examination of the two earlier amendments.  Perhaps a balance can be found where some information is published.  My preference, like that of Deputy O'Callaghan, is that all of it would be published.  Consumers should have the right to know, even if I have a long list of minor infractions, because the other trader in this case, Deputy O'Callaghan, has no infractions.

This is an opportunity for the Minister of State to clarify the provisions of section 63, in which case I may be happy to withdraw our opposition to the section.  Section 63 deals with the relationship between investigation and criminal proceedings.  Subsection (1) states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIf a sanction is imposed on a person under <i>section 49(2) <\/i>or <i>sections 50, 52 <\/i>or <i>53,<\/i>as the case may be, and the improper conduct in respect of which the sanction is imposed is an offence under this Act, the person is not liable to criminal proceedings for the offence in respect of the matter concerned. <\/blockquote> <p>Will the Minister of State fully explain what the implications of that final clause are?  When a complaint is made against a registered contractor, an investigation takes place, a sanction is issued and that sanction is then be confirmed in the courts.  Is it the case, however, that neither the board nor a third party could instigate any criminal proceedings with respect to the same matter on foot of that court decision?  If that is the case, particularly with respect to third parties, not with respect to the board which has done its work and a sanction has been imposed, that a third party, for example, the homebuyer who has bought a defective home, would not be able to instigate any legal proceedings or seek any criminal proceedings for damages?

This section is very clear.  I refer to the lengthy discussion we had earlier on the interrelationship between failure to comply building control regulations and non-compliance with the competency requirements of the register.  If, for example, builder A has been subject to building enforcement by a planning authority and that is used as evidence in a sanction to question the competence of the registered person as per the register criteria, and the builder is then struck off, would that prohibit the building control authority or a third party - the affected homeowner - from pursuing further criminal action against the builder?  I am trying to understand the interrelationship between the two potential decisions.  The decision to strike somebody off the register is on the limited grounds that the person has not complied with the competency criteria.  My understanding is that this section would not in any way prevent a building control authority or a third party affected from pursuing criminal proceedings for breach of building control regulations, even if those breaches were part of the evidence to make the case that non-compliance with the competency elements of the register was at stake.<\/p><p>Am I clear in that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022031000002#K03300","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":1020,"content":"<p>It does not stop action under the Building Control Acts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022031000002#L00200","speaker":"1595"},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":1021,"content":"<p>It does not in any way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022031000002#L00300","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":1022,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022031000002#L00400","speaker":"1595"},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":1023,"content":"<p>It would only prevent criminal proceedings under the provisions of this Act with respect to competence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022031000002#L00500","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":1024,"content":"<p>Correct.

It is subjective but the Attorney General and the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel have already put forward the word \"serious\" for use.
