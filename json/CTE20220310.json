Deputy McAuliffe sent his apologies and Deputy Catherine Murphy sent her apologies in regard to this afternoon's session.  In order to limit the risk of spreading Covid-19, the Service encourages all members, visitors and witnesses to continue to wear a face mask when moving around the Leinster House campus and when in close proximity to other people.  I ask members and witnesses to respect social distancing.  Covid-19 has not gone away just yet.<\/p> <p>  Members attending remotely must continue to do so within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the place where the Parliament has chosen to sit.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee and is accompanied by Mr. Andrew Harkness, director of audit at the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.<\/p> <p>  This morning we will engage with officials from the HSE and  examine expenditure on mental health services in the context of the HSE's 2020 financial statements, with a particular focus on child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.  The HSE has been advised that the committee may also wish to examine the following matters: expenditure in terms of the Owenacurra Centre in Midleton in County Cork; and HSE recruitment targets, budgeting delivery and departmental oversight.<\/p> <p>  Attending remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House are the following HSE officials: Mr. Paul Reid, CEO; Ms Anne O'Connor, chief operations officer; Mr. Stephen Mulvaney, chief financial officer; Mr. Jim Curran, national director of capital and estates; Ms Yvonne O'Neill, national director of community operations; and Dr. Amanda Burke, child and adolescent consultant psychiatrist and executive clinical director for Galway Roscommon mental health services.  Also attending remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House are the following officials from the Department of Health: Ms Louise McGirr, assistant secretary; Ms Margaret Campbell, principal officer; and Mr. Seamus Hempenstall, principal officer.  They are all very welcome.<\/p> <p>  When we begin to engage, I will ask those attending remotely to mute their microphones when not contributing in order that we do not pick up any background noise.  As usual, I remind all those in attendance to ensure that their mobile phones are either in silent mode or switched off.<\/p> <p>  I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses in respect of reference witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  As they are within the precincts of Leinster House, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation they make to the committee.  This means that they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they may say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Cathaoirleach to ensure that it is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue and it is imperative that they comply with such directions.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  I call on the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022031000002#A00300","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646904600,"counter":8,"content":"<p>The annual financial statements of the Health Service Executive are presented in the form directed by the Minister for Health, as provided for in the Health Act 2004.  The direction requires the HSE's expenditure to be split between what is referred to as \"revenue\" or current expenditure and \"capital\" expenditure.<\/p> <p>  Within the revenue income and expenditure statement, spending is broken down into pay and non-pay, with further analysis of non-pay spending under a mix of resource type and national scheme categories.  However, the amount spent on mental health services in 2020 is not disclosed in the audited financial statements.  Separately, the HSE&rsquo;s annual report discloses an unaudited figure of just over &euro;1 billion of current spending on mental health services in 2020.<\/p> <p>  What is referred to as an indicative appendix to the revised Estimate for the health Vote includes some budgetary information by service type.  This indicates that for 2020 there was an original budget of &euro;1.057 billion in Exchequer funding for mental health services, including a capital allocation of &euro;26 million.  The capital allocation was subsequently increased to &euro;44 million.<\/p> <p>  The indicative appendix also sets out a range of output and activity measures and performance targets for the mental health services.  However, the appropriation account for the Vote does not report the outturn for the mental health services, either in terms of delivery performance or of service-related expenditure.  Reconciling the budget figures for mental health funding to the HSE&rsquo;s annual report spending figure for mental health is further complicated because of the different bases of accounting used.<\/p> <p>  The framework of accountability for public expenditure on our health services is therefore very complex.  The committee may be aware of a briefing paper prepared by the Parliamentary Budget Office in 2018 which examined the systems in place in the HSE and the Department of Health for budgeting, performance measurement and financial reporting.  That paper concluded that there is a requirement for a significantly better alignment of the programmes of Vote 38 with the HSE&rsquo;s internal allocations, to make the relationship between what the Oireachtas approves and what is spent on the ground more transparent.  The HSE will be able to update the committee on developments in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022031000002#A00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1646904600,"counter":9,"content":"<p>Mr. Reid is very welcome.

The Chair has introduced my colleagues so I will not repeat the names.<\/p> <p>  The range of mental health services delivered by or on behalf of the HSE is extensive and ranges from promotion of positive mental health, HSE-funded services provided by our partner organisations and mental health in primary care, to specialist inpatient and community-based mental health services.<\/p> <p>  As requested by the committee, I refer to the briefing notes submitted in advance of today&rsquo;s meeting, which provide a detailed breakdown of all HSE expenditure on mental health services and associated governance and oversight arrangements, as well as expenditure and associated spending decisions with regard to the buildings at Owenacurra Centre in Midleton in County Cork.<\/p> <p>  Owenacurra Centre currently provides mental healthcare, rehabilitation services and accommodation for 11 service users.  The building is, regrettably, no longer fit for purpose and it is not viable to bring it to a standard that will meet the needs of our service users and staff.  Mental health services in Cork Kerry community healthcare organisation work in close collaboration with the affected service users and their families to find more appropriate accommodation.  The process will be handled with sensitivity and with regard to the wishes and preferences of each resident.<\/p> <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s annual financial statements for 2020 reported total expenditure of &euro;20.2 billion for the provision of health and social care services while also dealing with the unprecedented Covid-19 pandemic.  Mental health services expenditure in 2020 was more than &euro;1 billion or more than 5% of total expenditure reported.<\/p> <p>  Over the past decade, mental health services have seen a significant budget increase.  Since 2012, &euro;325 million have been made available to support priority service enhancements.  These targeted investments have been directed by national mental health policy in Vision for Change 2007, Connecting for Life 2015, and Sharing the Vision 2020, and in line with the Sl&aacute;intecare reform programme.<\/p> <p>  Developments have, in broad terms, been aimed at modernising services that historically were centred on institutionalised care by building our workforce and investing in fit-for-purpose infrastructure; promoting positive mental health; intervening early when problems develop; and providing accessible, comprehensive and community-based services for those who need them and supporting the recovery journey of each individual, based on clinical advice and best practice, while recognising the importance of lived experience.<\/p><p>Funding for new developments has been invested in building our community teams for children and young people, for adults, and for older persons; expanding youth mental health services; developing specialist services and clinical programmes; driving forward our national suicide prevention strategy; strengthening mental health services in primary care; empowering service user involvement; and modernising forensic services.<\/p><p> The availability of skilled staff is a significant issue in mental health services where demand outstrips supply and where our workforce, particular younger staff, are availing of employment opportunities outside of Ireland.  We continue to have a strong focus on mitigating these risks, among other things by building a service that is attractive to work in, by offering flexible working arrangements and by fully utilising opportunities offered by telehealth solutions.<\/p><p> Notwithstanding our recruitment challenges, this continued investment has enabled mental health services to progress the shift from institutional to community care and to improve the overall quality of services.  Since 2012, mental health services have seen a net growth of 1,441 wholetime equivalent posts, while increases in agency staff and overtime equals an additional 789 wholetime equivalents into the workforce.  In parallel, significant capacity has been built into primary care and community services to relieve pressures on specialist mental health services, including CAMHS.<\/p><p> The clear outcomes from this investment can be seen in the following: an additional 18 CAMHS teams since 2012, and generally enhanced capacity in CAMHS; between 2020 and 2021, the number of accepted CAMHS referrals increased by 21%; enhanced inpatient CAMHS capacity and reduction of young people admitted to adult acute units; enhanced capacity within our adult community mental health teams, which has significantly reduced admissions into acute inpatient units; an additional ten community-based teams for older persons; more developed upstream mental health services, including funding for partner organisations such as Jigsaw; greater access to talking therapies, including establishment of counselling in primary care, which has seen more than150,000 people referred for treatment since 2013; development of a new national forensic mental health service in Portrane, which will incorporate a new ten-bed forensic CAMHS unit; design and implementation of four national clinical programmes; establishment of a mental health engagement function nationally and within each community health organisation, as well as recruitment of peer support workers; and expansion of suicide prevention, mental health promotion and health.<\/p><p> An additional &euro;24 million has been made available to enhance and build new mental health services in 2022.  This will allow the HSE to continue our implementation of the national clinical programmes, build out-of-hours services, crisis response teams and crisis caf&eacute;s, and bring forward a recovery approach into all services.<\/p><p> In collaboration with the Department of Health, next month we will launch a three-year implementation plan to drive forward delivery of Sharing the Vision, which will complement the Connecting for Life implementation plan already in place.<\/p><p> These detailed multi-annual plans will provide a clear roadmap for the continued development of mental health services in Ireland.  Implementation will be driven by a strong outcomes focus and a shared commitment to report on progress against these plans in an open and transparent manner, among other things by making progress reports publicly available.<\/p><p> In delivering these work programmes, the HSE will work in partnership with staff, service users and families to achieve our goal of a modern and fit-for-purpose mental health service that meet the needs of those who require our services.<\/p><p> This concludes my opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022031000002#A00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646904600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank Mr Reid.

In addition, the HSE provides a profile of its cash requirements and its projected expenditure on an accruals basis.  The profile is submitted to the Department and much work is done to understand the cash and the I&amp;E spend and where they sit together.  Obviously, the HSE also provides draft annual financial statements to the Minister for Health.  A significant volume of work goes on throughout the year.<\/p> <p>  As for improvements relating to financial transparency and the visibility of information, I am on the board relating to the IFMS, the new financial management system.  The Department and the HSE work closely together on the development of the new systems, which are crucial.  I refer to both the HR and the financial management systems.  In addition, many improvements have been made and much work done with colleagues in the HSE, despite some of the limitations on the systems, to improve the reporting.  We are continuously engaged in that process with our colleagues in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to improve transparency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022031000002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Louise McGirr"},{"type":"speech","time":1646904600,"counter":44,"content":"<p>I thank Ms McGirr for elaborating on that.

It was a very simple question and the response I got was comprehensive, which was to the credit of Mr. Ryan.  The response was that the total number of persons waiting for CAMHS nationally was 3,357.  When I submitted a further parliamentary question, asking for a breakdown of services provided by CAMHS, specifically the number presenting to CAMHS who were waiting for psychology services, the reply, which was from Mr. O'Regan, the head of operations, gave a universal figure of 9,554 for psychology services alone.  If I break it down further in relation to CHO 4, the CHO I am most familiar with, I get a total of 682 people waiting.  For psychology services, I get a figure of approximately 3,000 for CHO 4.<\/p> <p>  What is deeply frustrating for us in representing families and children awaiting appointments or trying to get into the system of CAMHS is that it is very hard to get accurate information in real time in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  When we table parliamentary questions, it is very hard to give families real-time information based on their children's needs and their expectations.  I have no criticisms whatsoever of the individuals who work in CAMHS, who are trying to do their best and work through all the needs of families daily, but Mr. Reid has to acknowledge that there is a serious issue in respect of CAMHS and his datasets in respect of interrogating figures in that regard.  It is Kafkaesque that systems within the HSE organisation are not talking to each other properly.  If Mr. Reid cannot even come up with proper figures for me when there are glaring contradictions, how can we expect to have confidence in his approach?  In fairness to him, he has taken a national lead on the Covid pandemic, but we want him to devote the same energy to dealing with CAMHS, its management and, ultimately, the delivery of services to families.  We remain to be convinced that appropriate resources are being deployed.  From Mr. Reid's level of management down, more needs to be done.  How does he answer this critique - I do not call it a criticism - of how we as politicians interface with the service?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022031000002#D00200","speaker":"1514"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646904600,"counter":61,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

I will briefly describe - I do not want to over-labour this point - the circumstances related to oversight of all our services.  The executive management team reports to our board setting out not only the targeted objectives in our corporate plan but equally the targeted objectives in our national service plan every year.  One of the strengthening processes that I, as CEO, put in place with the executive team is one whereby, on a monthly basis, we report monthly to the board with a national scorecard for every aspect of our national service plan, every aspect of all targets in the national service plan, our progress and the issues and risks in respect of each of the targets.  That is new and different.  I reassure the Deputy that it is not just about oversight in respect of Covid over the past two years.  Throughout the process and since 2019, we have had very strong oversight of all aspects of our services, including mental health services, and direct reporting on a scorecard related to CAMHS.  I just wanted to give that general assurance.  I ask my colleague, Ms O'Connor, to give some of the specifics.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022031000002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646904600,"counter":62,"content":"<p>On the waiting lists the Deputy referred to, the figure of 3,357 is specific to CAMHS.

In theory, for us the waiting-beyond target figure is the 1,700.  The larger number the Deputy referred to in relation to psychology concerns psychology for children across mental health and disability primary care.  In the mental health area, we have invested in primary care psychology to support children because we know that when we are talking specifically about CAMHS, we are talking about children who have gone into the specialist mental health service.  Our priority needs to be to support children earlier in their pathway in primary care or if they are in disability services.  The 9,000 pertains to psychology for children across the different specialties; it is not specific to CAMHS.  This relates to what has consistently been our challenge.  It is now something we are trying to work through in implementing Sharing the Vision and recommendations on youth mental health and in all that good work that is going on.

That is what \"unaudited\" means in that context.<\/p> <p>  The appropriation account, which the Department looks after, is based on certain legal requirements, as is the HSE's annual financial statement.

We have to start there and say that if we have guidance that took a lot of development, we have to assure ourselves it is being used by the teams.  That is one step.

Part of the challenge for people when they look into our system, as we have previously flagged, is the complexity of it and ensuring that people&rsquo;s needs are met.  There are people who are no longer in CAMHS, who have moved into adult services or who are not in services at all.  It is critical, and I fully accept that we have to ensure that services are available.  There are vacancies in that area.

It is a measure to centralise service costs in St. Stephen's Hospital and St. Catherine's ward.  We have decided to move 19 people 30 km away from their homes.  I spoke to a man on Monday who was crying because he is so distressed.  He has never left Midleton and never lived anywhere else.  None of the people are going into community settings as far as I can see, despite the fact that community settings are being used as a reason to close down Owenacurra.  At the end of this process, only one person will be in a community setting.  The other 18 people will be in congregated settings or nursing homes.  Is the Department overseeing this?  Is it happy with this type of capital cost decision-making?  Is there any accountability in the east Cork area?  Is there any accountability for the decision-making on mental health facilities in Cork in the Department?  East Cork will now have not one 24-hour high-support bed, not one.

Mr. Curran's colleague from HSE estates was there.  It was a reasonably positive meeting.  In excess of &euro;4 million went into the Abbeyleix nursing unit, we are told, or what is referred to locally as Abbeyleix hospital.  There are 42 or 43 staff and the site is five acres.  Up to last week, seven beds were occupied.  That has increased this week.  I want to say very directly to Mr. Reid that we have to get better at using resources in this State.  The HSE has to get better at it.  Here is a fine facility on a large site with a very committed and dedicated staff.  Those in the county who are looking to get people into nursing home beds would give their right arm to get their relatives into that facility.  That needs to be brought back into full use with the staff used.<\/p><p> Will Mr. Curran respond on the utilisation of those beds and of the full premises?  Will he address the situation around the day-care centre?  It was closed during Covid, understandably, but then a decision was taken during Covid to move it away from Abbeyleix hospital where it was located for years.  There was an integrated healthcare hub there.  The plan was to relocate it in a separate building and perhaps even a different town.  I know that the HSE had looked at buildings in Mountrath ten miles away.

We are all well aware of that.  The actions we have taken since the cyberattack have primarily been around security 24-7, increased access controls and increased authentication controls where people might have to type a double entry to access a system.  There are some specific recommendations around the recruitment of, in particular, two key specialists.  This is a role around a chief technology and transformation officer and a chief operations officer with a speciality in cyber.  We have set out the process to recruit for those two roles.  That will probably take some time.  We have issued a tender for someone to come in and support us in that process in the meantime.  We are just finalising that detail.  In summary, it will be a significant recruitment of resources and strengthening of 24-7 monitoring, which we currently have place now and which was not in place previously.  There will be a whole set of increased controls in governance and oversight.  There is one particular recommendation around business resilience or, in our case, service resilience in terms of strengthening capacity to the best extent we can when something like this happens.

In the period since the closure decision was made, no information has been provided on the building that is relevant to the closure.

As usual, if there are any particular matters of interest to members that they would like to receive a briefing on in advance of the meeting, please let the clerk know.<\/p> <p>  On 31 March, we will commence a series of justice-related meetings for which the following engagements have been confirmed: An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on 31 March, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission for the morning of 7 April and the Policing Authority for the afternoon of 7 April.  There are then two non-sitting weeks scheduled for Easter, which means that the next meeting after Easter will be on 28 April.  That will be with the Department of Justice - there are a good few justice-related issues coming up - and will examine the appropriation account of the Department and the Irish Prison Service.  That is the last confirmed meeting.<\/p> <p>  We previously agreed that we will engage with the University of Limerick, the Department of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform after the meeting with the Department of Justice, but these meetings have not yet been scheduled.  On matters in the public domain regarding the Department of Health and the HSE, we previously agreed that we would examine any prior year's adjustment to the HSE&rsquo;s accounts once the Comptroller and Auditor General has audited the HSE&rsquo;s 2021 financial statements and they are laid before the House.  The committee did that for a good reason.  Some of the stuff in the media did not reflect that or the intentions of the committee.  The committee's intentions were not represented and, to some extent, were misrepresented.<\/p> <p>  In respect of other issues we have identified from reports in the public domain concerning the Department of Health and the HSE, we have yet to decide whether to address them as part of our engagement on the HSE&rsquo;s 2021 financial statements or to hold a separate hearing before the summer.  The next available date is 5 May.  We could look to schedule the University of Limerick, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform or the Department of Finance in May as well.  I will open it to members, including Deputies Dillon, Carthy or anybody else who wants to come in on that.  What order do members wish to take those meetings in?  Does anybody have any views on that?  Okay.  The next available date is 5 May.  We could schedule a prior hearing with the HSE and the Department of Health for that date, if it is the wish of the committee.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  We then have the University of Limerick and the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance in May as well.

I am sure the committee will join me in expressing profound sorrow and sympathy for the victims of this illegal act of violence.  This event speaks directly to the need for international pressure to be brought to bear so that this senseless conflict can be halted as soon as possible.<\/p> <p>  The implications of the Russian invasion of Ukraine for all of us in Europe are profound.  Every part of Government is working intensely.  In our meeting today, I will cover the elements that come under the responsibility of my Department but the challenge is one to which the whole of Government must respond. <\/p> <p>  Ireland has been always been unwavering in its support for Ukraine&rsquo;s sovereignty and territorial integrity.  We could not have been clearer in calling out the actions of Russia for what they are, that is, a blatant violation of the UN Charter and a breach of international law for which Russia must be held solely accountable.  Ireland has been at the forefront of efforts across the multilateral system to respond to Russian aggression, alleviate the humanitarian crisis and bring an end to this conflict.  We have joined with 38 other state parties in referring the situation in Ukraine to the International Criminal Court, ICC, to investigate alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity.  By taking this action, the ICC prosecutor is now able to immediately begin a formal investigation.<\/p> <p>  The committee will also be aware of our decisive action at the UN Security Council and the UN General Assembly.  When Russia vetoed a Security Council resolution, we moved immediately to vote in favour of an emergency session of the General Assembly.  That session saw an overwhelming majority as 141 UN member states voted in favour of a resolution, which we co-sponsored, deploring Russia&rsquo;s aggression.  The extent of support is a powerful demonstration of the widespread global condemnation of Russia&rsquo;s aggression.  Only Belarus, Syria, North Korea and Eritrea voted with Russia on that motion, which says a lot.<\/p> <p>  We have also been at the forefront of the Council&rsquo;s consideration of the deeply worrying humanitarian and nuclear aspects of this crisis.  The Council met following the Russian attack on the nuclear power station at Zaporizhzhia.  As a member of the board of governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Ireland has also given its full support to the agency in trying to manage the serious situation at Ukraine&rsquo;s nuclear sites.  All nuclear facilities must be returned to the control of the competent Ukrainian authorities.<\/p> <p>  We have also been active at the Human Rights Council, co-sponsoring an adopted resolution to establish a commission of inquiry into alleged violations and abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law. <\/p> <p>  At the Council of Europe, the Committee of Ministers voted in favour of suspending the Russian Federation from its rights of representation at both the Committee of Ministers and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.  I hear today that Russia is leaving the Council of Europe of its own accord, at least for now.  I know the Oireachtas members of Ireland&rsquo;s delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe are following the situation closely and will travel to Strasbourg next week to express their views on this matter.<\/p> <p>  At the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, along with 44 other states, we invoked the so-called Moscow mechanism, which allows a mission of experts to be convened to establish the facts and circumstances surrounding Russia&rsquo;s possible violations of international human rights law, war crimes and crimes against humanity.  Full, safe and unhindered access to provide humanitarian assistance is urgently needed.  Compliance with international humanitarian law by all parties is not optional.<\/p> <p>  We have looked on in horror as attempts to evacuate hundreds of thousands of people from besieged cities have failed time and time again.  Let me be absolutely clear that whatever is agreed or not agreed on humanitarian corridors or other measures, civilians and civilian infrastructure must be protected, whether those civilians choose to leave or stay.  It is a core obligation under international humanitarian law. <\/p> <p>  The majority of those who have fled Ukraine are women and children.  Those fleeing face increased risks as they do so, including a heightened risk of sexual and gender-based violence.  It remains imperative that they are protected.  The inclusion of women in the decision-making processes and humanitarian response, and in any peace negotiations, is essential to ensure that their rights are upheld.  Ireland will continue to emphasise that point, as we did at the European Security Council meeting on Monday. <\/p> <p>  Ireland contributed &euro;10 million in humanitarian assistance on the first day of the invasion.  As we speak, my Department is disbursing this funding in Ukraine and in neighbouring countries.  The Taoiseach has since announced an additional &euro;10 million and we will act quickly to get these funds to where they are needed most.  I will talk about that point further when we are discussing the Estimates because we may need Revised Estimates in that regard later in the year.<\/p> <p>  As the committee is aware, the EU pursued all means in recent months to engage with President Putin and to urge him to step back.  EU leaders, both bilaterally and through the Normandy format, made every diplomatic effort to de-escalate the situation and to prevent war.  At the same time, the EU was absolutely clear that further military aggression by Russia against Ukraine would result in massive cost for Russia and that is exactly what has happened.  I have been in politics for 23 years and I have never seen EU member states as unified and as resolved as they are in their support for Ukraine.<\/p> <p>  In the space of just over a week, we have imposed unprecedented sanctions against Russia in three different waves.  The sanctions are hitting the web of companies, financial institutions, state institutions and agencies, oligarchs, government members and media interests that surround President Putin and enable the corruption and violence that are currently taking place.  The EU has now sanctioned over 800 individuals and over 50 entities.  Over 20 Belarusian military leaders have also been added to sanctions lists.  Sectoral sanctions target the Russian financial, energy, technology and defence, and transport sectors.  They prevent Russian state-owed media from spreading disinformation in the EU.  The sanctions also restrict economic relations between the EU and the breakaway regions in Donetsk and Luhansk, as well as significantly curtailing trade between the EU and Belarus and targeting the Belarusian financial sector.<\/p> <p>   We have already seen a significant impact.  The value of the rouble has plummeted.  The Russian Government has had to double interest rates and reintroduce currency controls.  The closure of EU airspace has drastically reduced transport options in and out of Russia.  The economic and trade measures will hinder Russia&rsquo;s ability to finance its military campaign and further equip its military.  The key priority now is the rapid and effective implementation of all of the sanctions agreed to date.  Discussions will also continue at EU level on possible additional sanctions.<\/p> <p>   The EU has also committed over &euro;1 billion in support and, through the European peace facility, the EU has agreed a package of &euro;500 million for the Ukrainian military.  In line with our programme for Government commitment, Ireland will pay its full share of approximately &euro;11 million.<\/p><p>A figure of between &euro;9 million and &euro;10 million has been out there to date.  I want to put on record today that the figure is &euro;11 million as part of that overall &euro;500 million fund.  Our contribution will go exclusively to the provision of non-lethal elements within the fund but it is all in the same effort and purpose.  There will be approximately &euro;450 million assigned to the provision of lethal weapons.  Approximately &euro;50 million of that fund will be to non-lethal elements and that is the &euro;50 million to which we are contributing.<\/p><p> Ukraine has underlined its desire to join the EU.  Ireland has been clear in expressing our strong support for Ukraine&rsquo;s aspirations for EU membership.  My Department has been helping the many Irish citizens who have found themselves caught in the midst of this conflict and, believe me, some of the situations have been extremely complex.  Approximately 45 citizens remain in Ukraine with 157 already departed.  We will continue to keep in close contact with them, supporting them in every way we can.  There are limitations to that, however, given the fact that much of Ukraine is now a war zone.<\/p><p> Members know already of the extensive work we have been involved in with families with surrogacy arrangements in Ukraine.  That will continue.  As always, the privacy and security of these families will remain a top priority for me and I will not be talking about their cases in any detail publicly.<\/p><p> This appalling act of aggression against Ukraine offends our common humanity.  I said last week in the D&aacute;il, and I repeat it now, that we must lay responsibility clearly where it belongs.  This is not a war in which there are two equal contributing parties.  That responsibility has to be laid at the feet of the Russian authorities and the Kremlin's leadership.<\/p><p> I pay tribute to the ordinary Russian and Belarusian people who have been protesting this unjustified assault, often at great cost and risk to themselves.  I read something when I was in New York two days ago at the Security Council and, from what I can remember, on that day, 4,600 Russians were arrested across Russian cities for protesting.  They were willing to take that risk to speak out against the decisions that are being made by their leadership in their names.  The Russian and Belarusian communities in Ireland are part of the fabric of this nation and it is important that we continue to show them that they are welcome here, just as we will for the many Ukrainians who now seek refuge with us in Ireland.<\/p><p> Of course, we need to continue to maintain pressure through sanctions to ensure we provide a strong deterrent to the continuation of this war.  We must also work with international partners, however, to find a way to turn the tide and persuade the Kremlin that this madness needs to stop and be replaced by negotiation, diplomacy and a ceasefire in order that we can, if necessary, be part of negotiated solutions over time in the absence of war.<\/p><p> In the meantime, we need to be blunt in our language, honest and consistent in terms of the standards that international obligations require of countries big and small in respect of what is happening at the moment in Ukraine, particularly the deliberate targeting of civilians and civilian infrastructure.  Yesterday, we saw the horrific images of a maternity and children's hospital where we are told children are buried under the rubble.  That is an outrageous act of aggression that cannot go unchecked.  We will, as I believe many other countries will as well, ensure there is accountability through all the legal mechanisms and entities available globally to respond to atrocities like that.  Unfortunately, however, that is not an isolated case.  I think the figure now is that well over 200 schools have been hit.  Many hospitals across Ukraine and, of course, many civilian areas in terms of households, apartment blocks and so on are being brutalised from the air and from artillery positions.<\/p><p> This war is having an enormous cost.  It will fundamentally change global politics even if it ends tomorrow which, unfortunately, it will not.  For us, as a European country within the European Union, it is, unfortunately, fundamentally changing the security arrangements on this continent and the relationship between Russia and the rest of Europe.  I suspect we will be having many conversations at this committee in the future in that regard from a security, defence, foreign policy and EU perspective as we learn lessons from what continues to unfold on a daily basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022031000002#B00300","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":542,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for all his work, which is acknowledged and appreciated by our committee.

I will say that at the outset.  I commend all the officials within the Department and all the other Departments who are working tirelessly on this issue and the fallout from it.  I want to put that on record.  I welcome the fact that the formal process with the International Criminal Court, ICC, has been initiated when we see cluster munitions, vacuum bombs, etc., and the impact that is having on civilians.<\/p> <p>  I will mention a few specifics.  During the week, our ambassador to Moscow, Mr. Brian McElduff, was called in to be reprimanded - I am not sure who he was called in before - because of Ireland's actions and actions taken here by some.  I want to get a view from the Minister on what was said.  Russia stated that there will be repercussions for countries that have taken actions and imposed sanctions or whatever.  Can I get a viewpoint on that?<\/p> <p>  In terms of the humanitarian crisis that is unfolding, even as we speak, we see more Russian troops starting to move an inch closer to encircle Kyiv.  There has been a massive exodus of civilians.  I heard the mayor of Kyiv say that 50% of the civilian population has now been displaced, leading to more than 2 million people fleeing over the borders into Moldova, Poland and elsewhere.<\/p> <p>  There is an awful lot of goodwill here in Ireland.  I have spoken to many people who want to go there and provide humanitarian assistance.  I have also been contacted by Irish citizens who want to go there and take up arms to defend Ukraine and stand with the Ukrainian people.  I would like to get the Minister's view on that.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the potential for nuclear catastrophe, there have been threats in terms of the positioning and getting ready of nuclear weapons.  We also had a very concerning development around the Chernobyl nuclear power plant and the inability to cool some of the materials and fuels there.  I would like the Minister's perspective in terms of preparedness in what hopefully will not evolve into a situation where there is a catastrophe like that.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the third round of sanctions.  There has been much focus on the International Financial Services Centre, IFSC, and the washing of dirty oligarch Russian money through the IFSC.  Is the Minister satisfied at this stage that this has now ended and that the sanctions that are in place will cover that?  It was stated last week that potentially three companies have been identified and are being looked at.  I would like the Minister's view on that.<\/p> <p>  I will make two final points around diplomacy.  We have a seat on the UN Security Council.  The Russian foreign minister, Mr. Sergey Lavrov, is in Turkey today taking part in the highest level of talks to date.<\/p><p>God only knows what will come out of that.  Apart from our position on the Security Council, what are we doing outside of that in terms of pushing the diplomatic route?  What analysis has been done?  The Minister said Ireland will only move in tandem with the EU but on the question of expelling diplomats from Ireland, including the ambassador, my view and that of my party is well known.  Now is the time, even if we have to act unilaterally, to move on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022031000002#C00300","speaker":"1625","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":545,"content":"<p>I take it the Russian ambassador has been invited to the Department on more than one occasion recently to hear the Minister's views and those of Ireland on this issue.

Will the Minister comment on that?<\/p> <p>  Has the &euro;11 million that is to be provided under the European peace facility been paid over yet?  Is the equipment being purchased centrally through Europe or are we doing it ourselves?  I heard a person from Ukraine on television the other night saying that flak jackets, helmets and other defensive and protective equipment are badly needed there.<\/p> <p>  The Minister said that Ireland is deeply committed to, and supports, the application of Ukraine to join the European Union.  Where does he see that going?  Can it be fast-tracked and, if so, would that have an impact on the European peace mechanism whereby different European states are committed to support each other in the event of their being attacked?  If that happened, what would the impact be?  There are some countries that are ambivalent, to say the least, about what is going on.  Have the Government and the EU done anything to try to persuade them to be more objective in their interaction with the dreadful situation that is going on in Ukraine?  India and China, for instance, come to mind, as well as others.

We cannot sit back now and expect Russia just to concentrate its efforts in Ukraine.  Given the sanctions we have implemented against the Russian Federation and the Russian oligarchs, there is a serious risk now to all of us, particularly in the area of cybersecurity and especially in respect of banking and financial transactions.  There are a number of employees who are Irish citizens acting as monitors at the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE.

I ask him to forgive me for being unavoidably absent during his presentation.  He may have answered some of the questions I am asking but I would like to hear his responses in any case.  People outside the Oireachtas need to hear those responses.<\/p> <p>  First, does he see any glimmer of hope on the diplomatic front?

Is he satisfied that we have dotted the i's and crossed the t's on sanctions and there is nothing left that we could be doing?  Has he done such an audit or inventory to ensure everyone is performing?  This is not all within his departmental brief but it is all relevant.<\/p> <p>  I support what Senator Craughwell said about Ukraine's application for EU membership.  Will the Minister comment on that?  It would be a great signal to grant membership to Ukraine and, indeed, to Georgia.  We are living in exceptional times and it should be done, as I said to him on the most recent occasion he was in the Seanad.  I disagree with my colleague, Senator Craughwell, on our neutrality.

Many people I have spoken to in the North are deeply frustrated by the approach of the British Government and the Home Office to the issue of refugees.

For my own part I merely want to support strongly what Senator Craughwell said in regard to neighbouring Moldova where there is an urgent humanitarian crisis with tens of thousands of refugees crossing in an unregulated way on a daily basis.  This is proving to be a huge challenge for Moldova, a neutral country, and like Ireland with neutrality enshrined in its constitution.  It is very fearful for its own future now.

We are due to meet them tomorrow to follow up to see if we can provide any assistance there.  I have made it very clear to colleagues in the EU countries that border Ukraine that we are available to help in any way we can from a logistics perspective, or quite frankly any other perspective, in regard to helping countries to deal with an enormous flow of people, in particular Poland which is taking roughly 50% of all Ukrainians coming into the EU.  Slovakia, Hungary and Romania are also taking in Ukrainians.  Can we imagine if Ireland had to deal with 1 million people in a week coming into Ireland, to process them, feed them and provide shelter and supports?  That is what Poland is going through at the moment.  The generosity of the response has been breathtaking.  The most difficult issue, politically, in the EU for the past ten years has been migration.  We could not agree on anything on how to deal with migration, how to burden-share in the EU, how countries in northern and western Europe could support those in the south that were impacted by significant numbers of migrants and asylum seekers coming from North Africa and the Middle East and so on.  Within the space of 48 hours the EU effectively signed off on a temporary protection mechanism which essentially allowed an unlimited number of Ukrainians to come to anywhere in the EU and effectively be treated as EU citizens in terms of supports, housing, healthcare, education, social welfare supports and so on.  This is what solidarity actually means.  Of course there have been problems on the border given the numbers.  However, in general the response from countries that are highly sensitive politically to migration generally, like Hungary, Slovakia and Poland in particular over the past number of years, have set all of that aside.  They expect, and are right to expect, solidarity from countries like Ireland in terms of helping with those efforts in the days and weeks ahead.  As of this morning we have had about 2,500 Ukrainians arrive here.  We can expect that figure to increase by many multiples in the weeks ahead.  I will answer some of the questions in terms of why that is the case.<\/p> <p>  In that context, Moldova is under enormous pressure because Moldova is in many ways a country in between Ukraine and the EU and has had to deal with enormous numbers, including some of our most complex cancer cases in terms of a route through Moldova, out of Ukraine.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Brady mentioned the ICC.  I am a big supporter of the ICC, so is Ireland, but many powerful countries are not.  It is important that this process is begun in terms of gathering information and evidence.  Whether it will actually result in a prosecution of President Putin remains to be seen but we have to do everything we can to support Karim Khan, the chief prosecutor, who has now opened a formal investigation and file on this with the support of 39 countries.  Ireland was one of the early members of that group.<\/p> <p>  In regard to our ambassador in Moscow, I am not going to go into conversations that have happened between the ambassador and authorities in Moscow apart from saying it is not that unusual, when there is tension, for our ambassador abroad to be called in by a foreign office in another country.  It has happened in Israel many times with different ambassadors.  He was asked in after the incident in the Russian embassy here in Dublin, which was an unfortunate incident actually because it has distracted attention away from some of the core messages that we need to deliver.  That was not an unexpected conversation and I am not overly surprised by it at all.<\/p> <p>  The entire EU is now on an official list of unfriendly countries.  We do not quite know what that is going to mean.  It normally means that there are decisions made following up that designation such as targeted sanctions or removal of diplomats.  That is what happened with the Czech Republic a few months ago when it was named an unfriendly nation towards Russia.  Let us wait and see what happens there.  We do not know yet.<\/p> <p>  In regard to Kyiv and 50% of the civilian population leaving, I am not surprised at that.  It means 50% of the population is still there too.  Many of them are incredibly determined to fight for their city, their country, their families.  The response of the Ukrainian population has been extraordinary in terms of courage and resolve.  It was underestimated by Russia.  That was not the only thing that has been underestimated.  The resolve of the EU and the West more generally was also underestimated.<\/p> <p>  On Irish assistance, I say very clearly that the advice of the Department of Foreign Affairs to everybody is not to travel to Ukraine.  Whether you feel you want to join the fight or whether you want to deliver aid, whatever the motivation, we have very clear travel advice not to travel to Ukraine unless you are part of an international organisation that is formally tasked with delivering aid.  The UN has done much work with Russia in trying to secure access for UN humanitarian organisations to get assistance into parts of Ukraine.  Those arrangements and negotiations are hugely important in terms of humanitarian assistance but that is a different thing from somebody just deciding to go.  I ask everybody to be clear in our messaging on that and to keep everybody safe.<\/p> <p>  The nuclear concerns are real.  We are a board member on the IEA and there are two different nuclear plants that have been a cause for concern.  I know about Chernobyl very well and have been involved in campaigns linked to Chernobyl in the past before coming into politics.<\/p><p>Turning off the power to that facility or to parts of it raises concerns around safety in terms of the management of nuclear waste, maintaining temperatures and so on.  The statements from the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, have been clear on that and somewhat reassuring during the past 24 hours, but we need to keep a very close eye on it.  The much larger plant, which has six reactors, is the largest nuclear power station in Europe.  The fact it was fired on as part of the conflict is very worrying and it had quite a serious fire in a training facility next door.  Our understanding is those facilities are safe for now.  In all conflict there are very clear rules of engagement regarding nuclear facilities with which the Russian military need to comply and to take note of as opposed to the reckless actions we saw.<\/p><p> In terms of the International Financial Services Centre, IFSC, I have said before and I will say it again, we will ensure that in Ireland we are compliant with the sanctions that have been put in place, whether that be with respect to financial services or any other areas.<\/p><p> On the talks in Turkey, I read in the media, but I cannot be sure, there has been no agreement on a ceasefire or on humanitarian aid corridors, and those talks have ended.  It is not great, I am afraid, but I certainly commend Turkey on its efforts.  Much of the discussion in New York at the start of this week was focused on trying to explore the question of who would approach Russia and how it could be approached to try to change the course of what has been happening.  Certainly, Turkey is an important potential contributor to those efforts, as are China and India.  I would strongly appeal publicly to China, in particular.  It is a global superpower.  It has responsibilities like everybody else in the international community to call out breaches of international law and to do what it can to make a positive contribution towards peace, a ceasefire, and an absence of war.  It is important to state that.<\/p><p> On the issue of diplomatic engagement and expelling the ambassador, as I have said previously, it is hard to say credibly on the one hand we should expel the ambassador and therefore shut down the Russian embassy in Dublin, because if we expel the ambassador the embassy is gone, and say on the other hand we need to be pursuing diplomatic efforts and channels of communication to try to persuade Russia to change course.  That does not make sense to me.  I understand the sentiment, the anger and why people would want to expel the Russian ambassador and many others.  I understand the sentiment behind that and the calls for that.  However, the judgment the Government has made, the three party leaders and me, is that we need to keep diplomatic channels open, even in wartime situations when we are highly critical of the actions Russia continues to take every day, and we need to do so for a number of reasons.<\/p><p> First, we have Irish citizens in Ukraine, Belarus and Russia and I have an obligation to them.  Second, I am not aware of any country in the world that has expelled its Russian ambassador and there is a reason for that, namely, in wartime situations, channels of communication are important if we are trying to work towards a ceasefire, an absence of war, humanitarian interventions and so on.  Despite how angry one might be with a country or its leadership or how vehemently one disagrees with the decisions it is making, having no communication channels does not make sense.  That being said, looking at other options in terms of asking some people to leave is something the EU is discussing collectively and I have had numerous conversations with other foreign ministers in that regard, and I am not ruling anything out there.  Basic channels of diplomatic communications are important if the ultimate objective here is to end war, which it is.  There are a whole load of other things we need to do too but, ultimately, an awful lot of the other channels become much easier if we could secure the end of-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022031000002#E00400","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":559,"content":"<p>I hesitate to intervene to inform the Minister we are into the final five minutes of the meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022031000002#F00200","speaker":"1589"},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":560,"content":"<p>I will try to be quicker.

Those conversations take place perhaps not every day but I would say every second day.<\/p> <p>  The &euro;11 million for the European Peace Facility has not been spent yet but it will be.  That money has been available.  We are also looking to see what gear we can provide and we will make some decisions on that shortly, having taken account of what we have that is spare and available.  The members would be surprised there is not as much as they might think but there is some military defensive equipment that would be useful.  We are making decisions on that as we speak and we will get it to Ukraine as quickly as we can.<\/p> <p>  In terms of Ukraine's EU membership, Ireland is a strong supporter of fast-tracking that process and getting Ukraine formally designated as an applicant country.  I suspect when the leaders meet in Versailles today, that is one of the issues they will discuss because getting consensus on that is important.  The EU membership process is quite complex and has a load of legalities and benchmarks that need to be met and so on.  We should not forget that quite a few other countries are in the queue.  That needs to be managed sensitively, but if ever there was a country whose people were literally giving their lives for the value system we hold dear in the European Union and what drives democracy in our Union, it is Ukraine at the moment.  That has to be reflected in the political decisions we make.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Gannon asked about the Russian ambassador&rsquo;s comments on Russian media.  He reflected the fact there is a very strong feeling in Ireland against the decisions the Russian leadership has made.  Obviously, there have been demonstrations in Ireland.  I think what the ambassador said was that Irish people are to the fore of protesting and demonstrating against Russia or something like that.  I am not surprised by that because Irish people are outraged by it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022031000002#F00300","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":561,"content":"<p>He said we were anti-Russian.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022031000002#F00400","speaker":"1560"},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":562,"content":"<p>For the record, Irish people are not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022031000002#F00500","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":563,"content":"<p>They are not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022031000002#F00600","speaker":"1560"},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":564,"content":"<p>Irish people are anti the Russian leadership and the decisions it is making right now.  It is very important for all of us to keep delivering the message that Russian citizens in Ireland and Russian children in Irish schools should not be targeted or blamed for what is happening in Ukraine.  This is not in their name.  Russian people in Ireland are welcome.  However, the decisions the Russian leadership and the Kremlin are making need to be strongly criticised by Ireland and that is what we are trying to do, and we are trying to make that clear distinction.<\/p> <p>  Regarding whether we should we be sending buses to the border to bring people back, I know some people personally who are planning to do that and are trying to organise that logistically.  There are two airports, or numerous airports, that people can access.  It is much easier to fly to Ireland than to get on a bus and make that journey.  It is a long trip factoring in ferries and all the rest of it.  We should, by and large, try to make it as easy as possible for people to come here and for them to fly here.  Both Aer Lingus and Ryanair have been quite active in that space, as have other airlines.  Members would be aware the Ministers, Deputies McEntee and Humphreys, were in Dublin Airport yesterday meeting Ukrainian refugees coming into the country.  We want to make sure we have a structured welcome arrangement when they arrive so that people are not lost in the airport not knowing where to go.  We are putting all those facilities in place now.<\/p><p>This is a massive logistical exercise.  Ireland's allocation key, in terms of burden sharing, is normally about 2%.  Four million people could end up coming from Ukraine into the EU.  In fact, that is quite likely and it may go beyond that figure if the conflict continues.  For every 1 million, that is 20,000 in Ireland.  We may not reach those numbers, but it is certainly possible we will and we may go well beyond it.  We need to be prepared for that and have a mindset that will allow us to cope with that.  This is a wartime situation by which Ireland is being impacted.<\/p><p> We have seen the extraordinary generosity of Irish people making private offers of accommodation.  I believe there have been up to 10,000 offers of accommodation on the Irish Red Cross website so far.  The Minister for Justice and the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth are working to co-ordinate that, and we now have an agreed management system among Departments to determine how we manage it weekly.  We are putting this together as we go because we simply do not have time to plan.  There is no six-month lead-in time here; people are coming today.  Somewhere between 400 and 600 people are expected to arrive from Ukraine today.<\/p><p> Senator Craughwell asked about the stated position on Irish neutrality.  I was taking parliamentary questions in the House earlier and I think I gave strong answers on that.  My view as to what Irish neutrality is, or military non-alignment, if people want to call it that, is that we decide when we get involved in a conflict or not and when we take sides or not, and our positions are not required of us by an alliance to which we have signed up that can suck us into a conflict and so on.  It is up to the Government and the Parliament to decide what we do and when we do it.  Nevertheless, let me be clear: in regard to what is happening in Ukraine, we are not neutral.  In fact, we are actively funding and supplying equipment to the Ukrainian military to help it defend itself and the civilians in that country.  We have chosen to take sides in that regard because we believe the Russian aggression is not only illegal and inconsistent with the UN charter but is also something on which Ireland, morally, needs to take a stand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022031000002#F00700","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":566,"content":"<p>I apologise for interrupting but I must now blow the whistle because there are other important engagements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022031000002#G00200","speaker":"1589"},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":567,"content":"<p>I can revert to the committee in writing if that is desired.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022031000002#G00300","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":568,"content":"<p>It would be most helpful if a short email could be addressed to any members who had specific questions.

I welcome the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Defence, Deputy Coveney.  I thank him for being with us at this especially busy time for all of us but especially the Minister and his officials.<\/p> <p>  On behalf of the committee, I thank the officials and the Department for the comprehensive briefing we received in advance of this meeting.  We will deal with Vote 28 under the relevant programmes and then deal with Vote 27.

I hope committee members are not tired of listening to me given our conversations yesterday and again today.  I will try to move through the Revised Estimates as quickly as I can.<\/p> <p>  I will focus on Vote 28 - foreign affairs.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Brophy, will address the committee afterwards with regard to Vote 27 -  international co-operation, which has become more complex in the past number of years given the pressures of Covid and now the pressures of war.<\/p> <p>  Members will have seen the advance briefing notes provided by my Department on the two Votes, which summarise the main activities and priorities under each expenditure programme.  For 2022, the overall gross Estimate for the foreign affairs group of Votes, Votes 27 and 28, is &euro;921 million.  This represents a &euro;69 million increase on its 2021 allocation, which is a significant increase given the pressures we were under.<\/p> <p>  For 2022, the gross expenditure allocation for Vote 28, including a capital allocation of &euro;22.5 million, is &euro;316 million.  This is an overall increase of just over &euro;35 million or 12%.  This increase has been allocated to programmes to assist the Department in meeting the many challenges and opportunities we face in the coming year.<\/p> <p>  Over the past two weeks, we have seen the scale and horror of Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine, which has shocked us all.  As we have just discussed, my Department is at the centre of this country&rsquo;s response and will remain so.  The scale of events means that our existing priorities, at home and abroad, will need to change.  This will bring its own budgetary challenges and require reprioritisation and reallocation of resources.  Our work will form part of a wider Government-led response across all Departments.<\/p> <p>  As has been proposed, I will now proceed to make some short introductory comments on each of the programmes in sequence.  Programme A, our people, which is an allocation of &euro;98 million, covers many key policy areas for my Department, including consular services and assistance; the passport service, which is a significant increase in spend this year; our emigrant support programme; and Northern Ireland.  Under this programme, the Department has been provided with an allocation of &euro;10 million from the Covid contingency fund for extra spend on passport services.  Demand for passports continues to be very strong.  In February 2022, the passport service received a record 156,000 new passport applications.  To put that into context, January set the previous all-time record of 137,000.  We are in completely new passport territory this year.  This is the highest volume of monthly applications ever received and is a result of the pent-up demand for passports following the relaxation of necessary travel restrictions due to the Covid pandemic.  We anticipate 1.4 million applications this year compared with 900,000, the previous highest figure, in 2019.  One month ago, we thought the figure might reach 1.7 million this year.  The estimate is now 1.4 million, which is still 500,000 more than ever before.<\/p> <p>  Since June 2021, more than 300 members of staff at all grades have been assigned to the passport service.  My Department has worked closely with the Public Appointments Service to recruit additional staff over the past several months.  In addition, the passport service is running its own recruitment competition for temporary clerical officers with a view to assigning additional staff and maintaining staffing levels throughout the year to meet the demand expected in the coming months.<\/p> <p>  Furthermore, in the context of the national development plan, the Department is making a major investment in the future of the passport service.<\/p><p>Over the next couple of years, we will replace the core technology underpinning the service, which will deliver efficiencies and a more resilient passport system.  It will also give us more options for managing the security arrangements in respect of how we accept passport applications.<\/p><p> The processing of foreign birth registration resumed in November 2021.  Due to the complex nature of the foreign birth registration process, applicants should allow approximately two years from the receipt of supporting documentation for processing of applications at this time.  Increased resources are being allocated to work on foreign birth registration applications as additional staff are assigned to the passport service.<\/p><p> The 2022 allocation for the emigrant support programme remains at &euro;12.6 million, the same level as it was in 2021.  The past two years have demonstrated more than ever the need to continue to support and deepen our bonds with our vibrant and diverse global Irish community, in particular, the need to innovate and diversify the ways in which we connect with it.  I am meeting some of those diverse communities in New York this week.  That is very much a partnership for how we will listen to the Irish abroad and what they need and want.  I commend the work of my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for the diaspora, Deputy Brophy, who will take any questions members may have on these issues later.<\/p><p> This programme also deals with matters relating to Northern Ireland, North-South co-operation and British-Irish relations, which are a particular emphasis of my Department.  We remain focused on strengthening our relationship with the UK in the post-Brexit context, which has not been straightforward, as members will be aware.<\/p><p> The focus of work under programme B, our place in Europe, which is allocated &euro;39 million, will be to safeguard Ireland&rsquo;s interests in the broader context of Brexit and the future direction and policies of the Union.  It will also support Ireland's contribution to the EU's global engagement on peace, security, trade and development, as well as security in the wider European region.<\/p><p> Programme B is also used to fund projects and proposals that further Ireland's Common Foreign and Security Policy, CFSP, priorities, support EU engagement and support the placing of Irish personnel in EU and international institutions.  In case anybody does not know, we will assume the Presidency of the Council of Europe from May to November of this year.  It is an interesting time to take that presidency, particularly since Russia has just pulled out of the Council of Europe.  The Department's costs associated with Ireland's upcoming Presidency of the Council of Europe and the EU50 programme, marking the 50th anniversary of Ireland&rsquo;s accession to the European Union, will also be met from this programme.<\/p><p> Programme C is entitled Our Values.  The majority of current expenditure under programme C, which has an allocation of &euro;62 million, consists of Ireland's contributions to international organisations.  The allocation set aside for these contributions, at &euro;40 million, is a &euro;6 million increase on last year reflecting the first year of contributions to the European Peace Facility, EPF, which is a facility that many people know much more about now than they did two weeks ago.  Our estimate for allocation to the European Peace Facility for this year was &euro;5.4 million.  Clearly, we will be going well beyond that.<\/p><p> The EPF, established this year, funds EU Common Security and Defence Policy, CSDP, with a financial ceiling of &euro;5.7 billion for the period 2021 to 2027.  We are already seeing significant pressure on this fund arising from the Ukrainian crisis and Ireland will have to make additional contributions this year.  On 27 February, EU foreign ministers agreed an EPF package of &euro;500 million in assistance for Ukraine.  Ireland will contribute to the funding for non-lethal equipment only.  Ireland's contribution to this measure will amount to approximately &euro;10.5 million, or perhaps closer to &euro;11 million, this year.  It is clear that this assistance to Ukraine absorbs the bulk of the EPF ceiling for commitments for 2022, which is &euro;540 million in total spend for the EU.<\/p><p> This means it is likely that the overall budgetary implications of the EPF for member states in 2022 will be significantly higher than anticipated.  It is not possible to provide a definitive estimate of the increase this year at this stage as the European External Action Service, EEAS, is still working on detailed proposals in this regard.  I hope members will work with me on that.  We may have to come back to it later in the year to provide clarity.<\/p><p> Under programme D, Our Prosperity, which has an allocation of &euro;44 million, there will be particular focus in 2022 on assisting Irish business to identify new opportunities as we emerge from the global pandemic.  To this end, we will continue our highly successful collaborations with other Departments and State agencies, which deliver effective results for our citizens and business sector.<\/p><p> Our annual St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day programme also comes under this programme.  This year, in the wake of the pandemic, we will connect with our communities at home and overseas, and especially the people of Ukraine.  We will mark this St. Patrick's Day with solidarity rather than celebration and express our Irish identity by rededicating ourselves to democratic and humanitarian values.  One of the tangible things we will do this year is to look at using our greening programme to project Ukrainian colours in parts of the world where we think solidarity would be respected and appreciated instead of projecting green onto major symbols, buildings, etc., around the world.<\/p><p> Programme E, entitled Our Effectiveness, involves an allocation of &euro;50 million.  It covers the management and development of staff, the management and mitigation of risk, ICT, property management and compliance with statutory and legal obligations.  The programme also covers communication by the Department of its policies, objectives and activities to citizens at home and abroad.<\/p><p> The resources for the Global Ireland 2025 strategy are managed under this programme.  This year, consulates will open in Miami, Toronto and Lyon and an embassy will open in Dakar, Senegal.  It cannot be underestimated how important this programme is.  Having infrastructure on the ground in Rabat and Kyiv, for instance, allowed us to provide direct assistance and support to hundreds of Irish citizens and their families to get safely home.  Can members imagine if we had been one of the only countries in Europe not to have an embassy in Kyiv in the build-up to this conflict?  It is a reminder of the importance of expanding our global footprint to parts and regions of the world where Ireland needs to have an influence and a say, and to be reporting back from the ground.<\/p><p> That is a brief overview of the main activities and priorities of the Department of Foreign Affairs for the year.  I welcome any comments and questions members may have.  In truth, unlike in many other Departments, there is generally not much controversy in the Department of Foreign Affairs when it comes to the budget, particularly outside the development aid side, which is where most of the money is spent.  My Department's challenges normally involve policy development and diplomacy, the right interventions at the right time, etc., but the budget is not insignificant either.  I look forward to members' questions and comments and I will try to provide as much information as I can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2022031000002#A00500","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":582,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

I would like to get the Minister's views on that.  I know it is something he said he has looked at previously, but he wanted to try to promote online applications in the first instance.  Could I get a view on the matter given the growing number of applications?  Could I also get a timeline on new recruits coming into the Department?<\/p><p> Foreign birth registrations have been a source of frustration.  I have asked the Minister about the issue a number of times in the past year.

Can the Minister provide the current number waiting at this point?  I know he said he would deploy more human resources to deal with the backlog.  Could we get a timeframe for that?

I declare an interest insofar as I am a director of Co-operation Ireland, which is a body known to the Department.  In the course of the year, we had an opportunity to raise with the Minister an important issue that was raised in the first instance by my colleague, Deputy Stanton.  It relates to the future of the American Irish Historical Society in New York.  The Department granted a significant amount of funding to the society in the past.  I acknowledge that the Government has no proprietary interest in the premises, but we are concerned at reports of its proposed sale.  We are also mindful that there are significant issues in relation to the society's governance arrangements and internal controls.  We know there have been changes.  If it is not a matter the Minister can discuss with us now, he might advise as to whether the Department still has concerns in respect of governance.  Given the strong feeling of concern, not only in America among the Irish diaspora but also here in Ireland, the Minister may be willing to engage, assuming the governance structures are to his satisfaction and having regard to the role of the US Attorney General, Letitia James, whose consent to the sale of the property is required.  As a non-profit organisation, any sale of the premises is contingent upon the approval of the US Office of the Attorney General or the New York Supreme Court.  While the Government does not have a proprietary interest, has it indicated an interest otherwise, having regard to the importance of the building to Ireland and its iconic status on Fifth Avenue?<\/p> <p>  Regarding North-South and Anglo-Irish co-operation and the importance of all the funding under the subhead, it is stated that funding in 2022 has been maintained at 2021 levels.

I think I am right in saying that since the Global Ireland strategy began a few years ago, we have opened about 15 new embassies and consulates.  That is quite significant.  I refer to places such as Santiago in Chile, Bogot&aacute; in Colombia and Vancouver.  We have opened an embassy for the first time in New Zealand, in Wellington, and we have opened multiple new consulates across the US and one in Vancouver, western Canada.  We have opened new consulates across the EU as well.  We will open in Lyon this year.  Last year, we opened in Frankfurt as well as in north Africa, in Morocco, and east of the European Union, in Kyiv.  The way this works is that we make decisions 12 months before we are likely to action them.  Therefore, when the Chairman says he does not see Perth on the list, that is because it is being considered as part of a package which is not yet signed off on but which I will bring to the Government in the coming weeks as suggestions we are making for new representations that should progress next year.  This year we are progressing Dakar, Toronto, Miami and Lyon for sure.  One or two may be added to that list if we can move quickly on them.  I am anxious to do something in the western Balkans.  We have no diplomatic footprint there at all.  There are other countries that have large populations and are quite influential in their regions where we need a presence.  Obviously, I do not want to start announcing names now without bringing them to the Government first, but that is how this works.  We have made a decision on Tehran.  We have, effectively, the equivalent of an ambassador in Iran at the moment.  We have a partnership with Germany.  Basically, we asked Germany if it would partner with us before we came onto the Security Council because we knew we would be taking on the important brief of the facilitator for the joint comprehensive plan of action, JCPOA, or the Iranian nuclear dear.  UN Resolution 2231 is the basis for that deal.  We needed a presence on the ground there, so I approached the German foreign minister, with whom I had a very good relationship.  Germany has facilitated us to have a team in its quite large embassy in Tehran, so we already have a presence there and it is proving very useful, but we are committed to opening a full embassy.  What I said when I was last in Tehran is that we would try to do that in the first quarter of next year.  I hope we will be able to deliver on that timeline.  Obviously, it is not straightforward getting a building in somewhere such as Tehran, but that is what we plan to do.  It is another example of the need to have a diplomatic footprint in a country in respect of which, from a policy perspective, we probably have differences of opinion and perspective on many things.  It is important that, as an international partner, we can speak to people, understand different perspectives and try to make useful interventions.  There is a specific role on the Security Council, which we are focused on now.  The JCPOA should have been concluded by now along with the negotiations in Vienna.  We continue to work as best we can to try to encourage a conclusion.  The world could do with a good news story now.  Getting the JCPOA, or Iranian nuclear deal, back in place to provide guarantees for the world that Iran is not pursuing a nuclear weapon and removing the sanctions, which could allow the Iranian economy to grow on the back of that commitment, would be a good news story for the region and for the world more generally.  As I said, given what is happening in Ukraine, Yemen and other such places, we could do with a positive headline.<\/p> <p>  If it is okay, I will ask my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Brophy, to deal with the American Irish Historical Society.  I know a bit about it but am told he knows more, so I will let him deal with that.  It is a diaspora issue.  It is a complex enough issue for us to deal with, but I got a reasonable brief on it in New York this week.  I understand that the Minister of State is very much on top of that issue so I will leave that question to him.<\/p> <p>  As for North-South co-operation and so on, last year we increased the reconciliation fund by &euro;1 million and this year we are maintaining it.  Given the tension and polarisation of politics around some of the Brexit issues, the Northern Ireland protocol issues and so on, we really must invest in cross-Border relationships.  The Department of the Taoiseach is doing that through the shared island fund; we do it through the reconciliation fund and through supporting organisations such as Co-operation Ireland, which is a great organisation, and the International Fund for Ireland.  One of the reasons we are increasing our contribution to the IFI is to encourage others to do the same.  Multiple governments, in particular our Government, the UK Government and that in Washington, commit to the IFI.  It is important we lead by example in that regard.  It is a hugely valuable fund in how it is spent.  The IFI can do things that the Governments and Government agencies sometimes cannot do.  It can take more risk.  It can reach out to communities that state agencies and governments may find hard to reach.  That is very important in reaching out to some of the more marginalised communities that are impacted by tension, violence and paramilitary activity in Northern Ireland.  I was exposed to a fantastic IFI-funded project two weeks ago, when I was in Belfast.  It was a reminder of why we are spending money there.<\/p> <p>  As for the Security Council, yes, there is an increased spend because we have a team in New York.  I better get this right because I am relying on memory, but it comprises about 50 people, or perhaps just under 50.  The number 47 springs to mind, but it comprises between 45 and 50 people, local staff as well as a really experienced people.  It is a mixed team of different levels of experience.  May I say for the record something I do not get a chance to say often?  Our team on the Security Council is doing a phenomenal job for Ireland in respect of our reputation, our standing and the integration and partnerships we create and build on the files the team is working on.  We have taken on a huge amount of work for a small country on the Security Council, and the team is flat out the whole time.  It is led by Geraldine Byrne Nason, who does an incredible job there, but there are many other people on that team who do not often get recognition here at home.  They are setting a benchmark for how small countries should contribute to global debates on the Security Council in a way that is very impressive.  That is money well spent.  The budget for that was put in place last year and is now just being sustained.  That is why Members do not see an increase in salaries on last year.  They would have seen that increase when we got onto the Security Council at the start.<\/p> <p>  I had hoped someone would give me a note on women in roles of responsibility because I know we are doing well on our targets but I just was not sure what the figures were.  As a percentage of heads of mission, the number of women will rise to 46% from 36%, so we are close to half our heads of mission now being women.  Some people in this room might remember the Department of Foreign Affairs back in the 1970s, when that number would have been unheard of.<\/p><p>In fact, there was a time when there were no women heads of mission at all, and now almost half of them are women.  Furthermore, a total of 50% of the ambassadors appointed this year as heads of mission were women.  That is a significant step in the right direction, and not before time.  We talk all the time on the Security Council and elsewhere about women's peace and security, the need for female participation and empowerment and so on, and we would not have much credibility if we did not try to apply that to our decision-making.  In 2022, the target for women in senior roles, that is, principal officer and above, is 41%.  We are again trying to move towards the 50% figure, which is important.  The former Secretary General, who has received some criticism from this committee in respect of one incident, personally drove this issue.  Niall Burgess's contribution to trying to move more women into senior positions of responsibility within the Department was significant, as was his contribution to appointing heads of mission and making recommendations to me.  It is important to say that because it is true.  That work continues under the current leadership.<\/p><p> On passports, I might outline some statistics.  There are currently 770 staff in the Passport Office, including 130 new staff who joined during January and February.  More than 300 staff have, therefore, been added to the passport service since last summer.  A further 21 staff are due to start in the coming days.  Turnaround times are important in light of the volume of applications being dealt with at the moment.  For simple adult renewals, the target turnaround time is ten working days, but 45% of those renewals are processed within 48 hours.  I get many questions about passports and many requests.  Siobh&aacute;n, who is sitting next to me during this meeting, is a living saint in terms of dealing with the volume of requests she deals with daily.  The vast majority of passports in the system come through in a pretty smooth and efficient way.  Of the close to 160,000 passports issued in February, almost half of the adult renewals were processed in less than two days.  Those numbers speak loudly for the efforts that are being put in place.<\/p><p> For complex or child online renewals, it can take up to 15 working days but is often done more quickly than that, while it can take up to 35 working days for first-time applicants on Passport Online, an issue many of my colleagues have raised with me.  First-time applications have been taking a long time.  They require additional paperwork, which often delays the process.   About half of the first-time applications that are stuck in the system or go beyond the 35 days &ndash; the target was up to 40 days until a week ago - relate to the fact we are awaiting documentation.  There is a challenge for us to improve our communications in respect of the initial application process in order that there will be far fewer problem applications because the applicant has not provided the full suite of information, documentation or whatever.  We are working on the target of 35 days and I understand that the intention is to reduce it further.  We have knocked five days off it in the past two weeks, so that is a start.<\/p><p> There is also An Post's so-called Passport Express service.  I am really looking forward to the day when, in a committee such as this, I can say it is no longer called that name but rather something else, given it is an eight-week process.  It is not an express process; it is a much slower process than that of online applications.  I recall having this conversation when I was in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  People told me there was no way farmers would be able to apply entirely online for their payments, given there were people who did not know how to use to a computer or who would not have access to broadband and so on.  The Department just switched, insisting that everybody had to apply online and, if they could not do it at home, they had to get someone, whether a farm adviser or whoever, to do it for them.  We have to move into that space with passports.  We have to get this system online, and for people who cannot do it at home, or who do not have the broadband or computer skills to do it, we have to have agents throughout the country who can help them do it.  That will make the system more secure and more efficient in terms of corrections, dealing with emergency cases and so on.<\/p><p> I acknowledge there is concern over the issue of foreign birth registration.  Where a child is born abroad to Irish parents and is entitled to an Irish passport, it is taking time to turn that around.  That does not mean that if there is an urgent case that needs to be deal with, we are not dealing with it expeditiously.  There are thousands of cases that have been processed quickly through the system because a child needs to travel or needs a passport for whatever reason.  That facility is still there, but we had to prioritise during Covid.  In the case of many people who were living abroad, while getting an Irish passport for their child was important, it was not necessarily time sensitive.  As a result, we had to prioritise other areas in regard to delivery and now we have to catch up on that.  The reason for the 50% target figure for this year probably relates to the timeline estimate of approximately two years, and one year for 50%.  I assume that is the case but I stand open to correction.<\/p><p> There are currently 33,000 applications for which documentation has been received and which are awaiting processing.  Nevertheless, given we are processing about 160,000 passports a month, the high figure is something we can get on top of when we get greater and faster throughput in regard to foreign birth registration.  Foreign birth registration requires much more paperwork and verification to ensure we do not contribute to child abduction, fraud and so on.  I have spent a bit of time in the Passport Office and talked to the fraud squad there.  We have very good systems that are used to detect fraud through facial recognition and a range of other technologies.  It is a pretty regular occurrence that someone tries to get an Irish passport inappropriately.  Deputy Brady asked about how we are dealing with cybersecurity and fraud issues.  Whether it is a first-time passport for a child in Ireland, which has a 35-day turnaround time and requires additional forms to be filled in and so on, or whether it is a foreign birth registration, there is a reason the Irish passport is the fifth most trusted passport on the planet.  It is why we can get into 190-something countries without a visa.  Countries trust our verification systems and I am not going to allow that to change.  We cannot simply just shovel out passports without the proper checks and verifications.<\/p><p> I am not saying anyone is suggesting we should do that, but we are putting in place, and spending a lot of money on, a new IT system as the foundation for our passport system in the context of security, efficiency, delivery and so on.  That will be in place for next year and it will allow us to make decisions such as those relating to, potentially, using other State-owned offices throughout the country to allow people to come in and apply for passports and so on, which will be very helpful.  For now, the IT system does not allow us to do that.  Earlier in the Covid pandemic, our passport staff were not able work from home securely because we had to have a closed system in the passport offices where the systems were working.  I ask Deputies to take that on board in the context of the challenges we have had through Covid and some of the hangover problems, particularly relating to foreign birth registration, that come from that.<\/p><p> As a benchmark in regard to turnaround times for passports, Ireland&rsquo;s system fares very well.  I often compare us with the UK, our closest neighbour, which also has a very globalised view of the world and has many people it needs to facilitate in travelling and so on.  We benchmark very well against the UK.  In terms of adult renewals, we are quicker than it; while in regard to complex and child online renewals, we are very similar.  The UK is a bit quicker than us on first-time applications but we are reducing the turnaround times all the time.<\/p><p>That is just to give some reassurance on some of those things.  Deputy Stanton might be interested to know that we are looking to move to a new office in Cork, although we have to find one first.  While the offices in Cork work well, there are space issues and constraints and we are actively looking at options for moving to a more modern facility.  However, that is not going to happen quickly and we have to manage leases and so on.  I think that answers all the questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2022031000002#D00800","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":602,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Brophy.

I get a lot of representations from Irish citizens in the North through MLA or MP offices.  It is frustrating that there is not a mechanism for elected public representatives in the North to make direct contact with the Passport Office, unlike Members of this House, to represent the constituents up there.

Particularly for first-time applications, when an applicant was told a mistake had been made and they sent in corrected forms or new photographs or whatever, the clock started again and the application took another eight weeks.  That is no longer the case.  Now, when a correction is made or extra documentation is submitted, there is a commitment to try to turn around that application within three weeks.  That has not been a straightforward process but, as with many things, the Passport Office has responded to the concerns coming from public representatives and the applicants themselves.  It is not a case of realising after a number of weeks that there is a mistake and then starting all over again.  In fact, it is quite the opposite now.  The turnaround time is often less than three weeks after the corrections are made but that is the target we are setting for ourselves.<\/p> <p>  I have been asked about opening an office in Northern Ireland.  I have also been asked about opening an office in the west of Ireland.  We are trying to get people to apply online in big numbers and that is working.  If people apply online and fill out the correct forms, it should not matter where on the island they are applying from.  Of the 140,000 applications made in February, 106,557 were domestic, which essentially means they were from the Republic of Ireland.  There were 7,339 international applications, which is outside the UK and Ireland, 757 from our missions, 11,983 from Northern Ireland and 13,487 from the UK.  There are a lot of people applying from Great Britain and quite a number applying from Northern Ireland but the main bulk is still domestic applications from the Republic of Ireland.  I said when asked about this in the Seanad that we would look at whether we could put some sort of information portal in place for public representatives in Northern Ireland.  I can understand that that is a pressure and we will see what we can do there.  However, I do not want to commit on the hoof because there are resource implications there.  We are not opening an office but when we have a new IT system we might have options to look at our office structure.  For now, we are trying to get the system as efficient as possible and get more staff in place.

With regard to programme B and Brexit, it is interesting to analyse the response from Britain to the attack on Ukraine by Russia.  Does the Minister believe Britain might now be more inclined to reconsider its refusal to establish a common security approach with the EU?  Have there been any discussions around that so far?  What potential repercussions might there be for the protocol?  We discussed earlier the pressures and the report about Ukraine.  My colleague Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile asked about an all-Ireland approach, given what can only be described as the appalling approach of the British Government to its responsibilities for Ukrainian refugees.  What communication has taken place with Ministers in the North on that, if any?  Is there a prospect of initiating a conversation about an all-Ireland or co-ordinated approach?<\/p> <p>  Programme C refers to international organisations.  The &euro;62 million is critical money and goes to some brilliant organisations, including a couple we have dealt with extensively here and human rights organisations in Palestine.  The Minister has stated previously that there is no prospect of funding being pulled from the organisations we fund, that is, the two of the six organisations that have been labelled as terror entities by Israel.  I would like some reassurance from the Minister that funding for those organisations is not under any threat.  The Minister has asked the Israeli authorities for any evidence they may have to back up their unwarranted labelling of these organisations as terrorist entities.  Has the Minister received any information on that?  What conversations have taken place at EU level?<\/p><p>The EU has suspended funding for these organisations.  I ask the Minister for an update and reassurance about that.<\/p><p> I welcome the approach and programme for St. Patrick's Day.

We need to have stringent legislation in place for it.  We need to look at having our own legislation, rather than just waiting for the EU to bring it forward.  One area that this committee has looked at is the Cerrej&oacute;n mine in Colombia and the importation of coal from that mine.  Due to the situation in Ukraine and Russia, the coal that was being imported from Russia has now been halted, and rightly so.  It has been suggested that we will go back to Colombia to get coal to supply our stations.  Where in Colombia is that coal coming from?

We are co-locating with the EU delegation.  The EU delegation is responsible for the building and we sub-lease from it.  I am not aware of it having been damaged, but I do not know for sure.  We had some local staff there.  That facility is not operating.  Our team left some time ago, along with members of the EU delegation.  The co-ordination across EU countries was quite successful.  We were determined to stay for as long as we could, to give a clear signal to Ukraine that we wanted to stay with it, but I had to make decisions about the safety of our staff.  We did that in consultation with other EU countries.<\/p> <p>  In response to Deputy Stanton, Global Ireland 2025 is not just about opening embassies and consulates, although that is what the focus seems to be.  It is also about trade missions, culture, music and sport.  It is basically about Ireland's capacity to imprint our influence in different parts of the world through all the different mechanisms and tools that we have, both online and in person, through multiple different strategies.  In that regard, culture is a big sales point for Ireland.  Anybody who knows the impact of Riverdance in China or U2 across South America will realise the incredible power of music, literature, dance and culture.  We appointed new cultural officers in a number of locations, including London and New York.  I think we appointed officers in Berlin and probably in Paris.  We may not have done so yet but are in the process.  We want to do more of that.  A new Irish arts centre has opened in New York.  It is a phenomenal success.  It is one of the most visited cultural venues in New York.  We invested much public money in that, along with the local authority there and other contributors.  It is a way to guarantee an Irish presence in performance arts and the cultural elements of New York city, which is important.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Stanton mentioned online activity and branding.  We have done a lot of work on it.  When Deputy Cannon was Minister of State, a role which has been taken over by Deputy Colm Brophy, we did a lot to connect the diaspora with each other and us through online platforms.  There has been much new thinking and investment in that in recent years, which has been successful.  In the last two years, when we were not able to travel for St. Patrick's Day, we focused on a massive online campaign, which had an extraordinary reach.  It reached tens of millions of people.  This year, I am glad to say that we will do both, both online and in person.  Ironically, I will be one of the few people staying home on St. Patrick's Day this year.  I will probably be the only Minister who will not travel, but I am not short of travel opportunities in my job, so I am happy to do that.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Brady asked a series of questions.  I do not want to bring the Brexit debate into Ukraine.  The UK has made its decision about Brexit.  We respect that.  We need to work through some of these issues with it with regard to the implementation of the protocol in Northern Ireland and how we do that in a way that tries to respond to the genuine concerns that have been raised.  The UK's approach to Ukrainian refugees is different from the rest of the Continent of Europe.  Last time I checked, although it may have changed, it still requires some form of visa.  It is trying to facilitate family reunification for people from Ukraine.<\/p><p>That is quite a different approach from what we have, which is effectively an open-door policy.  It will put our systems under a lot of pressure but it is the right thing to do.  There is a complication arising from that because we share a common travel area with the UK.  As it is outside the Schengen area, there have been some discussions on the matter between the Department of Justice and the UK Home Secretary.  From our perspective, the humanitarian response is the priority and everything else must come second to that.  It is also worth pointing out that under common travel area rules, a non-Irish person in Ireland does not have the same facilitation as Irish people have.  That applies to Ukrainians who come to Ireland in the same way that it apples to many other non-Irish citizens.  It is important to say that.<\/p><p> Regarding Northern Ireland, I understand there have been some conversations between the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and its counterpart in Northern Ireland.  Ultimately, however, I suspect visa policy for the UK will be determined in London and not Belfast.  We will just have to live with and manage two different approaches to the humanitarian response for Ukrainian refugees.<\/p><p> On Palestine, let me be clear that we support and fund both Al-Haq and Addameer.  They are two NGOs that have been listed by the Israeli Government as being active terrorist groups or as supporting terrorism.  We think that is both inaccurate and a mistake.  That is our position.  I am certainly open to persuasion if there is evidence to suggest otherwise but I have not seen any, and I have asked for it.  As far as I am concerned, we have good checks and balances for who we spend money with and what they do with it.  I have no reason to believe either Al-Haq or Addameer are spending Irish money inappropriately and certainly none to believe either is promoting violence or terrorism.  If I see such evidence, I will act on it without delay, but I have not seen it.  We owe it to these organisations to maintain our relationship in the absence of such evidence, which I am told exists but which I have not seen.  We also continue to talk to the European Commission about those issues.  Ireland is not the only country in Europe that holds the position of being very concerned at what is effectively a shutting down by the Israeli Government of civil society organisations and NGOs linked to advocacy for Palestinians.<\/p><p> On programme D, I agree with the Deputy on the opportunities for St. Patrick's Day.  I am sure there will be plenty of members of his party in Washington and elsewhere next week.<\/p><p> On coal for Moneypoint, the ESB has moved away from sourcing it from Russia.  I understand it is again sourcing coal from Columbia.  I will give the Deputy the note I have on the matter.  I apologise for having so many pieces of paper.  As it happens, the coal is not from the mine to which the Deputy referred.  It is a good note so I will put it on the record.  We are aware of reports around alleged abuses committed at the Cerrej&oacute;n mine in northern Columbia.  I understand the ESB has not imported coal from the mine since 2018.  In any case, policy responsibility with regard to the importation of coal is obviously the remit of another Department, namely, the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, but that does not mean we do not take note of it.  Officials from the Irish embassy in Bogot&aacute; travelled to the mine region in 2019 and met all stakeholders involved.  A report was issued and delivered to the mine management, civil society and the Columbian Government.  Ireland remains actively cited on issues relating to the mine.  As I said, my understanding is the ESB is forced to change its supply lines and the volumes of coal it uses are not easily found.  My understanding is the ESB is now sourcing coal from Columbia again, though not from the Cerrej&oacute;n mine.  The Deputy will probably have to put a question to the responsible Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2022031000002#G00500","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":615,"content":"<p>If there were coal coming from any source, it would not be paid for out of the Minister's budget in any event.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2022031000002#H00200","speaker":"1589"},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":616,"content":"<p>That is a fair point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2022031000002#H00300","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":617,"content":"<p>I take the point Deputy Brady has made and we will have a further opportunity to deal with that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2022031000002#H00400","speaker":"1589"},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":618,"content":"<p>There was one other question on Expo 2020.

I welcome this opportunity to present the 2022 Estimate for Vote 27 - international co-operation.  Through Vote 27, the Department of Foreign Affairs manages just under 60% of Ireland&rsquo;s official development assistance, ODA, programme, which is known to the public as Irish Aid.  The Vote provides the funding necessary to deliver on the Department&rsquo;s high-level goal of working for a more just, secure and sustainable world.<\/p> <p>  This is the first year in which total ODA will exceed &euro;1 billion, with the budget day allocation of &euro;1.045 billion representing an increase of &euro;176 million, or approximately 20%, on the allocation for 2021.  This is the eighth consecutive year in which the overall allocation to the development co-operation programme has increased.  Just under 60% of this total, a figure of &euro;605 million, is allocated to the Department of Foreign Affairs and is managed through Vote 26.  The allocation to Vote 27 for 2022 is &euro;35 million greater than in 2021.  The remaining 40% of Ireland&rsquo;s overall ODA allocation for this year, a forecasted &euro;440.5 million, is managed by other Departments, notably the Departments of Finance and Health, as well as the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.<\/p> <p>  A key element is Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the EU development co-operation budget, as well as assessed and voluntary contributions to international organisations managed through other Government Departments.  This year, the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, which leads on national refugee response, will also account for a portion of Ireland&rsquo;s ODA.  This increased allocation for ODA for 2022 is a demonstration of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to international development.  International development is not simply the right thing to do but, as we have been reminded by the pandemic and, in recent weeks, by the war in Ukraine, our effective aid programme is a clear and practical protection of our interests.<\/p><p>Through the Irish Aid programme, we invest in a better, safer and more sustainable world.  Through the quality of our programming, the aid programme helps us expand our influence and strengthen our partnerships, today and for tomorrow.<\/p><p> ODA is an integral component of Ireland&rsquo;s overall foreign policy and national presence overseas, enabling Ireland to respond to complex human needs and humanitarian crises around the world.  As the OECD found in its 2020 peer review of the Irish Aid programme, Ireland is one of the few leading donors delivering principled, high quality, untied and coherent development co-operation and humanitarian responses.  A Better World, Ireland&rsquo;s policy for international development, provides the framework for our whole-of-government development co-operation programme.  Rooted in the sustainable development goals, A Better World focuses our efforts on four policy priorities, which together ensure that our programme reaches the furthest behind first.  These priorities are gender equality, reducing humanitarian need, climate action and strengthening governance.  We deliver on these priorities through working intensely across three clusters of interventions building on areas where Ireland has both proven expertise and which also resonate with our own development trajectory.  These clusters are in the areas of protection, food and people.<\/p><p> In recent weeks, since the invasion of Ukraine, Irish Aid has been working with our partners to ensure that Ireland is contributing to the protection of people affected by the conflict, whether in Ukraine or in places where they are taking refuge.  More than &euro;10 million in bilateral humanitarian assistance was released immediately, complementing pre-positioned Irish funding which the UN and the International Committee of the Red Cross have released as part of the response to what is happening in Ukraine.  The Irish Aid team is working with partners to put additional supports in place.<\/p><p> With regard to the Covid-19 pandemic, it will continue to have a negative impact on the development outcomes of people around the world.  That is why this year, through Vote 27, we will continue to invest in global public health and contribute to global efforts to ensure vaccines are available to people, regardless of income or where they are from.  In addition, officials in my Department continue to work with HSE experts to deliver improvements in public health in partner countries throughout Africa.  Through the bilateral programmes managed by our embassies in Africa and in Vietnam we are working to mitigate the long-term social and developmental impacts of the pandemic in our partner countries.<\/p><p> Our Shared Future, the programme for Government, contains a commitment to making incremental, sustainable progress towards achieving the UN target of spending 0.7% of gross national income, GNI, on ODA by 2030.  This year&rsquo;s allocation is the highest amount allocated by any Government ever to ODA, and a 20% increase on the cash allocation for 2021.  I expect that this figure will correspond to 0.32% of GNI for 2022 given our strong economic recovery, as we balance sustained and sizeable increases in Ireland's allocation to ODA in GNI percentage terms against the need to responsibly manage the Irish Aid allocation.  My Department is currently reviewing and building systems that will enable our development programme to grow further, including as a proportion of GNI, in a sustainable and responsible way.  We continue to plan carefully and consult other Departments and stakeholders to ensure this is done effectively.<\/p><p> Ireland&rsquo;s international development programme has always been focused on the need to protect the most vulnerable in society.  The evolving global context, marked by a global pandemic, conflict, the threat of climate change, extreme violence against women and girls and growing inequality, requires a transformative, integrated approach.  We will continue to invest in our strategic, coherent approach across Government to development co-operation and humanitarian action as well as strengthening our representation and engagement at the European Union, United Nations and other multilateral spaces, including during Ireland&rsquo;s ongoing term as an elected member of the UN Security Council this year.<\/p><p> Our international development programme focuses on helping those most in need.  However, as we have learned in recent years, what impacts on people abroad also affects us at home in many different ways.  Put simply, to be safe at home we need to invest, through the aid programme and our diplomacy, in ensuring others are safe in the places they call home.  I take pride in our reputation as a leader in development co-operation and humanitarian action.  Our capacity and effectiveness in responding to complex crises are well regarded, complementing our contributions to the protection of human rights, to peacekeeping and to disarmament.  The values that guide our effective and impactful programming in difficult contexts also serve to protect us, while being an expression of our global solidarity.<\/p><p> I welcome comments and questions from members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2022031000002#H01000","speaker":"1573","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":625,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his opening statement.  I commend all the work that takes place in the Department on the critical work we undertake across the globe.  I have a number of questions.  The first relates to Irish Aid.  This committee has done extensive work on aid that goes into the occupied Palestinian territories.  We held a series of meetings and published a report in respect of the demolition of structures, including Irish-funded structures, within the occupied territories.  In the first instance, what is the Minister of State's view on those illegal activities that are being perpetrated on the Palestinian people by the Israeli occupational forces?  Second, with regard to a compensation claim that Ireland is a part of and which is being headed by the West Bank Protection Consortium, can the Minister of State give a view or an analysis of the current position of that claim?  Has Israel engaged with Ireland or the West Bank Protection Consortium on this claim, which includes the destruction of Irish-funded infrastructure?<\/p> <p>  Regarding the situation in Ukraine, I note the impact of the conflict there on the civilian population.  Given Ireland's commitment to an international rules-based system, what actions can Ireland meaningfully take bilaterally and through multilateral fora to promote and respect accountability for international humanitarian law in Ukraine?  We have made a number of commitments, quite correctly, to resettle refugees from places such as Jordan, Lebanon and Eritrea, to name a few.  Can the Minister of State confirm that meeting these resettlement pledges will not be negatively impacted by the welcome decision to relocate refugees from EU states bordering Ukraine?  Can we get a commitment that those commitments will be honoured?<\/p> <p>  What measures, including price controls, solidarity actions among exporting nations and trade policy measures, may be used to ensure continuity of supplies to protect the right to food for the most vulnerable throughout the world?  What leadership can Ireland provide at UN level on this?  Can the Minister of State confirm that Ireland will continue to meet its commitments to ongoing and existing humanitarian and development issues already budgeted for in 2022 and whether additional finances are being sought for the refugee response in Ireland?<\/p> <p>  To conclude, things are getting a little better with the Covid situation in Ireland.  However, internationally and particularly in developing countries, it is still a major challenge given the low levels of vaccine roll-out and accessibility.  Regarding my view and the view of many organisations on the inequality in terms of vaccine equity that exists, what is the current position or view of the Government on the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, TRIPS, Agreement waiver?<\/p><p>What is the current position of Government in regard to the TRIPS waiver?  Does the Minister still believe it is not needed at this point and that there is adequate access to vaccines in those developing countries?

Irish Aid is doing amazing work across the world.  The Chairman will recall that on 8 February last, the committee heard a briefing from D&oacute;chas, Misean Cara, the Marist Asia Foundation, Plan International Ireland and Concern Worldwide, all of which outlined a bleak picture across the world with respect to education.  They were all quite complimentary about what Irish Aid is doing.  We should be doing more, however.<\/p> <p>  Pre-Covid, worldwide there were 125 million girls not in school.  The situation has worsened since then, as we were told.  Between conflict, Covid, corruption and climate change, many communities and societies are under terrible pressure.  The reports I have had from people who have been impacted by Irish Aid have been extraordinarily positive.  A small amount of euro can, and is, making a massive difference.  Irish people are doing amazing work in those areas under very challenging circumstances.  For instance, in Nigeria the cost of security for a girl going to school is a huge challenge and there are issues with climate change and conflict and in regard to Covid where parents have died and older children are charged with looking after their younger siblings and so cannot go to school.  I thank the Minister, the teams in the Department and beyond and the NGOs for the working that is being done.  I encourage the Government to support the Minister in anything he can do to further develop areas and support people across the world, in particular the children who need education, health supports and accommodation and, at the end of the day, employment.  We have seen testimonies of people who have managed to get to school through the support of Irish Aid and reached their fantastic potential.  We need to highlight the positive, but to also look for more, if that is possible.<\/p> <p>  If I may be so bold as to piggyback on what the Chairman said at the previous session in regard to the American Irish Historical Society building in New York, I would also welcome a comment from the Minister of State on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2022031000002#K00200","speaker":"1515"},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":628,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and I thank him for his opening statement.

We know that, as with every conflict, the war in Ukraine will end and there will be a reconstruction phase.  It will be appropriate that Russia pays the lion's share in regard to any reconstruction efforts in Ukraine but if the EU wants to make a contribution and Ireland is required to make a contribution as part of that effort, do we have any spare capacity in this Vote or will we have to look for a Supplementary Estimate?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2022031000002#K00300","speaker":"1587"},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":629,"content":"<p>I invite the Minister to respond to the questions from Deputies Brady, Stanton and Berry and to my question in regard to whether the foreign affairs section of the Department is as engaged with the situation in Ukraine as the defence section.  I am sure everyone will agree that we are seeing a devastating humanitarian crisis unfold in Ukraine and surrounding countries.  The impact is not only serious, it is widespread.  Some of the most vulnerable people in the world appear to be hardest hit.  I acknowledge what has been said by the Minister in terms of the pride that he takes in our reputation as a leader in humanitarian action.  An important part of the work of this committee is dealing with the various groups engaged on the front line.  We meet them regularly and we hear their concerns.  We are as proud as the Minister is of the work they do.<\/p> <p>  On the matter of Ukraine, is the Minister of State in a position to advise us regarding the monitoring of international humanitarian law.  In recent days, we have seen the most outrageous unprovoked attacks.  We see the work that is being undertaken by humanitarian groups on the ground.  We acknowledge the danger faced by humanitarian defenders in Ukraine and the surrounding areas.  In the matter of the scale of displacement, it seems this will surpass, or has already surpassed, anything that Europe has seen in decades.  In regard to the fundamental principle that all parties to the conflict adhere to their international humanitarian obligations, it seems there have already been a number of breaches.  Is the Minister of State in a position to comment on that?  I refer in particular to the work the Red Cross is undertaking and attacks that appear to me to be directed towards civilian objects.  I would not call them targets because they are not treated as such.  In terms of the Minister of State's area of responsibility, does the Department have any evidence of clear breaches of international humanitarian obligations?<\/p> <p>  To return to the point raised by Deputy Stanton, I am reluctant to raise the issue of the American Irish Historical Society in the context of such a humanitarian disaster as is before us and so I will not repeat anything I said to the Minister, Deputy Coveney.  I will, however, make the point that this committee, through Deputy Stanton in particular, is concerned about the building in New York.  We have raised some issues by way of correspondence.  The Minister has informed us that the Minister of State, Deputy Brophy, has been briefed.  I will not ask the Minister of State to comment on that now because of the need for the committee to concentrate almost exclusively on the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine and the humanitarian issues raised by Deputy Brady.  As far as the building is concerned, the Minister of State might keep us informed of developments.  He might acknowledge our concern.  It is a matter we will come back to but perhaps not in the current heightened circumstances of humanitarian issues.<\/p> <p>  My final point is in regard to Ukraine.  Earlier, we raised with the Minister the humanitarian issues in adjoining areas, with particular reference to Moldova.  We trust that from a humanitarian perspective, the Department would keep in mind the people of Moldova at this difficult time.  They are in dire need of assistance from the European Union and the international community.  I do not believe there are any bilateral partnerships between Ireland and Moldova.  I assume the Minister of State would engage on the matter with his EU colleagues.  He might comment on whether there is any bilateral engagement or arrangement.  The scenes from Poland, although distressing, appear to be the subject of some type of order and process.  My concern for Moldova is that there is no such order or process, nor can there be because there is no capacity for that small neutral country to absorb the refugees.<\/p><p>It is just not possible.  Last night I saw the President of Moldova on television make a harrowing plea to the international community and remembering that because of the presence of Russian troops on the ground in Transnistria and across other parts of Moldova, the situation there requires attention.<\/p><p> I thank you all for your work.  We would hope that, in the course of our work later on in the year, we would visit a project undertaken by Irish Aid.  We look forward to your assistance and co-operation in that pursuit.  To date, the visit is merely planned and not put together but it is certainly something that we would like to do before the end of the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2022031000002#K00400","speaker":"1589","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":631,"content":"<p>I will endeavour to try to cover all of the questions and if I forget anything, please come back to me.<\/p> <p>  I will comment on Moldova since the Chairman has talked about it.  I have been in Moldova and have seen at first hand the reality prior to what happened in Ukraine and to this situation.  The Chairman is quite right that Moldova faced enormous difficulties and problems in its own right.  The situation that it now finds itself in, on top of that, is an incredible one.  We can see that for any western EU country dealing with influxes and numbers on that scale, it is very difficult.  I know there will be a meeting between officials and the Moldovan Ambassador tomorrow, so there will be a direct engagement on that.  The issue has come up for discussion at the recent meeting of the EU development ministers.  It is an area that requires engagement with Moldova.  Both internationally and in terms of the meeting with the ambassador, there is engagement and awareness.<\/p> <p>  If it is agreeable, I will write to the Chairman with an update on the American Irish Historical Society rather than go through it today.  I heard the Chairman's earlier remarks to the Minister, so I am very much aware of the comments.<\/p> <p>  I will comment on the main area of education because it is a central part of what we do in terms of Irish Aid.  Deputy Stanton is quite right in so much of what he said and I would point out that it is further than that.  The impact of Covid-19 on education, particularly in the area of gender equality within education, and particularly for young girls, has been absolutely devastating.  It is a fair comment that programmes have probably been set back by more than ten years.  We will have to look at how we engage and work to combat that because we have a very strong and very proud record of engagement on that.  We have delivered a huge amount of really innovative and far reaching transformative programmes.  The Deputy quite rightly alluded to the fact that when one has the opportunity to travel in countries, and not just in the EU, it is fascinating to sometimes sit down beside people who will say that because of the support that Irish Aid gave, through local education, they were able to end up studying in an Irish university and that they have gone back to work in education within their home countries.  Sometimes one will even hear people from an older generation talk about the huge impact that the missionaries had, and which many Irish nuns and brothers had, in educating them right the way through.  One of the things our programme focuses on, and we believe this is at the heart of it, is that necessity to have a whole-of-society approach to education, so the value of education is instilled in the community and there is buy-in.  Because the number of years in education is quite short, particularly for young girls in developing countries, the impact of school closures of up to two years and the impact of non-attendance as a result of Covid have been devastating and children have not returned.  In addition, there has been an horrendous corresponding increase in sexual violence in a whole host of areas as a result of the collapse of organised education.  Indeed, when I was in Uganda, I saw children not able to attend their formal school but they were literally willing to travel many kilometres to attend an informal school run by volunteer teachers in the bush sitting underneath trees because they wanted to learn.  We must make sure we work with our partner organisations in countries to revitalise that education and make sure we rebuild the programmes that have been so badly affected.<\/p> <p>  In response to Deputy Berry, the European funding is not within this budget and it does not come under my remit.<\/p> <p>  In terms of rebuilding, unfortunately and tragically, we are a bit off that at this moment in time.  We will have to see how that evolves through our co-operation with the EU.  If we are looking at a process of reconstruction, and hopefully we will reach that point as quickly as we can, then we would probably have to look at the overall finances.  Within the budget, we have already committed &euro;20 million to Ukraine on the humanitarian side alone, literally in the last number of weeks.<\/p> <p>  It is important to note that we are also very conscious and recognise that there are a range of other issues that Irish Aid works tirelessly on which still exist.  There are issues in Syria, which is a huge programme for us, where we have done one of our biggest ever humanitarian support programmes.  There are issues in Ethiopia in terms of humanitarian support in another horrendous conflict situation.  A range of countries are affected in various ways and we are still going to support and fund them right the way through this.  We now have Ukraine, which is probably the most horrendous war on our doorstep that any of us in our lifetimes has seen.  Thankfully, it has shown one of the really positive responses of the Irish people in the way in which they have responded generously with their money, time and willingness to help.  Irish people have shown an absolute determination to engage on every level in terms of trying to help.  Within the Irish Aid context, we are certainly there and we will continue to be there.  When we get to that phase of rebuilding, that will be a subject which will have to be gone into in some detail and in co-operation with our EU partners.<\/p> <p>  There were a number of questions and I apologise if I miss anything.  Deputy Brady had a question about demolition.  The demolition is totally unacceptable.  It is contrary to what should take place.  The claim is for about &euro;950,000 and there has not been any progress on that.  We wrote to them again on 9 February and that was the most recent contact.  That &euro;950,000 is the totality of the claim that the consortium has made and obviously is part of Ireland's involvement.  I totally agree with the Deputy that it is upsetting and disheartening to see projects, which have been funded through any process of development aid and which are going to help people who are vulnerable and in need, being part of a confiscation or demolition process.  We fully oppose that and we have directly engaged with the Israeli authorities and made our views quite clear on that.<\/p><p> The Deputy and others, including the Chairman, raised with me the issue of Ukraine, international rights and examining the violation of human rights.  We are working with the International Committee of the Red Cross and the United Nations and we are supporting their work in examining what is happening on the ground.  We have all seen the coverage of events that has shown some really horrendous situations involving civilians, including at hospitals with children and with nurses and doctors working in that environment.  I imagine a process will take place involving feedback from those agencies which are on the ground.  We will continue to support and work with them in terms of what is happening.  That also applies to the International Criminal Court, to which the Minister referred.  There is also a commission to be established by the UN Human Rights Council, all of which we will support.  It is very clear, and Ireland and all of our fellow EU members are very clear, that what is happening and the way in which this war is being progressed are totally unacceptable.  We will see that information coming back in to us.<\/p><p> Deputy Brady also asked about refugees, in particular in terms of additional financing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2022031000002#L00200","speaker":"1573","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":633,"content":"<p>I asked in the context of the commitments made previously regarding refugees coming from Eritrea and Lebanon, for example, and other countries to see if there is an impact on what we have agreed as an intake of refugees from those countries, given the scale of the crisis unfolding in Ukraine and the huge numbers from there.

I believe we should be very pleased with the manner in which we have responded and the openness and willingness shown not just by Irish people but by the community and all of the people of our country together.  The Government has also shown a real clearness and openness to respond and to make that additional support and funding available to Ukrainians coming to our country.  That is where we will be.  I do not think there will be an impact in regard to the other programmes the Deputy mentioned.<\/p> <p>  I want to take a little time on the vaccine equality issue and the TRIPS waiver.  I believe we have a very good and working system at the moment in terms of COVAX and the delivery of vaccines.  From the experience I have had travelling in Africa in the last couple of weeks and travelling before that, there is now a large amount of vaccines available.  However, although we in Ireland have an incredibly good track record on this, in terms of the next stage of getting vaccination to work, it is very important to develop the whole-of-health systems that enable vaccination programmes to roll out and to support countries to enable them to deliver vaccine programmes.  There is no question that there were very strong views in regard to TRIPS but, given what is happening in, say, South Africa, where we had the establishment of production facilities funded and supported by the EU, we have wide vaccine availability.<\/p> <p>  We now have a couple of key tasks, as the World Health Organization has been pointing out.  These are to tackle vaccine hesitancy and to ensure health systems are able to deliver on the ground so people can access vaccines.  That is an area where we have worked.  We have made a large amount of vaccines available directly through COVAX and bilaterally.  We have funded, through the COVAX system in particular, the key part of what is needed in 2022 if we are to reach the 70% target we are setting, that is, to get that whole-of-health system support in place so that, as well as the actual availability of vaccine, the systems are available to deliver it and combat the resistance that is there.<\/p> <p>  It surprised me during some recent visits to listen to the outright hostility and negativity to vaccination within countries for a variety of reasons.  That is something we have to work on.  We have good experience through the Global Fund and the work we have done through that on AIDS, TB and malaria in regard to how we actually build programmes.  In a meeting which I had with them the other day, they talked about that key importance, which we support, of building health systems from the ground up.  We build from the community up so there is buy-in and acceptance of the programme, whereas the top-down delivery programmes do not always enable the most successful outcome.  We are determined to work in that area to ensure we achieve our vaccine targets throughout world.  To go back to that old adage that I alluded to in a different way in my opening remarks, no one is safe until everyone is safe, so that is very important.<\/p> <p>  I think I have covered most aspects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2022031000002#M00300","speaker":"1573"},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":635,"content":"<p>There was the question of an invitation to the committee to visit Africa.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2022031000002#M00400","speaker":"1625"},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":636,"content":"<p>That is very important.

The Bill is extremely important and it will change the culture in our health services in a very positive way.  I acknowledge the broad support the Bill received on First and Second Stages.<\/p> <p>  When things go wrong, patients and their families expect at least three things.  They expect to be told honestly what has happened, what can be done to deal with any harm that has been caused and what will be done to prevent a recurrence of such harm to anybody else.<\/p> <p>  In every health service the world over things will, of course, occasionally go wrong, and what matters when they do go wrong, when mistakes and errors occur, is how the health service responds and deals with these situations.  Much has been done to advance open disclosure in our health service.  The HSE introduced a national open disclosure policy in 2013, and there are many examples of open disclosure occurring as it should in our health service.  Unfortunately, it does not always happen.  All of us here today are aware of these tragic cases.  This Bill provides for mandatory open disclosure of serious patient safety incidents.  It provides for the notification of those reportable incidents to the relevant regulator and extends the remit of HIQA to private hospitals.  It also contains provisions supporting clinical audit in the health service.  This Bill will lead to a safer, better health service by placing patients and their needs front and centre.<\/p> <p>  As my colleagues are aware, the Government approved this Bill in December 2019, subject to certain amendments, and it passed First and Second Stages in the D&aacute;il on 12 December 2019.  It was due to proceed to Committee Stage in early 2020 but events overtook us with the arrival of Covid-19.  I would like to outline a number of amendments, some of which were part of the Government decision when the Bill was approved in December 2019.  I will first seek to clarify the amendment to section 9 of the Health Act 2007, which will strengthen the ministerial powers to request an investigation by HIQA into ongoing patient safety risk in Ireland&rsquo;s health and social services.<\/p> <p>  I am also proposing an amendment to section 12 of the Bill, which addresses openness and transparency.  As previously drafted, section 12 set out that both health service providers and health practitioners, when making an open disclosure under this Bill, must provide all relevant information to the patient or their relevant person.  Where appropriate, they must also inform other health services of a notifiable incident.  I have now added further draft provisions to section 12 that expand the impact of this section and ensure these provisions are enshrined in the relevant policies set by the HSE and national standards set by HIQA.  It also ensures they are enshrined in the codes of professional conduct or practice set by the relevant regulatory authorities.<\/p> <p>  Schedule 2 to the Bill contains a list of amendments to the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017.  These amendments are purely technical.  They aim to align the two pieces of legislation with specific reference to the organisation of the open disclosure meeting, the provision of information to the patient and their family, and the procedure to follow should a patient not wish to participate in an open disclosure meeting.  These amendments do not introduce any new substantive provisions to either Bill.<\/p> <p>  These three amendments are given effect in a number of sections throughout the Bill and I will outline the detail of the amendments as they arise.<\/p><p> I wish to flag two amendments I will be introducing on Report Stage.  First, I propose to give the HIQA chief inspector of social services a discretionary power to carry out a review of certain serious patient safety incidents that occur during the provision of healthcare where some or all of the care of the patient is carried out in a nursing home.  This proposed amendment will seek to support patients and their families when something goes wrong with the clinical care they received in a nursing home.  It will ensure appropriate external processes are in place to review serious patient safety incidents.  The amendment follows the report of the Covid-19 nursing home expert panel recommendations that call for suitable structures to be put in place for external oversight of individual care concerns arising in nursing homes.  This power will not replace the responsibility of nursing homes to address concerns that are raised by patients and families.  It will put in place an appropriate escalation pathway to ensure these concerns are addressed in a way that will provide answers to families and patients.<\/p><p> Second, the overarching intention of the Bill is to embed and support a culture of open disclosure.  It is fair to say that many aspects of the Bill have been informed by the learnings from CervicalCheck, particularly the need to ensure accountability by service providers and clinicians in carrying out open disclosure to patients and families.  I, together with my Department and the national screening services, have given a significant amount of consideration to these learnings and the work of the expert reference group on interval cancers.  These expert reports were commissioned as part of the Scally review in 2018.  They set out a new and comprehensive approach to reviews of interval cancers in people who have been screened by the breast, bowel and cervical cancer screening programmes.  I intend to introduce a notifiable incident directly relating to cancer screening services.  These measures are currently with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for drafting.  I will introduce this amendment on Report Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2022031000002#A00300","speaker":"1623","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":651,"content":"<p>I remind members that if a vote is called, they must physically come to the committee room to vote.

I certainly will be supporting the speedy passage of the Bill through the Oireachtas.  All present know its importance.  There are many related issues with which we also need to deal, including safeguarding legislation, which I hope the Minister will be in a position to bring forward this year.  There are issues relating to the rights of social care teams and safeguarding teams to investigate allegations of abuse and neglect.  There are issues of accountability at management level when there are failures.  Such failures have been highlighted time and again.  All of these issues are related to what we are trying to achieve in the Bill.  I welcome this element of it.  Mandatory reporting is important.  I wish to put on record that my thoughts are with Vicky Phelan, R&oacute;is&iacute;n Molloy and many other men and women who were victims of a lack of mandatory reporting and mandatory disclosure.  In my view, we are here today to improve systems for them.<\/p><p>The Minister made a point in his opening statement that is relevant to the amendment I am proposing to the Bill.  He stated the Bill should ensure safer and better health services for patients.  Of course, I hope that is what the Bill will do.  Any improvement in that direction is welcome.  The patients, however, will be the judges of whether it does what it needs to do, whether the Bill, once implemented and operational, will make health services safer and more fit for purpose and, as the Minister stated, engender a new culture of reporting within the health service.  All present hope that is what will happen.<\/p><p>The amendment seeks to establish a patient council.  The reason for that is obvious.  Patient advocates and patients themselves should have a voice in respect of the supervision of the Bill when enacted.  It calls for, at minimum, a report to be published each year by the patient council.  Obviously, it will meet as often as it deems necessary to review the operation of the legislation, but also to make recommendations.  As the Minister stated on Second Stage, the notifiable incidents under Schedule 1 may well be changed.  The Minister has the power to do so as time progresses.  If there are other incidents that need to be included in that Schedule, that can be done.  Surely, however, patients should have a voice in that process as well.<\/p><p>I tabled the amendment in good faith.  I know many patient advocates and patients who have been through a very difficult time.  It pains me to say it but there is a significant amount of distrust in the system simply because many people quite rightly believe there is not just a lack of a culture of open disclosure but also a lack of a culture of accountability within the health services at a senior management level.  I am not pointing a finger at any individual; it is a culture issue.  One just has to look at all the scandals there have been.  I will not go through them all.  We know the full range of scandals involving patients being let down and becoming victims of a failed process.  Establishing this council would be a very important message to send in the context of giving them a sense that they will be part of this process and journey.<\/p><p>I will leave it there.  In the spirit of getting through all the amendments, it is important that I do not labour the point.  I have made the argument for the amendment and I ask the Minister to consider accepting it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2022031000002#B01500","speaker":"1615"},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":665,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  I agree with the intention of the amendment and everything he has just said.  I will not be accepting the amendment because there is an independent patient safety council in existence.  The council provides advice and guidance to the Minister for Health on a broad range of perspectives on the development of patient safety policy.  It was appointed by the then Minister in 2019 and held its first meeting on 27 February 2020.  By engaging a broad range of perspectives in patient safety policy, including those of the patient and the service in question, the work of the council leads to enhanced policymaking.  The council members bring a wide variety of expertise and experience, which is important, including citizens, education, patient safety, health policy, healthcare leadership and more.<\/p><p>The council is chaired by Ms Noeline Blackwell who we are all very aware of.  She is a person of excellent standing and CEO of the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre.  To the Deputy's point, the council obviously needs to meet and does so two to three times a year.  It also agrees on an annual work programme.  As part of the 2020 programme, the council was asked by the then Minister to carry out some work in the area of open disclosure.  Last year, it provided me with recommendations on a national policy framework for open disclosure in healthcare in Ireland.  I would be very happy to share that report with the committee.  I will check if it has been published, but I certainly see no reason why we should not provide it.  This framework is very much to assist organisations and clinicians to apply the principles of open disclosure and to communicate with patients where healthcare does not go to plan.  The framework is now being drafted and it will sit along this legislation to give guidance to healthcare organisations.<\/p><p> In short, I agree with the Deputy's points.  We have quite a robust council in place under an excellent chair that is already looking at open disclosure.  I propose, because I agree with everything the Deputy said, that the committee or I could write to the Independent Patient Safety Council and ask it in whatever the appropriate period is, possibly a year after operation, to do a review and report back to the Oireachtas and me with its findings.

I do not see why.  I cannot see how the amendment would have incurred a cost to the Exchequer to the point that it was ruled out of order but that is not for the Minister and I to have a discussion on.<\/p> <p>  I will speak very briefly to this point in the section and on what I was seeking to do, which is that any individual who is employed by the health services should be mandated to report incidents under Schedule 1.  If it is left to only some clinicians and not others, the difficulty is some of them may not report.  There are robust procedures and processes for failure to report but it is possible some incidents may not be captured in instances and situations where others working in or around an individual who is mandated to report are also aware of a notifiable incident, which should be reported by that individual.  It is very important we get this right and that any individual who has a sense that something is wrong and works in the healthcare service should be mandated to come forward.<\/p> <p>  I have spoken to a number of advocate groups on this matter and we do not want a situation where there is over-reporting.  I appreciate there is a balance to be struck but, at the same time, we can put safeguards in place to protect the rights of healthcare staff who may well come forward, which is why the amendment allows for people to report an incident to HIQA, for example, as an alternative and added protection.  Nobody should have any fear about coming forward in respect of his or her job or standing in the health services.  We are doing this because it is about patient safety and it is the right thing to do.  Incidents should be reported and followed by fair processes to investigate any notifiable incidents or complaints made under the mandatory reporting process.  Anyone in the health service needs to be properly protected when he or she comes forward.<\/p> <p>  The point I am making is what I was seeking to make in the amendment.  As that has been ruled out of order, I can only speak to it in the section, namely, that we should broaden the scope of who should be making reports and who should be mandated to make reports.  It should be all those who work in healthcare settings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2022031000002#C01200","speaker":"1615"},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":676,"content":"<p>Is the Deputy speaking to amendment No. 5 as well?

For someone who has no experience of advocacy or of how to navigate through what can be the maze of the HSE, the system, reporting systems and so on, the role of a patient advocate, as the Minister knows, is very important.  With this amendment we seek to place an obligation on the provider to ensure that it is mandated to provide information to a patient on how to engage the services of a patient advocate, rather than simply leaving it to a patient to have to try to find all of this out, sometimes by having to employ the services of legal representatives and incurring more costs.

The good news is we now have a patient advocacy service that is growing.  The Patient Advocacy Service, PAS, was set up to provide exactly what the Deputy is, quite rightly, calling for, which is free and independent advocacy for users in the acute system who intend to make a formal complaint regarding the care they receive.  The complaints come through the HSE's Your Service, Your Say process.  PAS is also there to help those who have been involved in a patient safety incident, which is obviously the topic of the legislation before us.  It was established for public acute hospital users.  However, since June of last year, we have extended that to HSE-operated nursing homes as well.<\/p> <p>  Since its establishment, the service commenced operations nationally.  There are hubs in centres with the highest activity, namely, Dublin, Cork, Limerick, the midlands and Galway.  The service goes to all locations to meet patients and service users as required.  Currently, 20 staff are employed by PAS and recruitment is ongoing.  Last year, it received 1,200 new contacts so it is doing an awful lot of work.  That is required advocacy arising from more than 3,300 separate complaints.  PAS is there, it is very active and it is working around the country.<\/p> <p>  While I will not accept the amendment, since we already have the service in place, I am happy to commit to asking my officials to engage directly with the HSE to make sure there is a very wide understanding that PAS is there, that it is free and that it is very responsive.  I agree entirely that there are many cases where patients need advocates.  PAS provides that expert advocacy service.<\/p> <p>  Section 7 is a very important section.  It establishes the obligation of mandatory open disclosure.  While amendment No. 4 has been ruled out of order, I will address some of the issues through discussion of the section.  The view is that it is very important a clear responsibility and accountability is placed on the service provider and the most relevant senior clinician.  That is what this is about.<\/p><p>The Deputy referred to protected disclosure.  He is correct.  Those protections are afforded under different legislation, namely, the Health Act 2004 which was amended in 2007.  The protections for people coming forward are very important and real but covered under separate legislation.  I looked at what other countries do.  We cannot find any other country where there is an obligation on everybody.  There is a concern where there could be someone in a hospital ward, for instance, with no clinical training or not the right level of clinical training who might see something that they are not really qualified to know whether it was a serious incident or whether should it have happened.  It might be that it is part of normal care or maybe it is not but it could create anxiety for them that they feel legally obliged to report all of these.  That is why Ireland and other countries keep it to the organisation.   This would introduce an offence with serious penalties.  The legislation lays out who the lead person is and there is back-up for the next person if that person is not available.  That is how the section is structured.  That is the right way to go rather than putting an obligation on everybody.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2022031000002#C02000","speaker":"1623","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":687,"content":"<p>I want to raise a couple of points under this section.

Given the extent to which the State depends on private nursing homes and that they are largely funded by State money, is there an intention to extend the remit of the patient advocacy service to private nursing homes?<\/p> <p>  There is a wider point on the section relating to clinical accountability.  Separate to this, there is a recommendation in the context of the regionalisation of the HSE to introduce legally binding clinical accountability where there would be regular reviews.  The Minister referred to what happens in other countries.  I remember Professor Tom Keane talking about this in relation to his own role in Canada, for example, where at the end of each year there was a kind of performance assessment which he and all other consultants had to undergo.  Is it intended work will start on that proposed legislation, which would be part of a piece with this legislation, to ensure it is not only when there are adverse events but that clinical assessment would be carried out on an ongoing basis by the hospital concerned?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2022031000002#D00200","speaker":"1567"},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":688,"content":"<p>I want to respond to some of the Minister's points.  First on the patient advocacy service, yes, it is a service that is available.  As Deputy Shortall rightly said, it is under-resourced.  It does not apply to private nursing homes.  I accept the Minister's bona fides that he will engage with the patient advocacy service in the context of the passage of this Bill and will look at resourcing and staffing issues, but I will press the amendment.  However, I will not call for a vote on any of the amendments because I want the Bill to pass as quickly as possible for the obvious reasons.<\/p> <p>  Returning to the broader point around the section, the Minister spoke on who would be obliged or mandated to make a report.  I accept much of the logic of his response.  That is why I said we have to be careful.  There has to be a balanced approach.  I tabled an amendment and I am pleased the Minister has looked at the matter to see how it operates internationally.  However, we must also be honest.  I do not want to prejudge reviews, processes and audits which are now in place around CAMHS in Kerry.  However, some of the senior officials were before the committee some weeks ago.  There was a failure in clinical supervision at the very top.  It is accepted by the HSE.  There were failures at management level and at very senior clinician level.  I understand that in CAMHS in Cork it was a social worker who made disclosures, not because she was mandated to do it but because she felt it was the right thing to do.  I just have a fear here.<\/p> <p>  While there is some logic in what the Minister said and you do not want to create the anxiety that he spoke about where everybody feels they have to report everything, that is not what the Bill does.  Schedule 1 sets out very clearly what is a notifiable incident.  Clearly any mandated report has to be under that Schedule by using this Act.  We can improve in this area.  This goes back to where I sought a separate patient council that would look at the operation of this Bill given its sheer importance that this is something that as part of that review process would be looked at.  I hope it is not the case, but I fear that we could end up, after the passage of this Bill, in one, two or three years' time, where we have had a number of incidents where those senior clinicians or relevant senior clinicians the Minister spoke about may not have reported what should have been reported.  Then there will be a failure in that area.  Yes, there are processes to deal with that but there may be other staff members in and around that clinician who were aware of incidents but were not mandated to report them.  We will then ask why not?   We will find the reason they were not making the reports is that they were not mandated to do so.  If that is the case, then the Act will have to be amended.<\/p> <p>  I very much hope this Bill will work and that we do not have those kinds of situations but the possibility of those arising is very real.  We can look at examples of failures at management and senior clinician level.  It very rarely happens.  We have excellent staff in our health service.  The senior clinicians are really good at what they do and it is very rare that we have these kinds of failures.  However, they occur and when they do and there are failures on the part of a senior clinician, there should be responsibility on the others to come forward.  My amendment might not have been the best way to do it and maybe there is a happy medium or a balance between what I was proposing and what is in the Bill.  For the purpose of moving this debate on, I will leave it at that.  I welcome the Minister's response but I fear it is an issue that we may have to return to in the future.  I hope that is not the case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2022031000002#D00300","speaker":"1615"},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":689,"content":"<p>Deputy Shortall asked if we will extend the remit of the patient advocacy service.  Yes, we will.  We want to extend it to nursing homes for all the obvious reasons.  A tendering process is now under way.  On the need for a bigger service, yes, we are expanding the service with more funding and staff and a wider remit.  I fully agree.<\/p> <p>  There is much overlap in the points made by Deputies Cullinane and Shortall on the really important question of clinical accountability.  I will try to decouple them slightly.  When I was discussing the Bill with Department officials, we were teasing out some of these points.  It was put to me that they are linked.  We are trying to strike a very delicate balance between fostering a culture of openness, which is what this Bill is all about - it is all about mandatory open disclosure  - and a culture where people are afraid, whether they should or should not be, to disclose because of what might happen to them.  The advice we have from looking around the world at systems that do this better than we do is to try to keep them separate insofar as possible.  For example, this Bill rightly contains requirements around apologies.  However, they cannot be used as part of court cases or admissions of liability.  My understanding is that Canada, for example, had a similar system.  We are trying to strike a really delicate balance.  First, we are telling people that under the 2004 Act they have protections if they want to come forward under protected disclosures.<\/p><p>Second, there are clear guidelines in place regarding mandatory open disclosure.  Now this Bill adds another serious layer to that.  It states it is a legal requirement and it is an offence if one does not do what one is meant to do in terms of mandatory open disclosure.  At the same time, to refer to the points of both Deputies, which I fully agree with, there has to be accountability.  There has to be clinical accountability and there has to be managerial accountability.  We can refer to numerous examples, including south Kerry.  We are trying to find a very fine line, or trying to walk the right balance, and get this balance right.  This Bill is about the mandatory open disclosure part, not the accountability part.<\/p><p> However, we are proceeding with the regional health areas, RHAs, for many reasons.  I was in Galway last week looking at the emergency departments and various other services.  The case for the regional health areas from a patient service perspective is clear as day.  We have many patients with delayed transfer of care and delayed discharge.  Patients in emergency departments need those beds, yet there are separate organisations running the hospitals and running the community side of things.  Obviously, it should all be the one organisation.  The RHAs are very important from a continuity of patient care perspective.  It is also through the RHAs that we will put the systems of accountability in place at the clinical level and at the managerial level.  That work is ongoing.  Not only is the work ongoing, I have also appointed an advisory group to me on the implementation of that.  This is one of the areas on which that group will be providing feedback to me, to make sure that we get the right balance and that we have accountability, which we must have, but it does not come at the cost of creating a culture where people are afraid to step forward and admit when things have gone wrong.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2022031000002#D00400","speaker":"1623","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":691,"content":"<p>We are committed to open disclosure, but we still do not have open disclosure.

We have to find the right level at which to intervene and the right level of incentives to ensure that the purpose of the Bill is served.  The culture is not going to change overnight and we could be here six months hence, a year hence and five years hence.  The Bill is as good as it operates and works and identifies the issues as they come along and are dealt with.

I realise we are talking about accountability in respect of mandatory open disclosure, but I will outline my experience of the HSE.  When the Minister was in the Opposition and on this committee, he had to deal with a lot of scandals and crises in health.  Many people who have come before this committee have had to testify to failures at management level, clinical governance management, standards, quality care and so forth.  There is a sense that nobody is held to account at management level.  We have reviews and processes, but at the end of it people do not see that there has been accountability at senior management level.  Obviously, we will have separate conversations on the wider areas in that regard when the Minister comes forward with his plans for regional health areas.  We have all sorts of concerns in that regard as well, to which we will return.  Everybody on the committee wants that to be right.  However, to get accountability right, there must be accountability at senior level at the core of an organisation.  If there are very senior clinical failures, nobody is ever held to account that I can see.  I will not attempt to talk the Minister through all the incidents.  I referenced some of the most recent ones but we could go back over many years.<\/p> <p>  Can the Minister talk through - people will want to hear this to better understand from the Minister's perspective how this is going to work - what the sanction is if a senior relevant clinician does not report something that the authorities then deem should have been reported and there was an obligation on the clinician to report it?  Separate from that, the Minister might take the opportunity to talk about his view on accountability at management level.  When I deal with organisations such as the Irish Association of Social Workers, Safeguarding Ireland and others, the one issue they continually come back to is that if one does not deal with cultural problems where there is a lack of accountability at senior level in the HSE, we will have these incidents happening repeatedly.  I know that it is a tricky area and I appreciate it is not an easy area to resolve, but it is one we have to start addressing.  We can start to do it in this Bill, certainly when it relates to mandatory open disclosure.  Can the Minister outline exactly what the sanctions would be for somebody who fails to report and who should have reported?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2022031000002#E00300","speaker":"1615"},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":693,"content":"<p>We are in agreement about the need for formal structures and the culture as well.

Deputy Cullinane referred earlier to our experience in this committee with the south Kerry CAMHS issue.  At that meeting, we were trying to get to the point where we could identify who was in charge and who was responsible.  It was impossible to do that because there was no clear chain of command at all.  There were various different management bodies.  There was the administrative one within the CHO, but then each of the different disciplines have their own management structure and they report up through that, whether it is physiotherapy, public health nurses or whatever.  The RHAs will assist in devolving power and responsibility down through the service.<\/p><p>The existing management structure is completely dysfunctional even within each of the CHOs.  The Minister made the point about having a single budget and that it makes sense as it means we do not have delayed discharges because there is no money for home care.  All of that is very important but equally important is having a clear chain of command and a management structure so that when something does go wrong, the buck stops with identifiable people.  When the Minister quotes section 49, he refers to how a health service provider that may have committed an offence can end up being fined and so on but what is a health service provider?  The HSE is a health service provider but there is no point in fining the HSE.  It must be tied into legal accountability for named posts within the management structure.  This is what concerns me.  I have made this point a few times when problems have arisen within the HSE.  You get the sense that everybody is responsible and yet nobody is responsible.  I think the term \"health service provider\" is a very wide and ambiguous one.  It does not fill me with confidence that there will be a way of identifying whether that the buck stops with \"X\" be that at a clinical or administrative level.  This is what we need to do.  If people are employed on very high salaries, responsibility must come with that.  This is the only way.  There must be consequences for individuals concerned when the job is not done properly or responsibly.  The fact that it is still quite loose concerns me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2022031000002#E01000","speaker":"1567","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":701,"content":"<p>The definition of a \"health service provider\" is detailed in section 3.  It could be an individual hospital, for example.  While I understand the points being made, I think they are probably beyond the scope of this legislation.  This legislation is around trying to instil in law an obligation for mandatory open disclosure.  It is one that will be taken very seriously by the healthcare providers and clinicians.  What it is doing is backing up.  It is another layer of defence because the HSE mandatory disclosure guidelines are already in place and are taken seriously.<\/p> <p>  There is a broader conversation into which we have very understandably moved around accountability generally.  As I said earlier, the process by which that needs to happen, and I agree with the Deputies that it needs to happen, is through the regional health areas because we will be creating the one organisation in each region that is responsible for end-to-end patient care.  I go to Galway, meet the nurses, doctors and managers and look at a situation that is not acceptable for patients or our healthcare workers.  I am meeting some emergency medicine nurses shortly and I know the committee has been engaged in the same thing.  As Deputy Shortall rightly said, the CHO has some responsibility in terms of stopping people from going into hospital in the first place and the GP network has some responsibility in terms of out-of-hours GP cover.  Some community hospital care that is under the CHO has responsibility to ensure beds are available.  The hospital group has a responsibility to make sure there is correct load balancing and so forth across the different hospitals.  The individual hospital is responsible for patients coming in the door but it is reliant on the CHO and nursing homes to a large extent to make sure patients can be discharged.  There is no single organisation that I and the committee can meet to ask what the head of organisation is doing and what its executive team is doing to sort this out.  I agree with Deputy Shortall but it is well beyond the scope of this legislation.  However, I would be very happy to discuss it with the committee on an ongoing basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2022031000002#F00200","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":702,"content":"<p>I agree with the Minister that it is beyond the scope of this Bill and is a much broader issue.

It seems everybody was and nobody was, as has been said.<\/p> <p>  As it is not relevant to the scope of this Bill, it might be useful if the Minister could give a commitment that some time over the next number of months, he will come back to this committee regarding the regional health areas, specifically the area of accountability and the changes that might come about.

I have concerns about that process, as have other members, but accountability is critical to it.<\/p> <p>  Integration of healthcare is critical but accountability is also critical.  It speaks to one of the areas of this Bill.  It is one area of it with regard to mandatory reporting but accountability is much bigger than that and it is a much broader debate that we should have.

Rather, it will be able to be done by way of a regulation brought in by the Minister, as opposed to an amendment to the Act itself.  It is better from the point of view of the legislative process to give the Minister that flexibility in order that if there is a change in the type of management system that is in place and if NIMS is to be changed or replaced, the logic of this group of amendments will mean that can be done by way of regulation, rather than require an amendment of the Act, which would not be a good use of our time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2022031000002#G05700","speaker":"1615"},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":771,"content":"<p>I looked carefully at this proposal to see its implications because I appreciate what the Deputy is seeking to achieve, namely, to provide flexibility in regard to the ability to change the system.  There are a few issues to consider, one of which relates to how the current system is going.  The reports that have come back are good.  The Deputy rightly referenced the HIQA review of May of last year.  It examined the information management practices for NIMS throughout the HSE.  It recommended improvements in the system, as the Deputy highlighted, and the review acknowledged the importance specifically of the NIMS.  The review states:<\/p> <blockquote> \t  \tIncident management plays a vital role in patient safety surveillance and learning.  NIMS, as the system underpinning incident management across the public health and social care system in Ireland is therefore an extremely important national health data collection. This review recognises the progress made by the HSE in its efforts to embed NIMS as the single designated national information system for incident management, patient safety, and learning across the HSE and HSE-funded services. HIQA also acknowledges the examples of good information management practices highlighted throughout this review, particularly in relation to information governance and use of information.  <\/blockquote> <p>The Deputy quite rightly pointed out that there is more to be done.  HIQA carried out a very good report on NIMS last year and the HSE is looking to expand it.  My concern with the amendments, which is why I cannot accept them even though I fully appreciate the Deputy&rsquo;s intent, is that they could undermine the prospect of us having an all-encompassing national system to be used throughout the country.  It is important that the entire HSE and all the publicly funded services use the same system.  There is a concern that one unintended consequence of the amendments is that they would give service providers freedom to say they will use something else.  I appreciate that is absolutely not what the Deputy intends, but it is a concern.  One of the main challenges we have, as has been discussed by all of us at previous committee meetings, relates to the importance of having a single integrated national data management system, rather than the multiplicity of systems we are currently using throughout the health service.<\/p><p>Accordingly, I cannot accept the amendments, although I fully appreciate the intent of them.  It is essential to ensure there is no room for individual providers to decide they will adopt a new system, in order that everyone will use the same one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2022031000002#G05800","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":772,"content":"<p>The unintended consequences the Minister mentioned are, obviously, issues we do not want to see happen.

In constructing the Bill and taking account of the issues I have flagged by way of these amendments, has he or any of his officials engaged with HIQA specifically on its views regarding NIMS?<\/p><p>I understand it has concerns.

I am introducing an amendment to section 9 of the Health Act 2007 to clarify and strengthen the powers to direct an investigation into Ireland's health and social services by the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA.  Section 9 of the Health Act 2007 gives the Minister for Health and Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth the power to direct HIQA to undertake a statutory investigation to address serious ongoing risks to patient safety in Ireland's health and social services.<\/p><p>In the National Maternity Hospital <i>v<\/i>. the Minister for Health in September 2018, the court quashed a decision by the then Minister for Health to direct HIQA to carry out a section 9 investigation into a maternal death that had occurred at the hospital.  The central difficulty in this case addressed in the judgment and by counsel throughout was the very high bar set by section 9 of the Health Act for ordering such an investigation under this section.  It is clear from the judgment and from legal advices received that the current discretion for the ordering of an investigation under section 9 is extremely limited and impractical in terms of allowing for an appropriate response to ongoing risk to patient safety within our health and social services.<\/p><p>The proposed amendments to section 9 of the Health Act 2007 will ensure that when directing an investigation into Ireland's health and social services, the Ministers and-or HIQA must believe on reasonable grounds that there may be serious risk to the health or welfare of people receiving services that will be the subject of investigation.  This replaces the previous requirement for a belief there is a serious risk.<\/p><p>Second, there may be a section 9 investigation into a specific service, notwithstanding that a similar risk may exist in another service.  Third, the purpose of the investigation will include a public interest element where a need for learning and improvement of services will form part of the rationale for requiring an investigation under section 9.  The provisions are repeated for both the Minister for Health and Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  References in the Bill are to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and these will subsequently be updated with the new title.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2022031000002#J01400","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1646870400,"counter":826,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":827,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 38:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 50, line 20, to delete &ldquo;and&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2022031000002#J01600","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1646870400,"counter":828,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":829,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 39:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 50, to delete lines 21 to 29 and substitute the following:  \t&ldquo;(ii) by the substitution of the following paragraph for paragraph (a): <blockquote> \t&ldquo;(a) there may be a serious risk&mdash;

Regulators such as HIQA, the chief inspector and the Mental Health Commission all have distinct roles and responsibilities, as the Deputy outlined, in terms of regulating health and social services and they already have functions set out in the Bill.  It is important there is clarity in respect of the functions and respective roles of the regulators.  It is particularly relevant in this context as no one regulator covers all of the health and social service providers that are subject to the Bill.  Prosecution of these types of offences would represent a significant increase and change in their respective functions and, with that in mind, the advice I have and with which I agree is that the Garda is best placed and has the appropriate powers to carry out investigations and bring proceedings in the event of an event having been committed under the Act.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2022031000002#K00200","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":858,"content":"<p>I ask the Minister to clarify whether it is only the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that can prosecute under the Act.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2022031000002#K00300","speaker":"1615"},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":859,"content":"<p>Yes, it is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2022031000002#K00400","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":860,"content":"<p>I have a concern about that.

I carefully considered the amendment and whether this particular incident could be included as a notifiable event.  We looked around the world and could not find any system that includes this specific incident.   The rationale is that it is vague.  Many of the notifiable incidences are quite binary.  They relate to things that clearly happened and it is clear to see what they are.  Delayed diagnosis is quite vague.  Its inclusion would essentially create an unsupportable administrative burden on the entire system.  It could cover anything from relatively minor delays to much more serious ones, including those such as the ones the Deputy referenced.  As it stands, the current list of notifiable events is specifically designed to cover the most serious reportable events, that is, those that cause death or serious injury.  These notifiable patient safety events set out currently in the Bill are clearly defined and provide clear direction to health service practitioners.<\/p> <p>  However, as I stated in my opening remarks, I will bring forward on Report Stage an amendment that deals with the incidences we all discussed at great length and that were flagged through everything that happened with CervicalCheck.  The advice I have is that it is legally and technically very difficult to do.  A significant amount of work has been done to figure out a way to do it and there are ongoing discussions on it.  I am seeking to address this issue through an amendment I will bring forward on Report Stage.

Unfortunately, we have direct experience in this State of how women were failed.  One of the reasons open disclosure and mandatory reporting is on our agenda is because of what happened to many of those women in terms of failures to report and issues relating to open disclosure.  There have been many more incidents.  Obviously, it was not only related to CervicalCheck, although it was cited in Dr. Scally&rsquo;s report in the recommendations he made that we move to implement in this area.  I accept what the Minister is saying that he has got advice, that it would not be appropriate to add it to the Schedule and that he will bringing forward an amendment on Report Stage that will deal with this and with broader issues relating to the failures that happened in CervicalCheck.  I look forward to what that means, what it will look like and what it will do.  We will evaluate that when we see it.  For me, this is a really important area.  If I were to push any amendment to a vote, it would be this one.

There is nothing in building control regulation or enforcement or in planning law that empowers any agency of the State to prevent someone from building again in the future if he or she has a proven track record of being in breach of building control or planning.  I made this point at the end of the last session but I wish to repeat it because it is important to understand where I am coming from.<\/p> <p>  Take, for example, the developer that built Priory Hall, the developer that build Beacon South Quarter, the developer that built Br&uacute; na Sionna or whatever.  The Minister of State knows them as well as I.  These are houses, apartments and duplexes that hard-working families spent considerable sums of money on to purchase as homes.  In each of those cases, even if building control had been taken to its absolute limit, which it was not in most cases with the possible exception of Priory Hall, and the building contractor, developer or other associated construction professionals had been found to be in breach of building controls, fined or even imprisoned &ndash; breaches of the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations can carry custodial sentences &ndash; none of that would have prevented the very same builders, developers or contractors from starting up the next day, creating new companies and getting back in the game.  In fact, the developer of Priory Hall is back in the building game in another jurisdiction.  That is a matter of public record.<\/p> <p>  I accept that what I am proposing is outside the scope of what the Government is bringing to us, but my argument is that we have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to provide a level of deterrence to ensure that construction industry professionals operate with the level of competence that this register requests them to have.  I know that the Minister of State will not accept my amendment, but this is one where I wish to at least try to reason with him to go away and consider the proposition.  If we do not do this, either in the form of my amendment or some other amendment that his team comes back with, we will essentially be saying &ndash; because the Government has no other plans to deal with this dilemma in any other part of the legislative programme &ndash; that we do not believe that people who build defective buildings should be prohibited from building more buildings.  The Minister of State referred to a failure of competence.  What better example is there of a failure of competence than building Priory Hall, Br&uacute; na Sionna or Beacon South Quarter?<\/p> <p>  I appeal to the Minister of State to extend the scope of this legislation beyond what it is currently being proposed to do.  This would give a level of comfort to people, be they signing a contract for a home extension or buying an apartment, duplex or house.  Yes, there are building controls and people could make formal complaints to the building control authorities, which could instigate an investigation and pursue the matter.<\/p><p>In parallel, they could take a case to this register and if they could demonstrate a failure of competence and compliance with building control regulations, that person would be struck off.  I will give one example and then I will conclude.  The example I will give is in the public domain and well established.<\/p><p> There is a former Ben Dunne gymnasium on the Coldcut Road in my constituency.  A developer bought it and successfully applied for planning permission for 37 apartments.  That was a good thing because the area needs apartments.  He decided not to proceed and applied for 48 apartments, was refused by the local authority, appealed to the board and yet fitted out the 48 apartments and got tenants for all of them.  They are all fully occupied today.  Not a single certificate under the building control (amendment) regulations was submitted to the local authority.  There was no commencement notice, fire certificate or completion certificate.<\/p><p> The developer is flagrantly in breach of building control regulations and planning permission but is permitted to continue to develop on a case-by-case basis subject to getting planning permission and all the rest of it.  Even if South Dublin County Council concludes a successful building control enforcement action against him, which is a big if, and gets the maximum fine of &euro;5,000 per breach of the building control amendment regulations, which is what that legislation stipulates, he can still go out the next day and continue the same practice.  That must be outlawed and this legislation provides us with an opportunity to do that.<\/p><p> The Minister of State can see I am genuinely passionate about this issue having worked with many of these issues, as has Deputy Cian O'Callaghan.  I know the Minister of State will not accept this amendment now.  I urge him to discuss the matter with his officials and find a way of ensuring that someone who has been found to be in breach of the building control regulations will not be allowed to be on this register.<\/p><p> In the case I am talking about, the developer in question, who is also a landlord, took a bunch of tenants to the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, over rent arrears.  In the case in the RTB - again this is on the public record - I testified and demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt that he had not complied with building control (amendment) regulations.  He had not supplied any certificates for the 48 apartments.  He accepted that on the record of the RTB hearing.  It is a matter of fact, established in the legally binding determination that is published.  That should be sufficient evidence for somebody to make a complaint to the construction industry register, outlining that as this individual has accepted they flagrantly broke building control (amendment) regulations and building control law, they should be struck off and never be allowed to build again.  That is what I am urging the Minister of State to do.<\/p><p> This legislation provides an opportunity to do this, although perhaps not with the wording or in the section I have proposed.  If the Minister of State does not accept this, he will be missing an opportunity to make a profound change to our building regime and construction sector, and I think people will not forgive the Government.  People will look on this as a lost opportunity to do something really significant.  Whatever the Minister of State might say in response to me, I urge him to go back to the Department and consider this because it could be a really positive step if it is done in the right way.<\/p><p> People will thank the Minister of State personally and the building industry would also benefit from it because it would help to flush out the rogue operators and ensure that good, professional, high-quality construction industry professionals would be able to operate in a much cleaner environment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022031000002#A00600","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":917,"content":"<p>Is the Deputy suggesting that someone should be struck off for any breach of building control regulations?

This section is about individuals having the right to make a complaint against someone who is registered and for that complaint to be investigated.  Just because breach of building regulations is one of the grounds for complaint, if it is minor, it does not necessarily mean that the person would be struck off the register.  If there were serious breaches of building control regulations, people could raise a complaint and they could be struck off the register which would then mean they would no longer be able to build; it would not be legal for them to do so.  When that is said out loud, I am very confident there is agreement in all parties across the Oireachtas.  I do not believe anyone thinks it is in any way tolerable for people to have flagrant breaches of building control regulations on an ongoing basis, especially given recent history in this country and the massive costs we have talked about already.<\/p> <p>  As Deputy &Oacute; Broin said, people in the industry want this.  Some of the most vocal people on this are builders.  We often hear of builders who have experience of working in the UK, for example.  They come back here and cannot get over how lax some of these things are and why it is tolerated.  Most builders take pride in their work and they do not want a minority of rogue builders who create enormous damage and reputational damage for everyone working in the industry.  People who are serious about the industry, which is most people engaged in it, want this addressed.  At a political level, across all parties, I presume everyone wants this addressed.  The public want it addressed.  If it is not done in this legislation, it will not be addressed.  There is a very strong case for it.<\/p> <p>  I understand the rationale that this is constructed on the basis that people can only make complaints on the technical side related to registration.  However, this section deals with competence, criteria and compliance with the building control regulations on a consistent basis.  It is a very important form of competence and is highly relevant in that sense.  If it is not included in the legislation, especially now that an amendment has been proposed on it, it almost implies that there is a view in the Oireachtas that that would not be an important part of competence for a builder.  Clearly, we would all have the view that it is.<\/p> <p>  I agree with what Deputy &Oacute; Broin has said.  I ask the Minister of State to see if this can be done in a way that he is happy with.  He may be able to introduce an amendment on Report Stage.  If we do not do that, it could be years before this is addressed elsewhere.  We appreciate that there is other legislation relating to building control, but we must be able to make it illegal for people who were in flagrant breach of building control regulations to build; they must be struck off.  The whole point of having a register is that people like that can be struck off.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022031000002#B00700","speaker":"1550"},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":923,"content":"<p>I again thank the members for their contributions.  We take any breaches of the Building Control Act and the planning Acts very seriously.  Some of the examples mentioned have caused heartbreak for people, which is the last thing we want to see happen.  It is part of a broader response.  Section 44 sets out the grounds for complaint and competence is referred to in section 44(1)(d).  Section 28(2)(b) refers to building control regulations in terms of grounds for competence which is important.<\/p> <p>  Any convictions relating to building control, notices from the court or enforcement notices will be published on the register.  That information is available for consumers engaging contractors who may have been convicted in the past or had an order enforced by the courts in the past.  That is a very strong safeguard for consumers who are engaging building contractors.<\/p> <p>  Having a number of State bodies potentially adjudicating on one single case can be a difficulty.  In the wider spectrum, including procurement law, many other parts that deliver public infrastructure need to be looked at regarding past performance of building contractors to protect individuals.

Let us imagine I am a developer and following an enforcement by a local authority, I have been found in significant breach of the building control regulations and I have been fined.  Let us imagine some other legal binding documents, such as RTB determinations or planning decisions, reflect that.  Publishing that but allowing me to continue to trade would be the equivalent of somebody who is convicted in the courts for serious drink driving offences not losing his or her licence but simply publishing that he or she has a conviction for serious drink driving and causing, for example, damage to persons as a result.  The idea that we are saying it would still be permissible to trade for those egregious breaches is a fundamental weakness of our system.  I will not labour the point.  We have a lot of business to get through.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State does not understand the opportunity that he is giving up here.  I appreciate that his officials will advise him to stick to the text.  That is their job.  I am appealing to him at a political level, not at a Civil Service level.  I mean no disrespect to the officials, who have done a good job in bringing the legislation to this point.  I am appealing to him as a politician to go away and think about this.  What of people who are guilty of egregious breaches of building control regulation that have had devastating impacts on people's lives, including, for example, in the case of Priory Hall?  A man took his own life because of the stress and strain.  To the credit of a former party colleague of the Minister of State, the former Taoiseach, Mr. Enda Kenny, at that point in time intervened and ensured the problem would be resolved, but it took that loss of life.<\/p> <p>  I am politically appealing that the Minister of State goes away and thinks about this.  If we do not do it in this Bill, I guarantee I will come back to him in a few years stating that we missed an opportunity and we will not have that again, unless there is a change of Government or there is a change of policy.<\/p> <p>  I will press these amendments and I will call votes on them.  I am appealing to the Minister of State to think hard about this before he discards the central proposition my party is making because we will return to this on Report Stage and in the Seanad.  I would much prefer him to bring forward a much more competent and appropriate form of amendment to deal with the matter.  If we do not do it here, what we are essentially saying is that people who egregiously break building control regulations and planning conditions can still trade.

In this entire process, the onus is put on individuals to come forward and make complaints.  That can be quite off-putting and onerous as it is.  Many people just will not do that.  Even if these processes are relatively easy to navigate, if people are not used to doing that they can find it very off-putting and stressful.  If people have made a complaint and the complaint is deemed to have been sufficiently serious that it at least warranted mediation or other processes, if that does not work out the complaint should not simply drop with the onus put on the individual to have to resubmit it.  At that point, even though the complaint might still be serious, many people will drop out of the process and we will lose serious complaints.  That is the intention behind the amendment.<\/p><p>While it still means the system puts the onus on individuals to make complaints, it just means that when they do that it is less likely that their complaint will be dropped or lost if the mediation processes do not work out.  It takes their complaint that bit more seriously, makes it a little more user friendly in that sense and places a little less of a burden on individuals who come forward to make complaints.  It also means that if the complaint is initially put into a mediation process or some other informal process, the individual is not put at a disadvantage just because that does not work out.  Those types of processes should never put somebody at a disadvantage.  There should always be an additional means of resolving things rather than something that might mean the complaint effectively runs into the ground.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022031000002#E01800","speaker":"1550"},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":979,"content":"<p>I concur with the Deputy, and my amendment is trying to achieve the same objective.  I find subsection (4) very odd.  If I make a complaint to the Residential Tenancies Board today about my landlord breaching the terms of the tenancy agreement, the first thing the RTB will do is recommend mediation.  As I always recommend to constituents, always go for mediation.  It is the reasonable thing to do.  If the mediation takes place and it does not provide a suitable outcome, the Residential Tenancies Board automatically moves to adjudication.  It has its hearing and its decision.  It would be nonsensical to say that if mediation breaks down because, for example, the building contractor does not participate or is just obstructive, the complainant has to go and make a fresh complaint.  Unless I am misinterpreting section 44(4), it is essentially suggesting that it has to go back to the start.  Deputy Cian O'Callaghan's amendment is probably better drafted than mine in the sense that it refers back to the board for investigation.  However, one way or another, if mediation fails for whatever reason, it should automatically go into the adjudication phase rather than requiring somebody to step out of the process and start again.

I know they are not the same but the point I am going to make will be clear to the Minister of State when I make it.  The inspectors are the people who sift through all the information, talk to the relevant parties and consider all of the matters at hand.  If they are not empowered to make a recommendation in terms of the sanction, who is?

The inspector is the person who goes out and assesses the planning application and goes through all the files.  Because of that knowledge, the inspector then makes a recommendation as to whether the board should proceed or not.  It is up to the board, as we know from An Bord Plean&aacute;la, not to accept the recommendation of the inspector.  It is unusual in the case of the Residential Tenancies Board for the recommendation of an adjudicator not to be accepted but I cannot see how the board could make a better decision without a recommendation from the person who knows the finer grain of the complaint and the information pertaining to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022031000002#E02900","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":991,"content":"<p>I will now address amendment No. 42.

Such a recommendation might be that the matter is for the board to decide.  It may be that a particular case is finely tuned and the inspector is not in a position to make such a recommendation.  However, I see no reason not to allow the inspector to make a recommendation because the inspector will have spent far more time sifting through the fine grain of the case.

Does the Minister of State mind me asking why?  This is an issue we often have.  If one considers the Residential Tenancies Board, for example, that board would certainly not issue fines of &euro;500,000.  Certainly when one is getting to that level of fine, there is an argument for a court prosecution.  The Residential Tenancies Board can, however, impose fines of up to &euro;20,000 on foot of a determination approved by the board.  It does not require any recourse to the courts.  There is a reason I say this.  It relates to my amendment, which I will come to shortly after we have dealt with this one.  Clearly there is a view, and the current Attorney General is on record as being of this view, that administrative justice is disliked.  Those who hold this view believe that any level of fine should always go to the courts.  Surely there should be some provision for a level of fine that can be issued by the board, which would then allow for certain levels of sanctions to progress much more quickly.  Clearly, the person against whom that sanction is imposed could then decide to appeal it to the court.  If all fines have to require a level of prosecution, does this not create an unnecessary delay, particularly for low to mid-level orders of fines or sanctions rather than for the very high level the Minister of State has just outlined?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022031000002#G02300","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":1036,"content":"<p>I hear the Deputy's case.  It is the gravity, when compared to the Residential Tenancies Board, in the context of someone earning a livelihood and potentially, their reputation.  There is a higher threshold to be looked at in going for a prosecution, as opposed to making a fine.  It is a more significant issue.  We can look more into this and I can commit to having another look at it with the officials and perhaps checking with the Attorney General's office about it again.  I can see, however, that the gravity is very different in terms of the two instances..<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022031000002#G02400","speaker":"1595"},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":1037,"content":"<p>Absolutely.  I will outline the only reason I would encourage the Minister of State to look at it.  Let us go back to the discussion we had earlier about the building control amendment regulations, BCAR.  The maximum fine for a breach of BCAR is &euro;5,000.  It might be &euro;10,000 but from memory, I believe it is &euro;5,000.  That is lower than some of the upper ends of the Residential Tenancies Board fines, for example for landlords not adequately addressing the issue of antisocial behaviour and criminal activity of their tenants.  We have seen a range of such fines of &euro;15,000 to &euro;20,000 imposed by the board without recourse to the courts.  That can be quite a stiff penalty.  If a person is a sole trader and out doing dodgy extensions for people, the idea of getting hit with a fine of &euro;10,000 or &euro;20,000 just on foot of a decision by the board, could be a much nimbler instrument then a formal court prosecution.  I am not in any way arguing that the board should be allowed to impose fines of &euro;500,000.  That should be in the courts.  One of the weaknesses of this section of the Bill is that there is not enough flexibility in some of the sanctions that could be applied.  I ask the Minister of State to consider this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022031000002#G02500","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":1038,"content":"<p>The Minister of State has said that he will consider that.

The difficulty is that we are dealing with such a broad range of suppliers, from very small operators and specialist operators right up to larger providers.  I absolutely hear what the Minister of State has said about the level of sanction.  I would want that to be a court proceeding.  I also hear what Deputy &Oacute; Broin has said about wanting to give the legislation teeth and making sure it is doing what all of us in the room want it to do.  A key issue is how it interacts with other regulations.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Cian O'Callaghan has raised the issue of the submissions many Deputies have received from the Heating and Plumbing Association of Ireland.  They are an example of suppliers that provide both labour and materials.  They are subject to their own specialist registered employment agreement.  It is recognised that there is a difference between what they do and what many other suppliers in the construction industry do. This is recognised by the different registered employment agreement.<\/p> <p>  There is a balance to be achieved in what the Minister of State and Deputy &Oacute; Broin are playing out here in front of us.  Some of those mechanical contractors are registered with a whole range of different regulatory bodies, for example the gas installer in a planned extension may be registered with the Oil Firing Technical Association, OFTEC, or the Register of Gas Installers of Ireland, RGII. There are a range of different regulatory bodies.  For smaller and specialist type providers we must ensure that we get this balance right.  Perhaps the solution is under section 4(b).  Deputy O'Callaghan had said the issue was raised after the amendments deadline had closed.  Perhaps, rather than changing the argument that the Minister is making, it would be better to go back to change the definition in section 4(b)  where gas works refers more to mechanical building services instead.  Given that we are past the deadline, however, perhaps the Seanad could deal with this.  It is a good example of how we need to be careful about getting that balance, which both the Minister of State and Deputy &Oacute; Broin rightly argue for.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022031000002#G02700","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":1040,"content":"<p>Even though it does not neatly fit into this Stage, as both Deputies have mentioned it, I will highlight the fact that I may bring forward an amendment on Report Stage.

Section 53 relates to the application to the High Court to confirm a decision to impose a major sanction so we are saying a major sanction is to be imposed or is recommended by the board.  A person against whom that sanction has been applied does not appeal it and does not appeal it to the courts so he or she has had two opportunities to challenge it.  In that instance, the board still has to proceed for a court confirmation of the sanction.  I have no difficulty with the idea of a court confirmation of the sanction but would it not be better to place the responsibility on the person or entity who is being sanctioned to take that case and challenge the decision in the courts rather than the responsibility falling on the board and, ultimately, on the taxpayer?  If I was a company or sole trader and the board imposed a very heavy sanction, of course I am going to challenge it but if I do not challenge it, surely then there is an argument to say that for the board to go to the courts is not necessary.  I will not press this very strongly but I am interested to understand why even where the sanctioned entity does not appeal it to the court, the board still has to go to court.

What the Minister of State is really saying is that it is not the severity of the fine that is the issue.  Any fine would fall foul of the Zalewski judgment in the view of this Attorney General because this Attorney General is against any form of administrative justice, so it is not about administrative justice at a certain point of scale.  Rather it is about any administrative justice.  The only reason I want to put this on the record is that it does relate to the issue of fines.  I suspect that if the Minister of State has a chat with the Attorney General and asks him whether we can have some level of fine, the Minister of State will probably find the same argument coming back, namely, that the determination of issues of justice shall be for the courts.  However, there are many areas where certain levels of administrative justice are permissible under the Constitution and this is one case where I think it would be valuable.

This part of the Bill states that the board will set a fee that will not exceed the standard fees of registration.  On face value, this seems fair enough.  The issue though is there could be considerable cost for the board in terms of taking action against people who are suspended from the register for a while.  Their actions or failings create costs for the board.  Under this provision, those costs will, therefore, be paid by all the people who have been compliant.  They will carry the costs because the board will not be able to set a higher fee for someone to re-register to get back on to the register following a suspension.  It is not that the board should have to set a higher fee but I would like a situation where it could set a higher fee to effectively recover some of its costs for dealing with people who are not being compliant.  This provision means that the fees paid by compliant builders and traders who never end up having compliance issues with the board will have to be increased to cover the cost of dealing with the non-compliant entities and individuals.  That wording is placing a prohibition that is not necessary.  It does not provide the board with flexibility so that if it wants to set a higher fee, it can do so.  There is a penalty element to it but it is really a justice element.  Those who are non-compliant should have to bear some of the cost of non-compliance rather than all the compliant traders and builders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022031000002#H02800","speaker":"1550"},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":1086,"content":"<p>While I can understand the Deputy's intention, I do not think punishing someone is the correct mechanism.

I acknowledge his flexibility on that, which is very welcome.  As he said, advice is included in the list of minor sanctions in section 8 and he makes a reasonable point on that.  It can also mean a reprimand, a caution or a combination of those.  What happens if a contractor receives a series of reprimands or cautions?  \"Prime Time\" did a significant piece of reportage on an individual trader who does home extensions and has left a trail of devastation behind him.  It may be that a registered person has received a series of reprimands or cautions but the cumulative impact of those would be relevant to somebody considering whether this is the kind of trader he or she wants to contract to carry out works.  My understanding is that the Residential Tenancies Board publishes all determinations, good, bad or indifferent and serious or light, and these are a matter of public record.  I know the Minister of State will look at this but I urge him to also consider Deputy O'Callaghan's amendment.<\/p> <p>  To return to a point we made at the start of the meeting, one of the great values of a statutory register, notwithstanding some of the fundamental weaknesses in this Bill, is that it protects the good traders and contractors and helps to clean up the industry.  For too long, as we know, it has been negatively affected by a portion of contractors, both legal companies and individual sole traders, who have behaved recklessly.  To ensure the maximum level of public confidence is restored, everything should be published.  It would then be up to individuals to decide if they want to take on somebody.  For example, if Deputy O'Callaghan and I were both contractors and the Minister of State was deciding which of us to choose to do his home extension, and I had a litany of minor sanctions but Deputy O'Callaghan's record was a clean as a whistle, who would the Minister of State choose?  I would prefer him to know that I had received all those sanctions or reprimands and Deputy O'Callaghan had done nothing wrong.  I urge the Minister of Sate to consider that in the context of his examination of the two earlier amendments.  Perhaps a balance can be found where some information is published.  My preference, like that of Deputy O'Callaghan, is that all of it would be published.  Consumers should have the right to know, even if I have a long list of minor infractions, because the other trader in this case, Deputy O'Callaghan, has no infractions.

This is an opportunity for the Minister of State to clarify the provisions of section 63, in which case I may be happy to withdraw our opposition to the section.  Section 63 deals with the relationship between investigation and criminal proceedings.  Subsection (1) states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIf a sanction is imposed on a person under <i>section 49(2) <\/i>or <i>sections 50, 52 <\/i>or <i>53,<\/i>as the case may be, and the improper conduct in respect of which the sanction is imposed is an offence under this Act, the person is not liable to criminal proceedings for the offence in respect of the matter concerned. <\/blockquote> <p>Will the Minister of State fully explain what the implications of that final clause are?  When a complaint is made against a registered contractor, an investigation takes place, a sanction is issued and that sanction is then be confirmed in the courts.  Is it the case, however, that neither the board nor a third party could instigate any criminal proceedings with respect to the same matter on foot of that court decision?  If that is the case, particularly with respect to third parties, not with respect to the board which has done its work and a sanction has been imposed, that a third party, for example, the homebuyer who has bought a defective home, would not be able to instigate any legal proceedings or seek any criminal proceedings for damages?

This section is very clear.  I refer to the lengthy discussion we had earlier on the interrelationship between failure to comply building control regulations and non-compliance with the competency requirements of the register.  If, for example, builder A has been subject to building enforcement by a planning authority and that is used as evidence in a sanction to question the competence of the registered person as per the register criteria, and the builder is then struck off, would that prohibit the building control authority or a third party - the affected homeowner - from pursuing further criminal action against the builder?  I am trying to understand the interrelationship between the two potential decisions.  The decision to strike somebody off the register is on the limited grounds that the person has not complied with the competency criteria.  My understanding is that this section would not in any way prevent a building control authority or a third party affected from pursuing criminal proceedings for breach of building control regulations, even if those breaches were part of the evidence to make the case that non-compliance with the competency elements of the register was at stake.<\/p><p>Am I clear in that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022031000002#K03300","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":1129,"content":"<p>It does not stop action under the Building Control Acts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022031000002#L00200","speaker":"1595"},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":1130,"content":"<p>It does not in any way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022031000002#L00300","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":1131,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022031000002#L00400","speaker":"1595"},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":1132,"content":"<p>It would only prevent criminal proceedings under the provisions of this Act with respect to competence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022031000002#L00500","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1646870400,"counter":1133,"content":"<p>Correct.

It is subjective but the Attorney General and the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel have already put forward the word \"serious\" for use.
