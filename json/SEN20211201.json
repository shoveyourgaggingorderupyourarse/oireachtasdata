He clearly regards it as important.  When I first took my seat in 2014, I was immediately aware of the job of Seanad secretarial assistant, SA, and that it bore little resemblance to the work that SAs actually do.  That was confirmed in a survey in 2017, which showed that Seanad SAs do the same work as parliamentary assistants in the D&aacute;il.  They undertake research, speech-writing, preparing newsletters and briefing papers and preparing material for committees, among other things.  Not only is the job of an SA a misnomer, the pay does not compensate for the work they undertake.  SAs currently earn &euro;24,423 per year or &euro;11.75 per hour.  That would qualify an SA with one child to avail of working family payment from social welfare to supplement their income.<\/p> <p>To add insult to injury, it currently takes 18 years to reach the maximum point on the SA scale on contracts that are fixed purpose and that do not exceed five years in duration.  We are bringing all these passionate, highly educated and incredibly loyal people to assist us as legislators on temporary contracts with long working hours and we are paying them well below the living wage.  In any other sector, we would be accused of gross exploitation and rightly vilified for this as a result.<\/p> <p>What is even worse is that we, the employers of SAs, have no control over their terms and conditions.  The Minister is the only person who can successfully address the issue.  In 2018, SIPTU lodged a pay claim on behalf of SAs which called for the introduction of the parliamentary assistant scale for the Seanad and compensation for the SA scale so that staff in the D&aacute;il are rewarded for the essential work they do in the Oireachtas.  In 2019, I and other colleagues from across the House passed a motion calling on the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to meet with the staff union representing this group as a matter of urgency.  It is now 2021 and no meeting has ever taken place.  I appreciate there have been many emergency issues in the meantime.<\/p> <p>This year, assistants in both the D&aacute;il and Seanad were offered a pay increase of 1% in October, 1% in February 2022 and 1% in October 2022.  That would bring their salaries to &euro;25,162 per year or &euro;12.09 per hour, which is still below the living wage.  This was not acceptable and was rejected totally by the staff and their union, SIPTU.  More importantly, it failed to address the fundamental issue that the role of an SA has evolved to the level of a parliamentary assistant and that the D&aacute;il and Seanad have completely different roles.  If a Seanad SA loses his or her job after an election, having the job of SA on a CV completely misrepresents the work they have done.<\/p> <p>Earlier this year, the Ceann Comhairle relaunched the form on a family friendly and inclusive Parliament, which is an excellent initiative.  However, we know that it is impossible to attract a diverse workforce and create truly inclusive workplaces without considering the factors that will encourage retention.  I strongly believe salary transparency, pay equity and equal pay for equal work are the fundamental cornerstones in building an inclusive culture in the Oireachtas.  SAs acquire a vast amount of proprietary knowledge very quickly and we should be doing everything we can to retain them.  Instead, we are exploiting them while they are here.<\/p> <p>I know that the Cabinet agreed to publish the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission (Amendment) Bill 2021, which will provide &euro;462.5 million to run the D&aacute;il and Seanad for the next three years.  It would be shameful if every aspect of the running of the Parliament was adequately funded except for the people on whom so many of us depend, who are the powerhouses in our offices and whose loyalty is beyond question.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Gerard P.

It became a full-time job for me and, as such, I am entitled to the same supports as any full-time Member of the Oireachtas.  Without my SA, Jean Webster, my office would not run.  I would simply be neutered and unable to do anything.  From that point of view I am asking the Minister today to reverse our current position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120100002#A00500","speaker":"1645","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638354600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I again thank the Minister for coming into the House this morning to discuss this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120100002#B00200","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"speech","time":1638354600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Craughwell for raising this issue and I thank the Cathaoirleach for giving me the opportunity to address it in the House.<\/p><p>As a Member of the Oireachtas for more than 14 years, I am deeply conscious and appreciative of the extraordinary work carried out by all of our support staff.  I see this work up close day in, day out, and know that I, for one, could not do the job I do without the selfless dedication and commitment I get from my own staff.  I have no doubt the same is true for every Member of this House, as Senator Craughwell has noted in his own case.  I also acknowledge that the nature of the work carried out by our staff, which in the case of Senators means their SAs is unique. They have to deal with a multifaceted set of issues every day and their role extends far beyond providing what might be generally termed secretarial support.<\/p><p>The role of an SA is very different now to what it was even a decade ago in light of the rapid changes in the way we communicate and interact with the people we represent.  I am also deeply aware that they do not enjoy job security and, in many instances, they will no longer have work once the Member they work for is not re-elected or retires.  Being a politician or working for a politician has many benefits, principally the enjoyment and satisfaction we get from helping people and making a difference, but job security is not one of them.<\/p><p>To deal with the specific issue at hand, the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Act 2003 provides a limited role for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in determining pay and superannuation arrangements for secretarial and parliamentary assistants employed under the scheme of secretarial assistance.  Under the Act, the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission has the power to regulate the provision of secretarial facilities to Members and qualifying parties.  This function transferred from the Minister for Finance on the establishment of the commission on 1 January 2004.  The term &quot;secretarial facilities&quot; is not defined in legislation but is generally taken to be a wide term encompassing the staff employed under the scheme for secretarial assistance, as well as ICT equipment, office equipment, printing facilities and graphic design services.  SAs, parliamentary assistants, administrative assistants, administrators and <i>chefs de cabine<\/i>t are employed by Members and by qualifying parties but are paid by the commission.  The commission also regulates the number of staff employed under the scheme and has oversight of the operation of the scheme.<\/p><p>Under the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Act 2003, the commission must obtain the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform before reaching an agreement with any person in respect of rates of pay, conditions of employment or superannuation rights.  In practice, this means that the commission advises on matters relating to resourcing, grading and terms and conditions of employment and submits proposals for the Minister's consideration and agreement.  In other words, the commission makes a proposal to me, as Minister, on issues such as grading, salary rates and so on, and I then make a decision on that proposal, having consulted with my officials.  In that regard, I am aware that there is a process under way at the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, dealing with various issues, including alignment with the current public service pay agreement Building Momentum, between the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission and SIPTU.  This is an issue I would like to see resolved and that is an important political signal for me as Minister to give in this House this morning.  I look forward to a successful resolution of the matter and early presentation of proposals for my agreement, in line with my role under the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120100002#B00300","speaker":"1459"},{"type":"speech","time":1638354600,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for outlining many of the issues relating to this matter.

If I am not misinterpreting what the Minister said, once the commission makes up its mind and comes to him with a proposal he will be willing to look at it and is anxious to have this matter resolved as quickly as possible.  Going back to my time as a teacher, a union activist and the president of a union, it always annoyed me terribly that the State was the most difficult body of all to deal with when it came to resolving matters before the WRC or the Labour Court.  I recall on one occasion having to go to the courts against an education authority in order to get enforcement.  The Cathaoirleach is a member of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  I hope that this matter will go before the commission at its next meeting, that a proposal will go to the Minister before Christmas and that we will have this matter resolved once and for all.  Failing that, I will try my damnedest in the new year to ensure that no legislation is dealt with in this House until this matter is addressed.  It is more than three years since I discussed this at the commission.  It is absolutely ridiculous that, three years later, we have to invite the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform into the House to try to resolve the matter.

I also acknowledge the Cathaoirleach's comments.  I should have said that this issue has been raised with me by him and many of his colleagues from across the floor of the Seanad in recent times.

That is what now needs to happen.  I welcome that and look forward to that happening.<\/p> <p>The Senator mentioned the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission (Amendment) Bill 2021.  I will be here in the next week or two to deal with that.  It provides for a significant increase in the resources of the Oireachtas of more than &euro;40 million across the next three years.  That is an increase of almost 10%, which is needed and which will be used for a variety of different purposes.<\/p> <p>What I want to do this morning is clearly set out what my role is under the legislation.  My role is to give consent to a proposal that is put to me by the commission.  The commission is the entity that is directly involved in the negotiations.  I have given a clear political signal and that is significant.  I have looked at the proposal that was put on the table in September and there is a lot of merit in it.  The realignment with public sector norms is important.  Even under the existing terms of Building Momentum, while the increases on 1 October 2021 and 1 October 2022 are 1% in headline terms, they also involve a minimum of &euro;500 each time.  For somebody at the bottom of the pay scale, that is 2% each time.  There is also the 1% from the sectoral bargaining fund on 1 February.<\/p> <p>An element from the previous agreement is also on the table.  It relates to the issue of incremental credits in order that people can start further up the pay scale and so on.  There is a lot in that but it is not for me to get into the detail of it.  I have given a signal for the commission to engage intensively with SIPTU in the normal industrial relations channels at the WRC and I stand ready with my officials to consider any proposal that is put to us.

When is it expected the report from the export forum on antisocial behaviour will be received, in light of the increasing incidence of antisocial behaviour throughout the country, including Galway, my home city, but also other cities such as Dublin, Cork, Waterford and Limerick?  There have been issues with antisocial behaviour, which has certainly increased in the inner cities since the pandemic began more than 18 months ago.  There are a number of reasons for that.  I can speak about Eyre Square at first hand, having been born and raised 200 yards from it.  The square has suffered from a spate of antisocial behaviour in recent times, including a tragic incident where a young woman lost sight in one eye when a firework was let off.  This has become such an issue that the chief superintendent of Mill Street Garda station in Galway city has even suggested the square may have to be closed at a certain hour.  As a Member of the Oireachtas, I certainly would not be in agreement with that suggestion, which is not a solution.<\/p> <p>As the Minister of State is aware, Eyre Square is in the heart of Galway city, very close to the train and bus stations and is often the first impression of our city for visitors and tourists alike.  Galway has always been a largely safe and happy place to live and visit.  We cannot allow the actions of a tiny minority to alter that.  A Christmas market with a large number of stalls is open in Eyre Square.  The market has activities for kids and adults, across the divide.  It will run right up to Christmas and offers an opportunity because there is full-time security in the square now.  However, the Garda presence in Eyre Square will need to be enhanced immediately after the market closes.  That issue must be dealt with.  The visibility of garda&iacute; is vital in reducing crimes.  We are currently seeing that, with the success of Operation Citizen in Dublin, with which the Minister of State will be familiar.  As highlighted last week, that operation has reduced crime statistics, which is very welcome.<\/p> <p>As I said, a number of issues are causing this problem.  Hospitality businesses are closing earlier and people have no place to go.  This is a major concern.  I am fully aware that Garda operations are a matter for the Garda.  Is the Department in a position to highlight the importance of locations such as Eyre Square being properly policed?  Seeing garda&iacute; on the ground gives certainty to businesses and residents in the inner city in Galway.  It is paramount that residents are safe and secure in their homes.  I will await the Minister of State's response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120100002#C00200","speaker":"1646"},{"type":"speech","time":1638354600,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Crowe for raising this very important matter relating to antisocial behaviour throughout Ireland but specifically in Eyre Square.  Senator Crowe has been raising concerns not only here in the Chamber but also behind the scenes with the Department of Justice and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I understand how important it is to him to ensure members of the public and his local community are safe in his city.  I have been to Eyre Square many times and the warm welcome received by domestic and international tourists in the city is renowned.  We have to ensure our public spaces are kept open for the public and communities.  That is their purpose and under no circumstances should they be lost to antisocial behaviour.<\/p> <p>The Government is determined to tackle antisocial behaviour and is very conscious of the effect it can have on the quality of life for local communities.  We are clear that incidents of assault or intimidation are completely unacceptable and that people must be safe and feel safe within their communities.  The programme for Government and the Justice Plan 2021 contain a number of commitments with regard to tackling antisocial behaviour and I will touch on a number of these important commitments.<\/p> <p>As Senators will be aware, the expert forum on antisocial behaviour was established by this Government in line with the programme for Government.  I chair the forum, which is charged with considering the effectiveness of existing legislation and propose new ways forward, including new powers for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and additional interventions to support parenting of offenders.  We were determined when this Government was formed that we would set up the antisocial behaviour forum in which, at a high level, representative groups could come together to address the issues around antisocial behaviour.  Rural and urban groups are represented on the forum and we work closely with the road safety forum, which I also sit on, to look at tackling issues around antisocial behaviour and other issues affecting both rural and urban Ireland.<\/p> <p>The forum has already produced a report regarding the misuse of scramblers, which I believe was very well received.  It is expected that a report on knife crime will be available early next year.  Future reporting will be produced on specific issues as and when they arise.  That is very much what we focus on in the forum.  Rather than trying to duplicate what other forums, such as the road safety forum, are doing, we target individual issues and try to come up with both community and legislative responses to those issues.<\/p> <p>Earlier this year, I launched the youth justice strategy for the period 2021 to 2027.  The strategy was published in April last.  I thank the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, for his significant support in providing additional funding of &euro;6.7 million in this year's budget to help kick-start that new youth justice strategy and recruit youth workers.  The strategy includes consideration of the full range of issues connected to children and young people at risk of coming into contact with the criminal justice system, including early intervention and preventative work, family support and diversion from crime, through to court process and facilities, supervision of offenders, detention and reintegration and support post release.<\/p> <p>The immediate priority is to enhance engagement with children and young people who are most at risk of involvement in criminal activity, principally by strengthening the services available through the existing network of youth diversion projects.  As I said, the Minister, Deputy McGrath, contributed an additional &euro;6.7 million this year, an increase of approximately 40% in the budget for youth justice, which is very significant.<\/p> <p>An unprecedented &euro;2 billion funding for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na allocated in budget 2022 also reflects the commitment of the Government to ensuring communities are safe and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the resources to be effective.  This funding will include provision for the recruitment of 800 new Garda recruits and 400 Garda staff.  We have the process of civilianisation of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na whereby we use civilian staff to release garda&iacute; from administrative duties back on to the front line to help ensure our communities are being kept safe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120100002#C00300","speaker":"1618"},{"type":"speech","time":1638354600,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his very positive comments in regard to public spaces.

There are certain crops that can be used such as winter or spring oats, rye, winter or spring wheat, winter or spring barley and winter or spring oilseed rape.  You can get paid on, at least, 5 ha but for no more than 40 ha.  If you apply for more than 40 ha you can carry it out but there is no payment above 40 ha.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has approved a budget of &euro;10 million for this scheme, with a payment rate per ha for the oat, rye, wheat and barley of &euro;250 and for oilseed rape &euro;150.<\/p> <p>Since its establishment, this has been a really good scheme.  Many tillage farmers in Tipperary speak very positively about it and they are very happy with it.  A question regularly asked of me by tillage farmers is if this scheme can be made permanent.  The Minister will be aware that for most schemes introduced by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine the first question is always on how it can be made easier to apply for.  This is a scheme that people are really happy with in terms of applying for it, but they are looking for it to be made permanent.  In fairness to the Irish Grain Growers group, it has been requesting this. I know that the group has been in contact with the Minister and the Department in regard to the scheme being made permanent for tillage farmers.  This year has been a good year for tillage farming but that is not always the case.  A scheme like this gives a level of certainty to farmers.<\/p> <p>Another question often put to me by farmers is on why the payment for oilseed rape is set at a different level and if, at any point into the future, it is proposed to increase it to the &euro;250 payment for the other crops.  A number of farmers chop the oilseed rape, but from a financial point of view and with a difference of &euro;100 per ha, it makes more sense to chop the straw of the wheat barley rather than the oilseed rape.  Will the Minister consider raising the budget for this over the next number of years as well because of the interest in it?  <\/p> <p>One of the main requests is for an increase in the ceiling per individual.  At the moment, as the Minister will be aware, a farmer can apply for 40 ha, or almost 100 acres, under this scheme, which is excellent and people are really happy with that.  Last year, we fell below the overall amount allowed to be used nationally.  I know farmers in Tipperary who wanted to use more of their land for this because they know it is a benefit to the environment.  Over the next number of months - this has started already - we will face issues with regard to fertiliser and the cost of fertiliser.  Cutting up straw and incorporating it into the soil helps in terms of encouraging farmers to use less fertiliser and it reduces the dependency for tillage farmers to use fertiliser.  There is an environmental aspect to this and they know that.  <\/p> <p>While it is welcome that you can have up to 100 acres per farmer, can the Department do something for tillage farmers in Tipperary who have more than 100 acres, such as set a percentage of their land that they can use?  For example, a farmer who has 150 acres can use 100 acres for this scheme, which means that farmer can use two-thirds of his or her land, but for the farmer who has 400 acres or 500 acres, 100 acres is only 20%.  Could we, perhaps, allow for say, 25% or 30% of land to be used under this scheme?  There are farmers who feel they would benefit a lot more if they could use more than 100 acres or, use the first 100 acres and beyond that a percentage of, say, 20% or 25%.  This would give farmers with greater amounts of land more to work it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120100002#D00500","speaker":"1629"},{"type":"speech","time":1638354600,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Ahearn for raising the straw incorporation measure, SIM.  Having secured funding in budget 2021, I introduced the measure as a pilot to support Irish tillage farmers who decide to chop and incorporate straw into the soil after harvest.  As pointed out by the Senator, the measure has been a success in terms of the environment and as a financial support to tillage farmers.  In 2021, it will pay out approximately &euro;8.5 million, with very strong support for the measure from applicants.  Eligible crops include: wheat, barley, oats, rye and oilseed rape.  The measure increases organic matter in soils, which will increase carbon sequestration, thereby reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but with added advantages of increasing water holding capacity and soil workability, while also returning nutrients to the soil.<\/p> <p>Payments are made at the rate of &euro;250 per hectare for those applicants who chop and incorporate oats, rye, wheat or barley, and oilseed rape is paid at the rate of &euro;150 per hectare.  The minimum application is 5 ha, with a maximum of 40 ha.  I believe in the long-term success of the straw incorporation measure and for that reason I have incorporated it into the CAP strategic plan as a permanent measure.  This will ensure that it will be available for at least the duration 2023-2027.  In the meantime, it will continue as a pilot measure in 2022.  The general feedback from advisers and farmers who participated in the pilot in 2021 is that they are very happy with it and most plan to reapply in 2022.  Tillage is a relatively low greenhouse gas emissions sector but, nonetheless, there is an increased awareness among tillage farmers of the need to improve soil and to play their part in reducing emissions overall.<\/p> <p>The measure also supports tillage farmers in making a change in their farm practice, which is positive in terms of greenhouse gas and soil improvement.  Therefore, it is imperative that farmers chop and incorporate the straw to achieve the numerous benefits and goals of the measure.  The ceiling of 40 ha was decided on to ensure that the measure is available to as many farmers as possible.  A farmer could earn up to &euro;10,000 under the measure.  Following on from the success of the scheme this year, I expect an increase in the number of applicants next year and I consider that an increase in the eligible hectare at this time is not warranted as data from applications indicates that the average farm size was less than 20 ha.  Furthermore, I believe any increase in the eligible maximum area per farm would limit the possibility for all applicants availing of the measure.  I need to remain conscious of that as well.  I want as many farmers as possible to have the opportunity to avail of this measure, without the need to impose rank and selection criteria if it is over-subscribed.<\/p> <p>The straw incorporation measure is an agri-environment and climate support targeted specifically at supporting tillage farmers in undertaking actions which will increase soil organic carbon levels and deliver reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Charlie McConalogue:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2319\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2319&amp;amp;pid=CharlieMcConalogue&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is not possible to open the measure to farmers who decide not to chop straw because one of the main purposes of the measure, which is to increase soil organic carbon levels, will not be achieved.

He said that there has been a pay-out of approximately &euro;8.5 million.  There will be &euro;10 million for this scheme in the budget.  Particular farmers in Tipperary are full-time tillage farmers who have quite sizable farms and see the opportunity, from an environmental point of view, and also certainty of payment relating to this scheme.  As the Minister knows, the past six or seven years have been challenging for tillage farmers.  Although this year has been good, that will not always be the case.  This scheme has been widely welcomed by the industry and by grain growers across the country.  The more people who can use it, the better.

I take the point he makes about wanting to ensure that all farmers who want to avail of the scheme can do so.  This is a reflection of how well it has been received and the value of it to farmers as well as the value from an environmental and emissions perspective.  It is a good initiative.  I am glad to be able to put the funding back in for 2022.  I will keep it under review.  I want to ensure that it is available to everyone, which is why the thresholds are there.  The average so far is 20 ha, but people who apply for 40 ha will get &euro;10,000, which is significant support to income.  It also puts a floor on the straw market to ensure that income is available.  We need to support tillage sector incomes.<\/p> <p>We need to have a safety valve too.  Last year, people could withdraw at any stage.  The safety valve was there to ensure that if straw started to get expensive, we expected to see farmers being able to sell it in order to keep the market right and to not see the price increase unnecessarily.  This is a type of scheme that makes sense in a year when yields are high and when there is a good supply of straw that can be used.  In years when things are tighter, it cab be used for other purposes.  The scheme needs to be flexible in order that it can be used to address any excess.<\/p> <p>I thank the Senator for raising this matter.

I welcome the Minister of State.  I know how passionate and compassionate she is regarding services for older people.  In this instance, we are talking about a specific service that is sad but needed.  Dame Cicely Saunders, who founded the hospice movement, said, \"You matter because you are you, and you matter to the end of your life.\"  Those words are important.  The hospice movement has given great dignity, respect and comfort to many at the ends of their lives, as well as to family members around them.<\/p> <p>In 2001, the national advisory committee on palliative care stressed the importance of every region having a hospice.  Sadly, there is one region that still does not have a hospice, namely, the midlands region of Laois, Offaly, Longford and Westmeath.  It has been described as a black spot.  In 2013, a joint study recommended that the hospice be on the campus of the hospital in Tullamore.<\/p> <p>There has been some movement.  Professor Humphrey O'Connor is the chair of the committee.  I have had a number of meetings with him and facilitated a meeting with the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, last April.  Since then, plans have been drawn up and a feasibility study was formally assessed.  These all agreed that Tullamore is the correct place for a hospice.  Planning, funding and so on need to be put in place.<\/p> <p>I referred to the Minister of State's passion and compassion at the start.  We need urgent action and intervention.  It is not acceptable to have a black spot for end-of-life and palliative care anywhere in our country.  While the region is fortunate to have a well-developed palliative care service in the community, with an aim to care appropriately for people at home for as long as possible, the provision of specialist palliative care and patient beds will facilitate hospital avoidance and support families in end-of-life care for their loved ones.  I know the tremendous service that St. Brigid's Hospice in the Curragh gives.  A friend and neighbour of mine, Paddy Curran, passed away a month ago.  I know the solace and support that the hospice gave to his wife and to all of his extended family and friends.<\/p> <p>Hospices are places that any of us ever wants to be in or see our loved ones in, but they are vital.  When the time comes and families in the midlands need to rely on these services in order to ensure that their loved ones are cared for with grace and dignity in the final period of their lives, this service is simply not there.  We need to ensure that we are providing patients and their loved ones with adequately funded and resourced end-of-life and palliative services.  These are already incredibly difficult and traumatic times for people.  It is not acceptable that we add to that suffering by not providing hospice care in the midlands.<\/p> <p>I hope that the update that the Minister of State is bringing us today will be a positive one from the Department and its officials.  I hope that we will be able to provide some certainty to those in the midland counties I mentioned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120100002#E00500","speaker":"1689"},{"type":"speech","time":1638354600,"counter":34,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this important issue about an update for the plans for a midlands hospice.  I thank her for the compassionate way in which she has dealt with it.  Her statement at the start, \"You matter because you are you, and you matter to the end of your life.\", reflects exactly what a hospice does.  The Government is strongly committed to the development of end-of-life services, which ensure the care and dignity of the dying person and the family are the focus.  The Government is working to guarantee equitable access to specialist palliative care services in every region of the country and to ensure that we meet the palliative care needs of all who require it, as our population grows and ages.<\/p> <p>In recent years there has been a significant increase in investment in palliative care services, with recent openings of new hospices in Mayo, Waterford and Wicklow.  Along with the extension of St. Brigid's Hospice in the Curragh, there will soon be 276 specialist inpatient palliative care beds available for those who need them.  Budget 2022 will provide for increased investment in palliative care services.  An additional &euro;2.4 million will be allocated for new service developments and &euro;10 million has been allocated as once-off funding for palliative and end-of-life services to progress national priorities.

It will also reflect increased demand for adult palliative care, the shift towards care in the community, the emphasis in Sl&aacute;intecare on addressing geographic variations in the provision of both community and hospital palliative care services and developments in international best practice.  It is expected to have the policy update published in 2022.<\/p><p>It is a commitment in the programme for Government to increase the number of specialist palliative care beds countrywide to ensure a hospice is serving every region of the country.  That was the Senator's exact point.  The Department of Health is actively engaging with the HSE to progress plans for the development of hospices planned for Drogheda, Cavan and the midlands.  The development of these three units will mean specialist palliative care services will be available in every region of the country.  It is recognised that the midlands is one of the three remaining regions without this specialist palliative care inpatient service in place.  However, there is continuing progress to develop a new specialist palliative care facility, co-located to the Midland Regional Hospital, Tullamore.  I noted the Senator said she met the Minister earlier in the year.<\/p><p>The HSE's palliative care services three-year development framework includes the development of a 15-bed specialist palliative care inpatient unit, or hospice, which will provide support to patients from across the four counties in the midlands.  Fundraising from Offaly Hospice Group has recently allowed for architects to carry out initial plans and a feasibility study at the co-located site.  The HSE has recently engaged with five hospice groups in the area, the Irish Hospice Foundation and Hooves 4 Hospice, to provide an update on progress regarding the midlands inpatient unit.  The development will require collective working towards a specialist inpatient palliative care service in the midlands.  HSE estates is developing a costed, timelined plan for the development to be ready by end of 2021, which is very short.  In line with the vision of palliative care in the programme for Government, Sl&aacute;intecare and HSE development framework for palliative care, this development aims to prioritise and protect the most vulnerable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120100002#E00600","speaker":"1614","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638354600,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her response.

We had this battle in Waterford for many years.  The friends of Waterford Hospice did phenomenal work and raised a significant amount of money over so many years.

However, for many vulnerable women, and indeed for migrant women, their only point of contact may be the home school liaison teacher, and that is in only schools that have delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS, status.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Fiona O'Loughlin:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2441\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2441&amp;amp;pid=FionaOLoughlin&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Every single school in the country should have a home school liaison teacher.

It is making everybody's job in school difficult.  The inspectors need to go back into the classroom to teach.  There are 200 inspectors.  They are experienced teachers, and they can bring a lot to schools, classrooms and staff rooms.  They need to be redeployed back into the classroom.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120100002#G00600","speaker":"1689","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638354600,"counter":47,"content":"<p>The Deputy Leader is welcome.  I call for a debate in the coming weeks on the winter plan that was agreed by the Cabinet and published in recent weeks.  Thanks to you, a Chathaoirligh, I raised it in a Commencement debate and at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health.  I refer to the situation in the Saolta University Health Care Group and the fact that no acute beds are being provided this winter under the winter plan, despite 205 beds being provided nationally and the fact that one in eight patients on trolleys in the eight-week period leading up to the publication of the plan were in Galway.  Despite that, no acute beds were provided.<\/p> <p>A related issue is the lack of carers.  We are not talking about hours or funding, we are talking about a physical lack of carers to do this very important work in the home care sector.  I received a response from community healthcare west stating that due to a shortage of healthcare support assistants, HCSAs, the HSE is currently challenged to cover the extra allocation of hours.  I had raised the case on behalf of the mother of a very worthy individual.  We often debate issues where the concern is a lack of funding but this is due to a lack of availability of staff.  The reply in this case is that the home support manager is making every effort to source HCSAs so that the full allocation can be delivered.  The HSE national office has approved an additional 54 whole-time equivalents for healthcare support assistants for community healthcare west.  As part of the winter plan, we need a debate on what the Government is doing to source carers to provide the very important work that they carry out in communities.  All families at some stage will need the additional supports provided by carers in the healthcare system.<\/p> <p>On another matter, I attended the health committee this morning, which addressed the issue of drugs.  We were told by the CityWide Drugs Crisis Campaign in Dublin that the mid-term review of the national drugs strategy is writing the community sector role out of the strategy.  At a meeting this Friday, the Department of Health intends to remove community and voluntary networks from their representative roles in the strategy and we were told that it will happen without review, rationale or discussion.  It is calling on the Government not to allow this to happen.  This is a matter of urgency.  At the committee I requested a meeting with the Minister for Health and his officials to explain why this is happening.  There must be a rationale for any major change in policy like this.  I ask that the Deputy Leader would write to the Minister of State with responsibility for the drugs strategy as a matter of urgency in advance of Friday's meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120100002#H00200","speaker":"1665"},{"type":"speech","time":1638354600,"counter":48,"content":"<p>I am a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport, as is my colleague, Senator Buttimer.  We have been speaking to the Coast Guard in recent meetings and a number of serious issues have arisen, some of which I have forwarded on to the Garda, and I will speak with them about more issues today.<\/p> <p>Caitr&iacute;ona Lucas, may she rest in peace, was lost in Kilkee.  There had been warnings around the time she was lost.  Several issues have been brought to our attention concerning Rescue 116 regarding a failure to act on warnings that were given.  Today, three issues must be dealt with immediately.  I ask that the Minister comes to this House this evening, tomorrow morning, tomorrow evening or Friday.  I do not care when it is, but he must know and take responsibility for the boat that is currently operating out of Howth.  The boat came from Kilkee to Howth and was refitted when it arrived in Howth.  I understand the engines that were fitted are considerably heavier than the ones that were originally designed for the boat, with the result that the stern of the boat was low in the water.  To rectify this, lead was put into the bow of the boat.  The boat is now operating without the certification to which it is entitled.  I am told by experts who operate in this area that, as we speak today, lives are at risk in Howth.  Each boat is fitted with two of everything: two radios, two GPS systems and two engines but there is only one isolation switch on the boat.  I understand the switch became faulty or was damaged on the boat in Howth, which meant that the boat itself had to be recovered and  I understand this is putting people's lives at risk.<\/p> <p>The third issue I want to put on the record today is the sea anchor that has been put into service.  The function of a sea anchor is to keep the boat head-on into the waves.  I understand that the sea anchor that is currently in use turns the boat broadside and all you need is a wave slightly higher than the width of the boat, and it will flip the boat over.  We have had serious accidents.  We could talk about them all day long, starting in Dingle with life jackets.  We know that the life jackets were withdrawn.<\/p> <p>I am putting on the record of the House today that there are three urgent issues that must be dealt with immediately.  Those boats must be inspected and if the issues that have been brought to my attention are factual, then the boats must be taken out of service and the crews must be stood down until a marine engineer certifies that they are suitable for use.  We need the Minister to come to the House because a plethora of other things has been brought to my attention in recent days.  These are volunteers putting their lives at risk.

Today is World AIDS Day and it is important that we mark the day in this Chamber, in particular the stigma that still surrounds HIV and AIDS.  When HIV and AIDS first emerged in the late 1980s it was a pandemic that was laden with both moral and social judgment.  I am somebody who grew up in the early 1990s in an area of Dublin that was very affected by HIV and AIDS and I believe that it is important to recognise how far we have come, particularly in terms of treatment.  If one does not have a viral load and the virus is undetectable then it is not transmissible.  We must also recognise that the provision of Covid healthcare means that there has been a drop in the number of people being diagnosed with HIV between 2018 to 2020.  Therefore, I ask people to get tested if they suspect they may have HIV.  It is an illness that one can live with.  One can have a long and healthy life as long as one can access the drugs that manage the virus.  On that latter point, it is important to recognise the discriminatory practices that are still in place in some countries.<\/p> <p>In terms of people travelling, we saw people lose their heads on Thursday and flights from South Africa were banned because that country was ahead in sequencing the new variant.  Somehow flights from a few countries in Africa to Europe have been banned so now it is worthwhile to ask the following question.  If the sequencing had been identified in a European country or another country would we have been as quick to ban flights from coming here?  It is important that we mark this matter.<\/p> <p>I want to raise the issue of the participants in community employment services who were outside this place yesterday.  In particular, I wish to refer to the shift from local employment services, a not-for-profit enterprise, to a tender system.  The Department needs to examine this matter again.  The tenders are meant to go out this month and the local employment services have a stay of execution that lasts 12 weeks.  The Department needs to shift its focus and what it considers to fully support local employment services and resource community employment schemes.  Unfortunately, the Department seems hell bent on pursuing a privatised approach.  This matter was discussed in the D&aacute;il last night and it is important that we have a discussion on the impact on local employment services this month before the tenders are published.  People in many communities around this city and around the country are extremely worried about the shift from a locally-based local employment service to a for-profit and per placement service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120100002#J00200","speaker":"1672"},{"type":"speech","time":1638354600,"counter":60,"content":"<p>I want to raise the issue of the mid-term review of the national drugs strategy, NDS.  There are four community voluntary networks and each of them is designated as a core constituent of the NDS.  They are all due to be removed from the oversight committee.  I think this is one part of what has been, for a number of years, an attempt to dismantle the community voice, dissent, agency and advocacy from all structures within that Department.  We say that there is no rationale to it but I feel having listened to people on the ground and in the community that this feels like people are being silenced and a pushing out of community involvement in decision-making.  It feels like there has been a concerted effort for many years, and one which seems to have been ramped up very recently, to pull decision-making back so centrally that people are not being empowered to make decisions within their own communities in terms of meeting their own needs.<\/p> <p>The aim of removing any kind of independent, questioning or dissenting voice within the community is extremely worrying.  That is especially so in a democracy where collective decision-making and input is a key component of who we are and what we do.  For me, as someone who comes from the community sector and still works very much in the community sector, I feel that we are the experts.  We bear the brunt.  We carry the history.  We know the knowledge.  We know what is needed.  We know what basic needs are not being met.  We feel the trauma.  We bury our loved ones.  We respond to the overdoses.  However, every single time that we look to involve ourselves in the key structures we are blocked at every move.  That is so wrong and worrying.  To be honest, it feels that in the past two Governments we have had Ministers who stood by and watched civil servants call all the shots that allowed this to happen.  I do not think that is okay.  If the civil servants want to run for politics to make those decisions then they should.  We need to be stronger, as Ministers, to push back, lead from the front and not be told what happens and how things will happen.  The community voice has been diluted so badly that people feel very disempowered and disengaged within their communities.  The more one disengages communities the worse the situation will get.<\/p> <p>We must be honest about this matter.  For many years I have made the effort to be diplomatic and not insult people but now I must set diplomacy aside to save lives and communities.

It is a fact that 58% of 25- to 34-year-olds in Ireland have a tertiary education qualification as against an EU average of 41%, and 53% of all of those aged between 25 and 64 years have a third level education qualification.  That means Ireland is the highest in the European Union in terms of the number of people who are graduates and, indeed, one of the highest in the world.  It is a fantastic achievement and something that we, as a nation, should be proud of.  In the past everyone said that tax was the reason that companies came to Ireland but part of the real reason is talent and Ireland is investing further in apprenticeship programmes.  Educational achievement is something about which we do not shout loudly enough.  Tied with all of that is the question of funding for higher education, which is an issue that I have raised on a number of occasions.  The Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, is on the record as saying that 2021 is the year in which the Cassells report will be addressed.

In this case, that is the family law complex in Dublin.

I have spoken many times about the subtle influence of money on the policy agendas of governments and international bodies, and the ideological activism that can be associated with that money.  As Senators know, within the United Nations, special rapporteurs are regularly appointed to look into particular countries or investigate a specific issue.  They are usually lawyers who are considered to be human rights experts and are appointed by the UN Human Rights Council.<\/p> <p>Earlier this year, the European Centre for Law and Justice, an established and respected NGO based in Strasbourg, published a report which showed some shocking practices in relation to special rapporteurs.  The report found that various private foundations, NGOs and, in some cases, governments are spending huge amounts of money to influence these rapporteurs and, in some cases, on recruiting them in the first place.  This violates both the letter and the spirit, I believe, of UN rules and anti-corruption legislation but the practice has been silently tolerated for years.<\/p> <p>I would like a debate on this with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney.  Between 2015 and 2019, 121 UN special rapporteurs were appointed, of whom 37 received payments totalling $11 million outside of any UN control from private foundations and NGOs, including the Ford Foundation, the Open Society Foundations of George Soros and other anonymous donors.  It is a matter of public record that the UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty was paid $600,000 by the Open Society Foundations in 2018 and 2019 through various grants, yet only declared $5,000 of that to the United Nations.  An Irish lawyer has held special rapporteur positions while concurrently being the chairperson of an Open Society Foundations project.<\/p> <p>The code of conduct which applies to special rapporteurs calls for \"objectivity and non-selectivity in the consideration of human rights issues, and the elimination of double standards and politicization.\"  There is a problem if special rapporteurs are receiving payments from organisations which hold particular views on the issues they are investigating and if they are funding political campaigns on that basis.

It was difficult for many families this morning to break the news to their children that they would have to wear masks in school.  We had an expert group which reported on ventilation in March.

The chair of the group, Professor John Wenger, said not enough has been done.  We need to ask some serious questions about why the work has not been carried out.  It is not suitable or necessary for every school but we all know school face financial barriers in providing these filters.  I have heard of schools where parents are buying the filters.<\/p> <p>HEPA filters reduce the number of particles in the air.  They are like gas masks and stop most particulate matter from circulating in the air.  Covid aside, they are relevant when we look to the future because we do not know what is coming.

I had a great discussion with Dearbhla Lawlor and Toby Long.  They are leaving certificate students and among the subjects they are studying are politics and society.  As part of their leaving certificate course, they undertook a research project to identify and analyse the social and political implications of an issue that affects society today.  The issue they chose to investigate and report on was LGBTQI and youth homelessness.  Their report is interesting and I will circulate it to all Members.  These young people are to be commended on their work.<\/p> <p>There were four main findings to the research.  LGBTQI young people experiencing homelessness fear violence, stigma and discrimination and this prevents them from accessing homelessness services.

Last month, there were 6,300 homeless people, of whom 2,500 were 18 years of age or younger, in other words, children.  However, there are no statistics that quantify LGBTQI.  The students also talked about the challenges and barriers that youth homelessness can present for LGBTQI young people in respect of their ability to engage in and complete education.

It is often said that people outside this House are ahead of the politicians.  These two young people certainly are.  They appreciate that their work will be circulated and considered.  They would also like, and I believe it is incumbent on everybody in the Opposition to do so, to stop the opposition to Housing for All and the State-led house-building programme being undertaken by this Government, which can lead us to the elimination of homelessness by 2030.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120100002#K00400","speaker":"1656"},{"type":"speech","time":1638354600,"counter":68,"content":"<p>There is a lot of focus in the media this morning, rightly, on the mica redress scheme and the sliding scale.

It is not the job of the Government to do so.  It has to be guided by an independent broker, which in this case is the surveyors of Ireland.  It is they who are setting the rate.  The rate we are working off currently is based on the 2020 market.  This does not reflect the massive inflation in building prices during 2021 but the new price surveyors will set in February next year will reflect on the inflation we have had in prices and products.  We cannot come out and say what that rate will be because the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, SCSI, has to announce it in February, but we are very confident that quite a significant increase will have to take place to reflect the market increase over this past year.  On that basis, we are very confident of looking after all the homeowners in Donegal with 100% redress.<\/p> <p>There is a job to do for us all in government to ensure that every homeowner is looked after because, as we know, at the end of the day this issue goes beyond Donegal and Mayo.

It is not surprising that women, particularly those from migrant communities and vulnerable sectors, find it more difficult to access the healthcare they need.

It is my first time hearing of this.  I would share her concerns if the community voice is being removed.  The people best placed to make decisions are those living in the community, those who are on the front line and dealing with people who are using services, and those who have recovered and are now helping others.

She drew a correlation between that and how we are dealing with the current Covid-19 pandemic and posed a very interesting question in respect of the very swift move by many governments to suspend all flights from southern African nations.  She posed an interesting question in respect of whether the same response would have been forthcoming if the variant had originated in an EU member state or another country.  I cannot answer that question.  Members will all have their own views as to what the response might have been if the variant was found elsewhere.  We should commend the medical experts and authorities in the southern African states on coming forward and informing the global community as quickly as they did, knowing that it may have negative repercussions for them.  They did the world a good service.  There are reports today that the first Omicron variant has been detected here in Ireland.  It is only a matter of time before we are trying to curtail its spread.

The advice of the Attorney General to the Government is that there must be compliance with EU and Irish procurement rules and that is why there is a change in the approach.  The plan is to expand employment services across the country.

I say \"Well done\" to Senator Ruane on organising that initiative.<\/p> <p>Senator Malcolm Byrne raised the issue of the Central Statistics Office report on educational attainment at third level.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lisa Chambers:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2449\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2449&amp;amp;pid=LisaChambers&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->He outlined some incredible statistics on Ireland's attainment levels in younger cohorts.  It is to be applauded that we have the highest educational attainment at third level in the EU and one of the highest in the world.  He is correct to say that we often speak about one of the key reasons for the significant amounts of foreign direct investment into Ireland as being our taxation.  It is not just about that.  It may be an element of it for some companies, but I agree with him that it is more about talent and the educated workforce that we have across multiple sectors.<\/p><p>He also raised the issue of higher education funding, which has been a topic of discussion for many years.  The Cassells report has been gathering dust for many years.  Multiple Ministers have not moved to enact the report's recommendations or dealt with the overall question of how to fund third level education.  Should it be done through student loans or Exchequer funding?  It is contentious and there is not full agreement on it.  A debate needs to be had.  I note the Minister made a commitment to deal with that report this year.  We will certainly seek a debate with the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, on that issue.<\/p><p>He also paid tribute to &Uacute;na Walsh the harpist who played on the \"Late Late Show\".  I thought she was excellent and I wish her well in her future career, which I have no doubt will be a stellar one.<\/p><p>Senator Ahearn raised the delay in the construction of Clonmel Garda station which is delaying further development in the town.  He should table a Commencement matter on it.  It is quite a niche issue and he may be able to get a satisfactory response through that mechanism.<\/p><p>Senator Mullen raised a very interesting topic and certainly one that requires further debate.  It is the influence of money on policymaking specifically relating to EU rapporteurs working in different areas and the level to which they may be influenced by funding coming from certain organisations that have a particular viewpoint or objective they are trying to achieve.  If what the Senator has put on the record of the House is correct, it appears that the code of conduct as set down by the EU is not being fully adhered to by all rapporteurs.  Much discussion needs to be had on that very interesting point.<\/p><p>Senator Pauline O'Reilly concurred with the remarks of the Cathaoirleach on Romania Day.  I also agree with those remarks.  She also raised the issue of HEPA filters which has been a topic for discussion.  Tomorrow in the House, we will have a debate on Covid and education with the Minister for Education.  It would be opportune to ask the question.  We also have statements on health this evening.  As both Ministers will be in the House this week, there will be an opportunity to discuss that issue directly with them.<\/p><p>There will also be an opportunity for Senators to share their concerns about the requirement for younger children to wear masks.  I agree with the comments of the Ombudsman for Children that we need to keep the matter under review every few weeks.  It is a very significant ask of our younger people, in particular their curtailment of their social activities and now the requirements for masks in schools, particularly when the rest of us can move freely.  We always need to question whether we are doing the right thing, taking on board, obviously, the public health advice and the need to curtail the spread of the virus.  We also need to keep this under review.  They are young children and these things have an impact.  We will have those debates this evening and tomorrow.<\/p><p>Senators Boylan and Blaney asked about the mica redress scheme.  As someone who lives in a county where homeowners have been affected by mica, I very much welcome the scheme.  It has been a long time in negotiation.  It is a significant improvement on the scheme that was announced by the previous Government.  Many of the concerns have been taken on board.  In excess of &euro;2 billion will be put into the scheme which is a colossal amount of money by any standards.  It will ensure that the vast majority of homeowners will be able to rebuild their homes to the best of standards as of today.  It is welcome to have a conclusion in sight before Christmas.<\/p><p>I commend the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, Councillor Martin McDermott in Donegal, Senator Blaney, Deputy Calleary, the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, Deputy McHugh, my constituency colleague, Senator Burke, and all those who have worked on it.  Many people have given input into this having listened to the concerns of those affected.  Many families have endured a very traumatic experience over a long period and many of them had to move out of their homes.  I am sure the scheme will be welcomed, despite some people not being fully happy.  It is a significant scheme with a large amount of money behind it.<\/p><p>Senator Ardagh raised the issue of the Irish Sign Language Bill that was brought through by the Cathaoirleach, Senator Mark Daly, in the previous term.  She supported the call for it to be a subject in second level schools.  She also raised the need for transport police on our public transport, the DART and Luas in particular, because of ongoing antisocial behaviour.  It is certainly something to be considered.<\/p><p>Senator Buttimer asked about the process and criteria to select host countries for sporting events like the World Cup and the Olympic Games.  He pointed to the need to have an audit on the human rights abuses of countries.  Any country that has been found to have been abusing human rights or not adhering to human rights practices and standards should not be a host country for these world sporting events.  He made a very good point.  What are the criteria for selecting a country?  Very often it appears to be money from what I can see.  One would have to question the locations of some of the most significant sporting events in recent years.  We should not need to have a discussion now about whether we should be sending Ministers and members of our diplomatic corps to the Olympic Games because that should be considered before these host countries are selected.<\/p><p>Senators Murphy and Maria Byrne raised the plight of the hospitality sector.  In all the areas where we are living, we are aware of many cancellations.  It is nearly worse than when they were closed because when they were closed, they had certainty about the State supports they were getting and they did not need to buy food, pay staff and pay certain overheads, whereas now they are open and are depending on all of us to support them.<\/p><p>Senator Murphy made a very good point that public health advice allows us to go to our local pub or restaurant to have a meal.  In line with public guidelines, it is a safe place to go.  It is an important message in the run up to Christmas.  Many businesses survive on the basis of having a good Christmas which gets them through the quieter months in the earlier parts of the new year.  We need to get the message out that it is safe to go out in smaller groups to those settings because the public health advice is clear.  Those businesses are running a tight ship and are ensuring their customers are safe.  I really feel for those businesses that have bought in food and paid staff, and people are cancelling.  I understand the concerns leading to people cancelling.  We need to convey the message that it is safe to go out.  People should try to support their local hospitality businesses because they may not be there next year if they do not get that support.<\/p><p>Senator Burke spoke in support of the mica scheme.  He also pointed out that nobody had been held accountable for this.  Who is to blame for this?  The politicians of today were not the perpetrators of it.  Many people were involved along the way.  Questions need to be asked about why everybody was able to walk away leaving the homeowners with nothing.  It was then left up to the politicians to try to rescue the situation through an enormous amount of taxpayers' money.  This money is being spent out of the public purse.  More than  &euro;2 billion is a significant amount of money.  If it is being spent on this scheme, and rightly so, it means it is not being spent on other public services and investment in capital projects.  Those are the decisions governments must make and that is the responsibility that lies with Cabinet Ministers.<\/p><p>Senator Byrne and other Members of the House have made the point previously about the corporate veil and those organisations and corporate entities that may have been responsible.  We do not know who knew what or when.  We do not know anything about how this happened.  We all suspect certain things, but ultimately the taxpayer is footing the bill for this.  Significant questions remain to be asked as to who is responsible and where the accountability for this issue lies.<\/p><p>Senator McGahon raised the lack of electric vehicle charging points or infrastructure for those living in an apartment block.  It is an area of concern.  How are we supposed to get to 1 million EVs without having charging points, given that many people are living in apartment buildings?  I was not aware of this until recently; technology exists to allow EVs to be charged at a lamp post.  We need to embrace any such technology because we have very ambitious targets to meet in our climate action plan.  It will involve all hands on deck and using every bit of technology we can to meet those ambitious targets and objectives.<\/p><p>Senator Dolan spoke about the EU competition.  I am aware that See Her Elected has been nominated.  I wish those involved well.  It has been a fantastic initiative.  Some of my party colleagues are involved in the organisation.  Women living in a rural area have particular difficulty in getting noticed and getting involved.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lisa Chambers:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2449\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2449&amp;amp;pid=LisaChambers&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We are often asked how we got involved in politics and very often it is because we were asked.  We did not push ourselves forward, for the most part.  The Senator is right to point out that in rural areas, it was traditionally done through organisations such as the Irish Farmers Association or the GAA, which were, historically, predominantly male.  It can be difficult for a woman to break through.  The Senator is right that parents associations, Tidy Towns associations and community groups are often led and run by women who then do not make the decision to run for public life.  See Her Elected and similar campaigns are, therefore, important and make a difference.  Women for Election is another organisation that has done fantastic work over the years to increase female participation by providing training programmes and putting people in touch with different political parties or other public representatives to push women to go forward for election.  That is good because we are a much richer and diverse democracy when we are more representative of our communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120100002#N00800","speaker":"1642","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638354600,"counter":89,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120100002#P00200","speaker":"1654"},{"type":"speech","time":1638354600,"counter":90,"content":"<p>Senator Dolan mentioned that Friday is the day to recognise people with a disability and asked people to wear purple.

That is democracy, to allow the speaker to speak.  I thank the Senator.  Before explaining the purpose of each amendment I want to dispel any misconceptions surrounding these amendments.  The purpose behind these amendments is to create a fairer, more just and rehabilitative focused justice system, not a let-off system.  I could not make the last debate and I went back over some of the comments made.  Some of Senator McDowell's comments confused me in regard to the reference to crack cocaine in Tallaght, which completely had no substance or basis.  We are talking about people and addiction.  The idea of a bad guy was referenced by one of the Senators.  There is a very fine line, there is a cigarette paper between the idea of what a bad guy is, and what a victim is.  Many people who perpetrate crime are also the victims of crime and of circumstance.  We need to be able to show discretion in these situations.  That is not to condone the acts of anybody, but usually there is a situation of duress, a situation of conditions or of intimidation in the background.  There are so many factors that we will never know.  That is why discretion is hugely important.  These amendments are not written to enable the courts to go easier on crime, they are written to facilitate the rehabilitation of people who, by dint of their circumstances may have been more vulnerable to the crimes referenced within this Bill.<\/p> <p>I will briefly walk through each amendment.  Amendment No. 1 amends section 4 of the Bill.  The purpose of adding this line is to remove presumptive minimum sentencing from the Firearms Act 1925.  As both myself and Senator Black have said previously, adding this line will enable us to step towards a system which best supports a rehabilitative justice system.  To do this it is crucial that we empower the Judiciary to sentence on a case-by-case basis.  By accepting the amendment to section 4 of the Bill, we have the opportunity to support our Judiciary to make these circumstantial sentences and empower its members to make decisions which would best serve the offender in front of them, as well as society at large and public safety, rather than simply make decisions which the legislation allows them to make.  By removing subsections (4), (4A), (5) and (6) from section 15 of the Firearms Act 1925 we offer society a more understanding justice system.  By removing these subsections we would remove the legislation binding judges to a presumptive minimum sentence of ten years in prison and instead would insert an opportunity for judges to offer sentences which they believe will best rehabilitate the offender, not just in exceptional cases but in any case which the judge feels to be fit, based on the facts of the case. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120100002#Q00600","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"speech","time":1638354600,"counter":99,"content":"<p>I interrupt the Senator briefly, to be helpful.

I will, yes.  What brings this Bill before us today is minimum sentencing in regard to the Firearms Act 1964, specifically in regard to minimum sentencing legislation and the Ellis <i>v.<\/i>Minister for Justice and Equality case.  Without rehashing the details of the case, with which I am sure Members are all familiar, this amendment would ensure that should any judge deem it fitting to suspend a sentence due to the details presented before him or her, he or she would be allowed to do so.  Currently the threshold set in the Firearms Act 1964 for when a judge may ignore the presumptive minimum sentence is only in exceptional cases.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lynn Ruane:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2481\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2481&amp;amp;pid=LynnRuane&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In effect, we are asking members of our Judiciary to judge whether or not a case meets an abstract exceptional standard before they can use knowledge of the circumstances of the case to hand down an appropriate sentence.  I have much experience in regard to drugs offences.  I spent a lot of time in and out of the courts over the years, acting as an advocate and support to many people who have ended up in front of the Judiciary for drugs offences.  How well people do or do not do in terms of deeming themselves an exceptional circumstance can rely heavily on many things, such as the type of supports within their family, the types of supports within their community, whether they have been engaged with sports clubs, what type of references they can build up and what type of psychosocial analysis they can have someone provide for the court case.  Some people have the ability to show, or have a legal team that can show, why something is an exceptional case.  However, somebody may be in a similar case or a worse case but may not have the means, wherewithal or know-how to lean on all those supports, or the legal team to be able to make that case to the courts.<\/p><p>Our amendments would remove this arbitrary exceptional standard and allow judges to tailor sentences to the circumstances of each individual case, rather than being bound to legislation.  This is in order to have the best possible chance of creating a system which promotes the ideals of rehabilitation, not only in cases deemed exceptional, but in every case.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 6, which relates to section 6, seeks the removal of presumptive minimum sentences, but this time in regard to the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977.  Convictions under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 are, by their nature, highly circumstantial.  In order to hand down a sentence which respects these circumstances, a judge must be free from the binding of the presumptive minimum sentencing legislation laid out in sections 27(3C) and 27(3D).  As I set out on previous stages, it is also because these convictions are so circumstantial that the Law Reform Commission recommended, in its 2013 mandatory sentences report, that subsections (3C) and (3D) be removed because they bind judges to restrictive minimum sentencing legislation.  The report stressed that these require nuance and understanding in order to deliver a fair and correct sentence.  They are cases which cannot be simply brushed aside as being convictions of \"bad guys\", as I said earlier.  They often involve individuals whose involvement in the drugs trade comes about through circumstance and often from the same circumstance that creates situations of addiction.  Poverty is often a driving force for many and, to be honest, I believe poverty should never be a crime.  If people are forced into particular situations because of poverty, by extension, they are being criminalised through marginalisation because their circumstances have created a set of conditions in which they then break the law.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 7 would amend section 7 by removing subsections (9), (9A), (10) and (11) of the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act 1990, which is the legislation under which Mr. Ellis was prosecuted.  This amendment has the same purpose as the previous amendment and would remove the presumptive minimum sentence with regard to the 1990 Act.  The amendment is made on the recommendation of the Irish Penal Reform Trust and the Law Reform Commission, both of which stressed that to accept the amendment would be a step towards a fairer justice system.<\/p><p>The final amendment is amendment No. 8.  Of all of the amendments, this is the one I would really like to stress.  The amendment seeks to amend section 8 by removing section 25 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007.  The amendment is proposed with the aim of allowing those convicted under both the misuse of drugs and the firearms legislation access to the possibility of temporary release.  There does not seem to be any reason, rationale or sense behind removing the ability for people to be able to access temporary release, not only in regard to individuals' ability to reintegrate and to prepare themselves for release and get to know their community again, but also in regard to the protection and well-being of their family.  We are talking about a family member who has spent a considerable amount of time in the prison system just landing back at their door, sometimes with children in the house who, in many cases, have not had their father stay overnight with them in years.  They are just planted back into the family and into the community, which does not serve the individual or the family, but it also does not serve public safety.  We need to build the capacity of people to reintegrate safely, ensure they are connected with their services and ensure they have had an opportunity to engage in employment on a temporary release scheme, because this is what brings about long-term public safety.<\/p><p>I think we can all agree on this.  Although I advocate very heavily for the individual who has committed crime, the ultimate goal of any of us is to ensure that people are safe, communities are safe and families are safe.  It is in that vein that I implore the Minister of State to consider accepting amendment No. 8 to allow temporary release, to ensure people have the best opportunity possible, to ensure we protect the well-being of the family, where people are welcome in the individual home, and that we also protect the community because we have safely reintegrated individuals before their release.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120100002#Q00800","speaker":"1681","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638354600,"counter":102,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for presenting such an array of amendments so succinctly and comprehensively.

I certainly heard her very strong arguments in regard to the purpose of the amendments.  I will not be accepting the amendments and I will set out why.  I note amendments Nos. 1 to 8, inclusive, have been taken together.  Amendments Nos. 1 to 8, inclusive, provide for the further amendment of sentencing provisions in the Firearms Acts 1925 and 1964, the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977, the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act 1990 and the Criminal Justice Act 2007.  The effect of each of these amendments is to repeal various provisions for presumptive minimum sentences in the Act concerned.  A presumptive minimum sentence directs a court to impose at a minimum a specified term of imprisonment unless the court is of the view that exceptional circumstances require a lower sentence.<\/p> <p>In the case of amendments Nos. 1, 3 and 6, the presumptive minimum sentences concerned are for imprisonment of ten years for certain firearms or drug offences, while in the case of amendments Nos. 4, 5 and 7, the presumptive minimum sentences concerned are for imprisonment of five years for certain firearms offences.  In the case of amendment No. 8, the presumptive minimum sentence is for three quarters of the maximum sentence provided by law for each of the serious offences listed in Schedule 2 to the Criminal Justice Act 2007.  The amendments would not repeal all penalties for the various offences involved.  While the presumptive minimum sentences would be repealed under these amendments, there would still be a maximum sentence in each section for the offence concerned, which would be subject to judicial discretion.<\/p> <p>I have acknowledged in the course of D&aacute;il and Seanad debates on this Bill the important role that is carried out by the Judiciary in the administration of justice.  As has been noted previously, including by the Supreme Court in its judgment on the Ellis case, sentencing always involves consideration by the Judiciary of the gravity of the offence, the circumstances, the personal situation of the accused and any mitigating factors.  I must note, however, that as I outlined in earlier debates in both Houses, this Bill is limited in scope and is designed to rectify the constitutional infirmity identified in the Ellis case by the repeal of all mandatory minimum sentences for second or subsequent offences.  It does not set out to make further policy and legislative changes in the area of sentencing for criminal offences.  The Bill is urgently needed in its current form in order to clarify the legal position with regard to the issues raised in the Ellis judgment, which was issued by the Supreme Court in 2019.  The Bill is not intended to be a vehicle for a much broader set of legal changes in the area of sentencing.  Existing penalties for presumptive minimum sentences are not affected by the Ellis judgment and remain valid.<\/p> <p>It is also worth considering that there are likely to be a wide range views in this House and elsewhere as to whether such sentences are appropriate in the case of each particular offence concerned.  A balanced view is needed which would also take into account the right of the Oireachtas to express its view on what certain sentencing thresholds should be, having regard to the seriousness of certain offences and, indeed, taking into account the perspective of victims of crime.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy James Browne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2443\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2443&amp;amp;pid=JamesBrowne&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->For these reasons, I regret I cannot agree to amendments Nos. 1 to 8.  However, as noted by Senator Ruane on Second Stage, section 29 of the Judicial Council Act 2019 provides that the Minister shall commence a review of minimum sentences not later than two years after the commencement of the section.  The section was legally commenced with effect from 16 December 2019 and, therefore, the review must be completed and a report must be provided to the Oireachtas within 12 months.  I can confirm to the House that the plans are now in place for the legislative requirements to be met in full.  In short, this review of all minimum sentences will start in the next couple of weeks and will, in accordance with legislation, be completed within a 12-month period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120100002#R00500","speaker":"1618","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638354600,"counter":107,"content":"<p>I hear what the Minister of State is saying about what the Bill is intended to do.  I am sure he can appreciate that, as someone who cares about this area, I try to find any possible way into the conversation and to amend the legislation.<\/p> <p>I wonder whether the Minister of State could explain a little more the reason the section in question has to come under the suite of measures.  Logically, if a person has a minimum sentence, he or she has to serve a minimum amount of time before any form of release.  If the person is given temporary release, it would fall under the minimum sentence arrangement in respect of the amount of time before the release date for which he or she is allowed to integrate into the community.  I think that is the logic but I am not really sure.  Is there a rationale for the temporary release provision?  If the Minister of State cannot answer now and has to come back to me, that will be completely acceptable.  I want to understand why the temporary release provision has to be included in respect of meeting the requirements under the sentencing guidelines.  To me, it really is a threat to public safety to release somebody who has spent considerable time in prison.  It does not benefit any of us, nor does it benefit the justice system.<\/p> <p>I understand there are different types of temporary release, so maybe it is a matter of breaking it down even further into the types that somebody might or should have access to if he or she falls under the guidelines.  Perhaps as part of the review and reporting, the Minister of State, his officials and I can engage further on how we uncouple the temporary release aspect from the rest of the sentencing guidelines in respect of what I dealt with in amendments Nos. 1 to 8.

I will speak for 14 minutes and he will have two.  This motion is important because it deals with sensitive issues between the Irish State and the People's Republic of China.

It also states the House &quot;rejects any attempts to curtail or end dealings by members of the Oireachtas with the people and government of Taiwan&quot; and &quot;condemns all efforts to isolate the people and government of Taiwan from participation in international organisations and joint international humanitarian initiatives.&quot;<\/p><p>I was privileged to travel to Taiwan to witness and see for myself how its last general election was conducted.  Although I was expecting that a democratic process of that kind would be different in other parts of the world, I found that, in Taiwan, there was a massive turnout of voters in polling stations right across the country.  There was great engagement by the people and massive rallies for the various parties.  There was a total commitment to ensuring the election was fair and free.  That is something no other person in China is permitted to participate in at this time.  There are no free and fair elections in the so-called People's Republic of China.  The people are given no direct say.  It is a dictatorship run by the Communist Party of China, which claims to act in the interests of the people.  It is a one-party state.  <\/p><p>Aside from that, there is also the enormous issue of how members of the Uighur people, the Muslim minority in Xinjiang province, have been treated by the Beijing Government.  I will very briefly paint a picture of what has happened to them.  A massive assault has been launched on their cultural, religious, ethnic and social existence.  An article in <i>The Guardian<\/i>this week clearly exposes how this goes straight to the top, to President Xi.  He called for radical measures to crush what he considers to be a separatist threat in that province and for the strongest measures to be taken to ensure that no religious or minority tendencies in any way threaten the integrity of the People's Republic of China.  For ordinary Uighurs, this means families being broken up, people being brought to so-called re-education camps and interned in what we would call prisons and women having their reproductive rights greatly circumscribed by Chinese authorities.  All of this is done with the avowed purpose of controlling the growth of the Uighur population in Xinjiang province.  This is only five or seven years after the ending of the one-child policy in China.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michael McDowell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=719\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->They now realise that their horrifically inhuman attacks on their own people's reproductive rights have led to a crisis with an ageing population.  One section of the Chinese people, the Uighur population, has been specially set aside as a group whose reproduction rate is considered in China to be a threat to the people's republic.  People have been the subject of mass deportations and have been sent to work as quasi-slave labourers in other parts of China.  Families have been broken up and their civil and political rights, as they existed in a tiny and vistigial way in modern China, have been completely trampled.  I do not compare this with what happened in Nazi Germany, but it amounts to a form of cultural, religious and ethnic genocide deliberately being perpetrated by the Beijing Government.<br\/><br\/>Where are we in all of this?  We are involved in two ways.  We have diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China and for that purpose we accept the one China policy.  That involves the Chinese assertion that the <i>de facto<\/i>division between mainland China and Taiwan is not legitimate and that there is an aspiration for unity of all the Chinese people, including the people of Taiwan.  Our Government generally endorses that position.  I presume, however, we do not support the notion that any force could be used in an any attempted reunification of China with Taiwan.  President Xi has explicitly endorsed the possibility of using force to end the Taiwan problem.  Wwe must make it very clear that we stand with those countries in the free world that absolutely and categorically reject such use of force and who stand with the people of Taiwan to say that any reunification of China and Taiwan can only be done by peaceful means.  We accepted that principle in 1998 when we decided that  peaceful means were the only way to Irish unity.<br\/><br\/>When I visited China as a Minister, I was forcefully struck by the changes under way at the time.  The former Secretary of State of the United States of America, Mr. Henry Kissinger, published a book on China.  I remember discussing it with him.  His view was that if China were to be integrated into the international world of trade from an economic point of view and were to prosper as a result, an emerging middle class in China would essentially change the nature of the country and make armed conflict between China and other states impossible.  For a while it seemed his optimism was well placed.  Now, however, we have a different China that is following an approach of wolf diplomacy.  It retaliates against countries that query its human rights record and threatens trade relations with those countries.<br\/><br\/>When I visited in Taiwan, I spoke with diplomats from many other countries stationed in representative offices.  I also visited the European Union's representative office in Taipei.  It was shocking to be told that Ireland especially among all the European Union member states had least to do with the European Union's representative office in Taipei.  It had closed whatever trade mission we had there and it was the one country that stood out as being most afraid in any way of crossing the path of the Chinese Government by having any visible presence in Taipei or Taiwan.  That is shameful.  It is really shameful because other members of the European Union have their representative offices there and the European Union has a representative office that we, in effect, boycott.  It is sad cowardice.<br\/><br\/>I will mention briefly the freedom of Members of the Oireachtas, including those in this House, to engage in political dialogue and friendly relations with the Taiwan representative office in Dublin.  It exists here but it is deeply unfortunate that the Ceann Comhairle, in his capacity as Chairman of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, wrote to Members of this House urging them to bear in mind the damage they would do to Ireland's interests by engaging at all with Taiwanese representatives in Dublin or having any ongoing political dialogue with them.  That is deeply regrettable but happily it was purely his own personal decision and he has no function under the Constitution to tell Members of this House or the Lower House what they should and should not do in terms of human rights and foreign policy.  The letter he wrote made very clear to me, as a recipient, the warning that I might damage Ireland's national interest by seeing a democratic process in operation in Taiwan and that I might damage our trading interests.  I accept our significant trading interest with China, but that does not mean I must avert my eyes or close my mouth when it comes to the abuse of human rights in China.<br\/><br\/>I put on record that the People's Republic of China has had a very interesting path of development.  It has gone through terrible periods of vicious suppression of its own minorities, with tens of millions of people dying in various campaigns promoted under the leadership of Chairman Mao.  I am long enough around here to remember - most Members of the House are not - a time when I was at university when contemporaries were breaking up lectures, waving the little red book, as the Irish end of the cultural revolution.  They were beating up lecturers in Trinity and UCD for having views on history and pharmacology that offended Chairman Mao's diktat.  I remember all of that.<br\/><br\/>China's record is not one we should admire.  It has done great things by embracing internal capitalism to alleviate the poverty it inflicted on its people but now we have come to the point where it is exerting influence across the world while at the same time engaging in massive suppression of minorities within its own state and threatening to take away the freedoms of the people of Taiwan.  The time has come for Members of the Oireachtas, freely and without any downward pressure from anybody, right or wrong, to express our views on these matters and call on the Government to strengthen its stance as a member of the United Nations Security Council against the abrogation of human rights in China.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120100002#Z00200","speaker":"1669","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638354600,"counter":145,"content":"<p>I second the motion and will use the last minute and half or so of the slot to thank my colleague and friend, Senator McDowell, for setting out the terms of the motion, which are very clear.

There is a lot that we can learn and there is a lot we can share.  I support the development of global, free and fair trade.  The EU and Ireland should do what they can to support trade with China, and we need to build co-operation and friendship.  I am also conscious of perceptions, and of Ireland and the EU being perceived in any way to lecture other countries.  We are not perfect ourselves, and our record on the treatment of minorities in the past has often not been perfect.  It is important, however, that we highlight universal values, and when we see human rights being abused that they are called out.  It does not matter whether this is in Belarus, Palestine, Venezuela, Cuba, or closer to home in Hungary or Poland.  When it comes to our foreign policy, it is a core question on what we stand for.  Irish foreign policy has always been based on the respect of human rights.  It has always been for standing against torture and oppression of minorities.  It supports the rule of law.  It is in favour of a free press, freedom of expression, including religious expression, as Senator Boylan has said, and the right to peaceful protest.<\/p> <p>We have seen a Chinese Communist Party that has become increasingly authoritarian.  We know about the Uighur genocide.  This is not just about the oppression of human rights or the freedom of expression.  We are talking about forced internment and mass sterilisation.  As Senator McDowell outlined very effectively, we are aware of the threats being made against Taiwan and against anyone who co-operates with Taiwan.  We are also seeing what is happening with fellow EU member state Lithuania at present.  We have seen the oppression of the Christian minorities, the Falun Dafa and other religious minorities in China.  We have seen the crushing of all dissent in Hong Kong and the national security law, which has seen more than 150 individuals rounded up, effectively without charge, just because of their public statements or political activity.  This includes the media boss Jimmy Lai and the political activist Joshua Wong.  These are activists, journalists, lawyers and academics.  The Chinese Communist Party has decided to round them up simply because of their views.<\/p> <p>In the case of Tibet, a situation that has been running for a long number of year, and Ireland has always shown solidarity with Tibet, the Chinese Communist Party continues to engage in its re-education programme.  It deprives Tibetans access to their own language.  On a regular basis, the UN committee against torture has expressed concern about the deaths and serious injuries of persons that are taken into custody in Tibet.<\/p> <p>As we see the advance of new technologies globally, we must ensure the citizens' data are protected.  I am very concerned about the growth of the surveillance society, which China and the Chinese Communist Party has allowed to develop.<\/p> <p>I have also tabled an amendment on the Beijing Olympics, which I will speak to in a moment.  I respect the Department's request not to push the particular amendment, and I will not.  I do this because of work that is going on in the case of Richard O'Halloran.  It is very important that we support the Department in its work to try to secure the freedom of an Irish citizens from an unlawful detention.  I must question the Department's approach to date concerning Richard O'Halloran.  There appears to be no progress.  Perhaps the Minister of State will be able to respond to that.  That said, I do not believe Ireland should be represented in any official or diplomatic capacity at the Beijing Winter Olympic Games.  I would be disappointed and angry if the ambassador or any official from our embassy in Beijing was to attend those games in an official capacity.  I do not believe that athletes should be disadvantaged in any way but we should support, including at EU level, a diplomatic boycott of the propaganda that will be the Beijing Winter Olympic Games.  I am aware that our Minister of State with responsibility for sport, Deputy Jack Chambers, has indicated very clearly that he will not attend.  I hope the Minister of State will also give a clear indication that the other Minister in the Department would not attend.<\/p> <p>The responsibility is not just on Government.  There must also be responsibility in the corporate world.  If those in the corporate world who are sponsoring the Beijing Winter Olympic Games want take part in this propaganda exercise on the part of the Chinese Communist Party, they need to make very clear statements around human rights.  These include some of the biggest companies in the world.  Airbnb, Allianz, Coca-Cola, Intel, Procter &amp;amp; Gamble, Samsung and Visa.  All of those companies are sponsors of the Beijing Winter Olympic Games.  They have a responsibility to indicate if they are on the side of global human rights and universal values, or if they are happy simply to support the increasingly authoritarian regime of the CCP.<\/p> <p>The Olympic Games inspires so much of the world but the International Olympic Committee also has a role in ensuring that international values around human rights are upheld.  In the selection of venues for future summer and winter Olympic Games regard must be had to the human rights record of any country.  I strongly support this motion.  It is core to Ireland's foreign policy that we put human rights at the heart of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120100002#BB00400","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"speech","time":1638354600,"counter":150,"content":"<p>The Green party, an Comhaontas Glas, is very pleased to support this motion before the House.

Much attention has quite rightly been brought to the situation of the Uighur population in Xinjiang where we have heard of the reports of mass detentions, sterilisation, and the abuse of human rights.  As a previous speaker said, if China harbours an aspiration to one day reunify with Taiwan, the only way of doing that is the democratic way.  It would make great and much more progress.  In Ireland we are at our closest point ever to reunification.  This is because the guns have been largely silent in recent times.  I am aware it is not an authentic peace but it is a seismic change to what we have been used to.  This is because we have enunciated and celebrate the consent principle.  It is through the consent principle in Northern Ireland and the consensus that one makes real progress.<\/p><p>I will make one observation about our country, and I would like the Minister of State to respond.

We eventually got a motion on that over the line.  If I could offer some constructive criticism, we seem to lack urgency in respect of condemning outright what clearly ought to be condemned.  As a small nation, we should lead the way in showing people how things can and should be done.  This begs questions.  We hear all of the time that Ireland has secured membership of the UN Security Council.  I have no doubt that Ireland and all of the officials led by the Minister for Foreign Affairs are doing their best but there is an information deficit.  With that influence at the very top table, are we any better in respect of tackling the Chinese problem?  Can we measure in tangible terms the results of our input?  How is the current position different from when we were not on the Security Council in respect condemning China and its horrendous barbaric regime?  I am sure work is being done and maybe there is a communications deficit.  I have no doubt that the uniquely Irish experience and influence are being brought to bear on the UN but I would like more updates on how we are making an effective, tangible and measured difference.<\/p><p>In many respects, the Senators who moved the motion are preaching to the converted.  Can we take the next steps?  Should we not seek to visit Taiwan or the Uighur population?  We should send a delegation.  We should put China under the microscope and under pressure.  Diplomacy is the art of speaking so I do not believe in cutting ties.  As suggested by a previous speaker, can we take the unprecedented step of inviting the Chinese ambassador to address the Upper House?  That would be a marked departure but this is a very serious issue?  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence will do its best but I wonder how the Seanad can make a difficult situation better in a measured and tangible way.  Our presence today putting on record all of our concerns is in itself a very important exercise but I seek the next steps.  Can the EU agitate more?  The EU has let us down sometimes, for example, by not leading the way and waiving patents for vaccines.  I ask the Minister of State to kindly reassure us and the Irish people that our input at the UN is being felt at the highest level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120100002#BB00500","speaker":"1667","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638354600,"counter":152,"content":"<p>I welcome my very good friend and party colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Brophy.  I know from internal meetings and my membership of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence that the Minister of State is very proactive on all issues and has made a real impact in his Ministry.  It is a great pleasure to have him here today.<\/p> <p>I will pick up where my good friend and colleague, Senator Martin, finished and put the record straight on our involvement at UN level.  That is not to object to his full thesis that we should use the UN and our presidency of the Security Council to the maximum degree.  Ireland joined a cross-regional statement on human rights in China at the third committee of the UN General Assembly on Thursday, 21 October.  The statement calls on China to allow immediate, meaningful and unfettered access to Xinjiang for independent observers, including the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.  It also expressed concern about fundamental freedoms, political pluralism and democratic rights in Hong Kong arising from the introduction of the national security law.  In line with the European Council's conclusions, Ireland suspended its extradition agreement with Hong Kong in October 2020.<\/p> <p>Senator Martin is fundamentally correct that we should of course use every international body to unambiguously pursue human rights, specifically in China in this instance.  Ireland has great credentials and moral authority in this area and is highly respected.  This matter should be pursued irrespective of the forum, but especially in the UN.  I wanted to put on record that we are doing what we can.  Unfortunately, we can make moral arguments and pass motions but the degree to which we can achieve their implementation is somewhat fettered.  Nevertheless, we must do our best and keep at it, as we are doing.<\/p> <p>Ireland has a positive trading relationship with China valued at &euro;24 billion.  There are 6,000 Irish citizens in Hong Kong, 1,000 in Shanghai and 600 in Beijing.  These are important relationships, which we would like to see grow.  In acknowledging our positive relationship, I will make a few points on human rights.  First, the basic thesis stands that the authoritarian regime should not become more authoritarian and should adopt a human rights approach.  The sabre-rattling and threats to Taiwan cannot be supported under any circumstances.  We have Taiwanese representatives of very high quality here in Dublin.  The Oireachtas must unambiguously state that Taiwan must have self-government and its own administration and has a right to self-determination in the sense that it has it currently.  There should also be no threat to the existence of Taiwan or its future.  Ireland's trade with Taiwan is worth &euro;1 billion, which is not insignificant.  The Taiwanese question is a major one.  In recent times, there has been an implicit threat to Taiwan which is creating insecurity.  We must unambiguously oppose that.<\/p> <p>Tragically, the question of the Uighur Muslims is on everyone's lips and we are giving it much thought.  What we know is horrific and what we do not know is scary.  We are aware of the abuses, including the use of electronic devices, and the concentration and re-education camps.  We know that much but what do we not know?  How comparable are this case and events in the Second World War?  It is a human tragedy, observers should be let in and the issue should be dealt with.<\/p> <p>The question of Hong Kong arises.  The basic law, the abuses in Hong Kong and way in which normal existence in Hong Kong has been upset over the years are a retrograde step.  Given what has happened in Hong Kong in recent years, there is a fear that the problem will extend to Taiwan next.<\/p> <p>We must to be unambiguous in our pursuit of human rights, both at UN and EU level.  Beyond that, we cannot take unilateral action that would have any impact.  Unfortunately, I missed some of the earlier contributions as I had to be elsewhere.  I have no doubt that one or more previous speakers have already suggested or will suggest that we break off all trading relationships and all forms of contact with China, commercial and otherwise.  I do not support that thesis but I support the thesis that we should be unambiguous and make our position clear in the EU, during our presidency of the Security Council, and also the Council of Europe, even if, strictly-speaking, it is not a relevant forum as it is focused on Europe.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Joe O'Reilly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=1610\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1610&amp;amp;pid=JoeOReilly&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I thank the Acting Chairman for the opportunity and congratulate the movers of this important motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120100002#CC00200","speaker":"1692","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638354600,"counter":154,"content":"<p>Ar dt&uacute;s b&aacute;ire, cuirim roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.

We are absolutely committed to the principles of human rights and stand opposed to and condemn human rights abuses wherever they occur in the world.  On the increase in tensions between China and Taiwan, the situation should be de-escalated and diplomacy and dialogue should be the instruments used to bring calm to the region.  This is what the European Union is meant to be about - dialogue and conflict resolution.  We must ensure Ireland's voice remains steadfast on the international stage against all human rights violations and use the position on the UN Security Council to act in support of negotiation, engagement and resolution.<\/p> <p>Since 1971, successive Irish Governments have recognised the Government of the People's Republic of China as the sole representative of China.

It also needs to be said that co-operation between the EU and China was central to first securing the Iran nuclear agreement, and co-operation in this field will remain an important factor in future developments in that regard.<\/p> <p>I encourage Senators, the Department and the Government to look to our own experiences of peacebuilding, conflict resolution and justice and human rights and ensure that Ireland stands for these principles at home and throughout the world.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120100002#DD00200","speaker":"1688"},{"type":"speech","time":1638354600,"counter":155,"content":"<p>The Labour Party supports this motion.

There was a dispute between her and the human rights commission.  Essentially, she was a whistle-blower because she noticed that the UN was passing on information to China, specifically giving names of some dissidents in the Uighur region.  Ms Reilly was suspended in 2019 and three weeks ago she was given a termination notice.  She now lives in Paris.

I, too, was in the privileged position to visit Taiwan.  In the lead-up to the visit, I spent a lot of time doing research, especially in the areas of interest to me.  While looking into the education system in Taiwan, I became aware of the Sunflower Student Movement, about which I read with great interest.  It was a wave of youth activism that swept across Taipei in March 2014 in opposition to a planned free trade pact with China.  It was led by students and academics.  The movement pushed back against the pact, which they understood was an attempt by Beijing to insert itself into Taiwan and control its economy.  They correctly viewed the pact as a way for the Chinese Government to subvert politics and control Taiwan through its economy.  China was in effect arming itself with the threat that should Taiwan descent to a Chinese policy, it could collapse Taiwan's economy overnight.  The students spotted the pattern.  They saw the pact for what it was, namely, another attempt by China to take control of Taiwan, maybe not by armed force but by economic threat.<\/p><p>The movement came to a head when, having occupied the legislative chamber for half a month, the students' demands were met.  Taiwan established a law requiring the supervision of cross-strait agreements before passing legislation.  This law, which was subsequently signed by all Taiwanese lawmakers, represents more than its procedures.  It represents Taiwan's assertion of its independence.  This independence is under threat.  On Monday, Taiwan had to scramble fighters as 27 Chinese airforce planes entered Taiwan airspace, five of which were nuclear capable bombers.  There is no doubt this was an act of warfare.  As Taiwan's defence minister, Chiu Kuo-cheng, put it, this was an attempt by the Chinese Government to let Taiwan know who has the power.<\/p><p>I have listened to today's debate and if I were a member of the Chinese Government or a decision maker looking in, I would not be too worried because every time Senators spoke about human rights abuse, they prefaced their remarks by referring to positive trade relationships.  It already gives a hand over if we say we will criticise China's human rights abuses while also drawing attention to trade arrangements.  To be honest, no one will be worried by what we are saying today.  We should not preface comments on human rights abuses with references to trade agreements.  That completely undermines the severity of what people are experiencing in China.  One of the communities Senators have referred to is the Uighur Muslim community.  This issue is not new but in recent years, it has reached unprecedented levels.<\/p><p>In February this year, the BBC published a report on the systematic rape of female detainees in Chinese re-education camps.  Former detainees and escapees recounted that organised mass rape is regularly perpetrated by Chinese police personnel.  One account was by a woman named Ziawudun, who fled Xinjiang after her release and is now in the US.  She recalls women being removed from the cells every night and raped by one or more masked Chinese men.  She said she was tortured and later gang-raped on three occasions, each time by two or three men.  She also recounted being physically abused, including being bitten by Chinese officials.  A woman who slept near Ziawudun in the cell, who said she had been detained for giving birth to too many children, disappeared for three days and when she returned her body was covered in the same bite marks.  We also know from testimony submitted to the Uyghur Human Rights Project that women are subject to barbaric forms of torture, including electrocution while also being sexually abused.  <\/p><p>An article in <i>The Art Newspaper<\/i>reads:<\/p> <blockquote> \tEthan Gutmann, an award-winning China analyst who has researched transplant abuse in the country for nearly two decades, told the [Uyghur] tribunal [that took place in London] that satellite images show crematoriums built close to prison camps so that bodies can be burned after operations to remove organs.  He estimates that between 25,000 and 50,000 Uyghurs are being killed for their organs every year and that this is &quot;overwhelming crematoria facilities near camps,&rdquo; Gutmann said. <\/blockquote> <p>Crimes for which people can be sentenced to years of imprisonment in the detention camps include praying regularly; reciting an Islamic verse at a funeral; giving children names of Islamic origin; teaching the Koran to one's children; attending a mosque; possessing religious content, such as Islamic verses, on mobile phones; practising Islamic burial rites such as washing deceased bodies according to Islamic custom; and wearing the hijab.<\/p><p>In June 2021, Amnesty International published a report documenting how Uighurs, Kazakhs and other Muslim ethnic minorities in Xinjiang face systematic state-organised mass imprisonment, torture and persecution, all of which amount to crimes against humanity.  In addition, the US has recently joined several countries, including Canada and the Netherlands, in accusing China of committing genocide, defined by the United Nations genocide convention as the &quot;intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group&quot;.<\/p><p>Despite the ongoing abused of Uighur Muslims, it would be wrong to say that their treatment is unexpected.

I am very pleased today to contribute to this important debate.  Ireland has a proud history of supporting the protection of human rights around the world.  We are a small country but we are an independent voice on the international stage, prioritising the most vulnerable and marginalised.  We are committed to the universality, indivisibility and interrelatedness of all human rights and to accountability for human rights violations and abuses.  I welcome the opportunity to discuss our engagement with China and will set out how Ireland has been actively engaging with China, including on issues of concern.  I will set out how Ireland engages also with the island of Taiwan.<\/p> <p>As Senators will agree there are a number of critical issues to consider in this debate and I now want to set out the facts and clarify a number of points raised.  Ireland has a positive and growing relationship with China.  Although the pandemic has limited people-to-people contacts our two countries continue to reach out to one another in many ways, including through the Irish and Chinese diaspora communities.  There is great potential in the relationship now and for the coming years.  Ireland raises our concerns on human rights directly with other governments, including the Chinese Government, in a principled and consistent manner.  As a smaller state, the multilateral system and our membership of the European Union are also key avenues through which Ireland highlights human rights concerns, with all states, including China.  This is the case when it comes to the international community's grave concerns about the situation in Xinjiang.  I was present for this debate in the Seanad last year as well.  When I stood before the Senators last year I set out the specific concerns about Xinjiang and our disappointment with the situation was impacting negatively on our relations with China.  <\/p> <p>Our values will always remain at the forefront and weave through this Government's engagement with all partners.  We have found that the most effective way to advocate for change is to engage directly with relevant authorities in concert with our partners in multilateral fora.  The situation in Xinjiang resonates with the Irish public, the Government and clearly here in the Oireachtas and with the Senators today.  On engaging with this issue we remain pro-human rights.  We are not anti-China.  As we challenge Chinese policy we do not seek to undermine Chinese sovereignty.  Rather, we emphasise the obligation on the Chinese authorities to act in a manner which respects international human rights obligations.  The evidence-based reports regarding serious human rights breaches in Xinjiang tell us that this has not been the case.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, had the opportunity to outline Ireland's position when he visited China in May and met with foreign minister and state councillor, Wang Yi.  At that meeting, Deputy Coveney outlined our evidence-based approach and raised our concerns in an open and candid manner.  <\/p> <p>Ireland is a firm believer in the multilateral system and the mechanisms it provides for states to engage and contribute to global human rights protection.  The European Union's founding values place human rights at the centre of its internal and global engagement.  The EU has been vocal about highlighting the continued widespread and systemic human rights violation of the Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in Xinjiang.  At the 48th UN Human Rights Council in September this year, Ireland joined an EU group statement of 26 member states which called on China to comply with its obligations under national and international law to respect and protect human rights, especially in Xinjiang, Tibet and Inner Mongolia.  The statement notes grave concerns about the existence of a large network of political re-education camps, widespread surveillance, systemic restrictions on freedom of religion or belief against the Uyghurs and other persons belonging to minorities, as well as by evidence-based reports about forced labour, forced sterilisation, forced birth control and sexual and gender-based violence.  <\/p> <p>In October this year, Ireland joined a cross-regional statement on the situation in Xinjiang, delivered at the UN General Assembly.  The statement calls attention to the arbitrary detention of more than 1 million people in Xinjiang and the systematic human rights violations, including reports documenting torture or cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment.  The statement called on China to allow immediate, meaningful and unfettered access to Xinjiang for independent observers, including the UN High Commission for Human Rights  In this context, we welcome the UN High Commissioner's intention to report on human rights in Xinjiang.  Ireland has long called on all states to facilitate visits to the territory of human rights experts and we have issued a standing invitation to UN special procedures to visit Ireland.  In that context, we have repeatedly advocated for the High Commissioner to be allowed unfettered access to Xinjiang.  On one of the comments on our UN involvement raised by Senators earlier on, I have clearly outlined there that we have a sustained and strong involvement on this issue using our UN role on the Security Council, on which we are now half way through our two-year term.  <\/p> <p>In March this year the EU agreed on a global human rights sanctions regime which allows the EU to target serious human rights violations and abuses by state and non-state actors worldwide.  The agreement of sanctions against four individuals and one entity in China is designed to act as a deterrent to encourage changes in these actors' behaviour.  The sanctions are based on solid legal evidence and are deployed in addition to other measures such as dialogue.  <\/p> <p>We also maintain concern about the situation in Hong Kong and the manner in which the national security law is being implemented has already given rise to concerns that many people there no longer have the freedom to express themselves.  The changes to the relation system to the legislative council reduce democratic representation.  I can confirm that Hong Kong was another topic that the Minister, Deputy Coveney, discussed during his visit to China.  In co-ordination with EU partners Ireland has also taken practical steps including suspension of Ireland's extradition agreement with Hong Kong which clearly signals our concerns on the rule of law.  At the Human Rights Council in September Ireland joined a statement of the 26 EU member states, urging Beijing and Hong Kong administrations to respect the rule of law and Hong Kong's autonomy under the One Country, Two Systems principle.  The EU made a similar statement at the UN General Assembly which Ireland supported.  I want to underline that the primary objective in all our human rights engagement with China remains to find meaningful improvements on the ground, including in Xinjiang and Hong Kong. <\/p> <p>I now wish to set out clearly for the Seanad the Government's agreed policy on the island of Taiwan.  Successive Irish Governments have recognised the Government of the People's Republic of China as the sole representative of China.  Ireland, like all EU member states and the EU itself, adheres to the One China policy.  This means that we do not recognise Taiwan as a state nor maintain diplomatic relations with it.  This policy is a prerequisite for our diplomatic relations with China, a country of 1.4 billion people.  The policy does not however preclude us from developing economic and cultural relations with Taiwan at official level.  We value co-operation with Taiwan.  We have a working holiday authorisation programme with Taiwan, and in 2020 estimates of bilateral trade were around &euro;1 billion annually.  The European Economic and Trade Office seeks to strengthen economic and trade relations.  That office and its services are available to Irish companies and investors seeking to grow their engagement in Taiwan.  Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland manage the Taiwanese market and marketplace services for Irish companies from regional offices.  This reflects the Government's overseas trade and investment footprint.  We do not and cannot have offices everywhere, rather we work from hubs to provide effective supports to Irish businesses.  <\/p> <p>I also wish to note, particularly in regard to Senator McDowell's contribution, on the issue of Oireachtas engagement with the Taipei representative office and with others in Taiwan.  I want to be clear that the Government supports the rights of Members of the Oireachtas to engage with external parties, as they see appropriate.  It remains the case that the Government is committed to the One China policy, as I have already mentioned and outlined above.  <\/p> <p>Senators will be aware of the reports of increased tension in the Pacific, particularly around Taiwan.  It is clear that any conflict in the Taiwan Straits would have grave repercussions.  Stability in the Pacific matters from many perspectives including global trade flows.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Colm Brophy:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2427\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2427&amp;amp;pid=ColmBrophy&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Ireland has committed to promoting a multilateral rules-based approach to engagement in the region, anchored in international law.

I have always had an issue with the subject but, in more recent years, I have become even more concerned.  I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I welcome his statement.<\/p> <p>Fianna F&aacute;il welcomes the debate and endorses the long-standing policy and practice of raising concerns about human rights and fundamental freedoms directly with counterparts in the Chinese Government in the context of the EU's relationship with China and at multilateral forums including the Human Rights Council of the United Nations and the United Nations General Assembly.  There continues, however, to be deep concern over evidence-based reports on the treatment of the Uighur people in Xinjiang.  Ireland, in line with all EU member states, adheres to the One China policy, which recognises the Government of the People's Republic of China as the sole representative of China and, as such, does not maintain diplomatic relations with Taiwan.  Nevertheless, the One China policy does not preclude Ireland from developing cultural and economic relations or appropriate technical engagements with Taiwan.<\/p> <p>The protection and promotion of human rights and freedom of expression is a core pillar of Ireland's foreign policy, and it is essential that China ensures full respect for the rule of law and complies with its obligations under national and international law with regard to the protection of human rights.  Tensions are high in this region and, to be honest, I do not think the Chinese authorities have helped the situation in any way.  In the early part of the 20th century, the Uighurs briefly declared independence but the region was brought under the complete control of Communist China in 1949.  Xinjiang is currently designated as an autonomous region within China, like Tibet to its south, but the reality is the province has little autonomy from the Chinese state.<\/p> <p>Over the years, central government policies have curtailed the Uighurs' religious, commercial and cultural activities, and a large number of the majority Han Chinese have been encouraged to move to the region.  Beijing is accused of intensifying its crackdown after street protests in Xinjiang in the 1990s and again in the run-up to the Beijing Olympics in 2008.  The street protests were largely demands for economic rights.  A university student in Xinjiang told the BBC in 2014 they were banned from fasting during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, and reports from the region suggest Uighurs' local government officials have been banned from fasting and from attending mosques.  In 2017, the Chinese President issued a directive stating, \"religions in China must be Chinese in orientation, and ... adapt themselves to socialist society\".<\/p> <p>This directive led to a fresh crackdown on religious practice and particularly affected the Uighurs.  It was outrageous behaviour.  Xinjiang is now covered by a pervasive network of surveillance, including police, checkpoints and cameras that scan everything from number plates to faces.  It is horrific and horrendous.  The Chinese Government has stated the measures are necessary to combat separatist violence in the region but is accused of exaggerating the threat to justify the repression of the Uighurs, and we all know that is what is happening.  Many prominent members of the ethnic minority have been imprisoned or have sought asylum abroad after being accused of terrorism.<\/p> <p>A UN human rights committee found in 2018 there were credible reports China was holding 1 million Uighurs in political counter-extremism camps.  A committee member, Gay McDougall, stated the Chinese Government has \"turned the Uighur autonomous region into something that resembles a massive internment camp\".  Human rights charities, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have long accused Beijing of mass imprisonment and torture.  Most inmates in the so-called re-education camps - we have watched a few documentaries on what exactly is going on there - have never been charged with a crime and have not received any legal representation.  China has long denied operating internment camps and maintains the outside world does not understand the circumstances in Xinjiang but I think most of us here do understand them and most of the free world know what is being done there.  China insists that Uighur militants are waging a violent campaign for an independent state by plotting bombings, sabotage and civic unrest.  It is clear to all of us, however, that what is being done there by the Chinese authorities is a terrible human rights injustice against the people of that region.<\/p> <p>I am delighted to support the motion.  I compliment Senator McDowell and the others who brought it forward.   I thank the Minister of State for appearing before the House but we must be in no doubt that what is happening in the Uighur region is not good and the Chinese authorities must bear responsibility for it.  We must not have a soft attitude towards the way it carries on.  I fully accept we do an increasing volume of business with China but business is one thing and the human rights of people in that region are another.  I will always stand firm with those who stand up for those people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120100002#FF00400","speaker":"1674"},{"type":"speech","time":1638354600,"counter":164,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it ar an &aacute;bhar t&aacute;bhachtach seo.  I have raised these issues on a number of occasions in this Chamber and elsewhere.  It is important to make the distinction in this debate between China and its people, on the one hand, that is, the ordinary citizens trying to go about their lives, educate and feed their children and make a living, and the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese Government, on the other.  This is a distinction I have made on a number of previous occasions because the two are different.  I have great respect for the Chinese people and Chinese history, and for what China has done over its innovative history regarding the development of so many things we often think are European but, in fact, originally come from China.  Their history is enormous in terms of their contribution to the world.  What has happened in that country since 1949 and the Communist era in China has completely changed the most populous country in the world, its attitudes to its citizens and its attitudes to the wider world.<\/p> <p>It is important to make that distinction, which is why I disagree with what Senator Ruane said about talk of trade and undermining the human rights abuses.  I recognise the importance of trade and the benefits to our economy and to individual people, companies, employees and families in this country, and I do not blame any of them for trading with China and engaging with Chinese people and society.  I do not blame people for using Chinese products or driving cars built in China.  All around us, including in this room, there are things that were made in China.  That is not the problem.  The problem is at a diplomatic and political level, and I say that with great respect to the Government.  As the Minister of State noted, there has been engagement directly at the level of its foreign minister, Wang Yi, and I acknowledge that is happening.<\/p> <p>At the same time, however, the Minister of State referred to the joint declaration by EU states that refers to the existence of a large network of political re-education camps, widespread surveillance and systematic restrictions on freedom of religion or belief against Uighurs.  There is a long list of issues and we all know they are happening.  There is no dispute about their happening, except from the Chinese Government.  I have raised the issues of Uighurs in this Chamber previously and I received correspondence from the Chinese ambassador here with a report I consider to be entirely bogus, contradicting findings in respect of the Uighur population.  I wrote to him to ask him to meet and talk about the matter but I have heard nothing since.  There is no dispute in the international community about what is happening.  There is a scale that goes from the threat to Taiwan, to the removal of freedom of speech and expression in Hong Kong, to the overcoming of the population in Tibet, to what we have been talking about in regard to the Uighur population in Xinjiang.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Barry Ward:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=BarryWard&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Make no mistake about it, what is going on there is a genocide.<\/p><p>I accept the difficult position the Government is in and countries are affected differently by their relationship with China, but as we sit here and talk about it,and as Senator McDowell said in proposing this motion, it is every bit as bad as what was happening on this Continent in the early part of the 20th century.  It is of the same scale.  To sit here and talk about it, and not acknowledge that and take stronger action, is every bit as bad in terms of political correctness as it was for Eamon de Valera to sign the book of condolences for Hitler after his death in 1945.  It is of the same order.  Although it may be diplomatically and politically correct, it is morally wrong.  It is something on which we must take a stand.  <\/p><p>Let me be absolutely clear about my attitude to human rights.  There are not human rights, freedom of expression or respect for the rule of law in China.  It continues to not only disrespect the rule of law within its own borders, but to do so outside of China and attack fellow members of the European Union.  Reference was made to Lithuania.  It made the grave diplomatic mistake of acknowledging Taiwan and having a Taiwan representative office instead of a Taipei representative office in Vilnius, a distinction that the rest of us think is absolutely preposterous but which appears to raise hackles so seriously in Beijing that Lithuania has now been the recipient of a deluge of online and offline attacks from China.  China withdrew its ambassador from Vilnius.  It ejected the Lithuanian ambassador from Beijing.  <\/p><p>It is a fellow European Union state and is not very different from Ireland, but perhaps has less trade with China than Ireland.  Nonetheless, it is a fellow member of the European Union.  It has been the subject of a pile on in terms of social media, cyberattacks and protests organised in Lithuania.  I know this is difficult and that the Minister of State is in an impossible and invidious position in terms of what to do diplomatically and politically, but we are a Legislature.  We are not the Executive of this country.  The notion that we would not raise these issues time and again is wrong.  <\/p><p>In the UK, in 2015 Xi Jinping referred to the Government in China being a socialist law based government with Chinese features, a definition I reject.  The Chinese features he referred to must be the suppression of the population, abuse of its citizens and the disregard for human rights and the rule of law, things we accept as norms.  The very fact that I can stand here and talk about that freely without fear that the Minister of State, Deputy Brophy, will launch an attack against me is a demonstration of how privileged we are relative to our counterparts in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan or anywhere else one chooses to mention.  <\/p><p>There can be no dispute that China has thumbed its nose at the international community and has totally thrown out the baby that is human rights abuses with its own desire to keep the water of its own government.  The extraordinary thing is that Taiwan is a demonstration of what China could be, namely, a much freer and productive society and a successful economic entity.  The short-sightedness of Xi Jinping and the communist crew in Beijing is damaging the future of the country enormously, as well as suppressing citizens.  We call on the Minister of State to make a very clear statement in that direction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120100002#FF00500","speaker":"1685","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638354600,"counter":166,"content":"<p>Following on from Senator Ward, the problem is not the Chinese people and their ancient traditions and wisdom and tremendous capacity.

The chances that a Minister of State would have an outbreak of independent mindedness on an issue like this against Government policy would mean his promotion prospects would disappear as quickly as a Chinese government contract from a member of Falun Gong.<\/p><p>Let us start with how compromised our political establishment is, and not just in Ireland.  When prominent academic and expert on the Uighur people, Dr. David O'Brien, compared the situation in China to that of South Africa during the 1980s, our former alumnus and Minister, Ruair&iacute; Quinn, who is on the board of the Ireland China Institute, said, &quot;I don&rsquo;t think you can compare with what happened in South Africa with what is happening today with the second largest economy in the world &quot;.  We should note the economy button was pressed straightaway.  He went on to say that, &quot;What the Chinese have achieved in terms of lifting their people out of poverty involves a scale that we in Europe find hard to imagine&quot;.  There is no mention of the tens millions of people who died and the decades of imposed poverty under the Chinese system.  Putting on the cloak of Irish independent mindedness, he then said,&quot;I would be very slow to criticise other systems that have emerged, and that have emerged so successfully ... and as the Chinese have ... and I would have a great respect for how they have done that, mistakes and all&quot;.  That is a line straight out of the playbook of the Chinese Communist Party.  <\/p><p>The excellent book, <i>Hidden Hand: Exposing How the Chinese Communist Party is Reshaping the World<\/i>, shows this is one of many techniques that the Chinese Government employees.  It has people it presents as China experts and members of boards and various organisations.  In reality, they are cadres of the Chinese Communist Party.  There is the double plating of organisations which have one name for cultural and propaganda purposes and another name in the Chinese Communist Party structure because nothing may happen unless there is control of it from that party.  <\/p><p>People like Alan Dukes, Enda Kenny and Ruair&iacute; Quinn are all names we can associate some way with Chinese engagement in recent years.  The day is coming when some committee in the House, as a matter of due diligence, will have to ask people like that whether they benefit financially or otherwise in any way directly or indirectly from what they do in regard to China.  The problem is as serious as that.  Unless we start asking the hard questions, we will never discover just how compromised our institutions have become.<\/p><p>What has the Government said about the fact that the Winter Olympics will take place in Beijing?  A number of us in the House cosigned a letter to the Olympic Federation of Ireland which was met with absolute silence.  We objected to the fact that the Olympics are taking place in Beijing and called for no diplomatic engagement.  Has the Government even said it would be better if the Olympics did not take place in Beijing?  It is unthinkable that there would be any partying or diplomatic engagement.  It would be the equivalent of partying on the top deck of a luxury ship while people are enslaved and tortured in the galleys, yet that is what is constantly happening with China.  <\/p><p>That is why we had a motion here last year which called on the Government to use all diplomatic and trade links in China to nail the message on the abuse of human rights, the enslavement, torture and coercion of culture and ethnicity of the Uighur people, the suppression of democracy in Hong Kong, the abrogation of the 1980s Sino-British accords that guaranteed the two systems-one China agreement and the abuse of the Tibetan people.  No prominent leader could even meet the Dalai Lama without an objection or consequences from China.  The list is endless.  <\/p><p>An Irish citizen has been detained arbitrarily in China and we do not whether to raise this case because of fear we will damage the chances of getting him home.

I second the amendment on Tibet made my colleague, Senator Malcolm Byrne.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Brophy, to the House and thank him for his contribution.<\/p><p>Taiwan's road to democracy began in the 1980s, culminating on 23 March 1996 when the people of Taiwan elected their first president by direct suffrage.  With a population of almost 24 million, this democratic country with a western-friendly attitude and highly efficient and educated workforce proficient in speaking English must be recognised and listened to.  The Irish Government needs to engage meaningfully with the government and people of Taiwan as other countries and the vast majority of the members of the European Union do.<\/p><p>Senator Martin referred to the attitude of the European Union to Taiwan.  I will put on record the official stance of the European Union, of which we are a senior member, regarding Taiwan and the one-China policy.  For the European Union, Taiwan is a reliable and valued like-minded partner in Asia.  The European Union and Taiwan share common values, such as democracy, the rule of law and human rights.  They are both committed to upholding multilateralism and the rules-based international order.  The European Union and Taiwan share common objectives, such as tackling the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic as well as promoting stability, security and sustainable growth.<\/p><p>While the European Union pursues its one-China policy, the European Union and Taiwan have developed solid relations and close co-operation in a wide range of areas.  Regular consultations between the European Union and Taiwan deal with issues of mutual interest, such as human rights, trade and economic issues, connectivity, innovation, digital issues, green energy, the circular economy, labour issues and disaster management.<\/p><p>The European Economic and Trade Office, which Senator McDowell mentioned, was established in 2003 as the EU office in Taiwan and is now comprised of three sections: the political, press and information section; the trade section; and the administration section.  Another important point, which I ask the Minister of State to note and bring back to his colleagues in government, is that 17 member states of the European Union also have offices in Taipei.<\/p><p>In 1989, Ireland opened an institute for trade and investment.  However, this office closed in 2012 as an austerity measure, we were told.  Ten years on, that office has failed to reopen despite representations from all sides of this House and the Lower House.  Why has that not happened?  That begs another question.  What is the real reason it was closed?<\/p><p><b><\/b>Taiwan was the European Union's 15th most important trading partner.  The official stance of this State is that we recognise the one-China policy and we want to see one-China two-systems work out.  That worked out very well for the people of Hong Kong.  Are we going to sit back and let this democratic island of 24 million people be treated in a similar manner?<\/p><p>I pay tribute to the Taiwanese representative office in Dublin led by Pierre Yang and his colleagues for the Trojan work they do in trying to establish better economic and cultural links to this country.  The onus is on us to facilitate them in doing that.  I again thank the Independent Group for tabling this motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120100002#HH01900","speaker":"1687"},{"type":"speech","time":1638354600,"counter":192,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.

He is representing our country magnificently.<\/p> <p>I thank Senator McDowell and his colleagues for tabling this motion.  It is a matter that has troubled me considerably, particularly in recent times.  We have seen how China is treating Taiwan by encroaching on its airspace in a very dictatorial and threatening manner.  Senator Wilson gave a very powerful contribution.  He articulated what we all believe to be the case.  Taiwan is a democratic country.  Its people elect their own president and their government.  It has a population of 24 million.  It is not like the monster that is trying to invade it and is threatening it, whose human rights record is atrocious.  I have no problem saying that and being quoted articulating that view.  It is very disturbing to listen to media reports of Chinese aircraft circling and invading the airspace of Taiwan.<\/p> <p>Taiwan has flourished; it is a great country.

The people of Taiwan and the people of Ireland share many interests.  They have a common purpose.  Yet our Government is the only one in Europe not to have an official representative in Taiwan.  I agree with Senator Wilson.  Why was it shut down in the first place?  Why has it not been opened?  We should have full diplomatic relations with Taiwan.  I pay tribute to the Taiwanese office in this country, led by Pierre Yang and Chris Tsai.  In spite of the fact we do not treat them with the respect they deserve, they treat us with huge respect.  Irish people have gone to Taiwan as missionaries, priests and people from religious orders.  The work they did in Taiwan to help Taiwan for many decades is something the Taiwanese people appreciate.<\/p><p>We are speaking about Taiwan, which has a population of 24 million, and how it does its business and how it recognises and respects human rights, the role of women, people with disabilities and people of diverse and different backgrounds.  However, the record of the country trying to invade it, China, on human rights is terrible.  It does not treat women with respect.  It does not treat people with disabilities with respect.  It has no regard whatsoever for people from different backgrounds.  It has grown into what can be described as a monstrous economy that really does threaten the world.<\/p><p>As a small country we have always punched above our weight internationally.  We are on the UN Security Council.  Traditionally, we have always punched above our weight.  We need to stand on the side of the Taiwanese people.  We need to use our influence internationally to support Taiwan and ensure its independence, its people and its way of life are respected and that it is not bullied by the power that is beside it.  I have to say I have huge regard for the record on Taiwan of President Joe Biden and previous US Administrations.  Whatever the purpose or reason for it, at least it is there as a counterbalance to what is going on.<\/p><p>I sincerely hope we will change our attitude on our foreign policy and, in the first instance, re-establish diplomatic relations with Taiwan and open our economic office in Taiwan, which should never have been closed in the first place.  The Minister of State is extremely influential in government.  He carries a huge amount of influence within the Department of Foreign Affairs.  I would love it if he came out on the side of Taiwan and became an advocate for the people of Taiwan and the wonderful culture and great democracy it is.  Taiwan and Ireland have significant connectivity and friendship.  This can be built on to the mutual benefit of both countries.  I look forward to the response of the Minister of State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120100002#HH02000","speaker":"1644","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638354600,"counter":194,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Brophy.

We must look at the totality of the relationships around the world, in this case with China and Taiwan.  There needs to be a real debate about this with regard to upholding freedoms and human rights.  All of us in the House predominantly agree with the tenet of what we are trying to achieve with regard to engagement and diplomatic relations.

For far too long, there has been a hands-off policy and a policy of keeping Europe and Taiwan at arm's length by European governments.  Thankfully, that is changing.  Senator Conway spoke about President Biden and relations with Taiwan.  There comes a time in the affairs of men and women where we must stand up.  We have made reference to Beijing and the Winter Olympics.  The corporate world is turning a blind eye to abuses of human rights.  Minorities are being suppressed.  This is a glorious opportunity.  Today on the Order of Business, I spoke about the need for sporting bodies in athletics, football, rugby or whatever sport, to have a conversation not only about the Olympics in Beijing 2022 but about how long we can stand idly by when human rights are being abused and people are being killed and tortured.<\/p> <p>Let us look at the issue of Peng Shuai, the tennis player.  Where is she today?  She mysteriously appeared last week in a video and has gone again today.  How long will we as parliamentarians say that the One China policy and economic ties are far more important than human rights and the killing, torture and oppression of people?  This is not about us flying the flag for Taiwan.  It is about us flying a flag around the world for human rights and for upholding the rights of people who are minorities.  There are some who come in and lecture us.  There are men and women throughout the world today who are afraid to be gay and who are oppressed by their own states.  We cannot stand idly by and say it is different because they are gay, God help us.  The world will start to change and we can, through this motion and through the Government, lead the way.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State, Deputy Brophy, has travelled the world.  He is challenging how we deal with HIV and AIDS in Africa and other parts of the world.  I note today is World AIDS Day.  I thank him for the work he has been doing quietly with NGOs and organisations throughout the world challenging regimes and looking for regime change.  There is more that unites us than divides us in the context of this debate.  I want us to leave here supportive of the need to uphold human rights and not just to say it is a flag of convenience.  We must bring real change.

As this is the first time I have addressed him since his elevation, I congratulate him on that.<\/p> <p>At the outset, I thank Senator McDowell for giving leadership to our group in this area.  Sitting here, listening to the debate this afternoon, the level of passion from all sides of the House and the excellent speeches that were made by all of my colleagues must surely drive home the message that we in Ireland need to wake up.<\/p> <p>In January, the European Parliament passed a resolution urging member states to revisit their engagement policies with Taiwan, and I fully support this.  Having visited Taiwan as a member of the Ireland-Taiwan Parliamentary Friendship Society, I know only too well the value of democracy and trade in this regard.  Indeed, when we visited Taiwan, we visited at the time of an election.  It was something else to see tens of thousands of supporters of different parties on the streets, speeches being made on street corners and massive rallies.  We saw it all.  We visited election centres and we watched people freely come in to cast their franchise and freely leave.  Nobody at any stage stopped anybody or spoke to them.  The officials who were in attendance simply did as they do in every constituency in Ireland; they handed out ballot papers and people cast their ballot and put it in the ballot box.  That is democracy, and we saw it in operation.<\/p> <p>I honestly do not believe that active engagement between Members of the Oireachtas and Taiwan can damage the relations between Ireland and China or are in conflict with the long-standing One China policy.  However, I am aware of the fact the Chinese get extremely upset when they hear people speaking about Taiwan, Tibet and various other things we do not like about China.  That is typical of the bully who was in the schoolyard when we were kids.  He determined who you could be friends with and who you could not be friends with.  The true test of friendship is to be able to tell a friend what they are doing is wrong and not to have that friend turn on you and say, &ldquo;Well, if that is the way you feel, I am not going to talk to you anymore.&rdquo;<\/p> <p>Senator Lynn Ruane spoke about how we seem forced into prefacing everything we say with trade.  Sometimes, just sometimes, there is more to life than trade.<\/p> <p>I and my Independent colleagues have often spoken in the House about the plight of Richard O'Halloran, who is still in China two and a half years on.  I have spoken to his wife many times.  If diplomatic relations are to have any value, Richard O'Halloran should be at home.  He should not be in China.  His children are growing up and they will not know their father.  I spoke to somebody the other day who was involved in the resettlement of prisoners from Vietnam.  One of the things he was advocating was that I would get somebody to make a DVD of what has happened while Richard has been away because, when he comes home, he has to, if we like, reacquaint himself with what has happened in Ireland.  This man is locked up out there for no reason and with no judicial process to keep him there.  When the Minister of State goes back today to the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, please tell him I do not buy it anymore that we are working hard to get Richard home.  If we were working hard to get Richard home, and if we had any standing whatsoever in the world, Richard would be home.<\/p> <p>Way before I came into this House, I visited China as a lonely, or lowly, teacher.  I went out there to the family of a student and I was brought around to visit schools.  I contrast what happened there with what happened when we watched the elections in Taiwan.  At every school we went to, we were welcomed.  It was very formal and the formality became more strict when the political officer came in.  There was no feeling of people with free speech.  In almost every classroom I visited, I was asked what I thought of China's record on human rights.  Why was I asked that question?  If anyone visited a school in Ireland, England, France or Germany, does somebody turn around and ask, &ldquo;What do you think of our record on human rights?&rdquo;  This was all predisposed.  The reason was that China is desperate to show itself as a country that respects human rights while, at the same time, showing absolutely no respect for human rights.<\/p> <p>In the time I have left, I want to talk about the corporate world.  Senator Buttimer spoke about corporate support for the Beijing Olympics.  It should be nothing unusual to any of us here to recognise the fact that the big corporate world could not give a continental damn about human rights or anything else.  Their bottom line is profit, and profit only.  They do not care about human rights.  If they did, we would not see the exploitation of children making clothing in some parts of the world or children mining in other parts of the world.  These things would not happen if big corporate world people had any respect for human rights.  Maybe they are in the right place in Beijing, standing alongside a totalitarian regime that cares sweet damn all for the people it rules over.<\/p> <p>I know the Minister of State represents this country abroad and he does a good job.  When he goes back to his ministerial colleagues, please tell them we have to wake up.  We may be small but we do have a voice.  Let us open an office in Taipei.  They were damn good to us when we needed PPE quickly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120100002#KK00200","speaker":"1645"},{"type":"speech","time":1638354600,"counter":203,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on this Private Members&rsquo; motion.  It is almost 12 months since this House unanimously agreed a motion in regard to the unlawful detention of Richard O'Halloran, an Irish citizen in detention in China.  As Senator Craughwell said, Richard O'Halloran should be at home and if diplomatic relations were working properly, he would be at home.  There is no reason that the Chinese authorities could not let Richard O'Halloran go and it would still be in consultation on the issue with the Irish Government if things were working properly.<\/p> <p>As I said, I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion.  A lot has been said about human rights in China and we all know the human rights issues that exist there.  As a people, the Irish people like the Chinese.  They are like the Irish people as they are industrious, hard-working people and great to work on their own initiative.  It is sad to see the human rights issues the Chinese people tell us about.  There is a significant Chinese population in this country.  There were nearly 100,000 Chinese people here during the boom, although it could be somewhat fewer at perhaps 50,000 or 60,000 now.  Many have very good, solid businesses, with many in the catering area.  They run a great show and they are very hard-working, like the Taiwanese people.<\/p> <p>I have visited both China and Taiwan.  The Taiwanese people are equally as industrious.  They have a great country of 24 million people.  I was very disappointed with the World Health Organization at the start of the pandemic.  The Taiwanese were the world leaders in regard to combating Covid-19 yet the World Health Organisation did not see fit to invite them to some of the world health conferences that took place and did not feel the Taiwanese should have an input, as they should have had an input.  They were the world leaders and probably are still world leaders today.  That goes to show what goes on.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State was quite right in his speech when he said that we are a Parliament and, therefore, we are different from the Executive and different from the Government.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paddy Burke:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=1866\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1866&amp;amp;pid=PaddyBurke&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is only right that we pass this motion.  I believe it will be passed unanimously.  There should be no interference with, or pressure brought to bear on, this Parliament in respect of what we say or who we wish to represent in respect of the Taiwan-China situation.  That has happened.  A number of us in this House were invited to Taiwan and we were put under pressure not to go.  We were told that trade deals were going down between Ireland and China and that it was not in the best interests of this country for a delegation from here to go to Taiwan.  Senator Wilson, former Senators Michelle Mulherin and Paudie Coffey, Deputy Carey and I were all to be part of that delegation but some of those people did not travel as a result of pressure from our Government and the Chinese office.  I would not like to see such a situation arise again.  Three of us did go but if we had not, what would the situation have been?  It would have been a massive victory for the Chinese against the Taiwanese.  That is not on.  The Government of the day should not have got involved in that.  As Senator McDowell has quite rightly pointed out, we are a Parliament and are separate from the Executive, that is, the Government.  <\/p><p>The Government closed down the office in Taiwan.  We should open it up again.  That should be a priority for the Government.  A lot of trade could take place.  As the Minister of State said in his speech, there is &euro;1 billion in trade annually between Taiwan and Ireland.  Taiwan is big in the whiskey industry and we are big producers of whiskey.  We have several world-leading brands in this country.  The Taiwanese are big drinkers of whiskey and they produce a lot of whiskey.  There are also many other areas in which we could have a significant amount of trade.  From speaking to people in the Taiwanese office, I have no doubt but that we could seriously increase trade with Taiwan.  The Minister of State does a magnificent job in travelling around, maintaining our relationships with various countries around the world and opening up trade opportunities.  I beg him to ask the Government to reopen that office.  That would be a very good step.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120100002#KK00300","speaker":"1636","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638354600,"counter":205,"content":"<p>As I did not expect to get in, I am delighted to be able to contribute.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Brophy, to the House.  He is doing a great job in the Department of Foreign Affairs.  While I was in a committee meeting from 1.30 p.m. until just recently, I was paying attention to this debate and I heard quite a few of the contributions.  I welcome the motion and thank Senators McDowell, Craughwell and Boyhan and their group for putting it down.  It is a useful motion for us to debate.  When I became a Senator for the first time in 2016, the Taipei Representative Office, as it is known in Ireland, reached out to me, as I am sure it does to all new Members.  I met officials of the office and had various engagements with them and discovered that I did not know an awful lot about Taiwan.  I believe many people here will not have known an awful lot about Taiwan before becoming Members of Parliament.  I always understood it to be an independent country.  Those of us of a certain vintage all probably grew up with toys that were made in Taiwan back in the day.  Taiwan has an enormous economy and a population of some 23 million people.  It is far bigger than most countries in the European Union.  It has a great cultural base and is also amazingly good at manufacturing and technology.<\/p><p>As Senator McDowell has outlined, it is a country - or a jurisdiction if we want to use that term for political reasons - that operates free and fair elections.  As Senator Wilson has outlined, it has been having free and fair elections since 1996.  Along with others, I was lucky enough to observe those elections.  Taiwanese people value their votes so much that people fly back from all over the world specially to vote in those free and fair elections.  I knew that Ireland adheres to the One China policy, as do all EU countries, but I note that in the Minister of State's speech, he said that:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThis means that we do not recognise Taiwan as a state nor maintain diplomatic relations.  This policy is a prerequisite for our diplomatic relations with China, a country of 1.4 billion people. <\/blockquote> <p>Certainly, 23 million people seems like a tiny population in the context of that 1.4 billion people but an awful lot of things seem tiny in that context.  I do not see this Parliament or this motion as being anti-China or as saying that China is terrible, in calling out mainland China, or the People's Republic of China.  Rather, it alerts the Chinese Government and the Chinese authorities that things are happening in their jurisdiction which we, as a parliament, are not comfortable or happy with and that we do not want to see these things happen.  We would not want to see them happen in any jurisdiction and we do not want to see them happen in this jurisdiction.  While it is not necessarily the case that President Xi Jinping is listening to this debate, I hope that, in light of our own history of conflict with our near neighbours, this Parliament would seek the cooling of tensions and the moderation of China's behaviour, including its incursions into the Taiwanese air zone, the pressure it constantly brings to bear and the way it has effectively frozen out countries such as Lithuania for allowing offices to be called Taiwanese representative offices, rather than Taipei representative offices.  Many of us admire China as a country for what it is has achieved but, as others have rightly asked, at what cost did it achieve these things?  It is fair for this Parliament to call out bad behaviour wherever it happens.  We are actually very quick to do so in respect of certain jurisdictions but we are much more reluctant to do it in respect of others.  In his speech the Minister of State also said:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe policy does not however preclude us from developing economic and cultural relations with Taiwan at official level.  We value co-operation with Taiwan.  We have a working holiday authorisation programme with Taiwan, and in 2020 estimates of bilateral trade were around &euro;1 billion annually.  <\/blockquote> <p>It is my understanding that the balance of this trade is very much in our favour.  I want to put on record that it is not being anti-China or the People's Republic of China to call out bad behaviour.  We hope that its Government will reflect on things that are happening.  If the motion goes through, as I hope it will, we will also be supporting the parliament of Taiwan and saying that Taiwan is entitled to self-governance and self-determination.  Any attempted interference from outside the island of Taiwan would be most unwelcome and very unhelpful.  The mainland Chinese authorities need to reflect on that.<\/p><p>In my last minute or 30 seconds, I will pay tribute to the Taipei Representative Office, as it is known in Ireland, and its representatives.  The office is currently headed up by Dr. Pierre Yang and was headed up by Mr. Simon S.K. Tu before him.  The office is promoting Irish-Taiwanese relationships all of the time in a very peaceful and friendly way.  It lets us know about Taiwan's culture, helps Irish people to go to Taiwan and makes introductions.  There are now Irish people running Chinese language schools in Taiwan and opening Irish pubs there.  The office has been very helpful with that.  I thank Senator McDowell for tabling this motion, which I wish well.  I believe it will be passed.  I am not saying that everything about China is bad but it is sometimes your friends who need to tell you when you are doing things wrong.  In this motion, we have called China out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120100002#LL00200","speaker":"1696"},{"type":"speech","time":1638354600,"counter":206,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for being here and I thank all the Members of the House from right across the political spectrum for their participation in this debate.

His senior colleague is not as succinct sometimes.  The Minister of State departed from the script in one important respect.  He stated that it is no part of the Government's policy or intention to discourage Members of the Oireachtas from having engagement with Taiwanese officials or Taiwanese people.  That is very important.  It is a very big step forward because we had not heard that before.  It is nice to have it confirmed.  I remind the House that Members of this House were told by the Chairman of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission that:<\/p><blockquote>\tActive engagement between members of the Oireachtas and Taiwan can damage the relations between Ireland and China and is in conflict to the long-standing One China policy.  As Ceann Comhairle, I have no intention of telling Oireachtas members who they, as elected public representatives, can meet or what functions they can attend.  That would never be my wish.  However, I am aware that there continues to be engagement between some Oireachtas members and the Taiwanese authorities.  This can cause serious offence and grave concern to our Chinese friends and has the potential to cause serious damage to Ireland&rsquo;s developing relationship with China as well as being a danger to Ireland&rsquo;s national interest.  <\/blockquote><p>That is what he wrote.  I am glad that this occasion now puts the nail firmly through that letter.  It is out of order.  This House has freedoms.  The Government has at last come to our aid and stated that we are free to speak our minds on this issue.<br\/><br\/>People speak about the Chinese economic miracle, and it has been a miracle.  However, I remind the House that, in the context of Taiwan, when the nationalists fled, having been defeated in the Chinese civil war, and landed on that island, there was nothing there.  It was almost a barren rock of a place.  The Taiwanese miracle is tremendous too.  I wish to put that on the record lest people think that somehow it was some little enclave of wealth.  The Taiwanese people built something out of nothing, practically speaking.<br\/><br\/>Having complimented the Minister of State, I wish to also compliment the people who helped him with his speech, because they dealt with the fact that there is a European Union representative office in Taipei.  He stated that IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland have regional offices.  Those bodies do not have offices in Taipei.  I think it is serviced from Singapore, Tokyo or somewhere else nowhere near Taipei.  It was Rudyard Kipling who wrote about the well-weighed answer that tells the blacker lie.  I am not accusing the Minister of State of lying, but I am saying that I spoke to people on the ground there and Irish diplomats have nothing whatsoever to do with the EU representative office in Taipei.  Just saying that it is there is fine and saying that it is open to Irish industrialists is fine but I am telling the House that Ireland is the weakest and most cowardly behind the door in making use of that European facility.  I reiterate the remarks of Senator Wilson in respect of the situation of the EU.  We share the values of the people of Taiwan.  We share their aims.  We are on their side.  Irish MEPs are not afraid to say so when speaking in the European Parliament and we should not be afraid to say so when we speak in this Parliament.<br\/><br\/>Reference was made to Tibet.  As Senators will appreciate, it is an autonomous region of the People's Republic of China.  Xinjiang province was an autonomous region.  This just underlines the absolute disparity between truthfulness and the labels which a Marxist-Leninist regime can use in its language.  I reiterate that President Xi and nobody else spoke about the importance of population proportion throughout the whole of China and stated that the disproportion in population was a danger to Chinese interests.  That means, in effect, that the Chinese authorities do not like Uighur Muslims having large families and will prevent them from doing so, sterilise their women, separate the men from the women and bring in the Han population and settle them in Xinjiang province.  That is genocide of a sort and it is nothing else.<br\/><br\/>The debate today has been valuable.  It is not simply a group of Senators speaking about something where there could be no opposition.  It is important that the Government has told us here that it supports our right to engage with the people of Taiwan.  It is important that Senator Wilson and the other Members have contributed.  Senator Wilson reminded us that the European Parliament has stated where the EU stands on Taiwan.  It is about time that message was really sunk into the marrow of Iveagh House.  It needs to be European, adopt what Europe says about Taiwan, live by European values in the context of Taiwan, and stop being timid in respect of Taiwan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120100002#LL00300","speaker":"1669","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638354600,"counter":208,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120100002#MM00200","nonspeaker":"Senators"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1638354600,"counter":209,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1638354600,"counter":210,"content":"<p>Is amendment No. 2 being moved?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120100002#MM00400","speaker":"1670"},{"type":"speech","time":1638354600,"counter":211,"content":"<p>I agreed not to move it following discussions with the Department of Foreign Affairs and on the basis that there would be clarity in respect of the case of Richard O'Halloran.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120100002#MM00500","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"speech","time":1638354600,"counter":212,"content":"<p>Is the Senator happy to withdraw the amendment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120100002#MM00600","speaker":"1670"},{"type":"speech","time":1638354600,"counter":213,"content":"<p>I am happy for the moment but I am concerned that I have not received further answers on the case of Richard O'Halloran.

I very much welcome the opportunity to update the House on the epidemiological situation and the national response.  The current level of Covid-19, as colleagues will be aware, is having a profoundly negative effect on public health as well as placing an enormous burden on all aspects of our health service.  The number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 in hospital including in ICU is still very high and more generally the overall level of infection continues to have a disproportionate and very disruptive impact across the system.  We are seeing case numbers previously seen only in January this year.<\/p><p>We know the situation in Ireland is not unique.  Countries right across Europe are seeing a surge of cases, and we have heard from the WHO's recent warning that Europe is once again at the epicentre of this pandemic.  Many EU countries are introducing new coronavirus restrictions.  This includes reintroducing measures that we have retained here such as masks and Covid certificates.  Some countries are having to go further, including for example the lockdown reimposed in Austria and the partial lockdown in the Netherlands.  The situation across the EU remains fluid and uncertain as we all know.<\/p><p>As we have seen throughout the course of the pandemic, Covid-19 continues to adapt and create very significant challenges.  The pandemic is not over yet.  The most recent challenge is of course the new Omicron variant, B.1.1.529.  I would like to advise the House that a number of actions have been swiftly implemented to limit the potential spread of this new variant.  People arriving into the State from overseas who have been vaccinated or recovered from Covid-19 will be required also to have a certified negative or &quot;not detected&quot; test result.  This can be from an antigen test taken no more than 48 hours before arrival or a PCR test taken no more than 72 hours before arrival.  The antigen test has to be professionally administered and certified.  It is not just a question of a person buying a test, doing it themselves and showing a &quot;not detected&quot; result.  This will be in effect from midnight on 3 December 2021.  Air and sea carriers will be required to carry out pre-boarding checks for compliance, supplemented by border management unit and Garda National Immigration Bureau spot-checks on arrivals at ports and airports.  This measure will apply for a minimum period of two weeks and will be kept under review with a view to removal as soon as possible, taking account of the overall epidemiological situation and what we find out in the coming weeks about the new variant.<\/p><p>These actions agreed by the Government are intended to limit the spread of the new variant while further evidence emerges relating to its transmissibility, its impact on disease severity, and its potential evasiveness when it come to vaccines and treatments.  My Department, the HSE, the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, and the National Virus Reference Laboratory, NVRL, have been meeting regularly to review the evolving situation.  The epidemiological situation both here and internationally, and all emerging evidence regarding the Omicron variant, will continue to be kept under close review in respect of potential implications for the pandemic. <\/p><p>More generally, the Government has been quick to act on public health advice as we continue to manage this current wave of infection.  Just yesterday, we agreed new advice for families in response to the very significant increases in the incidence in younger children in recent weeks.  This includes asking parents to try to reduce indoor socialisation for their children aged 12 and younger over the next two weeks and a recommendation that face coverings be worn by children aged nine years and over on public transport, in retail and in other public settings where face coverings are currently mandated for older children and adults.  Face coverings are also recommended in primary school from third class and above.  <\/p><p>This follows the introduction of a package of additional measures on 16 November to reduce the current level of socialisation across the country and interrupt the spread of Covid-19 in the community.  Measures include a move to working from home unless it is necessary to attend the workplace in person.  Proof of immunity will be required for entry into cinemas and theatres.  Bars, restaurants and nightclubs are closing from midnight.  Household close contacts who are fully vaccinated and showing no symptoms should now restrict their movements until they have three negative antigen test results within five days.  As colleagues will be aware, when they are identified as household close contacts the HSE is sending out the antigen tests to those people in their homes.<\/p><p>As the booster campaign progresses, we will continue to take a &quot;vaccine plus&quot; approach.  This means we will obviously keep vaccines at the centre of our response but there is more that we need to be emphasising as well, that is, continued adherence to basic measures to protect ourselves and those around us.  This includes: acting fast, isolating and getting tested if we have symptoms; wearing a face covering where appropriate; making sure that indoor spaces are well ventilated; maintaining social distancing whenever appropriate; and covering coughs and sneezes and keeping our hands clean.  We know these measures work.  Their impact was highlighted in a significant systematic review and meta-analysis published in the <i>British Medical Journal<\/i>in October, just last month.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Stephen Donnelly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2336\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2336&amp;amp;pid=StephenDonnelly&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That review showed that several personal protective and social measures, including handwashing, mask wearing and physical distancing, are associated with reductions in the incidence of Covid-19.  The research analysed the findings from over 30 studies and found, for example, that there was a 53% reduction in the incidence of Covid-19 with mask wearing.  This research highlights the continued importance of these basic protective measures.<\/p><p>Despite the current challenges, the steps we have taken together are working to protect our population from the worst of this virus.  Our vaccination programme is among the most successful in Europe, with more than 90% of the eligible population fully vaccinated.  More than 8.1 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine have now been administered since the programme began in December last year, with more than 800,000 booster vaccines and third doses for immunocompromised administered to date. We all know that every death from Covid is one death too many, and we must do everything we can to keep the mortality rate as low as possible.  According to the latest data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, Ireland has the fifth lowest overall Covid mortality rate out of the 27 EU countries, plus the United Kingdom.  The booster vaccines are adding further protection.  The impact of the recent booster vaccination on those aged 80 and older is evident as the incidence of Covid is no longer rising in this group.<\/p><p>The health system is being supported at this exceptionally challenging time through significantly increased funding, with over &euro;1 billion extra being provided in budget 2022, bringing total investment to a record &euro;22 billion.  Before the pandemic, we had just 255 critical care beds, which, we all agree, was inadequate.  We are addressing this lack of capacity as quickly as the HSE can add critical care beds.  Some &euro;52 million was provided for this year to add additional beds, an increase of 25% to the baseline.  The HSE has advised that 42 of these beds are now open, bringing baseline critical care capacity to 297.   More will be added over the coming weeks and months.  The HSE has been funded to increase capacity to 340 by the end of 2022 or early 2023, representing a 33% increase to the base since the pandemic began.  I have also secured a Government commitment to go significantly further than that and bring us beyond the total recommended in the 2018 capacity review.  We have also added 11,309 staff to our health workforce since the start of the pandemic, including almost 3,000 nurses and midwives and around 2,000 health and social care professionals.  We have permanently funded over 1,100 acute hospital beds, of which approximately 800 have opened to date.<\/p><p>I assure colleagues that the Government and I will continue to do all we can to respond to this stage of the pandemic and we will continue to boost capacity in our health service at the same time.  I very much look forward to listening to Senators' contributions to the debate.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120100002#QQ00300","speaker":"1623","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638354600,"counter":224,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for coming to the House.

The Minister will find that there is solidarity with him and his family on all sides of this House.  We need to take action.  We are all in favour of peaceful protest but to do what was done outside the Minister's home and to his family is completely unacceptable.<\/p> <p>As I am sure the Minister is aware, the difficulty with this pandemic is that there is no handbook.  If we were able to predict the trajectory, somebody would be able to make a fortune out of the guidebook he or she could draw up.  Nobody has been able to do that, however.  That has been one of the challenges.  On the points set out by the Minister, any reasonable person looking at how Ireland has managed the pandemic will see that we have not got everything right, but we have got a lot of things right.  In particular, the vaccination programme has been a success.<\/p> <p>What the Minister outlined regarding some of the long-term measures, including the increase in ICU bed capacity, is important.  The message needs to get out that we are increasing bed capacity.  It is not enough as yet but, in as far as possible, every additional bed that can be provided is being provided.  The message also needs to be put out that the Minister is reforming the health service at the same time.  The fact that more than 11,000 additional staff are now employed in health has not been getting out there.  It is important that we start to stress that the Government is responding not just in terms of the immediate response on vaccines and so on, but it is also looking at the long-term issues.  That is a communications challenge.<\/p> <p>We also need to communicate more effectively about how the health service is going to deal with many of the other health issues.  There are still challenges around elective surgeries and delays to waiting lists.  People will obviously be concerned that if we continue to see variants, increases in cases and possible increases in hospitalisations, the other areas of our health service will be impacted.  It is important that we communicate effectively on those issues.<\/p> <p>I ask the Minister to address a number of specific points.  I have always been struck by the approach taken by Dr. Mike Ryan of the World Health Organization who speaks very bluntly.  He said we will not get everything right but speed is of the essence and that once we take a decision, we should go with it.  We know that vaccines work.  We know, from the early evidence, that the booster campaign is working.  Will the Minister give an indicative timeline as to when the booster campaign will start to roll out to the wider population?  When will those of us in our 40s, or younger, be able to access booster vaccines?  There is a belief in society that vaccines are the best way of protecting us.  I know there will be a few weeks here and there, but I ask the Minister to give us an assurance on the timeline for the next few age cohorts and outline when and where the booster vaccines will be available to these groups.  That would be helpful.<\/p> <p>As the Minister is aware, I hold a strong view, which I have communicated previously, that theatres and arts venues should be kept open, not just for cultural reasons but for people's mental well-being.  I have had the privilege of being in a number of theatres around the country recently.  They are all following the guidelines.  They are checking Covid certificates and identification.  They are very safe, secure venues.  It is important that we give a reassurance to that sector.  There is a whole schedule that has been planned well into next year.  In as far as possible, theatres, museums and galleries should be allowed to remain open.  These are the activities that keep us all sane during this period.<\/p> <p>This is not an issue for the Minister directly, but he will be aware that because of some of the newer restrictions that have impacted on the hospitality sector, there will be issues with supports for business.  The Government has always committed to continuing those supports.  It is most important that we continue to commit to the provision of the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, and other supports for those who are affected.<\/p> <p>We need to look at those who want to take the vaccine but who, for medical reasons, are unable to take it.  This is a challenge.  They want to take the vaccine but cannot do so and cannot necessarily get a vaccine certificate.  We must accommodate them.  These people are not anti-vaxxers.  They believe in vaccines but are unable take the vaccine for medical reasons.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120100002#RR00400","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"speech","time":1638354600,"counter":227,"content":"<p>It is nice to see the Minister.

We know that the World Trade Organization TRIPS council is meeting this week.  To date, the Irish Government has opposed waiving intellectual property rights for Covid vaccines that would enable countries in the developing world to develop their own generic vaccines to vaccinate their population.  Large parts of the world have a vaccination rate of just 2%.<\/p> <p>When I raised this issue with the Minister previously he has told me he was in favour of waiving the intellectual property rights.  The problem is that the Government is not in favour of that approach.  We know that to date, and right up until today, the Government and large sections of the EU have opposed the waiving of intellectual property rights.  I want to hear the Minister state clearly that the Government will endorse and publicly call for the waiving of those intellectual property rights.  I ask him to provide clarity on that point.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paul Gavan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2469\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->If the Minister is not going to support it then he should tell us straight that he is not going to support it.

The new variant brings it home to us like never before, nobody is safe until everybody is safe.

I agree with some of the points made by Senator Malcolm Byrne.  Let us be clear.  Everyone should be scheduled for a booster jab at six months post the second job.  I do not know why we are delaying.  We know the need is there and we know it is safe.  We know how to do it.  We should just do it.  I will use my time to make a clear call again to anyone who has not yet been vaccinated to get out and get the vaccines.  They are the best route to safety for all of us.  There should be no equivocation on that point.<\/p> <p>We need clarity on the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine, particularly for those aged over 50 who should have been boosted three months later.  We also need clarity for those who are immunocompromised who, from what I can see at the moment, are being pushed and passed between the HSE and the GPs.  We need clarity for childcare workers and those who work with unvaccinated and vulnerable populations.<\/p> <p>On antigen testing, I have heard today of one family who are on day eight of waiting for the antigen test to be sent out by the HSE.

I have heard that people are being charged &euro;159 for a PCR test to make sure they are not going to work or sending their child to school while sick.<\/p> <p>On the Covid-19 certificates, so far the Minister has not issued guidance on clinical exemptions.  They are few but they do exist and are being ignored.  This is being introduced in the North and I would like a timeline as to when the Minister is going to deal with that. It is an important point.<\/p> <p>I must also talk about the schools issue.  I want to be very clear that Sinn F&eacute;in's point of view is that no child should be denied an education because of the Government's failures in respect of Covid-19.  The Minister will be aware that parents received alerts through their school apps late last night to say that it is now mandatory for children from third class and upwards to wear a mask in school all day, effective immediately.  Proper air filtration and contact tracing is what is needed in our schools, not directives that assume non-co-operation from parents.  The absolute inability of the Minister for Education to address the severe lack of substitute teachers, large class sizes, and the over-reliance on prefabricated buildings for classrooms is what the Minister for Education should be putting her energies into, not punishing children.  I continue to be concerned and alarmed at the language used about children throughout the pandemic.  From the start, they were described as vectors, which makes it so unfair that children have been targeted again.  The Children's Rights Alliance and other organisations have called for clear advice to be issued to schools before any directive from the Government to ensure that schools can take account of each child's needs in accessing his or her right to an education.  What transpired last night was actually the exact opposite.  Parents who know that their child will find it difficult or impossible to wear a mask in school will now need a medical certificate from their GP to allow for an exemption from wearing a mask.  This will place further strain on already overstretched GP practices, many of which have been scathing of this requirement.<\/p> <p>Unfortunately, I am running out of time but let me say briefly that we need much better communication.  There have been too many mixed messages in respect of antigen testing and schools.  I also seek information from the Minister on anti-viral medications.  These look like a real positive that should be available from early 2022.  We need to know when they will be available. The Government cannot be found wanting when such medication does become available.  There have been very promising clinical trials and this could play a key role in combating Covid-19 early next year. I am out of time now but I look forward to the Minister's response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120100002#SS00300","speaker":"1660"},{"type":"speech","time":1638354600,"counter":231,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister very much for coming to the House.  I join with Senators Malcolm Byrne and Gavan in condemning the protests outside every Government Minister's house, and in particular the Minister's own house.  It is simply not acceptable in our democracy that the families of public representatives would be targeted in that way.  I express that solidarity.<\/p> <p>As the Minister will know better than the rest of us, a number of very serious changes were announced this week.  There was the sudden abandonment of the subsidisation of antigen tests.  There was the announcement late last night, just over 24 hours ago, of the required mask wearing in schools.  We are now going to have the rush to reintroduce legislation for mandatory health quarantining.  Of course, all of that is taking place with a cut to the EWSS today and a cut to the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, two weeks ago.  What kind of a message is all of this sending out?  We are really in the middle of a war in the context of this global pandemic, and in the course of a war, communications are vital, as the Minister knows well.  The Government has been all over the place in recent days.  If the Minister wants to keep the public with the Government, then the Government really needs to up its game in communication, in ensuring that workers and families are communicated with clearly and that livelihoods are protected.<\/p> <p>None of us want to see the reimposition of restrictions but we accept that because Covid levels have been so high some measures have had to be taken, for example with the night-life sector.  Yet, the repeated message from the Government is that the PUP cannot be reopened and that it is okay to cut the PUP because there are labour shortages at present.  What kind of a message does this send to a DJ or a bouncer on the door of a nightclub?  Is it that they should go away and get a job in a cafe?  We really must bring the public with us around whatever measures need to be taken to contain this pandemic.<\/p> <p>The messaging from the Government has been alarming to me over recent weeks, given the lack of dignity and the lack of respect shown to certain workers in this country.  I am struck that even IBEC called for a continuation of the EWSS into the spring of next year, and yet the Government has gone ahead and cut it.  The Minister will say that he is responsible for the Department of Health and that is extremely onerous in itself, but the Minister also knows that this is a battle in keeping the public healthy and keeping people onside for the measures that need to be undertaken.  Protecting livelihoods has to be a vital part of that message.<\/p> <p>I am also struck by the five-day rule.  Retail workers have approached us, as has Mandate, which is the representative union of most retail workers.  Mandate has said that some workers have expressed to the union a real concern that they will not be able to stay at home from work for those five days, even though they are vaccinated and may be asymptomatic, if they are a close contact.  They need to earn that money and particularly in the run-up to Christmas.  At the end of the day, the Covid illness benefit is only 56% of the average earnings for a retail worker.  It remains the case that as of today, we have no paid sick leave in this country.  I am aware that the pre-legislative scrutiny of that legislation is currently being undertaken, which is great, but the Government is simply being too slow.  We now have situation where we badly need that paid sick leave.  We cannot afford for workers to feel that they have to go into work because otherwise, they would be out of pocket.<\/p> <p>For many months now, many Members in this House and across the parties have been calling for antigen testing to be rolled out on a substantial scale in order to support many sectors in this economy and in society.  There has been a degree of resistance.  There was a debate between NPHET and the Government with regard to that.  There was an announcement that we were to have subsidisation of antigens testing and that the Government was prepared to squander millions of euro effectively subsidising retailers for those antigen tests.  Then there was the withdrawal of that proposal on Monday.  Again, what message are we sending out with regard to antigen testing?  The Government needs to negotiate with a number of manufacturers, be far more cost-effective, and ensure that antigen tests are made freely and widely available to people in order that such testing can become part and parcel of household life from here on out.  It is vital to the support of sectors and for jobs and for schools to continue to remain open that antigen tests are deployed on a wide basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120100002#SS00400","speaker":"1683"},{"type":"speech","time":1638354600,"counter":232,"content":"<p>The Minister is very welcome to the House.

The fact that 95% of the public have opted to get the vaccine is a great news story and puts us above and beyond most other countries in the world, certainly within Europe.  That has saved thousands of lives, even though that will never be acknowledged because it cannot, really.  The fact is that per head of population, fewer people have lost their lives in this country than in most other countries in Europe.  Our hearts go out to the people who have lost their lives and the people who suffer from long Covid.  Many families, 5,000 or 6,000 at this stage, are grieving the loss of their loved ones.  Everything we do here is to ensure we reduce the number of people who contract Covid and, in doing so, by extension, reduce the number of people who require ICU support and, ultimately, the number of people who lose their lives.<\/p><p>It has been flagged for some time now that a vaccine booster would be necessary for most of the population.  The Minister might give me some reasoning as to why this happened but I cannot understand why the task force that was tasked with coming up with the recommendations on the vaccine roll-out was stood down over the summer.  What was the logic and reason for standing down the task force, given the fact that a booster vaccine programme was imminent and that there was going to be advice from the national immunisation advisory committee, NIAC, in that regard?  Booster vaccines are now being rolled out to the entire population.  Why was the task force stood down?<\/p><p>I also cannot understand why people who were working in the vaccination centres were let go over the summer months and earlier in quarter 3 of this year, again, given the fact that we knew we would have to rely on a booster vaccine programme.  What was the logic and the reasoning behind the HSE letting those staff go?  Now the HSE is under pressure to try to re-recruit staff.  Those people could have been kept on.  There was plenty of work for them to do on the flu vaccine, the HPV vaccine and other work.  I am just interested to know what the logic or reasoning behind letting those people go was because it should not have happened.<\/p><p>It saddens me to say that in the past two or three weeks, communication has not been at the level it should have been at.  That is nobody's fault but it was not what it should have been.  Unfortunately, there were a lot of mixed messages last week.  Now we are dealing with a new variant, which will present its own challenges.  We will be here on Friday dealing with the mandatory hotel quarantine legislation, which I think most people realise is necessary.  I think there will be a public inquiry into Covid and its handling at some stage in the future.  I believe things like the standing down of the task force and the letting go of the people working in the vaccine centres should not have happened and I would like to know why they did.  As for the communications strategy, it is difficult to communicate to the public 18 months to two years into a pandemic because people are tired and weary, but we still need to ensure that the communications are distinct, clear and focused and that they work.  I know that the Minister and his officials are doing their best, but there needs to be a step up in dealing with that.<\/p><p>I agree that schools are low-risk settings.  The National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, has constantly said they are.  There is no place where there is no risk, but certainly schools are low-risk.  I support the wearing of masks in primary schools.  Young people have seen their parents wear masks and have seen masks worn in the community, so I do not think it is as big an issue as people are saying it is.<\/p><p>I commend the Minister and offer my solidarity with him in respect of the behaviour outside his home on Sunday.  It was appalling and that behaviour needs to be dealt with, as I am sure An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is doing.  I wish the Minister well.  He is leading the response to Covid on behalf of all of us and, overall, he is doing a very good job.  We all wish him well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120100002#SS00500","speaker":"1644","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638354600,"counter":234,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and join others in condemning the protest outside his family home and, indeed, protests outside the family homes of any politicians of any persuasion.  That is to be condemned.  There is a time and a place for protest and free speech, and we have a proud record in this country of allowing protest to take place on our streets.  We have seen examples of that during the Covid pandemic.  It is right and proper that free speech be allowed but not in the form of protests at the private properties of politicians.<\/p> <p>I do not listen to \"Liveline\" but I see on Twitter that one parent asked, \"Where does it all end?\" on the programme today in the context of her son being forced to wear a mask in primary school.  Another caller called in and said, \"For me, it ended with a sealed coffin for my dad.\"  That puts things in context and was a powerful contribution from somebody who faced a father's death.  I have not heard from principals in my area but I have heard from colleagues that some principals in their areas are saying they will not comply with the regulations and will not ask children to comply.  It is not good enough.  I agree with Senator Conway that many children in primary school will probably be delighted to wear masks.  They see their parents and see everyone else wearing them and they might think, \"That looks like great fun.\"  It is a serious health issue, though, so I ask people to comply.<\/p> <p>High-efficiency particulate air, HEPA, filters in schools have been talked about for some time.  Maybe they are talked about so much that people believe they are the necessary safeguard that can solve all these problems.  Are they?  What are our counterparts in other countries doing regarding their school ventilation systems?  Is it a cost issue or a science issue?  I have said before in one of these contributions that we started off very well with signage in our businesses and places people frequent, but I think that has waned somewhat.  As a member of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, I have been told that even compliance with hand sanitisation within these Houses has dropped somewhat, following inspection.  I will not name places but I know shops in Galway where you see absolutely nothing in terms of messaging on Covid and nothing of prominence about the location of hand sanitiser dispensers.  There are too many empty hand sanitiser dispensers in the country as well.<\/p> <p>I welcome the progress that has been made on the booster campaign.  We can be very proud as a nation of the high uptake of the vaccine here, comparing it internationally.  Hot spots are being looked at in some areas where there may be a high immigrant population that may not have the language skills to know about the vaccine and its availability.  Information is being provided in different languages to ensure that people know about that.  That is important as well.  Also, we are engaging with the COVAX facility in supporting other nations.  This is not just a moral issue; it is also in our self-interest that the world gets vaccinated.  It is important we accept that.  We are trying to stay ahead of Covid via vaccination and while we have a very high rate of vaccination here, Austria and Germany, which are First World or developed world nations or whatever you want to call them, have much lower rates.  It is worrying that they have such low rates compared with ours because, as the virus mutates, without sufficient levels of vaccination it will cause further damage throughout the EU and throughout the world and other variants in the future may reach these shores.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->One could say that it was inevitable the new variant would reach Irish shores, particularly when it had reached the UK.

Can we say that the Galway Races will take place next July and August?  People are worried about such events taking place.

I welcome the Minister to the House and congratulate him.  He has had a very difficult period over the last two years as the Minister for Health.  No Minister for Health in the history of the State has suffered as much he has or encountered so many difficult situations.  It is a great task to get on top of this pandemic that befell the whole world and great credit is due to him, and the Government, on so many different occasions.  With being hit by so many different variants at different stages it is not an easy time to be in his shoes.<\/p> <p>No sector of society has been as hard hit as the hospitality sector.  When one considers what some in the industry have gone through, and are going through, it is very difficult.  The industry comprises great employers.  They employ people who would never be employed.  They employ young people and people who attend college.  They employ people who leave secondary school and some people who attend secondary school.  They give most people their first job.  All of this has changed for them.  People in the sector cannot work from home and these businesses need customers to come into their premises.  Those are two factors facing the industry.<\/p> <p>The schemes and support systems that have been put in place are very welcome and very much appreciated by the sector.  However, in some cases, people fall between the cracks.  I have one case where a pub provided drinks and then provided food.  Schemes were brought in and it falls between the cracks so may not qualify for the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS.  I have written to the Minister for Finance about one such case.  The Government should look sympathetically at cases that are highlighted.<\/p> <p>Let us consider the last couple of days.  NPHET or the Government should have communicated with Ryanair.  Mr. Michael O'Leary must be congratulated for operating the biggest airline in Europe and providing connectivity.  As an island nation we should be most thankful to him for the connectivity that we have now around Europe.  Connectivity has been made possible to a large degree by Ryanair.  Mr. O'Leary has operated Ryanair through very difficult circumstances.  He said very harsh things about the Government, and I suppose it is every man to his own trade in this business.  However, Ryanair should have been contacted because it is not easy for an airline to change all of a sudden and implement the impositions put on it by the Government.<\/p> <p>Last week, in my own area we were notified that there would be a walk-in service provided at Breaffy, Castlebar, County Mayo, which operates for the whole county.  For several hours persons over 60 years could walk in.  The over-60s were unfairly treated on one occasion where they were given AstraZenica but younger people were given other vaccines and before them.  However, last week, the over-60s could walk into the vaccination centre if it had been five months since they received their second dose.  If 152 days had lapsed double vaccinated people could get their vaccination there and then without notification.  Today, I noticed that I got a letter but it does not state that there are any walk-ins for over-60s.  There is a service for people who are underage, minors, schoolgoers and people who have received one vaccine and who can get a second dose.  It seems that no provision has been made for the over-60s for the next couple of days.  Some people under-50, who received a different vaccine from AstraZenica, have qualified to get their second dose.  I would have presumed that there still would be walk-in centres in the western region and Castlebar area for people over 60 years in the next couple of days provided that everything was in order.  Am I correct? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120100002#UU00200","speaker":"1636"},{"type":"speech","time":1638354600,"counter":237,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for attending this important debate.  Yet again we are at a crossroads in the context of Covid-19.  It is a bit like Groundhog Day with a recurring pandemic that continues to baffle eminent immunologists and virologists.  We must certainly keep our guard up.<\/p> <p>I endorse the remarks made by my colleague and friend, Senator Burke, about the hospitality sector.  The Minister is very much aware of the need for us to continue our supports for the hospitality sector.  We know well that the sector has been badly hit by the pandemic.  It is not in the gift of the Department but the Government can make a decision on whether to extend and retain the EWSS employment support at the levels we had for November.  I ask that we give ongoing support, as we have done, to the industry in the first couple of months of 2022 in order to assist the employers in the hospitality sector to sustain livelihoods through the retention of jobs thus ensuring the survival of the hospitality sector.<\/p> <p>I could read emails into the record of the House that I have received from friends of mine who work as employers and employees in the hospitality sector.  Both the employers and employees are fearful and worried about the future of the hospitality sector and where they will be come January and February of next year.  One person said to me that the exit plan announced a few months ago was based on a set of circumstances as predicted at the time but now we are in a different situation where quarter 1 of next year could be catastrophic.  That is just an example.  I will not dwell on the hospital sector too much more only to say that the rate of room occupancy has fallen and it is important that we support the sector.<\/p> <p>I wish to make a point about the vaccination programme.  Last Sunday in Cork, it took people four hours to progress through a walk-in vaccination centre, which is an inordinate amount of time.  I appeal to the Minister to reopen Parc U&iacute; Chaoimh and the Munster Technological University, MTU, where we had successful vaccination centres.  I also appeal to him to consider using community pharmacies, pharmacies and GPs as a means to ratchet up the vaccination and booster programmes.<\/p> <p>It is important to have a balanced debate on schools.  I have spoken to school teachers and young students about the wearing of masks in school and found that the vast majority have no difficulty doing so.

Before coming here to speak, I printed off a copy of the Covid restrictions and the new measures being introduced.  Reading through the list, I saw that the vast majority of our society is open.  Quite limited measures have been put in place.  As Senator Buttimer said, much hysteria has been driven by certain groups, factions and political parties.  They are causing angst in people, which s very regrettable when we are dealing with something as serious as this.<\/p> <p>I have a number of issues, particularly about the education system.  The Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, will come before the House tomorrow to speak about education and I will direct some of my questions to her.  There is an issue with regard to medical certification for youngsters in the context of wearing masks.  Perhaps there was a slip of the tongue by the Minister for Education earlier.  It is something to be addressed.  Children who cannot wear masks because their glasses keep fogging up and who are not able to study properly should not have to get medical certificates.  This should be a matter for common sense on the part of principals in schools.<\/p> <p>Vaccination is the key to everything.  Collectively, we have stood firmly behind it.  We are up to a vaccination rate of 93%.  Unfortunately, 7% of the population made the decision not to get vaccinated.  We should introduce more measures with regard to using the vaccine certificate for certain services in order to try to increase the rate.  I spoke to a nurse manager at one of the hospitals in Dublin where up to 60% of the beds in ICU and the hospital in general are taken up by members of that 7% of the population.  What is more worrying is the fact that in the hospital in question, four of the theatre nurses are unvaccinated.  These nurses cannot be rostered into theatre.  They are still working in the hospital and earning their weekend rates or whatever they might have been getting when they were in theatre.  They are putting more pressure on the existing staff, who are overworked as it is, by the fact they have not received the vaccine.  The nurse manager must then try to get agency staff for cover them, while dealing with other staff members being out because of being close contacts.  We need to make a strong decision on this with regard to everyone in the health service needing to be vaccinated.  Other countries have done this.  There might be kickbacks from mules, but Covid is not going to end in the short term.  We will be dealing with it in the long term.  The health service and health staff have worked extremely hard over long hours.  Some of them have not had holidays.  They have not done things with their own families.  It is incumbent on the small percentage in the health system who have not been vaccinated.  We have to take a serious look at this.<\/p> <p>I concur with the comments of Senator Buttimer on the hospitality industry.  I know the latter does not fall under the remit of the Department.  Over recent weeks, we have seen huge numbers of events that were planned for over Christmas being cancelled.  The businesses involved will take a serious hit.  At Cabinet level, we must insist that the employment wage subsidy scheme continues.  Otherwise, many of these businesses will not survive.  There is also a responsibility on the hospitality industry to check Covid certificates of people going into their premises.  A strong percentage are not doing so.  All of us know the places we have gone.  I have left places that have not asked for the certificate.  I purposely showed my certificate.  A significant number of places are not asking.  The vintners and the Irish Hotels Federation have to have a strong campaign.  If the Government is to support them, which I am pretty confident it will, they have to support the measures we are putting in place to make sure we look after our population and ensure we do not go back into a lockdown.<\/p> <p>I want to ask about deaf pupils.  It is an issue in schools.  Today I spoke to an organisation that represents parents.  There will be a severe difficulty for these children with regard to lip reading.  Perhaps there can be discussions with the INTO in this regard in order that some concessions might be made.<\/p> <p>The Minister is doing a good job.  We are looking after our people and that is our responsibility as public representatives.  We are ahead of almost every other country in Europe with regard to how we are dealing with it.  As a Government, we are probably not communicating it properly to people.  Much of this has to do with the fact that certain groups and political parties are trying to muddy the waters with the information going out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120100002#VV00200","speaker":"1639"},{"type":"speech","time":1638354600,"counter":240,"content":"<p>I join all my colleagues in saying how upset and annoyed I was with what happened outside the Minister's home.

I experienced this a few years ago as a Deputy.  It was not as bad as this.  It should not be happening anywhere.  I know the Minister is a strong man but we very much think of his family in this situation.  It should not be happening to any politician.<\/p> <p>I agree with much of what Senator Carrigy said.  Due to the fact that so many hotels and restaurants have contacted me about cancellations, I made the point on the Order of Business earlier that most of society is open.  It is not open in the normal way, and we all accept this, but we are not living in normal times.  There is no need for people not to go out and have a family meal or a meal with their friends as long as they adhere to what they are supposed to do.  There is no need to call off everything.  Most places have called off the big Christmas parties. The reality is that we are dealing with Covid.<\/p> <p>With regard to the mixed messages, we cannot but have mixed messages with Covid.  That is due to the way it changes from week to week.  We were making progress, and now we have a new variant.  We are not sure about where we will be with it for a few weeks.  It is a new threat.  The message changed.  It is not the Minister, the Government or the medical people; it is just the way Covid has shaken us all.  It has really turned the world upside down, whether we are speaking about business or politicians.  It has changed everything - all aspects of life.  We have to deal with it.  The Minister is doing his best, as is the Government, to keep people safe.  This has to be the bottom line.  Of course, we will have hiccoughs with new situations with masks, and I heard a discussion on this not too long ago.  There will be little issues but they will be sorted out.<\/p> <p>I know the Opposition has a job to do, but I remember some Opposition politicians stating six months ago that the roll-out of the vaccine was a disaster.  It turned out that Ireland ended up best in the world.  The Minister kept his head down, as did the officials, and kept working on it.  It is the same with the booster vaccinations.  I will get my booster vaccine in the coming days.  The pharmacists and doctors are at it.  Last Friday, the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, was in Roscommon.  The centre is in Kilbride in County Roscommon.  The Minister has also been there and the staff appreciated his visit.<\/p> <p>These are unusual times and difficult circumstances.  It is causing turmoil throughout the world.  We have very little control over it.  Society is managing to function but it is functioning in a different way.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Eugene Murphy:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2444\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2444&amp;amp;pid=EugeneMurphy&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is in everybody's interest to keep our schools open, but I am convinced that, with the good work of the principals, teachers and parents, the little hiccups that exist will be sorted in the coming days and all will be okay.  The Minister is correct that any child who is uncomfortable with a mask will not have to wear it.  That is fair enough.  All the relevant considerations, such as those concerning children with a disability, are taken into account.<\/p><p>There is a challenge facing the hospitality and entertainment sector.  It is appreciated that the Government has looked after it pretty well to date, but it is now facing something of a crisis.  I am sure the Government will consider extending schemes and reassessing circumstances to ensure the livelihoods of those in question are not affected.  One hotel told me it has had 75 cancellations.  It was so joyful when there was a return to some sort of normal opening.  Staff had to be retrained because some had been lost.  Now the sector faces this all over again.  Therefore, I appreciate the challenge.<\/p><p>We will have differences of opinion but politicians, the media and others should all be united in fighting this pandemic.  It is a global threat.  It is important, now more than ever, to have unity of purpose.  Of course we will all have questions and disagree on points but we should remember that if we are to defeat this virus, we must be unified nationally and globally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120100002#VV00300","speaker":"1674","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638354600,"counter":242,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for attending to discuss this important issue.  I compliment the Government on the job it has been doing to date.  Little did we think in February 2020 that we would be in the same situation in December 2021.  I compliment those behind the roll-out of the vaccine programme.  The vaccination centre in Limerick moved to a location just up the road from my house.  Its work there started today.  I was talking to somebody who works in the centre earlier and was told it has had a brisk day.  This is good to see because the Patrickswell centre was not working.<\/p> <p>We need a renewed campaign to get the message out.  I have said before that when people see an advertisement ten times, it fades into the background and they no longer see the message.  Some people still do not get the message so we need to find a new way of communicating the importance of getting vaccinated.  While it is not proven that vaccination stops the disease from being transmitted, it certainly helps to reduce its severity.  It is important that we encourage as many people as possible to get vaccinated.  There is a small minority who, for medical or other reasons, could not be vaccinated.  We must consider some sort of way leave for such people.  There are those who have chosen not to be vaccinated but there are others who, for genuine medical reasons, cannot be vaccinated.  We need to consider this.<\/p> <p>I am glad the number of Covid cases in University Hospital Limerick is down.  It was quite a worry for a while.  The Minister will know there have been long waiting lists in the hospital.  If the number rises again in the hospital, will private or other hospitals in the area be used so people will not be left waiting for various procedures?  To date, they have been left waiting.<\/p> <p>I cannot emphasise enough the plight of the hospitality sector over the past 18 months.  We all agree that those in the sector are the most vulnerable.  I would like the Government to consider keeping the employment wage subsidy scheme rate at its current level.  Hoteliers and restaurateurs to whom I have spoken in the past 24 hours have had numerous cancellations.  Cancellation is the customer's choice but the hotels and restaurants will have employed staff and bought food.  They incur many losses.  Therefore, we need to examine this matter with a view to supporting businesses.  I thank the Minister for attending.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120100002#WW00200","speaker":"1695"},{"type":"speech","time":1638354600,"counter":243,"content":"<p>I pay tribute to the Minister on the work he is doing while having to put up with the behaviour of what I can only describe as Neanderthals.  I am referring to how they have targeted him personally and politicians' private homes.  I commend the Minister on the work he is able to do while having to deal with this.  It is very much appreciated by Members of the Oireachtas of all political parties and none.<\/p> <p>At times over the past 18 months it has been very easy to lose perspective.  In this regard, consider where we are today by comparison with where we were last year.  Last year we did not have vaccines, and antigen tests were not in use.  We had to lock down the entire country when we had the number of cases we have today because we did not have any other way to combat the problem.  Fast forward 12 months and we have one of the highest vaccination rates in Europe, which is incredible when one sees the problems Austria and other countries face in trying to vaccinate their populations.  It is an incredible tribute to the Irish population that we have such a high vaccination rate.  It is sometimes lost on people in this country how well we are doing in that respect.<\/p> <p>We now have antigen tests.  We are able to keep the vast majority of sectors in our country up and running despite the current case numbers.  That is the perspective that is needed.  I have said before that there are elements of the media that, for whatever reason, are happy to play Chicken Little and say the sky is falling in because of the prospect of a new variant coming along, only for us to find out the following day, from the small bit of evidence we have, that the symptoms are quite mild.<\/p> <p>The second point on perspective is that I feel the case numbers announced every night are sometimes a little disingenuous because there are so many non-current cases included.  It is difficult for people who are watching every evening to understand the trend.  When one digs into the figures for the past couple of weeks, one sees a tapering off, a decline in case numbers, fewer people coming out of intensive care units and fewer people having to go to hospital.  This is because we are vaccinated and because vaccinations have worked so well.  That needs to be brought into the debate.  We need to take a deep breath, take a step back and have perspective.<\/p> <p>The term \"living with Covid\" has been thrown around so much over the past 18 months.  My view on living with Covid involves vaccination, accepting Covid is in the community and doing our very best to keep the country open as much as possible, based on listening to the scientific evidence and the Government making decisions thereon.<\/p> <p>On the potential new measures, I do not want to make any guesses.  I do not believe there is a need at this stage for additional or tougher restrictions, especially when we see the direction of the numbers and how well we are doing.  It is forgotten, because of the Chicken Little narrative of the sky falling in, that we are now in a much better place today than the best possible outcome for today that was suggested by the NPHET modelling.  Therefore, we are in a really good place.  It would be very difficult to argue in favour of further restrictions.<\/p> <p>On school numbers, schools have not suddenly become crazy, unsafe places.  The virus is thriving in places where people are not vaccinated, including schoolchildren between nine and 12.  It is for this reason that we see a high rate in the schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120100002#WW00300","speaker":"1670"},{"type":"speech","time":1638354600,"counter":244,"content":"<p>I am conscious that we have to call the Minister at 6.20 p.m. but I want to try to give everyone an opportunity to contribute.

I always find debates in the Seanad really valuable, useful, thought-provoking, challenging and important, so I thank Senators as always for their time.  I will try to address the various issues raised as best I can and I apologise if I miss some of them.<\/p> <p>Senators asked about progress on the Delta wave.  We are dealing with two different but related matters, that is, a Delta wave, which we have a plan in place to deal with, and the new variant, for which various actions are being taken.  As has been pointed out, the latest information we have, which we received earlier this week from Professor Nolan's team, plotted what is happening versus the projections we were given a few weeks ago.  As colleagues will be aware, we were given no-change future possibilities, with an optimistic and a pessimistic scenario.  This was where we saw the issue that was most concerning to me, that is, that by Christmas week, we faced a range of just-Covid ICU patients of between 200 and 450.  The implications of that for patients and the healthcare system are profound, so we acted and took various steps.<\/p> <p>Probably the most important step was a message, which everyone in this House got behind, to say to people we had to reduce our social contacts, stick with the basic measures and use masks and the things we know work.  Clearly, people have changed their behaviour, as they always do.  I again acknowledge the incredible response from people.  Individuals, families and communities throughout the country have adjusted their behaviour and it has had the desired effect of pushing back down the virus.  Our case numbers now are significantly below what was likely to happen if there had been no policy change.<\/p> <p>More encouraging than that again are the figures for hospitalisations and ICU admissions versus what was likely to happen if nothing changed.  Here we can really see the impact of the booster programme, a subject I will return to given various colleagues have sought more detail on it.  We are seeing a really important lower profile of hospitalisations and ICU admissions for Covid versus what it would be if nothing had happened.  A combination of the booster programme, which is moving at pace, and, just as important, people acting in a safe manner to keep themselves and their communities and families safe has worked very well.<\/p> <p>Many other measures are in place, as we are all aware.  These are: PCR testing and contact tracing; antigen testing, which I will return to shortly; the Covid pass, which we have extended; the winter plan; the flu vaccine; the nursing home measures; the working-from-home measure; the midnight closing in the hospitality sector; household close contacts staying at home for five days and being sent antigen tests; and antivirals, which were referenced and which, while they have not yet been deployed, we are ensuring will be deployed here as soon as they are ready.  All these measures are working.<\/p> <p>It is human instinct for us, including Members and the public, to focus on the bits that are not working.  That is right and proper and, obviously, there must always be challenge.  It is important, however, not to lose sight of the fact the overall approach, this national effort from people throughout our nation, the Oireachtas, the Government, the HSE and industry, is working.  It is important people know their efforts are bearing fruit and, ultimately, will save many lives, in the context both of Covid and of not having to cancel non-Covid care at a level that otherwise would be required.  In summary, when it comes to the Delta wave, the plan is working, and again, it is a national effort.  I am not trying to claim credit for the Government here.  As always, this is a national effort and it has, broadly, been a cross-party effort.<\/p> <p>A really important message for us all to get out, and I thank all the Senators who raised it, is that everyone should get vaccinated or boosted.  I put together some figures for the debate.  Right now, more than half of hospitalisations and more than 60% of ICU admissions in respect of Covid are unvaccinated.  If people, therefore, choose at this point to be unvaccinated, they are putting themselves and the people around them at risk.  It is taking up an awful lot of capacity within the system that otherwise would be used for other patients to get them the surgery and the procedures they need.  It is important we do not enter a blame game; that is not what this is about.  We need to try to reach out to these people to say vaccination really matters to protect them, other people, healthcare workers and our healthcare resource.<\/p> <p>Another figure I thought was quite interesting is that currently, about two thirds of Covid hospitalisations and ICU patients are under 45 years of age.  It is important to bear that in mind, given there is an almost 100% vaccination rate among the higher age groups and that falls off among younger groups.  In fairness to younger people, the figure is nonetheless between 80% and 89% among the late teens and 20-somethings, still very high by international standards, but it is interesting that two thirds of Covid patients in hospital, including in ICU, are now under 45 years of age.  That is an important message.<\/p> <p>The most important message the public health experts are always trying to get out to all of us is that if one is symptomatic, stay at home and get a PCR test.  I acknowledge there are delays.  We would like to get everyone booked in the next day but sometimes it is taking two days or, in some cases, three.  A total of 80% of self-referrals are being seen the next day.  We would love that figure to be 100% but the vast majority are being seen the next day.  In the case of priority referrals, which are from a GP or as a close contact, 97% of them happen within 24 hours.  We always want to make it better and better but the core message is that if one is symptomatic, stay at home and get a PCR test.  If one is going out, layer up with protection, that is, masks, distancing, ventilation, hand hygiene and so forth.  That makes a significant difference.  I referred earlier to some new research that shows how effective these simple and basic measures are.<\/p> <p>On the booster programme, I am delighted to be able to share that more than 800,000 doses have been administered, between the immuno-compromised, who received third doses, and the booster doses.  A total of 210,000 of them were administered in the past seven days and we are moving at speed.  The initial focus, as Senators will be aware and I think will be bought in to, has been on everyone over the age of 60, those with underlying conditions, those with weakened immune systems and our healthcare workers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120100002#XX00200","speaker":"1654"},{"type":"speech","time":1638354600,"counter":248,"content":"<p>I thank colleagues for their contributions and time.

Those aged 80 or above, those in long-term residential care and the immunocompromised are substantially done or have been offered a booster.  Approximately two thirds of healthcare workers and those in their 70s have been boosted and more have been offered those vaccines.  We are moving very quickly now through those in their 60s.  As of two days ago, approximately 20% of that group had been done.  More of them are now eligible by virtue of it having been five months since their vaccine.  It is not the original six-month target that we are using; it is five months, which is the shortest gap we can use.  Obviously, it is three months for those who received the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine.  This week, we have walk-in clinics for front-line healthcare workers and the over-60s.  Critically, one of the groups in respect of which I engaged with the HSE to ensure it happens as quickly as possible is that of people with underlying conditions.  The vast majority of people in hospital with Covid have an underlying condition, so it was very important to me that we got those people done as early as possible.  That is now happening this week.  They are being contacted by the HSE this week.<\/p><p>In terms of antigen testing, there has understandably been a significant amount of talk about subsidisation or stopping the subsidisation.  Let me explain that.  I believe antigen testing has a very important role to play.  The priority for me is ensuring that antigen tests are widely available and affordable and that people are supported in using them and receive good advice on how to use them and how to interpret the results.  In other words, it is the green light-red light idea.  We must ensure antigen tests are not used instead of PCR testing in the situations where PCR testing is the right thing to do.  There are very good materials now available online on the HSE website and public communications campaigns have been launched.  The tests are widely available.  We send many thousands of them to houses all over Ireland every day for household close contacts.  They are now going out to schools.  They are in colleges.  They are used in nursing homes, as well as many workplaces and healthcare settings.<\/p><p>The latest information we have is that approximately one in five people in the country is using an antigen test every week.  They are now being widely used.  I wanted to go further and make sure they were available at a reasonable price because, for me, &euro;7 or &euro;8 a test is not affordable for far too many people.  I wanted to see the price brought right down and, therefore, we looked at subsidising them.  Subsidising them is not a cheap thing to do.  We are talking about a lot of tests.  As part of that process, there was a significant and healthy engagement with the retail sector and various others on antigen tests and the price came down.  It came down from approximately &euro;8 to between &euro;2 and &euro;4.  That is not the case everywhere.  I saw it reported that a person said this has not worked because he or she found a pharmacy where the tests are &euro;8.  If the tests are on sale for &euro;8, people should not buy them there.  They should go elsewhere and buy them for less than &euro;8.  I want to make sure the price goes down further.  We are continuing to engage to that end.  Essentially, the policy objective was to bring about a significant and quick reduction in the retail price, and that has been achieved without having to deploy public money.  That is the situation there.<\/p><p>There has been much discussion this evening in respect of masks for nine, ten and 11 year olds.  We need to be very balanced in how we speak about this.  This is a public health recommendation from NPHET.  It is one that NPHET considered in great detail and it is driven in part by the fact that there has been a very significant increase in cases for nine, ten and 11 year olds.  There has been an increase in cases among younger age groups, but the rate among nine, ten and 11 year olds is the highest in the country.  It drops right back down again for 12 year-olds.  I am happy to share those data with colleagues after the debate.  I can ask the Department to send them on.  The belief is that the huge drop from 11 year olds to 12 year olds is down to a combination of factors.  It is down to the fact that 12 year olds can get vaccinated, but also that most or many 12 year olds are in secondary school, where masks are being used.  That is supported by international evidence that shows the really important protection masks provide.  We got a sensible and fully thought-through recommendation from NPHET on mask wearing for nine, ten and 11 year olds.  That translates broadly to third class and up in primary schools.  A decision was taken to make it third class and up, rather than having mixed rules in respect of mask wearing in classes containing nine year olds and eight year olds.  That is the public health rationale.  It is in place for one reason, which is to keep children safe.<\/p><p>I ask Senator Gavan to reflect on his usage of language such as \"punishing children\".  I do not know if it is a line his party is taking.  It is really unhelpful language.  This is a public health measure coming from the Chief Medical Officer and NPHET with one objective, which is to keep children safe.  I have a child in that age group and this morning he picked up a mask and went into school.  Would they all prefer not to be wearing masks?  Of course they would.  Do we take very seriously any public health advice that affects children?  Of course we do.  However, there is only one objective here, and that is to keep children safe.  I ask all present to keep that in mind when debating this issue.  Obviously, they may challenge and disagree with the measures but Oireachtas Members in particular need to be very careful with the language they use.  I disagree with the kind of language used by the Senator.  I do not think it is helpful.<\/p><p>That is probably a good segue to the issue of communications.  There is, understandably and rightly, a significant amount of focus on communication.  In a pandemic, communication is, obviously, essential.  I will be the first to admit that we must always do better.  There are definitely things we can do better.  I take on board the challenge and criticism that has been levelled from all sides and that is fair.  I was thinking this through during the debate.  Of course, every day and week we should try to do more.  Right now, between Government, the Department of Health and the HSE we have public communications campaigns on broad public health measures, as all present will be aware and support, in respect of distancing, masks and hand hygiene.  Those are core messages.<\/p><p>There is a public communications campaign on vaccines and first doses for people.  We have a public communications campaign on the boosters, not just their importance but where people can go, who we are doing, when each cohort will be up and how people can engage.  We are communicating on the new international travel measures because, obviously, they have a big effect on people.  People need to know about them.  We have public communications on testing and tracing.  We have public communications on PCR testing, contract tracing, enhanced contact tracing, antigen testing, flu vaccines and more.  Those are just some of the issues I wrote down this evening.  I make that point not by way of excuse - we have to do better - but because I want to share the significant complexity of the health communications during the pandemic.  That is not to say we cannot do more and should not do better.  We can do more and we must do better.<\/p><p>I wish to address this idea that if NPHET advises something but the Government decides to do something different, that is somehow mixed messaging.  It is not.  NPHET provides public health advice and the Government makes decisions.  That is how it works.  We have taken the decision, with which I think all present probably agree, to publish the NPHET advice.  It is published online very quickly.  I believe people have a right to know not just what governments decide, but what the public health advice is.  If we publish public health advice that we get on a Thursday and then meet as a Government on the Tuesday and take a few days to consider that advice, which we do, and we may make decisions on a Tuesday that are different, then I suggest to colleagues that not only is that not mixed messaging but transparent communications.  Most of us know that and get that.  It is quite healthy.   That is part of it.  I hear and accept the challenges and criticisms in terms of the public communications.  We have to always try to be as clear as possible and get it right.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Stephen Donnelly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2336\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2336&amp;amp;pid=StephenDonnelly&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I will end on a positive note.  The issue of antivirals was raised in this debate.  A definitive position has not yet been reached.  Engagement is still ongoing.  As colleagues will be aware, a joint EU procurement programme, similar to that used to procure vaccines, is being considered.  I have instructed the officials to engage directly with the pharmaceutical companies as well.  The policy position is essentially to do whatever gets them here and in use the fastest.  Good progress has been made on that.  As the Senator will be aware, these antivirals have not yet been authorised by the European Medicines Agency but indications from the trials with regard to the role they may play, and that I believe they will play, is very encouraging.  They will be another quite powerful tool for Ireland and other countries in helping people to avoid hospitalisation and really severe illness.  Things look positive in that regard.  When I have a more definitive position and when agreements are in place, I will update colleagues as quickly as I can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120100002#XX00300","speaker":"1623","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638354600,"counter":251,"content":"<p>Will the Minister refer to the TRIPS waiver?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120100002#ZZ00200","speaker":"1660"},{"type":"speech","time":1638354600,"counter":252,"content":"<p>I may have to come back to the Senator on that point.  I had some notes on that matter.  The short answer is that, as the Senator will be aware, I am on the public record as being in favour of such a waiver, as I have told him before.  However, I am cognisant of the EU position.  One of the concerns at an EU level is that there may potentially be unintended consequences if some of the incentive for these companies to move very quickly is removed.  We can agree or disagree with that.  This is a position that has been put to me.  Let us say we remove intellectual property protection and then this new variant turns out to be serious.  If it please God, it will not, but let us say that it does.  Let us also say that the variant requires the vaccines to be adjusted.  Will the pharmaceutical companies move as quickly in those circumstances?  These are the kinds of concerns that have to be worked through.<\/p> <p>My view is that we need a globally just solution to this.  There is no point in us here in Ireland getting our first and second doses, our booster vaccines and who knows what else in the future unless a globally just solution to this issue is found.  We must find such a solution for ethical reasons and reasons of justice and rights first and foremost, but enlightened self-interest is another reason to do so.  It is in our interest to do so.  It is not that this should be the motivating factor but it happens to also be in our interest.  <\/p> <p>Globally, Europe is at the centre of the export of vaccines to the developing world.  A &euro;1 billion proposal is being put in place to develop permanent production capacity in developing countries.  This means those countries would not just be reliant on supplies being transported from other parts of the world.  Let us forget about the EU for a second and ask what we in Ireland can do.  We have donated several hundred thousand doses of vaccines.  We have also donated more than &euro;7 million to COVAX.  It is the Government's intention to do more but, when one looks around the world, one sees that Europe is leading the way in exporting large amounts of vaccines to lower and middle-income countries.  <\/p> <p>More can be done.  Perhaps Ireland can play a role in that, given our high vaccine uptake rates.  Colleagues will be aware that the South African Government recently asked the pharmaceutical companies to slow down delivery of the vaccines because of vaccine hesitancy.  Perhaps Ireland, as a small country, can play a role in that regard, given that there has been a very successful programme here which has been embraced broadly.  I assure the Senator that I believe there must be a quick and just solution to this issue that makes sure that vaccines are distributed all over the world.  However, we must do more than just distribute vaccines.  We want to see permanent production capacity in these countries so they are not reliant on other parts of the world to send them vaccines.  Ireland and other countries can provide additional support with regard to public engagement and the roll-out of campaigns to address vaccine hesitancy, leading to high take-up rates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120100002#ZZ00300","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1638354600,"counter":253,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.  He has given us more of his time than he was scheduled to.  I appreciate that.  He gave a comprehensive reply.  I met the Minister for the first time in connection with a health issue in Kerry.  We were trying to recall the Seanad, which we managed to do.  We also tried to recall the D&aacute;il but did not succeed.  The issue in question was organ donation.  The Minister has been a champion of that for many years.  There were reports in the newspapers and other media in recent days that an organ transplant operation had to be cancelled as a result of lack of available ICU beds.  As the Minister will know, I am very passionate about the issue of organ donation.  As we know, 600 Irish citizens are on the waiting list for an organ transplant.  Many are taken off the list because they become simply too sick to receive an organ donation.  As the Minister has said, we do not want to get into a blame game in respect of this issue but, when people get this opportunity only for it to be taken away from them at the last minute, it can be very hard to take.  What are the Minister's thoughts on that issue?  It obviously affects the whole health system but, in that particular case, a person had a chance to live a much longer life and to have an enhanced quality of life.  People can spend decades on an organ transplant list.  It is huge for them when an opportunity arises but, in this case, that opportunity was taken away as a result of something that would not happen in normal circumstances.  What are the Minister's thoughts on that particular matter?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120100002#ZZ00400","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"speech","time":1638354600,"counter":254,"content":"<p>Are we getting supplementary questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120100002#ZZ00500","speaker":"1647"},{"type":"speech","time":1638354600,"counter":255,"content":"<p>The Minister has given us enough time.

I am aware of the case.  It is being looked at.  It is absolutely soul-destroying for the patient, the patient's family and the family of the donor for that to happen.  The anguish such a situation can cause is indescribable.  It should never happen.  We are making a lot of positive policy changes in respect of organ donation.  Legislation is coming through which will essentially move us to an opt-out system rather than an opt-in system.  Investment is being made in the infrastructure required.  There may also be opportunities in respect of international sharing.  We do some of this and I have asked the Department to explore opportunities to develop a wider international network for sharing.<\/p> <p>As the Cathaoirleach will be aware, the situation he has mentioned came down to the availability of an ICU bed.  We have to keep the pressure up, as we are doing, in order to get ICU and critical care capacity to a satisfactory level.  We simply do not have that now.  The baseline of 225 critical care beds was too low by a long way.  We have tasked the HSE with adding as many critical care beds as possible.  There is no issue in respect of funding.  I have allocated over &euro;60 million in funding over this year and next year just for critical care.  It is not a straightforward thing to do but it is absolutely essential and will help with regard to the issue the Cathaoirleach has raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120100002#ZZ00700","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1638354600,"counter":257,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his time today and I thank all colleagues who contributed to the debate.
