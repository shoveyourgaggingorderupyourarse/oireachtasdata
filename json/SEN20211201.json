He clearly regards it as important.  When I first took my seat in 2014, I was immediately aware of the job of Seanad secretarial assistant, SA, and that it bore little resemblance to the work that SAs actually do.  That was confirmed in a survey in 2017, which showed that Seanad SAs do the same work as parliamentary assistants in the D&aacute;il.  They undertake research, speech-writing, preparing newsletters and briefing papers and preparing material for committees, among other things.  Not only is the job of an SA a misnomer, the pay does not compensate for the work they undertake.  SAs currently earn &euro;24,423 per year or &euro;11.75 per hour.  That would qualify an SA with one child to avail of working family payment from social welfare to supplement their income.<\/p> <p>To add insult to injury, it currently takes 18 years to reach the maximum point on the SA scale on contracts that are fixed purpose and that do not exceed five years in duration.  We are bringing all these passionate, highly educated and incredibly loyal people to assist us as legislators on temporary contracts with long working hours and we are paying them well below the living wage.  In any other sector, we would be accused of gross exploitation and rightly vilified for this as a result.<\/p> <p>What is even worse is that we, the employers of SAs, have no control over their terms and conditions.  The Minister is the only person who can successfully address the issue.  In 2018, SIPTU lodged a pay claim on behalf of SAs which called for the introduction of the parliamentary assistant scale for the Seanad and compensation for the SA scale so that staff in the D&aacute;il are rewarded for the essential work they do in the Oireachtas.  In 2019, I and other colleagues from across the House passed a motion calling on the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to meet with the staff union representing this group as a matter of urgency.  It is now 2021 and no meeting has ever taken place.  I appreciate there have been many emergency issues in the meantime.<\/p> <p>This year, assistants in both the D&aacute;il and Seanad were offered a pay increase of 1% in October, 1% in February 2022 and 1% in October 2022.  That would bring their salaries to &euro;25,162 per year or &euro;12.09 per hour, which is still below the living wage.  This was not acceptable and was rejected totally by the staff and their union, SIPTU.  More importantly, it failed to address the fundamental issue that the role of an SA has evolved to the level of a parliamentary assistant and that the D&aacute;il and Seanad have completely different roles.  If a Seanad SA loses his or her job after an election, having the job of SA on a CV completely misrepresents the work they have done.<\/p> <p>Earlier this year, the Ceann Comhairle relaunched the form on a family friendly and inclusive Parliament, which is an excellent initiative.  However, we know that it is impossible to attract a diverse workforce and create truly inclusive workplaces without considering the factors that will encourage retention.  I strongly believe salary transparency, pay equity and equal pay for equal work are the fundamental cornerstones in building an inclusive culture in the Oireachtas.  SAs acquire a vast amount of proprietary knowledge very quickly and we should be doing everything we can to retain them.  Instead, we are exploiting them while they are here.<\/p> <p>I know that the Cabinet agreed to publish the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission (Amendment) Bill 2021, which will provide &euro;462.5 million to run the D&aacute;il and Seanad for the next three years.  It would be shameful if every aspect of the running of the Parliament was adequately funded except for the people on whom so many of us depend, who are the powerhouses in our offices and whose loyalty is beyond question.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Gerard P.

It became a full-time job for me and, as such, I am entitled to the same supports as any full-time Member of the Oireachtas.  Without my SA, Jean Webster, my office would not run.  I would simply be neutered and unable to do anything.  From that point of view I am asking the Minister today to reverse our current position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120100002#A00500","speaker":"1645","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638354600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I again thank the Minister for coming into the House this morning to discuss this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120100002#B00200","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"speech","time":1638354600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Craughwell for raising this issue and I thank the Cathaoirleach for giving me the opportunity to address it in the House.<\/p><p>As a Member of the Oireachtas for more than 14 years, I am deeply conscious and appreciative of the extraordinary work carried out by all of our support staff.  I see this work up close day in, day out, and know that I, for one, could not do the job I do without the selfless dedication and commitment I get from my own staff.  I have no doubt the same is true for every Member of this House, as Senator Craughwell has noted in his own case.  I also acknowledge that the nature of the work carried out by our staff, which in the case of Senators means their SAs is unique. They have to deal with a multifaceted set of issues every day and their role extends far beyond providing what might be generally termed secretarial support.<\/p><p>The role of an SA is very different now to what it was even a decade ago in light of the rapid changes in the way we communicate and interact with the people we represent.  I am also deeply aware that they do not enjoy job security and, in many instances, they will no longer have work once the Member they work for is not re-elected or retires.  Being a politician or working for a politician has many benefits, principally the enjoyment and satisfaction we get from helping people and making a difference, but job security is not one of them.<\/p><p>To deal with the specific issue at hand, the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Act 2003 provides a limited role for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in determining pay and superannuation arrangements for secretarial and parliamentary assistants employed under the scheme of secretarial assistance.  Under the Act, the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission has the power to regulate the provision of secretarial facilities to Members and qualifying parties.  This function transferred from the Minister for Finance on the establishment of the commission on 1 January 2004.  The term &quot;secretarial facilities&quot; is not defined in legislation but is generally taken to be a wide term encompassing the staff employed under the scheme for secretarial assistance, as well as ICT equipment, office equipment, printing facilities and graphic design services.  SAs, parliamentary assistants, administrative assistants, administrators and <i>chefs de cabine<\/i>t are employed by Members and by qualifying parties but are paid by the commission.  The commission also regulates the number of staff employed under the scheme and has oversight of the operation of the scheme.<\/p><p>Under the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Act 2003, the commission must obtain the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform before reaching an agreement with any person in respect of rates of pay, conditions of employment or superannuation rights.  In practice, this means that the commission advises on matters relating to resourcing, grading and terms and conditions of employment and submits proposals for the Minister's consideration and agreement.  In other words, the commission makes a proposal to me, as Minister, on issues such as grading, salary rates and so on, and I then make a decision on that proposal, having consulted with my officials.  In that regard, I am aware that there is a process under way at the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, dealing with various issues, including alignment with the current public service pay agreement Building Momentum, between the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission and SIPTU.  This is an issue I would like to see resolved and that is an important political signal for me as Minister to give in this House this morning.  I look forward to a successful resolution of the matter and early presentation of proposals for my agreement, in line with my role under the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120100002#B00300","speaker":"1459"},{"type":"speech","time":1638354600,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for outlining many of the issues relating to this matter.

If I am not misinterpreting what the Minister said, once the commission makes up its mind and comes to him with a proposal he will be willing to look at it and is anxious to have this matter resolved as quickly as possible.  Going back to my time as a teacher, a union activist and the president of a union, it always annoyed me terribly that the State was the most difficult body of all to deal with when it came to resolving matters before the WRC or the Labour Court.  I recall on one occasion having to go to the courts against an education authority in order to get enforcement.  The Cathaoirleach is a member of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  I hope that this matter will go before the commission at its next meeting, that a proposal will go to the Minister before Christmas and that we will have this matter resolved once and for all.  Failing that, I will try my damnedest in the new year to ensure that no legislation is dealt with in this House until this matter is addressed.  It is more than three years since I discussed this at the commission.  It is absolutely ridiculous that, three years later, we have to invite the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform into the House to try to resolve the matter.

I also acknowledge the Cathaoirleach's comments.  I should have said that this issue has been raised with me by him and many of his colleagues from across the floor of the Seanad in recent times.

That is what now needs to happen.  I welcome that and look forward to that happening.<\/p> <p>The Senator mentioned the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission (Amendment) Bill 2021.  I will be here in the next week or two to deal with that.  It provides for a significant increase in the resources of the Oireachtas of more than &euro;40 million across the next three years.  That is an increase of almost 10%, which is needed and which will be used for a variety of different purposes.<\/p> <p>What I want to do this morning is clearly set out what my role is under the legislation.  My role is to give consent to a proposal that is put to me by the commission.  The commission is the entity that is directly involved in the negotiations.  I have given a clear political signal and that is significant.  I have looked at the proposal that was put on the table in September and there is a lot of merit in it.  The realignment with public sector norms is important.  Even under the existing terms of Building Momentum, while the increases on 1 October 2021 and 1 October 2022 are 1% in headline terms, they also involve a minimum of &euro;500 each time.  For somebody at the bottom of the pay scale, that is 2% each time.  There is also the 1% from the sectoral bargaining fund on 1 February.<\/p> <p>An element from the previous agreement is also on the table.  It relates to the issue of incremental credits in order that people can start further up the pay scale and so on.  There is a lot in that but it is not for me to get into the detail of it.  I have given a signal for the commission to engage intensively with SIPTU in the normal industrial relations channels at the WRC and I stand ready with my officials to consider any proposal that is put to us.

When is it expected the report from the export forum on antisocial behaviour will be received, in light of the increasing incidence of antisocial behaviour throughout the country, including Galway, my home city, but also other cities such as Dublin, Cork, Waterford and Limerick?  There have been issues with antisocial behaviour, which has certainly increased in the inner cities since the pandemic began more than 18 months ago.  There are a number of reasons for that.  I can speak about Eyre Square at first hand, having been born and raised 200 yards from it.  The square has suffered from a spate of antisocial behaviour in recent times, including a tragic incident where a young woman lost sight in one eye when a firework was let off.  This has become such an issue that the chief superintendent of Mill Street Garda station in Galway city has even suggested the square may have to be closed at a certain hour.  As a Member of the Oireachtas, I certainly would not be in agreement with that suggestion, which is not a solution.<\/p> <p>As the Minister of State is aware, Eyre Square is in the heart of Galway city, very close to the train and bus stations and is often the first impression of our city for visitors and tourists alike.  Galway has always been a largely safe and happy place to live and visit.  We cannot allow the actions of a tiny minority to alter that.  A Christmas market with a large number of stalls is open in Eyre Square.  The market has activities for kids and adults, across the divide.  It will run right up to Christmas and offers an opportunity because there is full-time security in the square now.  However, the Garda presence in Eyre Square will need to be enhanced immediately after the market closes.  That issue must be dealt with.  The visibility of garda&iacute; is vital in reducing crimes.  We are currently seeing that, with the success of Operation Citizen in Dublin, with which the Minister of State will be familiar.  As highlighted last week, that operation has reduced crime statistics, which is very welcome.<\/p> <p>As I said, a number of issues are causing this problem.  Hospitality businesses are closing earlier and people have no place to go.  This is a major concern.  I am fully aware that Garda operations are a matter for the Garda.  Is the Department in a position to highlight the importance of locations such as Eyre Square being properly policed?  Seeing garda&iacute; on the ground gives certainty to businesses and residents in the inner city in Galway.  It is paramount that residents are safe and secure in their homes.  I will await the Minister of State's response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120100002#C00200","speaker":"1646"},{"type":"speech","time":1638354600,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Crowe for raising this very important matter relating to antisocial behaviour throughout Ireland but specifically in Eyre Square.  Senator Crowe has been raising concerns not only here in the Chamber but also behind the scenes with the Department of Justice and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I understand how important it is to him to ensure members of the public and his local community are safe in his city.  I have been to Eyre Square many times and the warm welcome received by domestic and international tourists in the city is renowned.  We have to ensure our public spaces are kept open for the public and communities.  That is their purpose and under no circumstances should they be lost to antisocial behaviour.<\/p> <p>The Government is determined to tackle antisocial behaviour and is very conscious of the effect it can have on the quality of life for local communities.  We are clear that incidents of assault or intimidation are completely unacceptable and that people must be safe and feel safe within their communities.  The programme for Government and the Justice Plan 2021 contain a number of commitments with regard to tackling antisocial behaviour and I will touch on a number of these important commitments.<\/p> <p>As Senators will be aware, the expert forum on antisocial behaviour was established by this Government in line with the programme for Government.  I chair the forum, which is charged with considering the effectiveness of existing legislation and propose new ways forward, including new powers for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and additional interventions to support parenting of offenders.  We were determined when this Government was formed that we would set up the antisocial behaviour forum in which, at a high level, representative groups could come together to address the issues around antisocial behaviour.  Rural and urban groups are represented on the forum and we work closely with the road safety forum, which I also sit on, to look at tackling issues around antisocial behaviour and other issues affecting both rural and urban Ireland.<\/p> <p>The forum has already produced a report regarding the misuse of scramblers, which I believe was very well received.  It is expected that a report on knife crime will be available early next year.  Future reporting will be produced on specific issues as and when they arise.  That is very much what we focus on in the forum.  Rather than trying to duplicate what other forums, such as the road safety forum, are doing, we target individual issues and try to come up with both community and legislative responses to those issues.<\/p> <p>Earlier this year, I launched the youth justice strategy for the period 2021 to 2027.  The strategy was published in April last.  I thank the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, for his significant support in providing additional funding of &euro;6.7 million in this year's budget to help kick-start that new youth justice strategy and recruit youth workers.  The strategy includes consideration of the full range of issues connected to children and young people at risk of coming into contact with the criminal justice system, including early intervention and preventative work, family support and diversion from crime, through to court process and facilities, supervision of offenders, detention and reintegration and support post release.<\/p> <p>The immediate priority is to enhance engagement with children and young people who are most at risk of involvement in criminal activity, principally by strengthening the services available through the existing network of youth diversion projects.  As I said, the Minister, Deputy McGrath, contributed an additional &euro;6.7 million this year, an increase of approximately 40% in the budget for youth justice, which is very significant.<\/p> <p>An unprecedented &euro;2 billion funding for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na allocated in budget 2022 also reflects the commitment of the Government to ensuring communities are safe and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the resources to be effective.  This funding will include provision for the recruitment of 800 new Garda recruits and 400 Garda staff.  We have the process of civilianisation of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na whereby we use civilian staff to release garda&iacute; from administrative duties back on to the front line to help ensure our communities are being kept safe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120100002#C00300","speaker":"1618"},{"type":"speech","time":1638354600,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his very positive comments in regard to public spaces.

There are certain crops that can be used such as winter or spring oats, rye, winter or spring wheat, winter or spring barley and winter or spring oilseed rape.  You can get paid on, at least, 5 ha but for no more than 40 ha.  If you apply for more than 40 ha you can carry it out but there is no payment above 40 ha.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has approved a budget of &euro;10 million for this scheme, with a payment rate per ha for the oat, rye, wheat and barley of &euro;250 and for oilseed rape &euro;150.<\/p> <p>Since its establishment, this has been a really good scheme.  Many tillage farmers in Tipperary speak very positively about it and they are very happy with it.  A question regularly asked of me by tillage farmers is if this scheme can be made permanent.  The Minister will be aware that for most schemes introduced by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine the first question is always on how it can be made easier to apply for.  This is a scheme that people are really happy with in terms of applying for it, but they are looking for it to be made permanent.  In fairness to the Irish Grain Growers group, it has been requesting this. I know that the group has been in contact with the Minister and the Department in regard to the scheme being made permanent for tillage farmers.  This year has been a good year for tillage farming but that is not always the case.  A scheme like this gives a level of certainty to farmers.<\/p> <p>Another question often put to me by farmers is on why the payment for oilseed rape is set at a different level and if, at any point into the future, it is proposed to increase it to the &euro;250 payment for the other crops.  A number of farmers chop the oilseed rape, but from a financial point of view and with a difference of &euro;100 per ha, it makes more sense to chop the straw of the wheat barley rather than the oilseed rape.  Will the Minister consider raising the budget for this over the next number of years as well because of the interest in it?  <\/p> <p>One of the main requests is for an increase in the ceiling per individual.  At the moment, as the Minister will be aware, a farmer can apply for 40 ha, or almost 100 acres, under this scheme, which is excellent and people are really happy with that.  Last year, we fell below the overall amount allowed to be used nationally.  I know farmers in Tipperary who wanted to use more of their land for this because they know it is a benefit to the environment.  Over the next number of months - this has started already - we will face issues with regard to fertiliser and the cost of fertiliser.  Cutting up straw and incorporating it into the soil helps in terms of encouraging farmers to use less fertiliser and it reduces the dependency for tillage farmers to use fertiliser.  There is an environmental aspect to this and they know that.  <\/p> <p>While it is welcome that you can have up to 100 acres per farmer, can the Department do something for tillage farmers in Tipperary who have more than 100 acres, such as set a percentage of their land that they can use?  For example, a farmer who has 150 acres can use 100 acres for this scheme, which means that farmer can use two-thirds of his or her land, but for the farmer who has 400 acres or 500 acres, 100 acres is only 20%.  Could we, perhaps, allow for say, 25% or 30% of land to be used under this scheme?  There are farmers who feel they would benefit a lot more if they could use more than 100 acres or, use the first 100 acres and beyond that a percentage of, say, 20% or 25%.  This would give farmers with greater amounts of land more to work it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120100002#D00500","speaker":"1629"},{"type":"speech","time":1638354600,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Ahearn for raising the straw incorporation measure, SIM.  Having secured funding in budget 2021, I introduced the measure as a pilot to support Irish tillage farmers who decide to chop and incorporate straw into the soil after harvest.  As pointed out by the Senator, the measure has been a success in terms of the environment and as a financial support to tillage farmers.  In 2021, it will pay out approximately &euro;8.5 million, with very strong support for the measure from applicants.  Eligible crops include: wheat, barley, oats, rye and oilseed rape.  The measure increases organic matter in soils, which will increase carbon sequestration, thereby reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but with added advantages of increasing water holding capacity and soil workability, while also returning nutrients to the soil.<\/p> <p>Payments are made at the rate of &euro;250 per hectare for those applicants who chop and incorporate oats, rye, wheat or barley, and oilseed rape is paid at the rate of &euro;150 per hectare.  The minimum application is 5 ha, with a maximum of 40 ha.  I believe in the long-term success of the straw incorporation measure and for that reason I have incorporated it into the CAP strategic plan as a permanent measure.  This will ensure that it will be available for at least the duration 2023-2027.  In the meantime, it will continue as a pilot measure in 2022.  The general feedback from advisers and farmers who participated in the pilot in 2021 is that they are very happy with it and most plan to reapply in 2022.  Tillage is a relatively low greenhouse gas emissions sector but, nonetheless, there is an increased awareness among tillage farmers of the need to improve soil and to play their part in reducing emissions overall.<\/p> <p>The measure also supports tillage farmers in making a change in their farm practice, which is positive in terms of greenhouse gas and soil improvement.  Therefore, it is imperative that farmers chop and incorporate the straw to achieve the numerous benefits and goals of the measure.  The ceiling of 40 ha was decided on to ensure that the measure is available to as many farmers as possible.  A farmer could earn up to &euro;10,000 under the measure.  Following on from the success of the scheme this year, I expect an increase in the number of applicants next year and I consider that an increase in the eligible hectare at this time is not warranted as data from applications indicates that the average farm size was less than 20 ha.  Furthermore, I believe any increase in the eligible maximum area per farm would limit the possibility for all applicants availing of the measure.  I need to remain conscious of that as well.  I want as many farmers as possible to have the opportunity to avail of this measure, without the need to impose rank and selection criteria if it is over-subscribed.<\/p> <p>The straw incorporation measure is an agri-environment and climate support targeted specifically at supporting tillage farmers in undertaking actions which will increase soil organic carbon levels and deliver reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Charlie McConalogue:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2319\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2319&amp;amp;pid=CharlieMcConalogue&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is not possible to open the measure to farmers who decide not to chop straw because one of the main purposes of the measure, which is to increase soil organic carbon levels, will not be achieved.

He said that there has been a pay-out of approximately &euro;8.5 million.  There will be &euro;10 million for this scheme in the budget.  Particular farmers in Tipperary are full-time tillage farmers who have quite sizable farms and see the opportunity, from an environmental point of view, and also certainty of payment relating to this scheme.  As the Minister knows, the past six or seven years have been challenging for tillage farmers.  Although this year has been good, that will not always be the case.  This scheme has been widely welcomed by the industry and by grain growers across the country.  The more people who can use it, the better.

I take the point he makes about wanting to ensure that all farmers who want to avail of the scheme can do so.  This is a reflection of how well it has been received and the value of it to farmers as well as the value from an environmental and emissions perspective.  It is a good initiative.  I am glad to be able to put the funding back in for 2022.  I will keep it under review.  I want to ensure that it is available to everyone, which is why the thresholds are there.  The average so far is 20 ha, but people who apply for 40 ha will get &euro;10,000, which is significant support to income.  It also puts a floor on the straw market to ensure that income is available.  We need to support tillage sector incomes.<\/p> <p>We need to have a safety valve too.  Last year, people could withdraw at any stage.  The safety valve was there to ensure that if straw started to get expensive, we expected to see farmers being able to sell it in order to keep the market right and to not see the price increase unnecessarily.  This is a type of scheme that makes sense in a year when yields are high and when there is a good supply of straw that can be used.  In years when things are tighter, it cab be used for other purposes.  The scheme needs to be flexible in order that it can be used to address any excess.<\/p> <p>I thank the Senator for raising this matter.

I welcome the Minister of State.  I know how passionate and compassionate she is regarding services for older people.  In this instance, we are talking about a specific service that is sad but needed.  Dame Cicely Saunders, who founded the hospice movement, said, \"You matter because you are you, and you matter to the end of your life.\"  Those words are important.  The hospice movement has given great dignity, respect and comfort to many at the ends of their lives, as well as to family members around them.<\/p> <p>In 2001, the national advisory committee on palliative care stressed the importance of every region having a hospice.  Sadly, there is one region that still does not have a hospice, namely, the midlands region of Laois, Offaly, Longford and Westmeath.  It has been described as a black spot.  In 2013, a joint study recommended that the hospice be on the campus of the hospital in Tullamore.<\/p> <p>There has been some movement.  Professor Humphrey O'Connor is the chair of the committee.  I have had a number of meetings with him and facilitated a meeting with the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, last April.  Since then, plans have been drawn up and a feasibility study was formally assessed.  These all agreed that Tullamore is the correct place for a hospice.  Planning, funding and so on need to be put in place.<\/p> <p>I referred to the Minister of State's passion and compassion at the start.  We need urgent action and intervention.  It is not acceptable to have a black spot for end-of-life and palliative care anywhere in our country.  While the region is fortunate to have a well-developed palliative care service in the community, with an aim to care appropriately for people at home for as long as possible, the provision of specialist palliative care and patient beds will facilitate hospital avoidance and support families in end-of-life care for their loved ones.  I know the tremendous service that St. Brigid's Hospice in the Curragh gives.  A friend and neighbour of mine, Paddy Curran, passed away a month ago.  I know the solace and support that the hospice gave to his wife and to all of his extended family and friends.<\/p> <p>Hospices are places that any of us ever wants to be in or see our loved ones in, but they are vital.  When the time comes and families in the midlands need to rely on these services in order to ensure that their loved ones are cared for with grace and dignity in the final period of their lives, this service is simply not there.  We need to ensure that we are providing patients and their loved ones with adequately funded and resourced end-of-life and palliative services.  These are already incredibly difficult and traumatic times for people.  It is not acceptable that we add to that suffering by not providing hospice care in the midlands.<\/p> <p>I hope that the update that the Minister of State is bringing us today will be a positive one from the Department and its officials.  I hope that we will be able to provide some certainty to those in the midland counties I mentioned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120100002#E00500","speaker":"1689"},{"type":"speech","time":1638354600,"counter":34,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this important issue about an update for the plans for a midlands hospice.  I thank her for the compassionate way in which she has dealt with it.  Her statement at the start, \"You matter because you are you, and you matter to the end of your life.\", reflects exactly what a hospice does.  The Government is strongly committed to the development of end-of-life services, which ensure the care and dignity of the dying person and the family are the focus.  The Government is working to guarantee equitable access to specialist palliative care services in every region of the country and to ensure that we meet the palliative care needs of all who require it, as our population grows and ages.<\/p> <p>In recent years there has been a significant increase in investment in palliative care services, with recent openings of new hospices in Mayo, Waterford and Wicklow.  Along with the extension of St. Brigid's Hospice in the Curragh, there will soon be 276 specialist inpatient palliative care beds available for those who need them.  Budget 2022 will provide for increased investment in palliative care services.  An additional &euro;2.4 million will be allocated for new service developments and &euro;10 million has been allocated as once-off funding for palliative and end-of-life services to progress national priorities.

It will also reflect increased demand for adult palliative care, the shift towards care in the community, the emphasis in Sl&aacute;intecare on addressing geographic variations in the provision of both community and hospital palliative care services and developments in international best practice.  It is expected to have the policy update published in 2022.<\/p><p>It is a commitment in the programme for Government to increase the number of specialist palliative care beds countrywide to ensure a hospice is serving every region of the country.  That was the Senator's exact point.  The Department of Health is actively engaging with the HSE to progress plans for the development of hospices planned for Drogheda, Cavan and the midlands.  The development of these three units will mean specialist palliative care services will be available in every region of the country.  It is recognised that the midlands is one of the three remaining regions without this specialist palliative care inpatient service in place.  However, there is continuing progress to develop a new specialist palliative care facility, co-located to the Midland Regional Hospital, Tullamore.  I noted the Senator said she met the Minister earlier in the year.<\/p><p>The HSE's palliative care services three-year development framework includes the development of a 15-bed specialist palliative care inpatient unit, or hospice, which will provide support to patients from across the four counties in the midlands.  Fundraising from Offaly Hospice Group has recently allowed for architects to carry out initial plans and a feasibility study at the co-located site.  The HSE has recently engaged with five hospice groups in the area, the Irish Hospice Foundation and Hooves 4 Hospice, to provide an update on progress regarding the midlands inpatient unit.  The development will require collective working towards a specialist inpatient palliative care service in the midlands.  HSE estates is developing a costed, timelined plan for the development to be ready by end of 2021, which is very short.  In line with the vision of palliative care in the programme for Government, Sl&aacute;intecare and HSE development framework for palliative care, this development aims to prioritise and protect the most vulnerable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120100002#E00600","speaker":"1614","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638354600,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her response.

We had this battle in Waterford for many years.  The friends of Waterford Hospice did phenomenal work and raised a significant amount of money over so many years.

However, for many vulnerable women, and indeed for migrant women, their only point of contact may be the home school liaison teacher, and that is in only schools that have delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS, status.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Fiona O'Loughlin:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2441\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2441&amp;amp;pid=FionaOLoughlin&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Every single school in the country should have a home school liaison teacher.

It is making everybody's job in school difficult.  The inspectors need to go back into the classroom to teach.  There are 200 inspectors.  They are experienced teachers, and they can bring a lot to schools, classrooms and staff rooms.  They need to be redeployed back into the classroom.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120100002#G00600","speaker":"1689","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638354600,"counter":47,"content":"<p>The Deputy Leader is welcome.  I call for a debate in the coming weeks on the winter plan that was agreed by the Cabinet and published in recent weeks.  Thanks to you, a Chathaoirligh, I raised it in a Commencement debate and at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health.  I refer to the situation in the Saolta University Health Care Group and the fact that no acute beds are being provided this winter under the winter plan, despite 205 beds being provided nationally and the fact that one in eight patients on trolleys in the eight-week period leading up to the publication of the plan were in Galway.  Despite that, no acute beds were provided.<\/p> <p>A related issue is the lack of carers.  We are not talking about hours or funding, we are talking about a physical lack of carers to do this very important work in the home care sector.  I received a response from community healthcare west stating that due to a shortage of healthcare support assistants, HCSAs, the HSE is currently challenged to cover the extra allocation of hours.  I had raised the case on behalf of the mother of a very worthy individual.  We often debate issues where the concern is a lack of funding but this is due to a lack of availability of staff.  The reply in this case is that the home support manager is making every effort to source HCSAs so that the full allocation can be delivered.  The HSE national office has approved an additional 54 whole-time equivalents for healthcare support assistants for community healthcare west.  As part of the winter plan, we need a debate on what the Government is doing to source carers to provide the very important work that they carry out in communities.  All families at some stage will need the additional supports provided by carers in the healthcare system.<\/p> <p>On another matter, I attended the health committee this morning, which addressed the issue of drugs.  We were told by the CityWide Drugs Crisis Campaign in Dublin that the mid-term review of the national drugs strategy is writing the community sector role out of the strategy.  At a meeting this Friday, the Department of Health intends to remove community and voluntary networks from their representative roles in the strategy and we were told that it will happen without review, rationale or discussion.  It is calling on the Government not to allow this to happen.  This is a matter of urgency.  At the committee I requested a meeting with the Minister for Health and his officials to explain why this is happening.  There must be a rationale for any major change in policy like this.  I ask that the Deputy Leader would write to the Minister of State with responsibility for the drugs strategy as a matter of urgency in advance of Friday's meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120100002#H00200","speaker":"1665"},{"type":"speech","time":1638354600,"counter":48,"content":"<p>I am a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport, as is my colleague, Senator Buttimer.  We have been speaking to the Coast Guard in recent meetings and a number of serious issues have arisen, some of which I have forwarded on to the Garda, and I will speak with them about more issues today.<\/p> <p>Caitr&iacute;ona Lucas, may she rest in peace, was lost in Kilkee.  There had been warnings around the time she was lost.  Several issues have been brought to our attention concerning Rescue 116 regarding a failure to act on warnings that were given.  Today, three issues must be dealt with immediately.  I ask that the Minister comes to this House this evening, tomorrow morning, tomorrow evening or Friday.  I do not care when it is, but he must know and take responsibility for the boat that is currently operating out of Howth.  The boat came from Kilkee to Howth and was refitted when it arrived in Howth.  I understand the engines that were fitted are considerably heavier than the ones that were originally designed for the boat, with the result that the stern of the boat was low in the water.  To rectify this, lead was put into the bow of the boat.  The boat is now operating without the certification to which it is entitled.  I am told by experts who operate in this area that, as we speak today, lives are at risk in Howth.  Each boat is fitted with two of everything: two radios, two GPS systems and two engines but there is only one isolation switch on the boat.  I understand the switch became faulty or was damaged on the boat in Howth, which meant that the boat itself had to be recovered and  I understand this is putting people's lives at risk.<\/p> <p>The third issue I want to put on the record today is the sea anchor that has been put into service.  The function of a sea anchor is to keep the boat head-on into the waves.  I understand that the sea anchor that is currently in use turns the boat broadside and all you need is a wave slightly higher than the width of the boat, and it will flip the boat over.  We have had serious accidents.  We could talk about them all day long, starting in Dingle with life jackets.  We know that the life jackets were withdrawn.<\/p> <p>I am putting on the record of the House today that there are three urgent issues that must be dealt with immediately.  Those boats must be inspected and if the issues that have been brought to my attention are factual, then the boats must be taken out of service and the crews must be stood down until a marine engineer certifies that they are suitable for use.  We need the Minister to come to the House because a plethora of other things has been brought to my attention in recent days.  These are volunteers putting their lives at risk.

Today is World AIDS Day and it is important that we mark the day in this Chamber, in particular the stigma that still surrounds HIV and AIDS.  When HIV and AIDS first emerged in the late 1980s it was a pandemic that was laden with both moral and social judgment.  I am somebody who grew up in the early 1990s in an area of Dublin that was very affected by HIV and AIDS and I believe that it is important to recognise how far we have come, particularly in terms of treatment.  If one does not have a viral load and the virus is undetectable then it is not transmissible.  We must also recognise that the provision of Covid healthcare means that there has been a drop in the number of people being diagnosed with HIV between 2018 to 2020.  Therefore, I ask people to get tested if they suspect they may have HIV.  It is an illness that one can live with.  One can have a long and healthy life as long as one can access the drugs that manage the virus.  On that latter point, it is important to recognise the discriminatory practices that are still in place in some countries.<\/p> <p>In terms of people travelling, we saw people lose their heads on Thursday and flights from South Africa were banned because that country was ahead in sequencing the new variant.  Somehow flights from a few countries in Africa to Europe have been banned so now it is worthwhile to ask the following question.  If the sequencing had been identified in a European country or another country would we have been as quick to ban flights from coming here?  It is important that we mark this matter.<\/p> <p>I want to raise the issue of the participants in community employment services who were outside this place yesterday.  In particular, I wish to refer to the shift from local employment services, a not-for-profit enterprise, to a tender system.  The Department needs to examine this matter again.  The tenders are meant to go out this month and the local employment services have a stay of execution that lasts 12 weeks.  The Department needs to shift its focus and what it considers to fully support local employment services and resource community employment schemes.  Unfortunately, the Department seems hell bent on pursuing a privatised approach.  This matter was discussed in the D&aacute;il last night and it is important that we have a discussion on the impact on local employment services this month before the tenders are published.  People in many communities around this city and around the country are extremely worried about the shift from a locally-based local employment service to a for-profit and per placement service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120100002#J00200","speaker":"1672"},{"type":"speech","time":1638354600,"counter":60,"content":"<p>I want to raise the issue of the mid-term review of the national drugs strategy, NDS.  There are four community voluntary networks and each of them is designated as a core constituent of the NDS.  They are all due to be removed from the oversight committee.  I think this is one part of what has been, for a number of years, an attempt to dismantle the community voice, dissent, agency and advocacy from all structures within that Department.  We say that there is no rationale to it but I feel having listened to people on the ground and in the community that this feels like people are being silenced and a pushing out of community involvement in decision-making.  It feels like there has been a concerted effort for many years, and one which seems to have been ramped up very recently, to pull decision-making back so centrally that people are not being empowered to make decisions within their own communities in terms of meeting their own needs.<\/p> <p>The aim of removing any kind of independent, questioning or dissenting voice within the community is extremely worrying.  That is especially so in a democracy where collective decision-making and input is a key component of who we are and what we do.  For me, as someone who comes from the community sector and still works very much in the community sector, I feel that we are the experts.  We bear the brunt.  We carry the history.  We know the knowledge.  We know what is needed.  We know what basic needs are not being met.  We feel the trauma.  We bury our loved ones.  We respond to the overdoses.  However, every single time that we look to involve ourselves in the key structures we are blocked at every move.  That is so wrong and worrying.  To be honest, it feels that in the past two Governments we have had Ministers who stood by and watched civil servants call all the shots that allowed this to happen.  I do not think that is okay.  If the civil servants want to run for politics to make those decisions then they should.  We need to be stronger, as Ministers, to push back, lead from the front and not be told what happens and how things will happen.  The community voice has been diluted so badly that people feel very disempowered and disengaged within their communities.  The more one disengages communities the worse the situation will get.<\/p> <p>We must be honest about this matter.  For many years I have made the effort to be diplomatic and not insult people but now I must set diplomacy aside to save lives and communities.

It is a fact that 58% of 25- to 34-year-olds in Ireland have a tertiary education qualification as against an EU average of 41%, and 53% of all of those aged between 25 and 64 years have a third level education qualification.  That means Ireland is the highest in the European Union in terms of the number of people who are graduates and, indeed, one of the highest in the world.  It is a fantastic achievement and something that we, as a nation, should be proud of.  In the past everyone said that tax was the reason that companies came to Ireland but part of the real reason is talent and Ireland is investing further in apprenticeship programmes.  Educational achievement is something about which we do not shout loudly enough.  Tied with all of that is the question of funding for higher education, which is an issue that I have raised on a number of occasions.  The Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, is on the record as saying that 2021 is the year in which the Cassells report will be addressed.

In this case, that is the family law complex in Dublin.

I have spoken many times about the subtle influence of money on the policy agendas of governments and international bodies, and the ideological activism that can be associated with that money.  As Senators know, within the United Nations, special rapporteurs are regularly appointed to look into particular countries or investigate a specific issue.  They are usually lawyers who are considered to be human rights experts and are appointed by the UN Human Rights Council.<\/p> <p>Earlier this year, the European Centre for Law and Justice, an established and respected NGO based in Strasbourg, published a report which showed some shocking practices in relation to special rapporteurs.  The report found that various private foundations, NGOs and, in some cases, governments are spending huge amounts of money to influence these rapporteurs and, in some cases, on recruiting them in the first place.  This violates both the letter and the spirit, I believe, of UN rules and anti-corruption legislation but the practice has been silently tolerated for years.<\/p> <p>I would like a debate on this with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney.  Between 2015 and 2019, 121 UN special rapporteurs were appointed, of whom 37 received payments totalling $11 million outside of any UN control from private foundations and NGOs, including the Ford Foundation, the Open Society Foundations of George Soros and other anonymous donors.  It is a matter of public record that the UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty was paid $600,000 by the Open Society Foundations in 2018 and 2019 through various grants, yet only declared $5,000 of that to the United Nations.  An Irish lawyer has held special rapporteur positions while concurrently being the chairperson of an Open Society Foundations project.<\/p> <p>The code of conduct which applies to special rapporteurs calls for \"objectivity and non-selectivity in the consideration of human rights issues, and the elimination of double standards and politicization.\"  There is a problem if special rapporteurs are receiving payments from organisations which hold particular views on the issues they are investigating and if they are funding political campaigns on that basis.

It was difficult for many families this morning to break the news to their children that they would have to wear masks in school.  We had an expert group which reported on ventilation in March.

The chair of the group, Professor John Wenger, said not enough has been done.  We need to ask some serious questions about why the work has not been carried out.  It is not suitable or necessary for every school but we all know school face financial barriers in providing these filters.  I have heard of schools where parents are buying the filters.<\/p> <p>HEPA filters reduce the number of particles in the air.  They are like gas masks and stop most particulate matter from circulating in the air.  Covid aside, they are relevant when we look to the future because we do not know what is coming.

I had a great discussion with Dearbhla Lawlor and Toby Long.  They are leaving certificate students and among the subjects they are studying are politics and society.  As part of their leaving certificate course, they undertook a research project to identify and analyse the social and political implications of an issue that affects society today.  The issue they chose to investigate and report on was LGBTQI and youth homelessness.  Their report is interesting and I will circulate it to all Members.  These young people are to be commended on their work.<\/p> <p>There were four main findings to the research.  LGBTQI young people experiencing homelessness fear violence, stigma and discrimination and this prevents them from accessing homelessness services.

Last month, there were 6,300 homeless people, of whom 2,500 were 18 years of age or younger, in other words, children.  However, there are no statistics that quantify LGBTQI.  The students also talked about the challenges and barriers that youth homelessness can present for LGBTQI young people in respect of their ability to engage in and complete education.

It is often said that people outside this House are ahead of the politicians.  These two young people certainly are.  They appreciate that their work will be circulated and considered.  They would also like, and I believe it is incumbent on everybody in the Opposition to do so, to stop the opposition to Housing for All and the State-led house-building programme being undertaken by this Government, which can lead us to the elimination of homelessness by 2030.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120100002#K00400","speaker":"1656"},{"type":"speech","time":1638354600,"counter":68,"content":"<p>There is a lot of focus in the media this morning, rightly, on the mica redress scheme and the sliding scale.  According to a Fine Gael Deputy on RT&Eacute; Radio 1 this morning, even the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, accepts it is a flawed scheme, despite the same Minister bringing it to Cabinet this week and announcing the details yesterday.  Make of that what you will.<\/p> <p>I call on the Minister to make a statement as to when we will see the report of the working group on latent defects.  This morning, families throughout Dublin are waking up in homes with Celtic tiger defects, such as fire safety issues and water ingress.  We were supposed to see a draft redress scheme in June this year in order that it could be considered in time to make proposals on its funding in the budget.  Here we are on 1 December and there is still no sign of the findings of that working group or of the draft scheme.  Fire safety defects and water ingress, just like mica, are a legacy of the light touch developer-led regulations we have seen from previous Governments.  People who bought their homes in good faith are either already significantly out of pocket or are living in substandard homes through no fault of their own.<\/p> <p>We need to urgently hear from the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage about when that working group will produce the draft redress scheme in order that we can ensure that families who are living with the legacy of Fianna F&aacute;il light touch self-regulation will be refunded and given the homes they deserve and have paid for.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120100002#L00100","speaker":"1635"},{"type":"speech","time":1638354600,"counter":69,"content":"<p>I join my colleague, Senator Malcolm Byrne, in calling for the full implementation of the Irish Sign Language Act and the introduction of Irish Sign Language as a second-level subject. Senator Fitzpatrick was able to give us a lovely presentation on one of the reports done by her constituents who are studying politics and society, which was not available when I did my leaving certificate.  We need to move with the times and having the Irish Sign Language as a key subject in the leaving certificate should be made a priority by the Department of Education.<\/p> <p>I also join with colleagues in this House - Senators Horkan and Dooley raised this issue and I raised it previously - in asking for a dedicated transport police.  Our colleague in the Lower House, Deputy Alan Farrell, witnessed a group chanting \"Let's rape her\" at a woman on the DART.  He has also managed to get statistics indicating that since January, up to &euro;500,000 worth of damage has been done to DART trains.  We all know of, and have heard anecdotal stories and witnessed, so much antisocial behaviour and violence on the DART and Luas that a dedicated transport police is required.  At one stage, we saw a lot of conductors on buses, when we did not have the Luas, and they were a major deterrent to people acting in an antisocial manner.  Perhaps, introducing Luas conductors in some sort of official capacity would be an appropriate first step.<\/p> <p>I congratulate Barbados on becoming a republic yesterday. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120100002#L00200","speaker":"1630"},{"type":"speech","time":1638354600,"counter":70,"content":"<p>Today is World AIDS Day.  We must as a country, collectively and individually, continue to remove the stigma associated with HIV and AIDS.  We must also do so in the world of sport, where a parallel exercise is necessary.  I ask for a debate in this House, and with the Government, on the criteria used in the selection of host countries for major sporting events, such as the Olympics and FIFA World Cup.  It is time we stopped rewarding countries that continue to deny human rights and where members of the LGBTQ+ community continue to live in fear.  That must no longer be allowed to continue.  It is also important that an audit is carried out of the records of human rights abuses in countries selected to host major international events.  It is now time we stop rewarding and elevating countries that have a poor human rights record and continue to discriminate against LGBTQ+ people.  It is not right.  It is wrong and we must stand up against it and stand up to those countries that are not living up to their human rights values.<\/p> <p>We are watching games in Qatar, Russia and Beijing.  Do any of us in this House watch those events and say, \"What if?\"  Tom Daley and other Olympians led the charge this week.  What is our collective role and collective view?  I hope that today, this House sends a message to the Government, to governments around the world and to sporting organisations that it is time they stop discrimination and stop rewarding the denial of human rights.<\/p> <p>Sport has led against apartheid.  We have role models who are hugely important.  We must send out a positive message to our role models about human rights.  I ask for a debate on this issue because it is high time that we as a House stood up and were counted and that our Government, our Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media and our sporting organisation led the way.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120100002#L00300","speaker":"1637"},{"type":"speech","time":1638354600,"counter":71,"content":"<p>I will speak about the new scheme put in place by the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, yesterday.  I strongly wish to put on record how much I welcome this new scheme.  It affects the Deputy Leader's county as well as mine.  There has been an awful lot of confusion overnight.  I wonder how much of the &euro;200,000 Sinn F&eacute;in raised at a golf event in the US over the past number of days has been used by it on social media overnight to confuse the people of Donegal and Mayo about the scheme.<\/p> <p>It is very important that people realise an independent organisation has to set the rates of redress.  It is not the job of the Government to do so.  It has to be guided by an independent broker, which in this case is the surveyors of Ireland.  It is they who are setting the rate.  The rate we are working off currently is based on the 2020 market.  This does not reflect the massive inflation in building prices during 2021 but the new price surveyors will set in February next year will reflect on the inflation we have had in prices and products.  We cannot come out and say what that rate will be because the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, SCSI, has to announce it in February, but we are very confident that quite a significant increase will have to take place to reflect the market increase over this past year.  On that basis, we are very confident of looking after all the homeowners in Donegal with 100% redress.<\/p> <p>There is a job to do for us all in government to ensure that every homeowner is looked after because, as we know, at the end of the day this issue goes beyond Donegal and Mayo.  Other counties are being looked at, such as Tipperary, Clare, Sligo and others.  The Minister is also in the process of dealing with those apartments that have fire defects.  I have no doubt he will come to the House with a similarly good scheme in turn.  I am delighted with the scheme and very glad to back it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120100002#L00400","speaker":"1633"},{"type":"speech","time":1638354600,"counter":72,"content":"<p>It is unbelievable that at this stage, after the past almost two years, we have such a crisis in the hospitality sector.  I experienced a notable increase in phone calls and emails from people in the hotel and restaurant sector, especially on Monday and Tuesday.  To say the sector is in a tailspin at present is nearly an understatement.  Staff in one local hotel told me that they had a 75% cancellation rate in the run-up to Christmas.  Another local restaurant has a rate of 64%.  It can be assumed that a cancellation rate of well over 50%, and right up to 80%, is taking place.<\/p> <p>I accept that this is about people making their own decisions.  We should remember and, hopefully, we can say today, and the Leader will echo what I am saying in her response, that there is nothing against family and friends going out for a meal in a hotel or restaurant.  There is nothing wrong in going out to a pub for a drink.  We need to support the hospitality sector.  Even the Chief Medical Officer has not said it is not safe.  It is quite clear that Christmas parties as normal will not take place because businesses and others are deciding they will not have the traditional Christmas party, but I have been told by some of those working in the most outstanding businesses in my locality that they will close if this continues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120100002#L00500","speaker":"1674"}]
