I am joined by: Dr. O'Neill, the president of the association, who is a principal dental surgeon employed by the HSE; Dr. Robins, chair of our general practice committee and a Carlow-based practice owner who holds a medical card contract; and Dr. McAllister, our president-elect and a Dublin-based general practice dentist.  We are delighted to appear before the committee and we welcome the members' interest in the concerns we have raised on behalf of dentists and patients over many years.<\/p> <p>  I propose to offer a brief explanation of the original scheme and the medical card scheme today, the difficulties which have prevented resolution of problems with the scheme, the possible options we see for reform of the scheme, and the priorities and approach we believe should be adopted as a matter of urgency.<\/p> <p>  Everybody accepts and, I hope, understands that oral health is an integral part of good general health.  Difficulty in accessing dental care is recognised internationally as contributing to poorer oral health for lower income groups due to the high cost of delivery of dental care.  In Ireland, the medical card scheme was originally designed under the legislation to provide basic dental care to those who met the income threshold provided for in the Health Act 1970 and subsequent legislation.  The only other State supports to patients in accessing dental care are within the PRSI dental scheme, which subsidises dental examinations and a scale and polish, and tax rebates under the Med 2 scheme, which refunds advanced care for those who can afford to pay for treatment.<\/p><p>In the appendices, we explain the significant differences that exist as regards the operation of the schemes for medical card patients in medical and dental care and the disparity in financial supports provided to doctors and dentists treating the same cohort of patients.  <br\/><br\/>I have also mentioned a very recent American study that shows the impact of the lack of priority afforded to oral health within primary care on the growth of inequities within different income groups.  That is very true in Ireland as well.  The Primary Care Collaborative, PCC, study, as it is known, is worthy of closer study.  It states:<\/p><blockquote>\tOral conditions impact the body in myriad ways, and oral disease has been associated with worse outcomes across multiple health conditions and organ systems.  The chronic inflammation associated with periodontal disease has been associated with worsened glycemic control among people with diabetes as well as increased risk of preterm birth.  Older adults with missing teeth have worse nutrition and are more likely to have nutrient deficiencies.  Poor oral health among people admitted to the hospital increases the risk of pneumonia. More importantly, the impact of poor oral health cannot be understood exclusively through potential association with other health conditions.  Even without harmfully affecting other health conditions oral health problems can cause pain, discomfort and, in some cases, even death.  Poor oral health impacts can also have an effect on employment prospects and an individual's self-confidence among many other economic, mental and social problems.  All these problems are more tragic because dental disease is almost entirely preventable.   <\/blockquote><p>Historical differences in how oral healthcare is delivered and paid for have led to even larger inequities in oral health access and outcomes as compared to the rest of the healthcare system, according to the PCC study.  That is very true in Ireland and elsewhere.  The pre-existing gap in access to dental care based on income disparities has only served to widen in Ireland in the past few years.  The current crisis in the medical card scheme is seeing an acceleration in the health divide between those who can and those who cannot afford to visit the dentist.  The current scheme was introduced in 1994 and initially offered access to basic dental care for all those who had a medical card.  It provided access to a dental examination, any fillings or extractions required, limited access to root canal treatment for front teeth and access to basic dentures.  In essence, it provided reasonable access at the time to restore and maintain dental health.<br\/><br\/>Private dentists hold individual contracts with the HSE to provide care to eligible patients.  Patients are entitled to be cared for and treated by any dentist holding a dental treatment services scheme, DTSS, contract.  In 2010, 11 years ago, the HSE imposed unilateral cuts to the scheme to reduce expenditure.  Those cuts were implemented without consulting the association, dentists or patients, despite the contract having an agreed committee to enable such consultations.  Those cuts fundamentally altered the scheme from a demand-led scheme to a budget-led scheme.  This was done by removing access for many patients to treatments under the scheme.  It restricted access for the majority of patients to one examination annually, a maximum of two fillings irrespective of circumstances and access to as many extractions as are required.  It no longer supports the oral health of medical card holders; rather it enables them to lose their teeth and to rely on dentures.  Only those who have a significant medical condition from a narrow, prescribed range are enabled to access more treatment of items on application.<br\/><br\/>The net effect is that any adult over the age of 16 can no longer access the dental care he or she requires to maintain dental health.  In my document, I outline the treatments available prior to 2010 and those currently available.  Biannual scale and polish, gum cleaning and periodontal treatment have been suspended, fillings are now restricted to two per annum and root canal treatment, dentures and denture repairs are all only available in emergency circumstances.  An unlimited number of extractions are still allowed.<br\/><br\/>For the patient, it means a lifetime of embarrassment, decreased nutrition and loss of well-being.  The association, as a party to the original agreement, has advocated on behalf of our members, and the patients who attend them, for many years.  It is our view, and the expressed view of our members who are the dentists operating the scheme on a daily basis, that the State scheme for approximately 1.5 million eligible medical card patients is in crisis and on the brink of collapse.<\/p><p>The past year has seen an unprecedented number of dentists withdraw from the medical card scheme with serious repercussions for patients across the country.  Total spending on the scheme fell from more than &euro;63 million in 2017 to barely &euro;40 million last year.  The implication of this is that large numbers of patients are no longer accessing treatment as the scheme is a fee-per-item structure.  A detailed breakdown of the impact of the cuts in spending on patient attendances by HSE community healthcare organisation, CHO, region, and an illustration of the reduced number of dental treatment services scheme, DTSS, contracts held by dentists by CHO region, has also been supplied to the committee.<\/p><p> The current sets of fees paid to dentists are in place since 2010 when fees were reduced under the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, legislation.  Any changes to fees require a decision by the Department of Health.  There has been no review in the intervening period and no reversal of the cuts imposed.  None of the items currently provided are economically viable in terms of the costs incurred by dentists caring for patients.  Many of those treatments are no longer in line with modern best practice dental care.  My colleagues will be happy to expand on that.<\/p><p> Last week, the committee heard from the HSE, which said that in a typical year just over 30% of the eligible population receive treatment through the scheme.  Last year, the HSE said it fell to barely 22%, mainly due to the Covid-19 pandemic.  The number of claims has fallen dramatically in the past number of years.  In 2019, there were more than 1 million and, in 2020, there were less than 800,000.  The number of contracts held by dentists nationwide fell by more than 30% between 2015 and 2020, from a figure of 1,847 to below 1,200.  We believe that the current figures are significantly overstated due to many inactive contracts.<\/p><p> The fundamental changes in the structure of the scheme and the reduced number of participating dentists have had very significant impacts for patients.  They are experiencing delays seeking treatment due to the reduced number of dentists participating and delays in accessing treatment while administrative decisions on whether to fund additional care are made.  Patients are looking at increased travel time seeking treatment and in some cases are relying on the already underfunded public dental service to provide care in areas where DTSS contracts are particularly scarce.<\/p><p> What we are seeing, therefore, is an unprecedented crisis in dentistry and access to dental care for the most vulnerable of patients.  In 2020, almost a quarter of participating dentists nationwide left the scheme.  We see the scheme as no longer viable and that is the decision at which those dentists have also arrived.  They simply cannot afford to continue to participate and this is leading to complete chaos.  In the footnote to my statement, I mention the fact that the last straw for many dentists was when they were promised personal protective equipment, PPE, within seven days by the then Minister for Health last June and it still has not materialised.  Many dentists said that was the last straw and it led them to resign.<\/p><p> The withdrawal of dentists is also affecting services provided by the HSE's own dental services, which are now faced with adult patients presenting when those same public services have seen a 24% reduction in staff at a time there has been a 20% increase in the number of eligible children seeking care from the HSE service.  All these impacts are without considering the substantial impact of Covid-19 in providing dental care.<\/p><p> Not surprisingly, our members continue to voice their anger and disillusionment with the Government's lack of action on the matter.  We have sought to engage with the Department of Health to redevelop the scheme over many years to no avail.  Many of our members believe now that the refusal to acknowledge the reality of the crisis within the scheme and the general approach of the Department suggests a level of disrespect, if not contempt, for the profession, the importance of dental and oral health and the patients who rely on this scheme.  It also shows scant regard or understanding of the impact of this crisis on vulnerable patients who are unable to afford access to a service that was defined as essential by the Government during the Covid-19 crisis.<\/p><p> Significant additional costs incurred by general dental practices during the pandemic have raised the costs of providing care to patients and have made the existing DTSS contracts completely unviable.  Dentists want to be able to provide care for all patients but the Government is leaving them with little choice but to minimise their involvement or withdraw from this scheme.<\/p><p>The Irish Dental Association is the representative body for all dentists and was party to the negotiations which culminated in the introduction of the scheme in 1994.  The need for redevelopment of the scheme has been long recognised.  Negotiations on a revised scheme were abandoned 14 years ago, in 2007, when the then Department of Health and Children withdrew from the negotiations citing concerns about the role of the association having regard to competition law.  We do not accept that there is any impediment to our participation in collective bargaining with the Department of Health and we have corresponded on and discussed this with the Department over a long period.  In order to overcome any concerns on this issue, as recently as November we presented a modified version of the so-called framework agreement which was concluded in 2014 by the Department of Health and the Irish Medical Organisation, which represents doctors in general practice treating the same cohort of patients, to reflect the specific role of the Irish Dental Association in representing general dental practitioners.  To date, we have not received a response to those proposals.<\/p><p> We stand ready to negotiate with the Department of Health.  We successfully negotiated with the former Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection in recent years on the extension of the PRSI dental scheme to eligible self-employed persons and the restoration of scale and polish entitlement in 2017.  We are confident that we can engage constructively with the Department of Health if the threat of criminal sanction against the association is removed.  The association is committed to promoting independent practice and has provided the committee with a copy of our independent practice policy paper, published as late as 2019.  We recognise the need for support from the State in allowing low income and marginalised groups access to dental care within the context of promoting independent dental practice.  However, the legitimacy and role of the association as the sole representative body for the dental profession must be recognised and secured within an appropriate framework agreement.<\/p><p> As the representative body, the Irish Dental Association believes that the priority in addressing the current crisis should be on ensuring proper access to dental care for those who face the greatest difficulty in meeting the cost of treatment.  Any arrangement has to be economically viable for dentists and cannot have an administrative burden which delays patient care.  There also must be clarity as regards care pathways for eligible patients.  Patients or dentists should not be put in the position whereby they have to barter about the care to be provided.<\/p><p> We believe that a new approach is required to address the need to restore access to dental care for low income groups rather than more of the same with a failed model, as exemplified by the current system.  We believe new models of access need to be examined, including a combination of some, or all, of the following approaches: application of a co-payment system similar to that used with the PRSI dental scheme; the use of use-it-or-lose-it vouchers funded by the State to encourage greater attendance of patients for dental examinations and, possibly, other preventative treatments of which there are examples in many countries; and expansion of the Med 2 tax relief scheme.<\/p><p> It was indicated by Department of Health representatives appearing before this committee last week that they favoured an interim solution prior to commencement of a root and branch review of the DTSS.  Our members have been very clear in voicing the opinion that applying a shot of adrenaline to the current scheme is not an acceptable solution.  It has been long accepted that a new dental scheme is required.  We cannot wait for the pandemic to be over before comprehensive discussions commence.  We are available to engage in discussions which, within an agreement timeframe, will produce an agreed long-term solution to the current crisis, but equally on the basis that any short-term interim solutions are credible and consistent with the principles outlined within this document and have a finite lifespan.<\/p><p> The legitimacy and role of the Irish Dental Association must be recognised and secured.  Ultimately, we believe that the following principles must apply to any scheme or approach developed by the State.  There must be a time limited review of any new arrangements.  The complementary role of the public dental service must be recognised.  There must be clear referral pathways agreed and adequately resourced within the public dental service.  There needs to be clarity around the scope of treatment coverage for patients and dentists.  Any changes in the scope of treatment must be reviewed regularly.  It is vital that there is clarity as regards the State's responsibility to provide care to eligible patients where elements of a treatment plan are not covered.  Any obligation resting on general dental practitioners and funded by the State must be clearly enunciated.<\/p><p>A demand-led approach cannot operate in tandem with caps on funding.  Agreement must be reached on the maximum number of eligible patients any dentists can be required to care for and treat in any scheme.  Bureaucratic overload must be avoided.  The autonomy of dentists and dental practices must be recognised by the State along with the imperative of dental practices to secure the viability of their business.  Professional fees must be structured in an economically viable manner, having regard to the operating costs incurred by dentists and with provision for regular review on an agreed basis.  Unilateralism on the part of the State is not compatible with a collaborative approach to working with the profession.  Finally, structured dialogue in any forums attended by State agencies and the IDA must be enabled along with agreed dispute resolution, grievance and disciplinary provisions.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for its interest.

It does not work in co-operation with the medical card scheme, which is a fully funded scheme.  The decision to provide root canal treatments for front teeth only was taken in the context of where we were back in 1994.  The DTSS was the first structured contracted care scheme for adult medical card holders.  It was designed to provide access to treatment on a national basis, which had not previously been available.  It tried to fill the gap between the <i>ad hoc<\/i>arrangements different health boards had in place, which shows how long ago this was, and where the patients were at the time.  A new scheme is now needed because this one was developed in the context of people having little or no access to routine care.  It developed and provided funded access to routine care for people back in the 1990s but, unfortunately, it has not kept up to date with dental science or with what is envisaged in current schemes.  It would be remiss of me not to mention the oral health policy because it talks about embedding the principles of prevention in the scheme.  These have been embedded in the children's services since the 1990s but there is no way to embed them in the current scheme.  A new scheme needs to be developed, which will be appropriate for adult medical card holders who are, by definition, the vulnerable in our society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021040800002#G01500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Anne O'Neill","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1617836400,"counter":40,"content":"<p>Deputy Durkan has come to the end of his time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021040800002#H00200","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speech","time":1617836400,"counter":41,"content":"<p>Senator Conway also wishes to come in.

In the health services generally, a great deal of catch-up care will be needed, given that a considerable amount of non-essential care was paused.  In dental and orthodontic services in the public system, there was a pause for a significant number of months.  The figure for the number of appointments from March to the end of May in 2019 was 45,924.  For the same dates in 2020, the figure was 3,161.

The easiest way to consider this matter is by mapping the patient journey.  While I can appreciate the numbers of practitioners within the dental treatment services, DTS, scheme is one of the trends to consider, a second trend is the amount of resources that are available in the geographical areas.  While someone may have a contract, we have staff who have not yet been able to resume services because of Covid and there are additional difficulties with pregnant women past certain ages participating in care.  People are also more mindful of their own general health in light of the impact of Covid, but the problems with the DTS scheme do not have their origins in Covid.  Covid could be called the nail in the coffin, though.<\/p> <p>  Consider the journey a patient now takes.  We will talk about the child, given the need for general anaesthetic care was referenced.  Unfortunately, general anaesthetic care requires hospital facilities, meaning the dental patient is automatically in competition for access to the same resources that provide treatment to scoliosis and cardiac care patients.  The dental patients are coming from the underfunded child service and hit the DTS service at the age of 16.  They are not able to access the number of fillings that will allow them to reach what a dentist would consider a state of health.  While the preference would of course be not to need fillings, if patients cannot access the number of fillings they require to bring them to a stable oral health status, they will end up losing those teeth earlier than is desirable.  One of the differences between our current policy and the previous policy, which was the dental health action plan, was that the latter set health targets for people whereas the new policy talks about access to care.  Access is an issue, but without having both in the same concept, it will be difficult to ensure there is sufficient resourcing for patients to be able to get the level of care they need.<\/p> <p>  The appointment numbers during the pandemic the Deputy mentioned fit into our general understanding of the resource difficulties the entire system is facing.<\/p><p>There is no doubt about it; orthodontic waiting lists have historically always been long, and because the treatment plans are long, orthodontists tend to take batches of patients from the waiting list from time to time.  It is a two-year treatment plan.  More patients are interested in having orthodontic treatment than ever before so they are more interested in being put on a waiting list and will wait for their treatment time because it is an expensive treatment.  The orthodontic waiting list is not limited to those with or without resources.  It is made up of children of clinical need and it covers all of our child population.  The difficulty Covid has put on us is on top of an already under-resourced system.

Sometimes it is not just a simple case of putting a filling in a tooth as opposed to taking a tooth out.  Sometimes one might be faced with trying to save the tooth.  I know people are interested in keeping their front teeth but they actually use all their back teeth for function.  There is a cost involved and that is where the medical card fails because it is cheaper to take out a tooth than to do the correct procedure, which would be to maintain the tooth for health and provide a root canal treatment.  That is the difference.<\/p> <p>  As regards the price difference between fillings and extractions done privately, they are all of a similar price but most people who could have a filling would opt for a filling as opposed to an extraction, whereas most people who are opting for an extraction in a private setting would be given the option of saving the tooth.  The inequity of the medical card scheme is people cannot even do that.  Young people are losing teeth very early on and it is a wholly unequal system.  It goes against everything dentists are trained to do.  We are trained to provide the best care and the best preventative care and the medical card does not allow us to do that.  It allows dentists to be destructive and land people in situations where, while they may be relieved of pain, they are landed in difficulty because they have difficulty chewing, particularly if they have had multiple extractions which is, unfortunately, very common.  Then the dentist cannot provide something to replace the teeth because people can only have dentures in an emergency situation.  That is what it is about.

Members heard from Dr. O'Neill that where children are not seen at an early stage, it has an impact on their oral health for years to come.  It is then compounded for 16-year-olds.  The divide that is there between those who can and cannot afford dental care widens remarkably after the age of 16 because of the limits in the medical card scheme that are not there if one goes to see a dentist privately.  That only serves to widen that divide.  Up to the age of 16, there is, in theory, the possibility that all children will have the same opportunity to access screening via the schools system.  One of the concerns we have is that what is being proposed in the new oral health strategy will dilute that equity of screening within the schools service.

I would like to hear, from whoever wants to make a contribution, where that document is and whether they have heard about it being progressed in any way.  In the document, a number of items were outlined as possible areas on which to make progress.  One of them was orthodontic provision, which I think we can all agree is of particular concern at the moment.  It was suggested that orthodontic patient treatment could be delivered in primary care to a certain level.  Has there been any progress on that?  What training would be required for a primary care dentist in an average practice to enable him or her to provide the first steps of orthodontic care?  Would that be a way of reducing waiting lists?<\/p> <p>  There was a suggestion that auxiliary staff, that is, technicians and nurses, could be utilised and could broaden their remit.

Mr. Hourihan has accurately described the issues with orthodontic provision.  As things stand, free orthodontic care is provided only to children who have very specific clinical needs.  The nature of those clinical needs means that they can only be provided for by people who have what is known as the masters in orthodontics, MOrth, or its equivalent, and are entitled to be included on the orthodontic specialist register of the Dental Council.  While a certain level of orthodontic intervention might be possible in a primary care setting, it will do nothing for the waiting lists that are the subject of so much interest and tend to be the basis of the conversations members would have with people in their jurisdictions.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of auxiliaries, there was an announcement last week by the Department regarding a waiting list initiative.  I understand my HSE colleagues have made representations for funding for auxiliaries to be included in the skills mix of people available to provide specialist orthodontic care.  That may alleviate some of the stress and strain on orthodontic provision.  However, the supporting services that are needed for children to be able to access fillings or extractions as part of an orthodontic care plan are not currently in position.

Children are losing permanent teeth as part of our school age ranges because we do not have the resources for that type of timely intervention.  More than one speaker this afternoon has mentioned that early intervention will reduce long-term costs.  The DTSS is probably at the level now where only emergency care is being provided because of the resource implications.  Many areas around the country are finding it difficult to do the staged interventions at appropriate age ranges that have been identified as part of the keystones set out in Smile agus Sl&aacute;inte.

It tends to look at bundles of care.  From a dental public health perspective, the patients who I know and provide care for rarely fit into a tick-box scenario.  It does not seem to have considered the interfaces between contracted care and support care for people who do not fit into that model.<\/p> <p>  With Covid and its stresses and strains on the system, contracted care reduces availability.  If we go to a fully contracted childcare service for dental, one will find some areas where there are not sufficient resources available to provide it because there are just not enough dentists in the system.  One of my colleagues this week said that they were looking for an associate to join an established practice but they could not find anybody.  Dentists are busy.

It was never explained to us what an alternative approach might be.  As I said, and Deputy Shortall is well aware, this problem persisted with the Irish Medical Organisation up to 2014 when a solution was found.  Before that, I had been raising the same issues on behalf of dentists and I had been told that whatever happened with doctors, because they knew they would have to resolve it, would apply to dentists pretty much automatically.  Seven years on, that has not been the case.  There is a solution there and I have no clear sense as to why they cannot simply do that.  I have done all the work for them.  I had adapted the 2014 framework agreement and presented it to them, and still I am waiting for an answer.  I do not think there is an alternative.  I do not think that any scheme would succeed without the implicit, and, indeed, explicit support of the Irish Dental Association.

I do not think any patient sitting in my chair wants to be looked after by a dentist who has not kept up with the science and the evolution of materials.  For example, in 2018 we passed the Minamata legislation in the reduction of amalgam waste in the environment.  That means I am not legally allowed to place an amalgam filling in a pregnant patient who presents to me, yet my contract only allows me to place amalgam fillings in back teeth.  Among the budgetary items removed in 2010 was the A6 dressing or temporary filling.  I cannot even place a temporary filling.  That means I am stuck and all I can offer that patient is an extraction.  That returns to the point we are making that if a tooth is removed, that means the problem is gone and no more money needs to be spent on it.

We have issues arising out of the frequency of sugar intake.  It tends to be the hard tissue basis for increasing rates of dental disease.  The widespread consumption of sugary drinks represents a significant issue.  There is some concern about the reduction in calcium sources for girls of certain ages, which then has implications for osteoporosis in later years because, depending on what the commonplace trends tend to be, taking dairy or wheat out alters the food basis.<\/p> <p>  With regard to reductions that positively impact on dental health, we are looking at the model of three meals and two snacks as being positive whereas the grazing model, ready access to foods and secondary school students having money to buy snacks on the way home impact negatively on oral health.  The Senator spoke about the under-resourcing of the school screening system.  The difficulty that imposes is that 16-year-olds who have not been able to access a comprehensive treatment plan are arriving into the adult medical card scheme.  They may come in with two or three cavities that need to be managed but will only be funded for two so they are automatically starting at a downward point.  We have looked at trends.  The HSE has funded and participated in epidemiological studies.  Nearly all of them show that 12- to 15-year-olds who get that extra independence and a bit more freedom in what they are able to purchase on their own behalf tend to have a higher level of decay starting to arrive because they are no longer under the same degree of parental control.  The ready access to sugar-based foods and sugary drinks is still contributing significantly to decay rates.  A lot of work can be done in influencing positive habits during the school ranges but it needs that timed intervention over longer periods so that children are supported in learning good habits.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021040800002#U00100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Anne O'Neill"},{"type":"speech","time":1617836400,"counter":127,"content":"<p>Do I have time for a final question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021040800002#U00200","speaker":"1665"},{"type":"speech","time":1617836400,"counter":128,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021040800002#U00300","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speech","time":1617836400,"counter":129,"content":"<p>The witnesses spoke about the administrative burden.

It will be pretty straightforward for the patient but the dentist faces a number of obstacles.  As was explained, there will be some presentations where the dentist will say that a patient needs a particular treatment or a certain treatment is recommended, but he or she needs to get what is known as prior approval or permission from the HSE dental team and must supply a lot of documentation to support it.  That is not something which applies ordinarily.  The administrative difficulties tend to be in the context of form-filling and claims that are submitted for payment, rejected and then appealed.  There is a strong sense of unnecessary bureaucratic overload with the scheme, which is one of the reasons we think that an entirely new approach is required.

If a private patient has a problem, we can talk about what needs to be done and get on with it straight away.  If a patient with a medical card has a problem, the first thing I need to do is go to my computer and go to the relevant part of the health checker to see if I can actually do that filling on the patient because if he or she has had that filling done here or elsewhere within the past five years, I am not entitled to do that filling for him or her.<\/p><p>If the patient will not pay for it I am then faced with telling the patient \"I am very sorry, you are not going to pay for it so I now have to send for approval, so that is a bit of a wasted appointment for you.

If I am filling in forms at the end and I go to claim a tooth extraction, and if I get told on the form that the tooth had previously been extracted, which can happen through a charting mismatch, I must write to the chief dental officer with all of the X-rays and the patient's files to ask the HSE to alter its file at the central hub, and then wait for that to get recognised at the primary care reimbursement service, PCRS.

This is especially relevant if a person is in a lot of pain yet a dentist cannot follow through on that treatment.  We are particularly interested in the numbers of dentists who have actually left the scheme.  The last report we received from the HSE referred to 199 dentists but I am aware that figures as high as 240 are quoted in the media.   The witnesses spoke of looking at a map and seeing black spots and gaps in services.  There are a number of charts included in the presentations and if we have the time I would like to go through them.  If one considers the decrease in spending, the CHO 6 area has the highest decrease in spending of 41%, along with areas such as Clare, Mayo and Dublin West, right across the coastline.  One of the questions we asked the HSE was whether it was a rural or urban issue.

The difficulty dentistry often has is that it must beat everybody else to the post to gain the high level of priority needed for the available funding.
