Occasionally, some people may feel unwell and faint after getting their injection.  To prevent this, they should sit down and rest for 15 minutes after the vaccination.

In the consultant category there has been an increase of over 600 whole time equivalents in the past five years, while for nurses and midwives the figure is over 3,500. <\/p>  <p>  This incremental growth in frontline staffing numbers is ongoing, and in the 12-month period to end October 2019, there continued to be increases with circa 150 additional consultants and 650 extra nurses and midwives. <\/p>  <p>  Regarding consultants, the recommendations of the 2017 Sl&aacute;intecare Report re-orientates the Irish health system towards one that prioritises fair and equal access to consultant led care for all patients. My Department recently published the de Buitl&eacute;ir report, following the establishment of a Group to examine how to give effect to the Sl&aacute;intecare recommendation on the removal of private practice from the public hospital system.  The recommendations of this report provide the pathway to deliver on the Sl&aacute;intecare vision of a consultant delivered model of care and addressing issues with regard to safe staffing levels. <\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare.  In this regard, my Department, together with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the HSE, recently met with both the IMO and the IHCA, and will be seeking to continue to engage with both bodies on Sl&aacute;intecare and the de Buitl&eacute;ir report.  As the Taoiseach outlined recently to the House, progress is being made between my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of An Taoiseach on the approach to implement the de Buitl&eacute;ir recommendations.

In a recent press release, the Irish College of General Practitioners stated it had received the highest ever number of applications for its 2020 GP training programme. <\/p>  <p>  I am confident that the measures outlined in the Agreement with GPs on contractual reform and service developments will make general practice more sustainable and a more attractive career option for doctors, thus increasing GP capacity and helping to ensure that all patients have access to GP services.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the availability of GP services in Carlow and Kilkenny, as this is an operational issue I have asked the HSE to reply to the directly to the Deputy in relation to this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112600057#WRB06700","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Emergency Departments Waiting Times","counter":120,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112600057#WRB06800"},{"type":"question","counter":121,"qnumday":85,"qnumall":"[48771\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112600057#WRB06900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason to date in 2019 more than 1,640 persons over 75 years of age have endured emergency department wait times of more than 24 hours at University Hospital Limerick.","asker":"1221","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":122,"content":"<p>Figures provided by the HSE show that for the first ten months of 2019, the number of patients attending University Hospital Limerick decreased by 1.1% and the number of attendances of patients over the age of 75 decreased by 1.5% compared to the same period in 2018.

The balance of payments is a complex accounting system which summarises economic transactions between Ireland and the rest of the world in a specific time period.  The compilation of the balance of payments is based primarily on enterprise surveys.  The framework includes also actual data and estimates of flows between resident and non-residents in the household, government, and non-profit institutions sectors.<\/p><p>In this context, workers&rsquo; remittances are all transfers between Irish resident households and non-resident households.  A household is considered to be Irish resident if they have been present for one year or more in Ireland. <\/p><p>Remittance information is difficult to compile for National Statistics Offices and is usually based on administrative sources and modelling rather than direct collection.  The current CSO data are estimated using Revenue data.  Pay of non-national workers is used to estimate disposable income and to derive a remittance amount.  The approach using indirect data sources is recognised as a standard approach in the IMF Guide for Compilers and Users of International Transactions in Remittances.  The CSO is currently investigating new approaches to deriving remittance information.<\/p><p>The CSO currently makes no estimate for remittances made to Irish resident households from non-resident households.  This is because: firstly, sources from which to compile such estimates are not readily available; secondly, it is believed that where such remittances are made, they are small in the context of the balance of payments and therefore there is not a pressing requirement to impute a value for them. <\/p><p>Data on remittances are published by Eurostat for all member states.

This fourth ship, named L&Eacute; George Bernard Shaw was commissioned into service in May 2019. <\/p>  <p>  The P50 class vessels, 20 and 18 years old this year, now fall into the category of ship requiring a mid-life refurbishment \/ extension programme.  Due to their age profile, much of the auxiliary equipment onboard is coming to the end of its useful life or is becoming obsolete and requires to be replaced in a structured manner.   <\/p>  <p>  The Mid-Life Extension Programme of L&Eacute; R&oacute;is&iacute;n commenced in March 2019, with an initial dry-docking phase to be followed by an extended period of equipment upgrade and refit works. Works are progressing as planned. L&Eacute; Niamh&rsquo;s extension programme is due to commence in 2020.  Over the course of their extension programmes, L&Eacute; R&oacute;is&iacute;n and L&Eacute; Niamh will be out of operation for a period of some twelve months each. Contracts to the value of the &euro;7.6m inclusive VAT have been awarded for the main works associated with the upgrade to L&Eacute; R&oacute;is&iacute;n. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, planning is ongoing for the replacement of the current Naval Service flagship L&Eacute; Eithne with a multi role vessel. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to Defence Forces communications systems, there is continued investment in the development of suitable network enabled communications in order to meet the challenges of an increasingly complex operational environment.<\/p>  <p>  The examples given, whilst not exhaustive, demonstrate my commitment to update and upgrade the Defence Forces equipment and capability, within the financial envelope available. In accordance with the National Development Plan, the capital allocation for Defence was been increased to &euro;113 million for 2020, an increase of &euro;7 million from 2019. The National Development Plan provides for a total of &euro;541 million for Defence over the period 2018-2022. This level of capital funding will allow the Defence Organisation to undertake a programme of sustained equipment replacement and infrastructural development across the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service as identified and prioritised in the Defence White Paper and builds on the significant investment programme over recent years. <\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Defence Forces have the necessary modern and effective range of equipment available to them, including vehicles and communication systems, which is in line with best international standards in order to fulfil all roles assigned to them by Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112600060#WRE02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Remuneration","counter":266,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112600060#WRE02500"},{"type":"question","counter":267,"qnumday":136,"qnumall":"[48792\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112600060#WRE02600","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"if he will clarify an issue regarding a delay in payment of a military allowance for Defence Force members who trained cadets (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1255","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":268,"content":"<p>Arrangements are being made to pay\u00a0the Specialised Instructors Allowance to the relevant NCO Specialised Instructors.

It is essential to review all tax reliefs, credits and incentives in order to ensure that they are properly targeted and, if necessary, re-focused in order that they can achieve their intended\u00a0socio-economic objectives. A feature of the OPFTC was that it could be claimed by multiple individuals in respect of a single child, resulting in a considerable annual cost of over &euro;141 million by 2013, attributable to over 104,000 claimants. This was unsustainable and the OPFTC was therefore\u00a0replaced by the SPCCC from 1 January 2014. Since then, only one credit is available in respect of any qualifying child, and an individual\u00a0who is a primary claimant in respect of more than one qualifying child can only receive one credit.\u00a0 Agreement as to who will be the primary carer of a child is a matter for the parents or guardians, and is defined for the purpose of the credit as being the person who the qualifying child is resident with for the greater part of the year.\u00a0 Where the custody of a child is shared equally between two individuals, the legislation provides that the primary claimant shall be the person in receipt of the child benefit payment from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection. However this is a secondary provision, and the main criteria for allocation of the credit is the residence provision.\u00a0 If a child is resident with one parent for the greater part of the year (i.e. for a period greater than 6 months), that person should qualify as the primary carer of the child and therefore be entitled to claim the credit in their own right as primary claimant. If the primary claimant does not wish to claim the credit they may surrender their entitlement to a secondary claimant.<\/p><p>In 2017, the most recent year for which data are available, the cost of the SPCCC was almost &euro;94 million, attributable to over 67,000 claimants. These figures, and costs for each year going back to 2004, are published in the Cost of Tax Expenditures document on Revenue&rsquo;s website at the link: <i><\/i>Issues concerning this credit are outlined in detail in the review of the SPCCC conducted by my Department in 2015 contained in the Report on Tax Expenditures, available online at the link:<i><\/i><\/p><p>I am satisfied that the SPCCC in its current form is targeting limited State resources to where they are most needed. However, I am conscious of the significant contribution made by taxpayers generally to the rebalancing of the public finances, and of the challenges that individuals continue to face notwithstanding the improving economic conditions.\u00a0 <\/p><p>It is the Government&rsquo;s position that earners start to pay the marginal rate of tax at too low an income level and it is committed to reducing excessive tax rates for low and middle income earners while also keeping the tax base broad. As a result of changes in recent Budgets, USC rates have been reduced to 0.5%, 2% and 4.5%.\u00a0 The income level at which taxpayers begin to pay the higher rate of tax has also been increased by &euro;2,500 and there have been increases in both the Home Carer Tax Credit and the Earned Income Tax\u00a0Credit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112600061#WRF00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":324,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112600061#WRF01200"},{"type":"question","counter":325,"qnumday":156,"qnumall":"[49066\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112600061#WRF01300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the status of the allocation of flat rate expenses for teachers (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":326,"content":"<p>Over the past 18 months, Revenue has been conducting a comprehensive review of the administratively based Flat Rate Expenses (FRE) regime.\u00a0 Revenue has advised me that the purpose of the FRE review, which involved engagement with relevant representative bodies, is to ensure that the expenses granted to each employment category remain justified and appropriate to modern day employments and work practices.\u00a0 Each category of FRE allowance is being examined separately in the light of the legislative requirements of section 114 TCA 1997, which provides expenses are tax deductible only if they are wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred by the employee in the performance of the duties of his or her employment and are not reimbursed by the employer. <\/p>  <p>  Revenue has also advised me that its FRE review is ongoing but is now nearing conclusion, with an expected completion date by end year. <\/p>  <p>  As I informed the House during the Report Stage debate on the Finance Bill last week, while I am aware of the effect this will have on those who are impacted by the change, I also need to respect the independence of the Revenue Commissioners.

Shortly after the introduction of VAT, Revenue allowed the zero rate to be applied to certain food supplement products (vitamins, minerals and fish oils). This concessionary approach expanded as the market developed over the years and resulted in the zero rating by Revenue of further similar products, including products other than vitamins, minerals and fish oils.<\/p>  <p>  Revenue has acknowledged that the scope of its concessionary approach broadened progressively over time to the point that it had become increasingly difficult to maintain an effective distinction between food supplement products that could benefit from the zero rate and those that were standard rated. Revenue acknowledges that this concessionary approach was unsatisfactory and led to diverging and inconsistent practices, and there were continuous efforts by elements in the industry to expand its scope.<\/p>  <p>  Following complaints from the Irish Health Trade Association (IHTA), Revenue conducted a comprehensive review of the VAT treatment of food supplement products, including getting an expert report on the definition of food for the purposes of the VAT Consolidation Act. The expert prepared a detailed, scientific report that concluded that food supplement products are not conventional food. Based on the expert report and its own legal analysis, Revenue concluded that the status quo was no longer sustainable. Following the review, Revenue engaged with my Department concerning policy options that might be considered in the context of Finance Bill 2018. The relevant legislation was not changed in Finance Bill 2018 and therefore Revenue issued new guidance in December 2018 which removed the concessionary zero rating of various food supplement products with effect from 1 March 2019.<\/p>  <p>  Following representation from Deputies and from the industry, I wrote to Revenue outlining my plans to examine the policy and legislative options for the taxation of food supplement products in the context of Finance Bill 2019. Revenue responded by delaying the withdrawal of its concessionary zero rating of the food supplement products concerned. This allowed time for my Department to carry out a public consultation on the taxation of food supplement products. <\/p>  <p>  The public consultation ran from 18 April to 24 May 2019 and sought input from a wide range of interested parties, including from health and nutrition experts and the Minister for Health.

The review also included an examination of the outstanding recommendations of the 2015 Thornhill review of the Local Property Tax. It included a consultation process to enable all interested parties and individuals to submit their views on the future of the LPT. <\/p><p>The Review Group found significant but geographically uneven increases in residential property price levels which made it difficult to identify a scenario that would deliver on the condition I set that there should be relative stability for all taxpayers in their LPT liabilities and that any increases should be modest, affordable and fair.<\/p><p>Having considered the findings of the review report, I decided to defer the valuation date from 1st November 2019 to 1st November 2020, and this was effected by ministerial order (S.I.

These changes were brought in to help tackle fraud and exaggerated claims, but also to align the law with GDPR requirements (e.g. deletion of CCTV footage).\u00a0 These amendments were made as part of the Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Act 2018. <\/p>  <p>  I believe that one of the key achievements of the CIWG is increased coordination and cooperation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the insurance industry with regard to tackling fraud.\u00a0 This includes the reporting of suspected fraud, as well as to how that fraud is recorded on the PULSE system.\u00a0 There has also been recent successes under Operation Coatee, which targets insurance-related criminality.\u00a0 In addition, Garda Commissioner Drew Harris has decided for operational reasons to investigate insurance fraud at the divisional level, rather than establish a centralised insurance investigation unit, which may not be in a position to investigate incidents at a local level to the same extent.\u00a0 This approach is aligned with a general divisional-focused Garda model and the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (GNECB) will guide divisions and provide training in the investigation of insurance fraud. <\/p>  <p>  I might conclude by saying that since the CIWG\u00a0started its\u00a0 work in 2016, I believe that many insurers are taking a much more robust approach to challenging questionable claims.\u00a0 This can be seen in recent media reports detailing personal injuries cases which have been dismissed by the courts after extensive investigations surrounding the circumstances of the claim.\u00a0 This trend is encouraging in terms of tackling the problem of dubious or exaggerated claims from the personal injuries litigation system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112600061#WRF05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Data","counter":363,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112600061#WRF05100"},{"type":"question","counter":364,"qnumday":169,"qnumall":"[48983\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112600061#WRF05200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the percentage of taxpayers who were exempt from income tax in each year since 2008 to 2018 and to date in 2019; his views on whether taxpayers should be required to pay income tax irrespective of income; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1312","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":365,"content":"<p>Ireland has one of the most progressive income tax systems in the developed world.

The estimates are provisional and may be revised. They assume no behavioural change by taxpayers.<\/p><p>Prior to the introduction of the USC, the Irish income tax base had narrowed to a point where over 45% of income earners in the State were exempt from income tax and just over 13% were liable to the higher rate of income tax. When initially introduced in 2011, the entry threshold to USC was &euro;4,004, with the result that just over 12% of income earners were exempt from a charge on their income. Notwithstanding the subsequent increase in the entry threshold from &euro;4,004 to &euro;13,000, of the three Irish charges on income (income tax, USC and PRSI), the USC currently has the broadest base. This is because, in general, entry into liability for the USC starts at income of &euro;13,000 per year (compared with &euro;16,500 for income tax and generally &euro;18,304 (&euro;352 per week) for PRSI). The USC base is broad because there are no credits and very few reliefs.<\/p><p>It is the Government&rsquo;s position that earners start to pay the marginal rate of tax at too low an income level and it is committed to reducing excessive tax rates for low and middle income earners while also keeping the tax base broad. As a result of changes in recent Budgets, USC rates have been reduced to 0.5%, 2% and 4.5%.\u00a0 The income level at which taxpayers begin to pay the higher rate of tax has also been increased by &euro;2,500 and there have been increases in both the Home Carer Tax Credit and the Earned Income Credit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112600061#WRF05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Sector","counter":366,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112600061#WRF05400"},{"type":"question","counter":367,"qnumday":170,"qnumall":"[49041\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112600061#WRF05500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if deferred tax assets on losses carried forward in banks are included in the calculations for CET1 and fully loaded CET1 ratios; if these ratios will deteriorate if the deferred tax assets were removed from the balance sheet; if it will mean that banks would have to hold more capital if these deferred tax assets were removed; if this will increase the costs facing the banks; if this will have an impact on retail interest rates for customers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":368,"content":"<p>The Deputy may recall that my Department issued a Technical Note to the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform and Taoiseach (FinPERT) in August 2018 which dealt with the potential consequences of changes to the treatment of Corporation Tax Loss relief in respect of banks. In answering the Deputy&rsquo;s current parliamentary question I have used content included in this note where relevant.<\/p><p>Under CRD IV rules, deferred tax assets (DTAs), which are substantially made up of tax losses in the case of the Irish banks, are being phased out over a 10-year period which commenced in 2014. Accordingly, tax losses still make up a material portion of the transitional CET1 ratios of the Irish banks. It should be noted that transitional CET1 ratio is the ratio which the regulator uses when assessing compliance with the minimum ratio set for the bank.<\/p><p>In the Technical Note referred to above, it was estimated that the removal of DTAs from the banks&rsquo; balance sheets would have the following impact on the December 2017 CET1 ratios as follows: <table>    <tr>       <th>Transitional CET1<\/th>       <th>AIB<\/th>       <th>BOI<\/th>       <th>PTSB<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Ratio as reported<\/td>       <td>20.8%<\/td>       <td>15.8%<\/td>       <td>17.1%<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Pro-forma ratios with DTAs removed<\/td>       <td>17.1%<\/td>       <td>14.0%<\/td>       <td>14.8%<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Reduction in CET1 ratios<\/td>       <td>(3.7%)<\/td>       <td>(1.8%)<\/td>       <td>(2.3%)<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>As fully loaded CET1 ratios are calculated with the DTAs deducted in their entirety from regulatory capital, the removal of DTAs would not impact on the reported ratio in the reporting period in which they were removed. However, for subsequent reporting periods, fully loaded ratios would be negatively impacted as they would not have benefitted from the usage of the DTAs in the scenario where the banks continue to be profitable. This also applies beyond the transitional period.<\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware of the significant increase in regulatory capital which the banks are now required to hold since the financial crisis. It is not possible to estimate the potential reaction of the regulator should the DTAs be removed from the banks&rsquo; balance sheets in terms of addressing the impact of this on capital. However, as the impact would be significant, with the reported ratios at AIB, BOI and PTSB being reduced by an estimated 18%, 11% and 13% respectively, it would no doubt be a matter carefully considered. <\/p><p>In addition, it is difficult to estimate the precise impact of the removal of DTAs on the pricing of retail customer products. However, one of the key criteria used by banks when pricing products is the return on equity (ROE). ROE is an important metric for a number of stakeholders, including the regulator, when assessing the financial performance of a bank. Accordingly, should a bank be required to hold more capital arising from the removal of DTAs, this could put upward pressure on interest rates say, for example, in relation to loan products to ensure the bank is achieving an adequate ROE.<\/p><p>As a separate matter, it is important to highlight that the DTAs are a valuable asset on a bank&rsquo;s balance sheet and the State benefits from this as it sells down its stakes in the banks.

Tacsa&iacute; na h&Eacute;ireann,\u00a0in respect of\u00a0its\u00a0the Report on Motor Insurance.\u00a0 It also met with the Hotels Federation of Ireland, IBEC, ISME, the Vintners&rsquo; Federation of Ireland (VFI), the Licensed Vintners Association (LVA), the Retail Grocery Dairy &amp;amp; Allied Trades Association (RGDATA), Chambers Ireland, the Law Society of Ireland, and the Health and Safety Authority, Insurance Ireland, a number of CEOs from insurers operating in the employer liability and public liability insurance market and representatives from Lloyd&rsquo;s of London as part of its consultations on the Report on Employer and Public Liability Insurance. \u00a0In addition, submissions received from all interested parties were considered as part of the process.<\/p><p>Following publication of the two reports, in January 2017 and January 2018 respectively, the CIWG has continued to meet so as to ensure that progress is being made related to the implementation of the various recommendations by the relevant Departments and bodies, which make up its membership.\u00a0 The purpose of its meetings has therefore been to discuss issues related to implementation, including the Personal Injuries Commission&rsquo;s recommendations, as well as to take stock of developments in the wider insurance reform agenda.\u00a0 The Minister of State, in his capacity as Chair of the CIWG, has also had an &ldquo;open door&rdquo; policy in relation to meeting various stakeholders such as businesses and community groups that have been experiencing difficulties in affording or being able to avail of insurance.\u00a0 <\/p><p>I think it is also important to mention that the relevant Ministers of State, as Chairs of the CIWG, have appeared before the FIN-PER Joint Oireachtas Committee to update them on the CIWG&rsquo;s work, including progress it has made in relation to implementing its recommendations.\u00a0 This has happened on seven occasions since 2016 and I believe that this demonstrates the importance the CIWG places on ensuring the Oireachtas has been informed and involved throughout its work.<\/p><p>Finally, I would like to commend the CIWG and its members regarding the work they have been taking to ensure that necessary reforms to the insurance sector are being carried out in line with the mandate that was given to it at the outset.\u00a0 I believe that these reforms are having a significant impact with regard to private motor insurance (CSO figures from October 2019 show that the price of motor insurance is now 27.1% lower than the July 2016 peak).\u00a0 However, I believe more needs to be done and in this context, I believe that the CIWG is as relevant now as it ever has been and it is likely to continue to meet into 2020 as implementation of remaining recommendations continues.\u00a0 The issue of the cost and availability of insurance, in particular to certain businesses and community groups, remains a priority for the Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112600061#WRF05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":372,"content":"<p>Question No. 172 answered with Question No. 151.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","counter":374,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112600061#WRF06200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Spending Code","counter":373,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112600061#WRF06100"},{"type":"question","counter":374,"qnumday":173,"qnumall":"[48530\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112600061#WRF06200","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"when a new public spending code will be issued;

The Scheme includes low riverside defences, an early flood warning system and new dam management procedures for the ESB dams at Carrigadrohid and Inniscarra.

The Department does not put in place such infrastructure. <\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0school referred to by the Deputy was recently included in mini competition run by my Department and the service to that school has been awarded to a provider of high speed\u00a0broadband.\u00a0The provider is currently working to provide this service to the school. The school will be contacted by the provider in due course\u00a0to arrange the installation.<\/p>  <p>  Under the current primary schools\u00a0programme the Department continually reviews the availability of services and upgrades schools where the opportunity arises, in line with contractual and budgetary requirements. A recent drawdown from the Framework of Providers of Broadband Services saw some 1,600 primary schools awarded download speeds of 30Mbps or greater (the baseline download speed required under the National Broadband Plan). Those schools have now been upgraded to that connectivity. This represents more than\u00a0one third of all primary schools. This\u00a0is\u00a0a significant improvement over recent years, given that less than 100 primary schools were on those speeds in 2012. Further schools\u00a0are likely to be upgraded to those speeds\u00a0in 2019 and 2020, through EIR's 300K Rural Deployment commitment, and planned industry provision.<\/p>  <p>  The need to improve broadband connectivity to primary schools is recognised in the Digital Strategy for Schools 2015-2020, and as noted access to high speed broadband is one of the indicators identified in the Digital Strategy Action Plan. My Department continues to liaise with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to ensure that the needs of\u00a0primary schools are prioritised in the implementation of the\u00a0National Broadband Plan.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112600062#WRG06200","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects Status","counter":446,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112600062#WRG06300"},{"type":"question","counter":447,"qnumday":197,"qnumall":"[48655\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112600062#WRG06400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will address a matter regarding a school (details supplied) in County Kerry;

With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level. <\/p><p>Major new residential developments in a school planning area have the potential to alter demand in that area. In that regard, as part of the demographic exercises, my Department engages with each of the local authorities to obtain the up-to-date information on significant new residential development in each area.  This is necessary to ensure that schools infrastructure planning is keeping pace with demographic changes as there is a constantly evolving picture with planned new residential development<\/p><p>Where demographic data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:<\/p><p>- Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,<\/p><p>- Extending the capacity of a school or schools,<\/p><p>- Provision of a new school or schools.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, in April 2018 the Government announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the next four years (2019 to 2022). This announcement followed nationwide demographic exercises carried out by my Department into the future need for primary and post-primary schools across the country.<\/p><p>While the announcement did not include a new school for the Malahide_Nevinstown and Portmarnock school planning areas, the following new schools were established in recent years to serve the Malahide_Nevinstown and Portmarnock school planning areas:<\/p><p>- A new 1,000 pupil post-primary school (Malahide Portmarnock Educate Together Secondary School) established in 2018; and<\/p><p>- A new primary school (Malahide Portmarnock Educate Together NS) established in 2014.<\/p><p>The requirement for new schools will be kept under on-going review and in particular will have regard for the increased rollout of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040. <\/p><p>Under Project Ireland 2040, my Department continues to make progress to increase the infrastructural capacity in the schools sector, in order to meet demographic and other demands.<\/p><p>The Capital Programme details the school projects that are being progressed under Project Ireland 2040. I wish to advise the Deputy that the current status of large-scale projects being delivered under Project Ireland 2040 may be viewed on my Department's website, and this information is updated regularly. In addition, a list of large-scale projects completed from 2010 to date may also be viewed on the website. <\/p><p>The Capital Programme also provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms, if required, for schools where an immediate enrolment need has been identified or where an additional teacher has been appointed.

Management of the courts is the responsibility of the Courts Service which is independent in exercising its functions under the Courts Service Act 1998. <\/p>  <p>  The ADM (Capacity) Act 2015 provides a modern statutory framework to support decision-making by adults with capacity difficulties. It provides for the establishment of new administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service (DSS) within the Mental Health Commission (a body under the Department of Health).<\/p>  <p>  Some provisions of the Act were commenced in October 2016 and progress has been made on preparing for the establishment of the DSS and commencement of the remainder of the Act. <\/p>  <p>  A high-level Steering Group comprising senior officials from the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Health, the Mental Health Commission and the Courts Service, together with the Director of the DSS, is overseeing the establishment and commissioning of the DSS and this work is ongoing.<\/p>  <p>  The Director of the DSS is working towards being operational and ready for the commencement of the main provisions of the Act. This lead-in timeframe ensures that the necessary staff resources, processes, IT system, expert panels, codes of practice and regulations will be in place so that the  Service will have the capacity to be up and running effectively. There are many complex strands to this work, including involvement of multiple organisations, and the situation is being kept under ongoing review as the preparatory work on implementation moves forward.<\/p>  <p>  The commencement of Part 8 of the Act, which provides for a legislative framework for advance healthcare directives, is a matter for the Minister for Health.<\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to work closely with the Mental Health Commission and the Director of the DSS to deliver the full implementation of the Act. <\/p>  <p>  When the Act is fully commenced, the law will be changed from the current &ldquo;all or nothing&rdquo; status approach to a flexible functional definition, whereby capacity is assessed only in relation to the matter in question and only at the time in question.<\/p>  <p>  The Act provides for a functional definition of capacity which takes an issue-specific and time specific approach, focusing on the particular time when a decision has to be made and on the particular matter to which the decision relates.  This allows for situations where the loss of capacity is temporary or partial and where there may be fluctuations in capacity.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Act, the current adult wards of court system will be phased out and replaced by a less intrusive system which offers a continuum of options to support people in maximising their decision-making capability.  Part 6 of the 2015 Act provides for the phased transition from adult wardship to this new support framework. It provides for the review by the wardship court of the capacity of all current adult wards within three years of the commencement of that Part of the Act.  Following a review of his or her capacity, the ward will be discharged from wardship and depending on the outcome of the review the wardship court may: <\/p>  <p> - Declare that the ward does not lack capacity and immediately discharge the ward from wardship and order that the property of the former ward be returned to him\/her.<\/p>  <p> - Declare that the ward lacks capacity unless a suitable person is made available as co-decision maker to make one or more decisions. Once a co-decision making agreement is registered the court shall immediately discharge the ward from wardship and order that the property of the former ward be returned to him\/her. If there is no suitable person to act as co-decision maker or the co-decision making agreement has not been properly registered within a period set down by the court, then the court shall make orders as appropriate under Part 5 to appoint a decision making representative and order that the property of the former ward be returned to him\/her once a decision making representative has been appointed. <\/p>  <p> - Declare that the ward lacks capacity even if a suitable person is made available as co-decision maker to make one or more decisions.

While we cannot yet know the form that Brexit will take, these measures aim to assist businesses in identifying key risk areas and practical preparatory actions regardless of the circumstances of the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU. <\/p>  <p>  InterTradeIreland&rsquo;s [ITI] Brexit Advisory Service provides a focal point for SMEs working to navigate any changes in cross-border trading relationships arising as a result of Brexit. As part of this service, ITI has organised a series of awareness-raising events focused on improving knowledge of customs processes and procedures and identifying actions that can be taken in areas such as logistics and supply chain management. As of 8 November, more than 5,300 SMEs have directly engaged with the Brexit Advisory Service this year.<\/p>  <p>  ITI&rsquo;s Brexit Planning Voucher aims to enable businesses to seek professional advice on how best to plan and prepare for Brexit. This support helps businesses obtain advice on specific areas such as tariffs, currency management, and regulatory and customs issues. Vouchers are worth up to &euro;2,250 (inclusive of VAT) each. To 8 November, 2,054 applications have been submitted for the Voucher, 1,747 of which have been approved. <\/p>  <p>  ITI has also launched a further financial support in the form of the Brexit Implementation Voucher, which offers financial support up to &pound;5,000\/&euro;5,625 (inclusive of VAT), with InterTradeIreland paying 50% towards implementing critical changes in relation to Brexit matters. As of 8 November, there have been 54 applications, of which 40 have been approved.<\/p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are the first-stop-shop for anyone seeking guidance and support on starting or growing their business, including businesses in the border counties. The LEOs have organised various events to enable companies to learn about the potential impacts and opportunities of Brexit. As of 8 November, 1,198 LEO clients have received one-to-one mentoring solely focused on Brexit. Since February, the LEOs have also been offering customs training workshops to support businesses trading with third countries in advance of the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU. To 8 November this year, there have been 1,456 training participants.<\/p>  <p>  The LEOs also engage in a number of other schemes to help businesses prepare for Brexit. The Technical Assistance Grant for Micro Export is offered as an incentive for LEO clients to explore and develop new market opportunities. As of 8th November, 800 LEO clients have been approved assistance under the grant.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the six LEOs in the Border region are working together with their Northern Ireland counterparts under the EU Co-Innovate Programme.\u00a0 The aim of Co-Innovate is to give SMEs from the manufacturing and tradable services sectors in the eligible regions the tools and tailored support to help them to innovate, differentiate and compete successfully. \u00a0This month, it was announced that over &euro;1 million of R&amp;D funding has been awarded through Co-Innovate. <\/p>  <p>  The Brexit Loan Scheme was launched in March 2018. It provides relatively short-term working capital, up to three years, to eligible businesses with up to 499 employees to help them innovate, change or adapt to mitigate their Brexit challenges. The scheme is open to eligible businesses from all regions of the country, including those in the Border counties. Dublin aside, the most recent quarterly report shows that the border region is the most active region in terms of eligibility applications for the scheme. As of 18 November, there have been 892 eligibility applications received, of which 804 have been approved and 212 loans progressed to sanction at bank level to a value of &euro;46.6 million. It should be noted that 159 of total applications received relate to repeat\/duplicate applications, as eligibility expires after six months. <\/p>  <p>  The Future Growth Loan Scheme opened for eligibility applications in April 2019. This scheme provides a longer-term facility, 8-10 years, of up to &euro;300m to support strategic capital investment for a post-Brexit environment at competitive rates. This scheme has been jointly funded by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to make available loans of &euro;100,000 (&euro;50,000 for primary agriculture) to &euro;3 million, with loans of under &euro;500,000 being provided on an unsecured basis.\u00a0 The scheme is open to eligible Irish businesses, including those in the primary agriculture and seafood sectors, to support strategic, long-term investment in a post-Brexit environment.\u00a0 As of 18 November, there have been 2,031 eligibility applications received, of which 1,925 have been approved and 595 loans progressed to sanction at bank level to a value of &euro;122.5 million. <\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland [EI] has established a Prepare for Brexit online portal and communications campaign, as well as an online &ldquo;Brexit SME Scorecard&rdquo; to help Irish businesses self-asses their exposure to Brexit and a &ldquo;Be Prepared Grant&rdquo; to support SME clients in planning to mitigate risks arising from Brexit.\u00a0 It has also launched a new Eurozone Strategy to help SMEs broaden their export footprint beyond the UK.<\/p>  <p>  EI&rsquo;s Customs Insights course helps businesses looking at customs for the first time to understand the key customs concepts, documentation and processes. The course advises on the key actions companies can take to prepare for Brexit and highlights the various supports available. To 8 November, there have been 1,916 Customs Insights Course participants. <\/p>  <p>  In quarter one of this year, I launched nine new Regional Enterprise Plans to 2020, including Plans for the North East and the North West. These Plans build on the very strong progress made on employment creation under the Regional Action Plan for Jobs 2015-2017. The new Plans will ensure that regional stakeholders continue to work together to help achieve the Government&rsquo;s 2020 targets for regional employment taking account of new and emerging opportunities and challenges, including Brexit. <\/p>  <p>  In order to help build enterprise capability, under the Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF) Enterprise Ireland invested in seven successful projects in the Border region with a total funding allocation of more than &euro;10.6 million.\u00a0This funding will help drive enterprise development and job creation in the Border Region. Enterprise Ireland will continue to engage with its clients to ensure they have the supports required to prepare for any kind of Brexit scenario. <\/p>  <p>  In June, at a visit to the recently opened Cavan Digital Hub, I announced that a further &euro;45 million is to be made available under a new third call of the REDF. The closing date for submission of eligible projects under this latest call was 25 September 2019.\u00a0On 20 October 2019 an Evaluation Panel comprised of representatives from EI, my Department and other public and private bodies began to evaluate eligible projects. The evaluation of eligible projects has now been completed and the selected projects by the Evaluation panel will be recommended for funding to EI&rsquo;s Investment Committee\/Board for approval and I intend making an announcement on the successful projects before the end of the year.<\/p>  <p>  My Department and I have also participated in the whole-of-Government 'Getting Ireland Brexit Ready' public information campaign. This campaign features workshop events throughout the country, aimed primarily at the businesses and people most impacted by Brexit, including events in Monaghan and Donegal. In addition to these events, Enterprise Ireland has rolled out a series of Brexit Advisory Clinics to help businesses across the country, including events in Dundalk, Letterkenny and Cootehill. In the last few weeks, the LEOs have held Brexit related events in Monaghan, Drogheda and Cavan.<\/p>  <p>  While I have seen a very positive uptake of the supports available, I am conscious that the lasting uncertainty around the Brexit process may be leading businesses to defer their Brexit preparations.\u00a0 The UK&rsquo;s exit from the EU will bring change for Irish businesses and I want businesses, particularly those around the Border counties to know my Department and agencies are here to help.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112600065#WRK00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Work Permits Data","counter":604,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112600065#WRK00800"},{"type":"question","counter":605,"qnumday":254,"qnumall":"[48749\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112600065#WRK00900","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the status of work permits for a company (details supplied); if the quotas for general employment permits for meat processing operatives will be extended; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1268","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":606,"content":"<p>In 2018, at my request, following significant and ongoing engagement with the agri-food sector and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, a review of the emerging labour shortages being experienced in that sector was undertaken resulting in the introduction of a pilot scheme\u00a0 which provided for operatives for the horticulture, dairy farming and meat processing industries.

No. 110 of 2019) were made by the Minister for Finance and provide that the Central Register of Beneficial Ownership of Companies and Industrial and Provident Societies (RBO) is the central repository of such information held by companies and industrial and provident societies. While the CRO homepage provides a link to the RBO, the RBO is a separate website and a statutorily separate Register from the Companies Registration Office. Obligations under S.I.

Ireland is now an international outlier on private medicine in public hospitals. Other countries with strong public hospital systems do not tolerate the inefficiencies and perverse incentives that arise with having a stream of private patients. The Sl&aacute;intecare and the de Buitl&eacute;ir reports together present an opportunity to design a public hospital service with a coherent vision, with the patient and the public good at its heart. I have committed to reverting to Government with proposals in this regard over the coming months. <\/p>  <p>  As part of its consideration on the recommendations contained within the report, my officials consulted with the a number of bodies including the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) on the implications of the recommendations.

The Act specifies criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines.<\/p>  <p>  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As a country, we invest heavily in medicines, to the tune of almost &euro;2 billion annually. As of October 2019, there have been 29 new medicines and 5 new indications for existing medicines approved for reimbursement in the public healthcare system. The approvals to date represent an additional investment by the HSE over five years of approximately &euro;220m in providing access to new and innovative treatment for Irish patients. It is expected that over 3,000 patients will benefit from access to these new medicines over the next 5 years\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the significant progress on drug costs achieved from price reductions under the pricing framework agreed with industry and commercial negotiations conducted by the HSE, the Health Service is still facing very significant challenges in relation to the affordability of medicines.\u00a0 The industry continues to develop very expensive products, particularly in the high-tech medicines area and the costs involved are a challenge for health systems even in countries with much greater resources than Ireland.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Government wants new and innovative medicines to be available to our citizens as quickly as possible, but this can only be achieved if medicines are priced by the pharmaceutical industry in a viable and sustainable manner.\u00a0\"League tables\" comparing speed of reimbursement in Ireland with that of other countries are often misleading since several countries have quite different and often less rigorous assessment arrangements than Ireland. Furthermore, many of the newer products being licenced are falling well short of cost-effectiveness thresholds, with limited clinical benefits.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The current process for assessing applications works very well where the new medicines have strong evidence of clinical effectiveness and are priced in a cost-effective manner.\u00a0Delays in reimbursement decisions for new products do occur in cases where the evidence of clinical effectiveness is weak, and where prices are set well outside of cost effectiveness parameters.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The HSE strives to reach a decision in as timely a manner as possible. However, because these commitments are often multi-million euro investments on an on-going basis, it must ensure that the best price is achieved. This can lead to a protracted negotiation and deliberation process.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  My Department and the HSE are working on making greater efficiencies in medicines usage through a range of initiatives both domestically and internationally to ensure the greatest possible access to new treatments for patients in Ireland.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s Medicines Management Programme (MMP), incorporating the Preferred Drugs initiative, is overseeing the implementation of a number of actions to bring about greater value for the taxpayer through cost-effective provision of medicines. These measures include the designation of preferred products with a focus on high-cost prescribing areas, in particular optimising the use of biosimilars.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>I and officials have also been engaging over the past number of years with a number of voluntary EU forums.\u00a0 In June 2018, I signed\u00a0the Beneluxa Initiative on Pharmaceutical Policy. This Agreement is in line with my objective to work with other European countries to identify workable solutions, in an increasingly challenging environment, to secure timely access for patients to new medicines in an affordable and sustainable way.\u00a0 In June 2019, Ireland became a Founding Member of the International Horizon Scanning Initiative which is being established as part of the work programme of Beneluxa.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112600066#WRL00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Air Ambulance Service","counter":683,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112600066#WRL00500"},{"type":"question","counter":684,"qnumday":280,"qnumall":"[48649\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112600066#WRL00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the action he will take to ensure that the air ambulance service does not close for a period of 16 days or for a period of time in view of the crucial role it plays in saving lives; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1440","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":685,"content":"<p>The Emergency Aeromedical Support (EAS) provides rapid access to appropriate treatment for very high acuity patients, specifically where land ambulance transit times would not be clinically appropriate.\u00a0The service is particularly beneficial for time-dependent cardiovascular patients who constitute about one third of all EAS missions.<\/p>  <p>  EAS services are provided primarily by the Air Corps with reserve capacity provided by the Irish Coast Guard.\u00a0 The service operates seven days a week in daylight hours and is specifically targeted at the West.\u00a0The highest demand for the EAS comes from Galway, Mayo and Roscommon, and the service has successfully completed over 2,600 emergency missions since it commenced operations in 2012.<\/p>  <p>  The Air Corps is not in a position to accept EAS taskings from the National Ambulance Service for four days per month for a period of four months, from November 2019 to February 2020.

As research has developed, there has been more awareness of this condition over the past number of years. When diagnosed and treated early, it has a very good recovery rate. It has been diagnosed in only a small number of people worldwide.<\/p>  <p>  Most cases of BIA-ALCL have been diagnosed in patients who have implants, or have had tissues expanders manufactured by Allergan, with a specific textured surface called \"BIOCELL.\" These implants and expanders have not been used in Ireland since December 2018.<\/p>  <p>  The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) has been updating my Department on this matter as further research is published and as evidence continues to emerge at both a European and international level and while the risk of developing BIA-ALCL has been shown to be more common than first thought, it still remains an uncommon condition.<\/p>  <p>  The Health Service Executive (HSE) has decided to communicate publicly on this matter in order to increase general awareness of BIA ALCL, ensure that women in Ireland are fully informed on this issue and are given the appropriate advice and follow up as required. My Department has been and continues to work alongside the HSE in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  The 8 national cancer centres are writing directly to their patients who have had breast implants or tissue expanders, including those who received Allergan &lsquo;BIOCELL&rsquo; and patients without Allergan &lsquo;BIOCELL&rsquo; breast implants\/ tissue expanders.  The distribution of these letters is an ongoing process, with letters being sent directly by the 8 cancer centres to their patients. As this is an ongoing communication process, I cannot inform the Deputy how many letters have issued. <\/p>  <p>  The letters and the information on the HSE&rsquo;s website, advise all individuals to be breast aware; describing the signs and symptoms to be aware of and monitor for and what to do if a patient finds a swelling or lump.  It is important to note that for patients without any symptoms- no further action is needed apart from routine follow-up.<\/p>  <p>  Dedicated telephone lines have been set up in the 8 cancer centres to provide assurance, encourage women to be breast aware and when necessary allocate clinical review. The phone numbers are included in each patient&rsquo;s letter.<\/p>  <p>   In December 2018, a French medical device notified body (which evaluates the conformity of products) decided not to renew the CE Certificates for certain breast implants and tissue expanders produced by the company Allergan. The HPRA made information available publicly when the product was withdrawn. The HSE advisory was issued in response to increased understanding of the incidence of the condition based on International studies over the past year. <\/p>  <p>  This current HSE patient advisory programme was initiated in August last based on the evolving understanding of the disease internationally.  Since then, my Department has been engaging with a range of national stakeholders, including the HSE, HPRA, clinical representatives and the private hospital sector on this issue to ensure that appropriate action is been taken.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112600067#WRM05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Treatment Abroad Scheme","counter":812,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112600067#WRM05800"},{"type":"question","counter":813,"qnumday":323,"qnumall":"[48938\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112600067#WRM05900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if there is a delay by the HSE in reimbursing claimants availing of surgery under the cross-border directive; his plans to ensure that a person (details supplied) is paid as soon as possible; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1360","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":814,"content":"<p>The HSE is responsible for the operation of the Cross-Border Directive and has a dedicated CBD office for this purpose.

The overriding focus throughout this process has been to ensure that review results are communicated to women and families in the most appropriate and sensitive way possible. <\/p>  <p>  On 9 September, the HSE sent a letter to all 1,038 participants in the review to provide them with options about how they may choose to receive their report. The process of communicating individual reports to women or next of kin has been ongoing since the 23 September.\u00a0This has been a large-scale process and, although it has taken longer than originally planned, is expected to complete in the coming days.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  A core principle underpinning this process has been to ensure that individual participants would have had an opportunity to receive their results in advance of publication of the Expert Panel&rsquo;s Aggregate Report. In keeping with this principle, the Minister for Health will bring the aggregate report to Government, and publish it, once he has received assurance that all women or next of kin have had the opportunity to receive their individual report.<\/p>  <p>  While the aggregate report has not yet been received, the Royal College in a letter to the Minister for Health in September advised that, based on the provisional findings of its Review, the performance characteristics of the CervicalCheck Screening Programme that fall within the scope of the Review appear to be broadly in line with experience in the UK.<\/p>  <p>  It has always been expected that a significant proportion of women in this review will receive results which disagree with their original review result. This is in line with international experience. For example, in one review of the English Cervical Screening Programme, 45% of slide reviews disagreed with the original review result.<\/p>  <p>  This reflects the reality that no matter how closely a review panel tries to reproduce the original screening conditions, the conditions of a review are different &ndash; the fact that a review includes records of a patient known to have a serious condition, such as cancer, will heighten vigilance and increase reports of abnormality. Finding discrepancies on review does not imply that the same findings should have been made under routine conditions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112600068#WRN05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Primary Care Centres","counter":884,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112600068#WRN05900"},{"type":"question","counter":885,"qnumday":352,"qnumall":"[49150\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112600068#WRN06000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the extent to which he expects the provision of primary care centres nationwide to alleviate the congestion at general hospitals; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":886,"content":"<p>As the HSE has responsibility for the provision, along with the maintenance and operation of Primary Care Centres and other Primary Care facilities, the Executive has been asked to reply directly to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112600068#WRN06100","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Data","counter":887,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112600068#WRN06200"},{"type":"question","counter":888,"qnumday":353,"qnumall":"[49151\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112600068#WRN06300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of full medical card holders nationwide; the extent to which this number has fluctuated in the past three years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":889,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112600068#WRN06400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Procedures","counter":890,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112600068#WRN06500"},{"type":"question","counter":891,"qnumday":354,"qnumall":"[49152\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112600068#WRN06600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of children or other patients who have undergone scoliosis procedures on a monthly basis in the past two years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":892,"content":"<p>Reducing waiting times for patients to access scoliosis services is a key priority of Government.

Over 34,500 farmers had applied for BEAM at its closing date of 20 September, representing potential commitments of up to\u00a0&euro;78 million.<\/p><p>In recognition of the important income support role played by the ANC scheme, the total allocation for the scheme has been increased by &euro;48m over the last two budgets (&euro;25m in Budget 2018 and &euro;23m in Budget 2019). In both 2018 and 2019, payment rates in the scheme were increased, with a targeting of increases corresponding to the different level of constraint in the different categories of land in the scheme.<\/p><p>In Budget 2020, I have provided almost &euro;85 million in targeted schemes to support sustainable beef farming. This includes almost &euro;45 million for the Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP), and a further &euro;40 million for targeted supports.

This will increase the level of bonus being paid on certain animals, as well as significantly increasing the number of animals which are eligible for a bonus. The cumulative effect is that over 70% of all steer and heifers slaughtered will now be eligible for a bonus on top of the base price paid.<\/p><p>A number of actions in the area of market transparency, beef promotion and strengthening the position of the farmer in the supply chain are included in the Agreement. These measures set a course towards greater clarity for all stakeholders involved in the beef supply chain, primarily farmers.<\/p><p>My Department is also proactively engaging with several potential beef Producer Organisations, which have to potential to strengthen the bargaining power of beef farmers in the supply chain.\u00a0 Two beef producer organisations have been formally recognised by my Department in recent weeks.<\/p><p>I have established a Beef Market Taskforce to provide the leadership to develop a sustainable pathway for the future of the beef sector in terms of economic, environmental and social sustainability.

Two further CNG refuelling stations are to be provided by Gas Networks Ireland's GRAZE project supported by the Climate Action Fund.<\/p>  <p>  The development of electric vehicle recharging points is being supported through a grant of up to &euro;600 for the installation of a home charge point, a grant of up to &euro;5,000 for Local Authorities to install on-street charge points and accelerated capital allowances to support businesses installing charge points. <\/p>  <p>  Budget 2020 provided &euro;6 million in funding to my Department to support the development of this charging infrastructure with &euro;4 million allocated to the home charge point grant and &euro;2 million to the on-street charge point grant. The Climate Action Plan, which was published in June, also sets out a range of actions to support the delivery of charging infrastructure for electric vehicles. These actions include expanding the home charger grant to include locations with shared parking such as apartments.<\/p>  <p>  Funding of &euro;10 million from the Climate Action Fund is supporting the ESB to develop a nationwide, state-of-the-art electric vehicle fast charging network, with the ESB also investing &euro;10 million. This project includes the installation of 140 fast chargers consisting of 90 150kW chargers (each of which will be capable of charging two vehicles simultaneously) and upgrading 50 existing standard chargers to 50kW chargers The project will also involve replacing over 500 existing standard charge points with next generation high reliability models. This is a multi-annual project and is expected to be fully completed by 2022.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, new regulations being developed by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government will require provision to be made for charge points in new domestic and non-domestic buildings with over 10 car parking spaces and those undergoing major refurbishments. The regulations will also require non-domestic buildings with over 20 car parking spaces to install charging facilities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112600070#WRP00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Exploration Licences","counter":980,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112600070#WRP01000"},{"type":"question","counter":981,"qnumday":384,"qnumall":"[48630\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112600070#WRP01100","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the reason prospecting licences are being granted in areas of Natura 2000 sites, national heritage areas, special areas of conservation and special protection areas in view of the fact that no mining licences are to be offered; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1316","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":982,"content":"<p>Prospecting licences may be granted following environmental screening by my Department including screening for Appropriate Assessment.

This action was taken following a reported malfunction of a number of lifejackets which are a key piece of personal protective equipment.\u00a0 An investigation is underway into the malfunctioning lifejackets which involves the Coast Guard, the supplier and the manufacturer.\u00a0 It is hoped to identify the cause and provide for a speedy, effective and safe solution.<\/p>  <p>  This action is being taken in compliance with Coast Guards SAR assurance obligations as set out in the National SAR Plan to ensure safety of Coast Guard boat crews. The National SAR Committee met on Monday 18 November and was briefed on the matter.\u00a0 In the meantime, from a SAR coverage point of view, the Coast Guard is deploying various contingencies based on an assessment of risk.\u00a0 All shoreline and cliff rescue services remain in place, along with the four Search and Rescue Coast Guard helicopters.\u00a0 The RNLI, Community Inshore Rescue Boats, and Naval Service will continue to assist particularly in those areas of greatest risk until the issue has been resolved.<\/p>  <p>  As regards other concerns raised previously, the Irish Coast Guard\u00a0addressed these\u00a0at the time through a programme of both internal and external testing. Along with independent testing through a UK based Testing Laboratory regarding the EN ISO standards applicable and assurances received from the manufacturer of the\u00a0lifejacket in question.<\/p>  <p>  As regards broader issues of safety in our national search and rescue service, I would draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the recent review of our National Search and Rescue Framework which was published in July last and the publication of a new National Search and Rescue Plan. The review was chaired independently by Sir Alan Massey, ex CEO of the UK&rsquo;s Maritime and Coastguard Agency. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Report welcomed the establishment by the IRCG of a new Safety, Quality and Compliance (SQC) section, and appointing therein a dedicated Health and Safety Officer to provide oversight of the SMS, working with the Department&rsquo;s Safety Officer(s) to embed and improve Health and Safety policy, procedures, goals and objectives.\u00a0 Further, the IRCG has committed to implementing an effective SMS, applicable to the specific needs of the IRCG and in line with the mandatory requirements of ISO 45001:2018 - Occupational Health and Safety Management Systems (SMS Revision &amp;amp; Accreditation &ndash; SRA - Project). This work is already helping inform other entities within the SAR system who are seeking to improve their Safety Management Systems. The recent issue with lifejackets and the response to that is evidence of safety management in action.<\/p>  <p>  At a national level, the new National SAR Plan delivers a new mechanism of assurance in relation to standards and practices and oversight of the overall Search and Rescue system. This includes a support network to assist those involved in search and rescue to develop minimum standards and practices and to embed principles of continuous improvement and safety within their organisations. It also creates a new Search and Rescue Regulators&rsquo; Forum, a unique initiative which brings transport regulators in the Search and Rescue domain together to exchange good practice and seek to improve the overall system assurance mechanisms.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112600071#WRQ04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tourism Policy","counter":1084,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112600071#WRQ04600"},{"type":"question","counter":1085,"qnumday":425,"qnumall":"[48970\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112600071#WRQ04700","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he will address a matter regarding the advertisement of greyhound races (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":1086,"content":"<p>I was gravely concerned following\u00a0the coverage and debate regarding alleged cruel practices within Ireland&rsquo;s greyhound industry.\u00a0One of the issues that arose as a result was the promotion of greyhound racing by our tourism agencies. <\/p>  <p>  Consequently, while the process of investigating and addressing issues was underway in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, I asked the\u00a0tourism\u00a0agencies to review their promotion of greyhound racing.\u00a0 I subsequently welcomed their decision to pause active promotion of greyhound racing and to keep the situation under review, pending implementation of several reforms.<\/p>  <p>  Since then, my colleague\u00a0Brendan Griffin T.D., Minister of State for Tourism and Sport at my Department, has received an update on Bord na gCon's additional and enhanced care and welfare measures, which he forwarded to both F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland.\u00a0 Minister Griffin has made it clear that he has strong personal views on the industry, which do not coincide with my own.

In some cases, the Early Years Specialist may recommend funding for additional assistance, either to allow for an additional staff member or to enable a reduction in the adult to child ratio.<\/p><p>In order to minimise any delays in the provision of supports, early learning and care providers are encouraged to submit applications for support (Access and Inclusion Profile) as early as possible.\u00a0\u00a0For the programme year that began in September 2019, the window for applications opened on 1st May.<\/p><p>Since the September 2019 programme call opened on May 1st, the average response time from submission of an Access and Inclusion Profile to conducting an observation visit for a child or children in the ECCE programme - which is necessary to determine the level of need - has been 26 days.\u00a0This is within the expected timeline as per the Access and Inclusion Profile guidance, which states that, following a review of the information provided, a member of the Better Start Access and Inclusion team will contact the pre-school within 4-6 weeks of submission.<\/p><p>Once an observation visit has taken place, an Early Years Specialist within Better Start completes a report, which goes through a review and appraisal process. On average the time from observation to final decision is 23 days.\u00a0Therefore, in total, from application to decision it takes on average 49 days to process an AIM application.<\/p><p>AIM payments for additional assistance (AIM Level 7) are made in line with the payments schedule published in August 2019 (see table). The first payment run was completed on 13 September 2019, three weeks after the commencement of the 2019\/2020 ECCE programme year. \u00a0Weekly catch-up payments are also facilitated to minimise the timeframe for services from approval to payment. In order to make an AIM Level 7 payment there must be an approved registration for the AIM child which reflects the level of AIM support awarded.\u00a0\u00a0Early learning and care services are informed of this requirement as part of the decision notification process and regular communications (including timelines) are published on the PIP provider portal.<\/p><p>With regard to the back-dating of AIM funding for an additional staff member, it should be noted that this type of support is only one of\u00a0a range of supports provided under AIM. Where an application for AIM support is submitted, an Early Years Specialist determines the most appropriate type of support, depending on the needs of the child in the context of the early learning and care setting.\u00a0The most appropriate support may not be an additional staff member. It would therefore not be appropriate for an additional staff member to be recruited until funding for this purpose is approved.<\/p><p>In cases where a child has additionally complex needs or complex medical needs such that he or she could not reasonably be expected to attend the preschool service for an observation visit without AIM targeted supports already being in place, the observation visit may be delayed until after the supports are in place at the discretion of the Better Start Early Years Specialist Service. In such situations, targeted supports can be approved prior to an observation visit, but approval by the Better Start Early Years Specialist Service is required, and payment in relation to targeted supports cannot be backdated to a date before the date on which approval is given.<\/p><p>In cases where a child has been allocated AIM Level 7 support in the first year of the ECCE Programme, and the child continues the ECCE Programme in the same early learning and care setting, provided there are no changes e.g. to the adult-child ratio in the room, approval for the second year of funding may be granted without a second visit to the setting.\u00a0(An observation visit\u00a0will have taken place in the first year of the child's participation.)<\/p><p><b>AIM Level 7 Payment Schedule<\/b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Payment Date<\/th>       <th>% paid<\/th>       <th>Cumulative paid<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>13th September 2019\u00a0<\/td>       <td>25% of contract value<\/td>       <td>25 % of contract value<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>11th\u00a0October 2019\u00a0<\/td>       <td>12.5% of contract value<\/td>       <td>37.5 % of contract value<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>29th November 2019\u00a0<\/td>       <td>12.5% of contract value<\/td>       <td>50 % of contract value<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>10th January 2020\u00a0<\/td>       <td>12.5% of contract value<\/td>       <td>62.5% of contract value<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>21st February 2020\u00a0<\/td>       <td>12.5% of contract value<\/td>       <td>75% of contract value<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>27th March 2020\u00a0<\/td>       <td>12.5% of contract value<\/td>       <td>87.5% of contract value<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>22nd May 2020\u00a0<\/td>       <td>12.5% of contract value<\/td>       <td>100 % of contract value<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p><b>Please Note:<\/b><\/p><p>-\u00a0Payments may vary throughout the year, if there are any changes to approved funding.<\/p><p>-\u00a0Catch up payments will be made to services on a weekly basis.<\/p><p>-\u00a0This schedule is for information purposes only.

Between July 2015 and October 2019, some 247,296 jobseekers had commenced their engagement period with the JobPath service.  Of this number, 52% were unemployed for over three years.  This group, in particular, faces significant barriers when seeking to enter or return to employment in the labour market.<\/p><p>The numbers of clients to engage with the JobPath service for the first three years and their employment outcomes are set out in Table 1 below. It should be noted that many clients who are currently engaged with JobPath are still in the first phase of the service. They have not had sufficient time with the service to have gained employment nor sustain that employment for up to 52 weeks. Furthermore, as many clients who have commenced employment will have done so less than 52 weeks ago the numbers sustaining employment for 52 weeks is expected to increase over time. This is particularly relevant for those clients who commenced an engagement with the service in 2018. <\/p><p>The number of Jobseekers engaged with JobPath and the number of current subsequent engagements is set out in Table 2 below.  <\/p><p>The number of registration fees paid in respect of JobPath referrals since 2015 as well as the number of registration fees paid in respect of the same person twice, three and four times are set out in Table 3 below. Registration fees are incurred when a client engages with the JobPath service and agrees a personal progression plan.

In order to provide for sustainable pensions and to facilitate a longer working life, legislation passed in 2011 provides for an increase in the State pension age in three separate stages.  In 2014, the State pension age was standardised at 66.  This will be increased to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028.  The Roadmap for Pensions Reform 2018-2023 has stated that future changes in State pension age after 2035 will be based on research into life expectancy. <\/p>  <p>  This sustainability is vital, if the current workers, who fund State pension payments through their PRSI, are to receive a pension themselves when they reach retirement age.  It is the only feasible solution which does not involve reducing pension rates to pensioners (which would result in an increase in the rate of poverty among older people), or reducing other significant areas of Government expenditure (such as other payments made by my Department). <\/p>  <p>  In most cases, it is hoped that workers will continue to work up to State pension age, and so the question of claiming a social protection payment would not arise.  Where this is not possible and a person ceases their employment before reaching State pension age, they may apply for either the jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance schemes.  Jobseeker&rsquo;s payments are currently paid to eligible jobseekers aged 18 to 66 years subject to the person satisfying the general scheme conditions. Social Welfare legislation states that jobseeker payments may be made until the person reaches pensionable age provided they satisfy the necessary contribution conditions.   <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that there is no legally mandated retirement age in the State, and the age at which employees retire is a matter for the contract of employment between them and their employers.  While such a contract may have been entered into with a retirement age of 65, in the context of the previous State pension arrangements, there is no legal impediment to the employer and employee agreeing to increase the duration of employment for one or more years, if both parties wish to do so.  In this regard, the Workplace Relations Commission has produced a Code of Practice on Longer Working and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) has published guidance material for employers on the use of fixed-term contracts beyond normal retirement age.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputies. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112600073#WRS05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Pension (Non-Contributory) Applications","counter":1242,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112600073#WRS05900"},{"type":"question","counter":1243,"qnumday":480,"qnumall":"[48755\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112600073#WRS06000","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the status of an application for a State pension by a person (details supplied) in County Kildare.","asker":"1276","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1244,"content":"<p>An application for state pension non-contributory was received from the person concerned on 7 November 2019.

In support of these the department has issued Technical Guidance Documents (TGD A - M) which provide technical guidance on how to comply with the building regulations in practical terms.  <\/p>  <p>  TGD D (Materials and Workmanship) requires &ldquo;proper materials&rdquo;. This means materials that are fit for the use for which they are intended and for the conditions in which they are to be used, and includes materials which comply with an appropriate Irish Standard.<\/p>  <p>  The National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) have issued the Timber Frame Dwellings Standard, IS 440, which sets the requirements for construction of timber frame dwellings. TGD A (Structure) recognises and takes account of the IS 440 timber frame standard for dwellings. NSAI facilitates industry standards committees in the area of timber construction materials. <\/p>  <p>  The Office of Public Works is leading an action of the Climate Action Plan to develop a roadmap to promote greater use of lower-carbon building material alternatives in construction.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is leading a range of additional actions to work with industry stakeholders to increase the use of low carbon materials, taking into account international best practice. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112600074#WRT05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1264"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Tax Review","counter":1316,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112600074#WRT06000"},{"type":"question","counter":1317,"qnumday":505,"qnumall":"[48566\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112600074#WRT06100","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the progress the baseline review group has made regarding the local property tax to date in 2019; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1318,"content":"<p>In May 2018, a Local Government Funding (Baseline) Review Group was established\u00a0to consider the methodology to determine local authority funding baselines, to inform the distribution of any additional\u00a0funding that could become available for general, operational purposes.<\/p>  <p>  Recommendations were received from the Review Group in August 2018 and these fall to be considered in the context of the review\u00a0of Local Property Tax (LPT) undertaken by the Department of Finance.\u00a0 When the ongoing process in relation to the consideration of that Review of LPT is concluded by the Department of Finance, the work\u00a0of the Baseline Review Group will be considered further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112600074#WRT06200","answer":true,"speaker":"1265"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Planning Data","counter":1319,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112600074#WRT06300"},{"type":"question","counter":1320,"qnumday":506,"qnumall":"[48551\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112600074#WRT06400","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the number of Part 8 housing planning applications that have been refused planning permission in each local authority in each of the years 2016 to 2018 and to date in 2019; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1321,"content":"<p>Local authority \"own\" developments prescribed in Part 8 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, as amended, are exempted development under section 4 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, and therefore no planning application is required for local authority development of this nature. <\/p>  <p>  Section 179 of the 2000 Act provides that, with certain exceptions, Part 8 type development proposals require a public consultation process and the consent by resolution of the elected members of the local authority in order to proceed.

The building regulations set the minimum performance requirements that a building must achieve, to provide for the health, safety and welfare of people in and about buildings. The building regulations apply to the design and construction of a building, material alterations or extensions of a building, provision of certain services, fittings and equipment and the material change of use of a building. The requirements of the building regulations are set out in 12 parts classified as Parts A to M. Technical Guidance Documents (TGDs) provide guidance on how to comply with the building regulations in practical terms. Where works are carried out in accordance with the guidance, this will, prima facie, indicate compliance with the requirements of the building regulations. <\/p><p>Part B\/TGD B of the building regulations deals with Fire Safety.

The review also considers common and emerging building trends, international developments and events, matters relating to external fire spread, external fire resistance, internal fire resistance, cladding systems, sprinklers, etc. It is intended to publish a draft for public consultation in 2020.<\/p><p>In parallel with the full review, my Department is preparing additional guidance to TGD B 2006 on open plan apartments, which will be published shortly. Currently there is no guidance in the TGD on this increasingly popular form of apartment design. This will provide both local authorities and industry with greater clarity on how to demonstrate compliance with Part B for open plan apartments, promote greater consistency across the country and streamline the process for demonstrating compliance.<\/p><p>Separately, following the Grenfell Tower fire tragedy, in June 2017, I established a Fire Safety Task Force to examine fire safety in Ireland.  As part of the work of the Task Force, my Department requested fire services to identify medium-to-high rise (greater than eighteen metres, or greater than six storeys in height) buildings fitted with cladding systems.  Fire services were also asked to consider whether use of their power under section 18(6) of the Fire Services Acts 1981 and 2003 &ndash; to require the person having control over the building to carry out a fire safety assessment of the building, including the cladding system &ndash; was warranted.  <\/p><p>Countrywide, fire safety assessments were required in respect of 210 buildings &ndash; including 103 residential buildings.  To support these assessments, as part of the work of the Task Force, guidance was developed and issued in December 2017.  The guidance provides information on methods and standards to be used in assessment of cladding systems, as well as interim fire safety measures for application, pending completion of remedial works to cladding systems, where necessary.  The guidance will be of assistance to those carrying out assessments, as well as to fire services who appraise assessments provided to them in respect of identified buildings.<\/p><p>The most recent information provided to my Department by fire services indicates that, so far, eight buildings have been identified where some remedial works to cladding systems will be necessary.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112600074#WRT06587","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water and Sewerage Schemes Status","counter":1325,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112600074#WRT06600"},{"type":"question","counter":1326,"qnumday":508,"qnumall":"[48612\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112600074#WRT06700","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the status of the sewage treatment works at the unfinished housing estates (details supplied) in County Donegal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1327,"content":"<p>On 23 July this year my Department launched the multi-annual Developer Provided Water Services Infrastructure Resolution Programme.

The Wildlife Acts afford protection to a range of habitats and species and provide for regulation and control of activities that impinge on biodiversity, such as hunting and trade.<\/p>  <p>  The legislative framework in place to protect our natural heritage is further strengthened by the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011 SI No 477\/2011, which also fall under the remit of my Department. These Regulations transpose the EU Birds Directive and the EU Habitats Directive into national law, and provide for protection of certain habitats and species across the European Union, giving a framework for specific measures to be taken to target areas of concern in each Member State. <\/p>  <p>  The main instruments provided for are the designation of Special Protection Areas (SPA), aimed at the protection of threatened species of birds, and Special Areas of Conservation (SAC), aimed at protecting other animal species and habitats. Ireland is required under the terms of the EU Birds Directive to designate Special Protection Areas (SPAs) for the protection of endangered species of wild birds. <\/p>  <p>  A programme to identify and designate SPA sites in Ireland commenced in 1985 and a review of the Irish network of SPA sites identified at that time a number of sites that required re-notification. The necessary SPA survey work was undertaken and all of Ireland&rsquo;s list of over 150 SPAs have been notified to landowners and published in a fashion that is consistent with the requirements of the Birds Directive.<\/p>  <p>  The SPA referred to in the question was selected for designation as it met a number of conditions relating to protection of listed species. Sites can only be designated on solid scientific grounds, where there is evidence-based justification for doing so. <\/p>  <p>  There are no plans in my Department, at this time, to undertake further scientific surveys in the SPA concerned. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112600075#WRU05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"}]
