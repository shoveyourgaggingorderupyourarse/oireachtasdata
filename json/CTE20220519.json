Please note that to limit the risk of spreading Covid-19, the service encourages all members, visitors and witnesses to continue to wear face masks when moving around the campus or when in close proximity to others, be respectful of other people's physical space and adhere to any other public health advice.<\/p> <p>  Members of the committee attending remotely must continue to do so from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit.<\/p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee.  He is accompanied by Mr. Paul Southern, deputy director of audit, from the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.<\/p> <p>  This morning we engage with officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to examine the following matters: the 2020 appropriation accounts for Vote 11 - Office of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform; Vote 12 - Superannuation and Retired Allowances; Vote 39 - Office of Government Procurement; and Vote 43 - Office of the Government Chief Information Officer.  Also, from the Comptroller and Auditor General's 2020 Report on the Accounts of the Public Services, we will look at Chapter 4 - Vote accounting and budget management.<\/p> <p>  The Department has been advised that the committee may also wish to examine the following matters: the format and content of the appropriation accounts; public private partnerships; the Benefacts database; and the Department's role in the recruitment process for the CEO of Horse Racing Ireland.<\/p> <p>  We are joined in the committee room by the following officials from the Department: Mr. David Moloney, Secretary General, Ms Mary O'Donohue, director, Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, Mr. David Feeney, principal officer, corporate office, Mr. John Pender, principal officer, work and pensions division, and Ms Niamh Callaghan, principal officer, expenditure policy division.<\/p> <p>  As usual, I remind all those in attendance to ensure their mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off.<\/p> <p>  Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practices of the House as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  As such witnesses are within the precincts of Leinster House, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentations they make to the committee.  This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they may say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse that privilege and it is my duty as Cathaoirleach to ensure it is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, the witnesses will be directed to discontinue their remarks and it is imperative that they comply with such direction.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government, or the merits or objective of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside of the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  I call the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022051900002#A01000","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652949000,"counter":14,"content":"<p>As members are aware, the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is the Accounting Office for a number of Votes, reflecting the diverse responsibility of the Department for the development and administration of a number of key cross-departmental functions in specialised and technical areas.  Separate to the accountability that the Vote-holding entails, and arising from its statutory responsibility in relation to central control and oversight of public spending, the Department sets the general accounting policies for all appropriation accounts, and issues binding directions around public financial management and procedures, and the corporate governance of public bodies.<\/p> <p>  I am happy to report that I issued clear audit opinions in relation to each of the appropriation accounts for 2020 being considered this morning.<\/p> <p>  The 2020 appropriation account for Vote 11 - Office of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, records gross expenditure of almost &euro;42 million.  This spending was divided between two spending programmes, which were broadly similar in scale and which comprise the core administration activity of the Department.  At the end of 2020, the Department had a surplus of &euro;4.2 million relative to its budget and this amount was surrendered.<\/p> <p>  Vote 12 - superannuation and retired allowances is used to pay pensions, primarily to retired civil servants across all Departments and offices, and to retired prison officers.  Pension payments for other public servants are charged, directly or indirectly, to other Votes, including those for education, health, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Army pensions, and to the Central Fund of the Exchequer.<\/p> <p>  The gross spend on Vote 12 in 2020 amounted to &euro;628 million.  Appropriations-in-aid, mainly comprising employee pension contributions, amounted to &euro;366 million in 2020.  The receipts into the Vote were significantly ahead of the level forecast.  Mainly because of this, the net outturn on the Vote for 2020 was a surplus of &euro;113 million, which was for surrender at the year end.  A similar level of surrender of surplus occurred in 2019.<\/p> <p>  The Office of Government Procurement, which is often referred to as OGP, carries out specialised functions in relation to the procurement of goods and services by public bodies in Ireland.  The 2020 appropriation account for Vote 39 - Office of Government Procurement records gross expenditure of &euro;16.5 million.  The surplus for surrender at the end of 2020 amounted to &euro;2.3 million.<\/p> <p>  Vote 43 - Office of the Government Chief Information Officer was established as a new vote in 2020, having previously been a programme within Vote 11.  As a result, the appropriation account appears without comparator prior-year figures.  Like the OGP, the office remains legally part of the Department.  The office provides an ICT shared service to a number of Departments and offices, which includes the provision of managed desktop services, including telephone, email and productivity applications.  The office also provides Government cloud and Government network services, including application hosting, and voice, video and data services across the public service.  The 2020 appropriation account for Vote 43 records gross expenditure of &euro;21.4 million.<\/p> <p>  Chapter 4 on Vote accounting and budget management is a recurrent annual report which aggregates and summarises the results of all appropriation accounts.  I publish this report because there is no other source of aggregated appropriation account information.<\/p> <p>  There has been a strong upward trend in voted expenditure in recent years, with an even greater increase in 2020 as a result of additional expenditure requirements due to the Covid-19 pandemic.   The total gross expenditure for all 45 Votes in 2020 was &euro;70.1 billion.  After the deduction of receipts retained in Votes totalling &euro;2.8 billion, net voted expenditure for the year was &euro;67.3 billion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022051900002#A01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1652949000,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Moloney and this is his first appearance as Accounting Officer.

My prepared statement is probably a little longer than five minutes but I will try to keep it to that, maybe by taking some of it as read, with the Chair's permission.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General said, there are four Votes under my Department, namely, those of the office of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, superannuation and retirement allowances, the OGP and the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer.  I understand that the committee has expressed an interest in examining the format and content of the appropriation accounts, public private partnerships, PPP, and the Benefacts database.  With the Chair's permission, I will not go through the detail of the Votes, which is set out in the opening statement I have submitted.  There are some surpluses to return to the Exchequer, which relate mostly to the timing of staffing and pensions.<\/p> <p>  As the Comptroller and Auditor General noted, the Vote of the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer is new.  It is an important innovation and the need to establish it emerged as a result of the build to share initiative, which was a pillar of the 2015 public service ICT strategy, and that remains central in the recently published Connecting Government 2030 - A Digital and ICT Strategy for Ireland&rsquo;s Public Service.<\/p> <p>  In regard to chapter 4 of the report, the Comptroller and Auditor General summarised the main amounts.  The total gross amount was &euro;70.1 billion and the net figure was &euro;67.3 billion, after deducting realised appropriations-in-aid totalling &euro;2.8 billion.  There were a number of changes to the Estimates in 2020, relating to the Covid pandemic and the restructuring of a number of Departments.  The strong position of the public finances before Covid put the Government in a position to deliver very significant supports in regard to Covid.  As the impact of the crisis recedes, the summer economic statement of 2021, agreed by the Government and published last July, set out a fiscal strategy, including a medium-term expenditure strategy.  This is based on growth and core expenditure each year broadly in line with the estimated trend growth of the economy, and will facilitate continued investment in our economy and society to deliver on improvements in infrastructure and public services while reducing the deficit to underpin the sustainability of the public finances.  It is the role of my Department to implement a credible and sustainable public expenditure framework in tandem with reforms supporting excellence in public service delivery, strategic policymaking and public governance structures.  To achieve these, my Department sets out policies and guidelines for Departments to follow.  In order for effective and transparent management of public expenditure and achievement of value for money, it is important our colleagues across the public service apply these policies and guidelines in their organisations.<\/p> <p>  On the format and content of the appropriation accounts, the committee has written to the Department in respect of the manner in which a number of issues are dealt with in the appropriation account, including pay, funding received from European funds and legal costs paid by Departments, which I will now briefly address.  On foot of earlier requests from the committee, we took in the 2021 accounts to revise the presentation of legal costs.  This will allow for an examination of costs arising in the year of account and also allow us to disclose the total number of cases settled in that year.  We will, of course, review the impact of that change, along with any views of the committee or the Comptroller and Auditor General, to see whether any further changes are needed in 2022.<\/p> <p>  The Department also took action to provide for the disclosure of Accounting Officer salary in the 2021 account and committed to examining this issue further for 2022.  I acknowledge that the committee has sought further changes in this regard to provide actual levels of remuneration, rather than as set out in the circular.  There is a need to have regard to potential legal issues that may arise in this instance, but the Department is happy to consider this further, with a view to the 2022 account and possibly also as an additional note to the 2021 account.  We are also reviewing the points raised in respect of greater disclosure regarding pay and will engage in consultation with other Departments on this issue shortly.  The Department also continues to progress the wider reform of the accounting framework for central government in order to align our framework with the international public sector accounting standard.  We are currently reviewing a set of 12 standards as a priority and will write to committee members shortly to seek their further views.<\/p> <p>  On public private partnerships, significant infrastructure projects have been developed on behalf of the State through the use of PPP procurement.  Some of the advantages associated with PPPs include that they allow the public sector to avail of greater private sector expertise and innovation and that the private partner assumes responsibility for a considerable portion of the risk.  The contracts tend to be long-term arrangements, typically spanning 25 years or more.  The Department&rsquo;s role in PPPs is to maintain and develop the general policy framework within which PPPs operate.  It has had no direct involvement in the procurement or delivery of individual PPP projects.  Therefore, the delivery of projects through the use of PPPs is, in the first instance, a matter for the relevant Departments.  As part of the review of the national development plan, NDP, the Department undertook a review of PPP policy.  Broadly speaking, the review found the PPP policy framework was robust and that the current guidance was fit for purpose, with a track record of successful delivery.  Hence, PPPs remain an option for public procurement where they provide the best value for money, with risk transfer forming an important element of that assessment, and we will continue to monitor the role they can play.<\/p> <p>  The year 2021 saw my Department enter its final funding arrangements with Benefacts, covering the three-month period to March 2022.  This agreement was primarily to enable Benefacts to cease its operations in a timely, orderly and compliant manner.  Benefacts was a pathfinder project established in 2014 amid heightened disquiet among the public concerning the charity sector, in particular.  During 2020, my Department undertook an evidence-based review, which found the environment had altered substantially.  In reaching its decision, my Department considered a number of factors, including the Charities Regulator&rsquo;s production of a register of core data sets and transparency information, the vesting of policy ownership of the Department of Rural and Community Development of the State's relationship with the not-for-profit sector, and the persistence of state aid and procurement risks associated with the continued funding of this company.<\/p> <p>  Before concluding, I would like to update the committee on some of my Department&rsquo;s priorities for the sustainable management of public expenditure and driving and supporting the reform programme.  The progress we made in these areas in 2020 was set out in considerable detail in my Department's annual report of that year.  Our report for 2021 will be published shortly and I will be happy to forward it to the committee.  Looking ahead, our priorities continue to be to manage public expenditure at sustainable levels in a balanced, evidence-informed manner to support Ireland's economic, social and climate goals, alongside challenges such as the impacts of Brexit and Ukraine, and to drive reform and innovation across the civil and public service to improve service delivery to the public and enable strategic policymaking and public governance structures.<\/p> <p>  To develop and implement policy, my Department will continue to: produce multi-annual Estimates and expenditure statements that meet Government objectives and are consistent with the Government&rsquo;s agreed fiscal strategy; mainstream budgetary reforms and, through the Government's economic and evaluation service, drive capacity-building for evidence-informed policy in the Civil Service; enhance the governance, oversight and delivery of the new national development plan; manage public service pay and pension costs on a fiscally sustainable basis; continue to address the challenges posed by Brexit while maximising the opportunities and benefits to Ireland of EU membership; and lead the development and implementation of Civil Service Renewal 2030, which will build an innovative Civil Service organisation and workforce that delivers evidence-informed policy and services; while the Department will continue, in its leadership role, to drive digital transformation across the public service as well as lead a procurement reform programme to enable effective, sustainable and compliant procurement across the public service.<\/p> <p>  I take this opportunity to pay tribute to my colleagues in the Department for their hard work, the contributions they have made to delivering on our objectives over the past couple of very difficult years and their role in response to the Covid-19 pandemic in particular.  I thank the Chairman and committee members for their attention.  I look forward to our discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022051900002#B00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Moloney"},{"type":"speech","time":1652949000,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Moloney.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022051900002#B00200","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1652949000,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Moloney and welcome him to the meeting.

I hope to cover three areas.  The issue of the accountability of public representatives has been there for some time, particularly in respect of our pay.  Increasingly the public is demanding that same level of accountability particularly for senior civil and public servants.  There has been some correspondence between us and the Department committee regarding the remuneration packages for Secretaries General.  This may have been covered in the opening questioning from Deputy Carroll MacNeill.  Some politicians in this House have suggested that they take a reduction and that has turned out not to be true.  Having accountability in respect of people who suggest they are taking a reduction in their salary is actually quite important because they are clearly trying to court positive public opinion in suggesting they might take a reduction, but we need to know that the reduction has actually taken place.<\/p> <p>  That goes to the heart of our request for the remuneration packages for particular public servants.  It is not that anybody has a navel-gazing obsession with people's salaries.  It is about the accountability of ensuring something is done if was said was it done.  I am not clear whether Mr. Moloney's predecessor took the reduction in his new role that was suggested.  I may be wrong in the information provided, but my understanding in respect of that appointment is that we have a salary range but it is not clear what the exact salary details are.  I ask Mr. Moloney to talk to us about that.

I think it dealt with somewhere in the region of &euro;7.4 billion and, very often, it would receive funding from multiple sources, sometimes multiple State sources.  It was an open access database and was heavily used.  It took &euro;250,000 to close it down and this was after &euro;6 million had been spent since 2015, a lot of it State money - public money - and some of it from philanthropy.

I will explain properly what I am asking.  If the money is invested in social housing, which one cannot do all at once - private rented accommodation is a short-term interim solution that has become a long-term solution, unfortunately - either through the local authorities or an approved housing body, there is an asset in the form of a house which the local authority may sell to a tenant at a future date or continue renting, or which the approved housing body will continue renting.  In terms of the note in relation to value for money on that, can Mr. Moloney include in the calculation the fact that there is not an asset at the end of the process?

I am concerned about the process of the putting in place of public contracts, as a result of which a major cost is being added to the contracts.  I will cite the example of a contract with which I was directly involved.  It was a school premises where a new school needed to be built.  A State agency objected to the planning permission.  Even though that State agency was given an undertaking that the number of students in the school would not be increased further, it took the matter all the way to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  That State agency caused a delay to the provision of a school.<\/p> <p>  A second issue was a further delay arising from the time the tenders were submitted to the when a tender was accepted, as a result of which the pricing of the project had changed.  The lowest tenderer could not complete the project for the price the contractor tendered and it offered to submit a revised tender, which would still have been lower than the next lowest tender.  The Department refused to allow that.  It went to the second lowest tender and that contractor would not accept the project and neither would the third or fourth lowest tender.  The project was awarded to the fifth lowest tenderer that tendered for it.  There was a price difference of approximately &euro;700,000 between the tender price that was finally accepted and what the revised tender of the lowest tenderer would have been, if accepted.  That did not represent good value for the taxpayer.  Surely there must be a process for dealing with those problems.  A State agency objected to planning for a State project and despite entering into discussions on it, that State agency did not back down.  There was also a delay in processing the tendering and even getting the project ready for tendering.  How does Mr. Moloney envisage such an issue would be dealt with in future?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022051900002#L00200","speaker":"1523"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652949000,"counter":277,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will know, in terms of our setting out the guidelines for procurement frameworks, we do not have that much visibility of individual projects.

As a result of the fiduciary and other duties and statutory or other responsibilities State agencies have, it is not always possible to avoid it, but I do not have oversight of the specific issue.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the difficulties that arise, particularly in the current circumstances around the length of time that passes between a tender being accepted and the project being initiated, which can sometimes happen, this year we have tried to introduce some flexibility into the public works contract in January.  We said there could be a more flexible arrangement with new contracts to take account of that time factor.  We are also encouraging contracting parties to minimise the time involved.  In a zero inflation environment the time factor is one thing, but in a higher inflation environment the time between tender awards and implementation needs to be minimised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022051900002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Moloney"},{"type":"speech","time":1652949000,"counter":278,"content":"<p>With regard to the system in Departments, whether it be the Office of Public Works, the Department of Health or the Department of Education, does the Mr. Moloney accept the process involved from the time we decide on a project, to it going for and securing planning, to getting it up and running is far too slow?  Does he accept that process needs to be reviewed, given that in the private sector there is a far faster turnover time for projects from start to finish.

Last week, the Government announced a fund in excess of &euro;500 million to meet more than 70% of construction costs that are related to inflation.  As I understand it, the scheme is not time-bound.  It is retrospective and goes back to 1 January this year.  It covers increased energy costs.  While there is no doubt but that energy costs have gone up, energy on its own is not the major part of inflation in construction.  It is significant, in the context of road construction and things like that, where heavy machinery is being used.  We know from previous discussions we had with the board of the children's hospital, there is recognition and provision for 4% inflation.  Once it goes over 4%, they can make a claim for it.  Will the Government provision of that fund potentially add further costs to the children's hospital in respect of price inflation on that project?   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022051900002#M02500","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652949000,"counter":308,"content":"<p>I will take the children's hospital piece first.

What is the role of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform when it comes to the question of public health and its budget?  The health budget has grown significantly, year on year, since 2016.  The increase has been significant and the budget has almost doubled.  However, for every aspect of health service that I deal with, including child services, carers and adolescent services, the waiting lists are growing exponentially.  It seems we are putting money into a black hole and no service is provided.  I will ask the Taoiseach about the issue under Questions on Policy and Legislation.

Is it the case that it is not involved?  In speaking about long-term planning, I am talking about saving money for the taxpayer.  For instance, local authorities undertake their five-year development plans, but the implementation of those plans is then subject to the whim of Irish Water because houses cannot be built unless Irish Water is prepared to install services.<\/p><p>Now the planning regulator is intervening.  In order to carry out long-term planning, we need to have a 20-year programme rather than a five-year programme.  Would Mr. Moloney accept that the way in which it is currently structured will result in a significant long-term cost to the taxpayer?<\/p><p> Turning to the health budget, the number of people working in the HSE has increased from 103,000 to more than 132,000, an increase of more than 27%.  This is about saving money in the health service and whether Mr. Moloney's Department can examine such an issue.  There has been a 27% increase in the total number of staff, including administrative staff, doctors and nurses, over a six-year period, but the one area in which there has not been an increase is public health nurses.  If we want to keep people out of hospitals, we will need to have more people on the ground.  In fact, the number of public health nurses increased by less than 4% in that period, from 1,460 to 1,523.  In the interests of saving money for the taxpayer, can the Department examine such issues and decide it needs to review certain aspects of a given Department's policy, rather than wait for that Department to make a proposal to be examined?  There is a considerable problem with the lack of long-term planning.  Five-year plans are being undertaken by local authorities, but that no longer works because that is a very short timeframe in which to put in infrastructure.  For instance, the Ringaskiddy bypass is being built in Cork, where the landowners were served notices in November 2014.  Eight years later, we are only turning the sod, without even having a contract yet in place.  The general structure does not seem to be working.  Is the Department looking at that aspect of reform?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022051900002#Q03000","speaker":"1523","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652949000,"counter":442,"content":"<p>Broadly, Project Ireland 2040 is a long-term plan for capital and setting capital expenditure ceilings is a function of the Minister, so it is something in which this Department is involved.

I mentioned dental services earlier.  We understand that Mr. Moloney&rsquo;s Department is not going to deal with the minutiae of the interactions between the Department of Health and the HSE.  Nevertheless, it sanctions the large health budget every year for both organisations.  Between now and whenever that budget is sanctioned, will Mr. Moloney ask them that specific question?  We in the committee may disagree on many other issues, between the Government and the Opposition, but not on Sl&aacute;intecare.  If public health nurses are not provided and if the complement is not increased, the point Deputy Burke articulated well will be a problem.<\/p> <p>  The case I referred to related to dental services.  There is no public dental service system at the moment.  A contract that had been won with private dentists collapsed and, as far as I can ascertain, it has not been resurrected, in the midlands at least.  Moreover, the school dental scheme is non-existent in most counties.  In Laois and Offaly, it has not existed for a number of years and children are not seen in primary school or within the first three years of secondary school.  Some of them leave school before any contact is made with their parents or anyone else about it.  Children complete their junior certificate without having been seen by a public dentist.  It has been a few years since I was in school, in the 1960s, but I recall being seen in third class.<\/p> <p>  Will Mr. Moloney ask the Department of Health why this is?  I am raising this in a respectful way.  We are trying to alert him to what is going on here.  He will have to sign off on this budget, which I know he will do with good intentions, and we will approve it with good intentions in the House after debates and so on.  We have highlighted just two examples.  This is at the centre of Sl&aacute;intecare.  If there cannot be public dentists providing a school dental scheme, and if the point Deputy Burke made about public health nurses is not addressed, it will have a very significant impact on the delivery of Sl&aacute;intecare.  It is central.  We are trying to keep people out of hospital.  If we do not deal with oral health in children when they are young, there will be awful health outcomes, which is already the case, as doctors have told me, because oral health is not being dealt with.  We are accumulating problems for child and adolescent mental health services for children on the autism spectrum because we are not reaching children in time.  Similarly, if elderly and infirm people who live at home are not seen by public health nurses or if those nurses are not available to deal with their circumstances, they will end up in nursing homes or accident and emergency units.  The system is just piling up.  My understanding is that other countries look at the front-line services and start building them.  I have attended meetings with representatives from the HSE at which - I am not kidding - your brain would turn into jelly after an hour.<\/p><p>You get all the management-speak and everything else but what you do not get is what they are doing to actually fill the gaps in public services.<\/p><p> We are trying to get Sl&aacute;intecare.  I understand Mr. Moloney cannot see everything that is going on.  As any public representative will tell him, and I am saying this in a respectful way, the services at that end are just not there and it is so frustrating.  We are held accountable by members of the public because they believe we can change things.  As I said, we could fill an articulated truck with money on Kildare Street, drive it over to the Miesian Plaza, start offloading it with a forklift truck and put another &euro;10 billion into the health service but, as things stand, it would not change matters because of how the system operates.<\/p><p> There are some people in the HSE trying to do good work.  I meet and speak to them and they have shared their frustrations with me.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is the Department that signs off on expenditure.  The Department of Health is the biggest spending Department.  I believe its budget is bigger than that of the Department of Social Protection, or both Departments may spend around the same amount.  With the Department of Social Protection, however, we can see where the funding is going.  It is more straightforward.  I understand health is complex and providing health services is complex.  There is no perfect health system on the planet but some countries do it much better than we do.  We are doing terrible for the amount of money we put into health.  We are a developed country.  We go around with our chests out saying how great we are doing, which is good, and that we are among the richest countries in the world.  Why, 100 years on, can we not have a health system that provides a school dental scheme?  That scheme has collapsed since the 1960s.  There were always loads of public health nurses but there are not now, despite the increase in population.  Before Mr. Moloney signs off on the budget for health, will he contact the Secretary General of the Department of Health &ndash; I am not sure if he has a direct line to the CEO of the HSE &ndash; and raise those two issues with him?  I am asking him to do that as the new Secretary General.<\/p><p> I wish to revert for a moment to the Benefacts issue.  Approximately &euro;14 billion goes into the not-for-profit sector each year.  The Benefacts database monitored that and provided information on it.  It stopped because the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform was signing off on it, which meant that Department was central to the database being maintained.  Despite other Departments and Accounting Officers not making a business case, is there not a business case for having that database?  Less than &euro;1 million - I believe it was &euro;950,000 - was the biggest annual spend on it.  That seems like a small amount of money relative to &euro;14 billion.  It seems that &euro;1 million to allow politicians, journalists and, indeed, civil servants to have information at their fingertips from Benefacts is a relatively small amount.  Forget about what everybody else says, including those who have said there is no business case.  Does Mr. Moloney not think it would be good to have that database?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022051900002#R00800","speaker":"1491","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652949000,"counter":450,"content":"<p>Clearly, it is good to have information on the community and voluntary sector.

Mr. Moloney&rsquo;s Department took a great interest in this.  I have a letter here from the Department dated 16 April 2019.  Last week, I raised with the Taoiseach the monitoring of this project, about which I have articulated my huge concerns.  There was a single contractor and all of the other bidders backed out.  I know the reasons for that because I heard some of them and they are clear at different stages.  I do not get any pleasure out of saying this, but some of the chickens are coming home to roost, including, for example, with regards to the delay in the roll-out.  Eir, a private company, has a fair amount of control over the pace at which this project moves because two or three years before the contract was signed, it was able to capture those households and premises that were easiest to serve.  The project is now moving into more remote areas, as a cursory glance at the map of the national broadband scheme would tell us.  I saw it first four years ago and raised it with the then Minister at the time.<\/p> <p>  We know the national broadband scheme is way behind schedule.  My understanding is that 44,000 homes and premises had been passed in mid-April, whereas 115,000 were to have been passed by January.  The first plan was revised because of the Covid lockdown.  The second plan is being revised because of Covid, even though the telecommunications sector was not prohibited from working during the 2021 Covid restrictions at that time.  However, another plan was then put in place and it too has since fallen behind.  By mid-April, 44,000 homes had been passed.  According to correspondence we received from the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications last week, it reckons the project is 12 or 13 months behind.  It accepts that the company, National Broadband Ireland, NBI, has a case for a delay of eight and a half months.  I raised this specifically with the Taoiseach last week.  There is a variation and a gap here now.  Penalties should apply.  According to the letter from the Department, that is confirmed.  I do not have the exact wording as I do not have the letter with me but that is my reading of it.  I asked the Taoiseach to monitor this.  Is Mr. Moloney aware of the issue and will his Department ensure that penalties are levied on NBI for failure to meet the targets?

There are issues related to Covid and how that was stretched and stretched, perhaps further than it should have been.  It is the first time I have seen committed to paper that the Department has conceded there should not be a 12- or 13-month delay but a delay of eight and a half months.  It uses wording around that and states that penalties should apply in this case.  I said this to the Taoiseach yesterday and today I am asking the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to ensure that happens.<\/p> <p>  The national broadband plan is a very precarious and complex project.

The letter referred to the project as a huge leap of faith, questioned the justification for spending scarce public funding on this scale and noted the unprecedented risk involved given that the Exchequer was committing &euro;2.7 billion to the project, whereas the only risk for the operator was &euro;175 million of its own funds.

If they are that fragile, one would have thought that conservation and digitisation would be the optimum.  I also do not understand why we do not see the benefit of these.

I am open to correction on this but we should write to the Secretary General of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine about it.

It was around homicide classification and the investigation by the Garda in 2017.  Essentially, this letter is giving us some reassurance that a report was published in December 2019.  The letter states, \"the classification did not impact the quality of the subsequent investigations undertaken [but they wanted] ... to prevent a reoccurrence ...\"  To be honest, what concerns me about that and the reason I wanted to raise it is there has been a recent newspaper article that makes me doubt that information.  A guy, a civilian, was appointed by the Policing Authority.  I am reading from a newspaper article.  Mr. John Mooney wrote it but I cannot see the date.  I can provide it to the clerk to the committee.  The article states, \"a civilian appointed by the Policing Authority to lead the GSAS after an international competition, resigned unexpectedly in 2019 shortly after accepting the role.\"  There had been a whistleblower.  She was the deputy head of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Analysis Service.  She was concerned with the classification.  This is fairly recent.<\/p> <p>  I do not want to accept this at face value where there are reports that indicate that there are people who are pretty much saying otherwise.
