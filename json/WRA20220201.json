RSE is required at all levels, from primary through to Senior Cycle. <\/p>  <p>  All schools are required to have an RSE policy that is developed in consultation with the school community, including school management, parents, teachers and students as appropriate.

Updated guidance for schools on Practical Steps for the Deployment of Good Ventilation Practices in Schools was provided at the end of May following the work of an expert group that carefully considered the role of ventilation in managing COVID-19. The updated guidance for schools is also fully in line with the most recent guidance on non-healthcare building ventilation during COVID-19, published by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre November 2021.   \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  To provide additional support in the context of Covid-19 the payment of a minor works grant totalling &euro;45m for primary schools and special schools, plus a once-off Covid-19 minor works funding of &euro;17m for post-primary schools, was issued in December 2021. All recognised schools in the free scheme have received their grants.   \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Given that each school setting is different, individual schools are best placed to decide how best to use this funding to address their particular needs. Specialist advice\/assistance of a Chartered Engineer or Registered Architect is an important source of support for schools.\u00a0 This will help ensure that appropriate solutions are being put in place to address ventilation issues including advice on whether a HEPA Air Cleaner Unit is required to deal with a poorly ventilated room.\u00a0 There is no one solution that fits all scenarios, each application requires bespoke analysis and selection of the appropriate unit(s) matched to the specific room size and volume.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Air cleaning devices are not a substitute for good ventilation but can be considered pending the completion of interventions\/works where poor ventilation persists. This is line with the Expert Group recommendations. Air filtration does not negate the need for natural ventilation and opening windows as required. Furthermore Mike Ryan of the World Health Organisation&rsquo;s Health Emergencies Programme has advised that schools not rely solely on air filters.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In the case where a school has difficulty engaging a Chartered Engineer or Registered \u00a0Architect the Department can assist, with a dedicated ventilation team \u00a0available to support school principals in this regard.\u00a0 Schools that identify inadequate ventilation in a room can utilise their minor work grant or apply for emergency works grant assistance to address ventilation enhancements where the minor work grant does not cover the full cost of the works required.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  To date 19 schools have applied for additional funding\u00a0under the emergency works scheme to assist with ventilation.

A number of patronage changes have taken place in recent years in this context, resulting in the provision of an additional 11 multi-denominational Community National Schools (three of which already had a multi-denominational ethos). In addition in 2021, an Irish-medium gaelscoil transferred patronage from its Catholic patron to An Foras P&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta. This school now offers parents of junior infants the choice of undertaking an Ethics and Morality Programme or a Catholic Programme.<\/p>  <p>  In September 2022 another planned primary school patronage transfer, from Catholic patronage to the local Education and Training Board, to become a multi-denominational Community National School is expected to take place. <\/p>  <p>  The Department of Education has been engaging with representatives of the Irish Episcopal Conference (Catholic bishops) as the majority patron of schools nationwide with a view to developing an agreed approach to the next phase of the reconfiguration process.<\/p>  <p>  School communities who wish to explore the potential to transfer patronage should contact their school patron in the first instance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100067#WRF00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Facilities","counter":124,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100067#WRF00800"},{"type":"question","counter":125,"qnumday":103,"qnumall":"[4662\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100067#WRF00900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the strategies in place to offer mental health supports for primary and secondary students, including access to emotional well-being supports in schools; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1572","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":126,"content":"<p>While the Department of Health has responsibility for mental health services in Ireland, my Department has an important role to support the wellbeing and positive mental health of all our young people. My Department&rsquo;s approach to supporting wellbeing and mental health of young people is set out in its Wellbeing Policy Statement and Framework for Practice first published in 2018 and refreshed in 2019.  The approach proposed is a whole school and preventative approach which has multiple components that include providing children and young people with opportunities to:<\/p>  <p>-  build core social and emotional skills and competencies<\/p>  <p>-  experience supportive relationships within the school setting<\/p>  <p>-  be part of a school environment and culture that feels both physically and psychologically safe, in which they feel a sense of belonging and connectedness, that their voice is heard, and they feel supported<\/p>  <p>  Embedded in the whole-school approach is the recognition that members of the school community may have different needs at different times and that a continuum of support in relation to wellbeing should be made available.<\/p>  <p>  A broad range of supports, resources and professional learning opportunities are being provided to support schools to promote and support wellbeing and resilience by the Department&rsquo;s support services.  The services support schools to provide strong universal support at the level of whole school and classroom, more targeted support for some children and young people who may be at risk, and more individualised support for those with greatest need.  <\/p>  <p>  Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) which is mandatory in primary schools and up to Junior Cycle provides specific opportunities to enable a young person to understand himself or herself, to develop healthy relationships and to establish and maintain healthy patterns of behaviour.<\/p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) provides educational psychological support to all primary and post-primary schools. This involves direct support in the event of a critical incident, access to national and regional support and development work to build school capacity to support students, access to a NEPS psychologist for responses to queries arising, and access to individual pupil casework where there is need via a NEPS psychologist.<\/p>  <p>  NEPS, in common with many other psychological services and best international practice, has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. <\/p>  <p>  The NEPS Support and Development service, reaching an estimated 25,000 teachers annually, is an applied psychological service for school staff to help build their capability to respond to the wellbeing, academic, social and emotional needs of all students, and particularly those who are experiencing barriers to their wellbeing, learning, inclusion and participation. Professional learning activities to support children\/young people with social\/emotional\/mental health difficulties and to promote positive wellbeing in school include:<\/p>  <p>FRIENDS: Training teachers in the delivery of the FRIENDS programmes (&lsquo;Fun Friends&rsquo;, &lsquo;Friends for Life&rsquo; and &lsquo;My Friends Youth&rsquo;), which are evidence-based anxiety prevention and resilience building programmes, which foster self-concept and a sense of school belonging using Cognitive Behavioural Therapeutically-informed approaches. Friends programmes help students to develop resilience by teaching them effective strategies to cope with, problem solve and manage all kinds of emotional distress, including worry, stress, change and anxiety. The Incredible Years Teacher Classroom Management programme is an evidence-based programme that equips teachers to manage their classrooms effectively to prevent and reduce behavioural problems while promoting children&rsquo;s wellbeing and emotional and social competence. Since Covid-19 the training has been adapted to online format which increases accessibility for teachers. <\/p>  <p>  NEPS has developed a range of workshops on the promotion of wellbeing and resilience in schools which include upskilling school staff on the use and implementation of therapeutically-informed approaches in schools.  These include trauma-informed approaches, approaches based on the principles of cognitive behaviour therapy, and attachment-aware approaches. The approaches outlined in the workshops are based on research findings, on the experience of experts in their fields and on the experience of practicing psychologists working in schools. The workshops will be available to build the capability of school staff in both primary and post-primary settings, including for school leaders, teachers and SNAs. <\/p>  <p>  Post primary schools have recently received a copy of new Student Support Team Guidelines.  A Student Support Team is a student-focused mechanism put in place by a school in order to co-ordinate the support available for students in the school and to facilitate links to the community and other non-school support services. NEPS provides support to post primary schools in the setting up or review of Student Support Teams.  <\/p>  <p>  Also at post primary level, counselling is a key part of the role of the Guidance Counsellor, offered on an individual or group basis as part of a developmental learning process, at moments of personal crisis but also at key transition points. The Guidance Counsellor also identifies and supports the referral of students to external counselling agencies and professionals, as required. Each post primary school currently receives an allocation in respect of guidance provision, calculated by reference to the approved enrolment.  <\/p>  <p>  Wellbeing resources and supports for Leaving Certificate students are also available.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has built strong links with the Department of Health and both Departments are exploring ways to improve supports for young people, including around increased awareness, promoting help-seeking behaviour and sign-posting to the wide range of available services.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100067#WRF00950","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Examinations","counter":127,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100067#WRF01000"},{"type":"question","counter":128,"qnumday":104,"qnumall":"[4360\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100067#WRF01100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if her Department will facilitate a hybrid leaving certificate as operated in 2021.","asker":"1570","askee":"1582"},{"type":"question","counter":129,"qnumday":111,"qnumall":"[4824\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100067#WRF01200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if she will ensure that the views of students are taken into account in finalising arrangements for the 2022 leaving certificate;

Following on from this meeting, I met with the members of the advisory group on a bilateral basis and also had further engagement with each of them thereafter.  I have listened carefully to what each of these stakeholders has had to say and examined each of their points. <\/p>  <p>  Following consideration of this matter by Government today, I announced the decision: to operate an examinations  approach for Leaving Certificate in 2022, with significant further adjustments to the examinations; and to provide students with a commitment that the overall results of Leaving Certificate 2022 will not be lower than in 2021. As the Deputy may be aware, it would not have been possible to run Accredited Grades in the same manner as last year, as Junior Cycle data was unavailable for 25% of our students. <\/p>  <p>  The further extensive changes I have announced to the examination papers, over and above those announced in August 2021, mean that candidates: have greater choice in the papers; have less questions to answer; and still have the same amount of time as in a normal year to complete the examination. For example, in mathematics on each paper, instead of having to answer all ten questions, candidates will only have to answer six.<\/p>  <p>  This is in addition to previously announced changes, such as the running of the Leaving Certificate Oral Examinations and Music Practical over the first week of the Easter Break. <\/p>  <p>  Timeframes for certain assessment elements of the Leaving Certificate Applied examinations have also been pushed out. Schools were also reminded of the flexibilities regarding the dates for completion and authentication of examination Coursework.<\/p>  <p>  I have also confirmed that Junior Cycle examinations will take place this summer. Adjustments to the assessment arrangements for Junior Cycle were published in August 2021 and provide for more teaching time in schools. They include a reduction in the number of Classroom Based Assessments to be completed, the removal of the requirement to complete Assessment Tasks, and adjustments to the requirements in coursework and practical performance tests.<\/p>  <p>  I believe that the decision announced will provide Leaving Certificate students of 2022 with an opportunity for their learning and attainment at the end of their post-primary education to be assessed, and will enable them to progress to the next stage of their lives. It also provides the certainty and clarity in this matter that had been requested by schools and parents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100067#WRF02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Site Acquisition","counter":141,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100067#WRF02400"},{"type":"question","counter":142,"qnumday":105,"qnumall":"[4376\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100067#WRF02500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"when a commencement date can be given for schools&rsquo; (details supplied) campuses given that the work of Kildare County Council has been completed; if the leaders of the schools can be included in future plans and developments; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1585","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":143,"content":"<p>My Department has reached an agreement in principle for the acquisition of the site for the proposed school campus referred to by the Deputy.

In addition Leaving Certificate Computer Science has been available nationally as of September 2020. The NCCA is seeking to ensure that the development of the new specifications for Leaving Certificate Physics, Chemistry and Biology will address the need to widen the appeal of the subjects in order to meet the targets of the STEM Education Policy Statement and re-balance gender uptakes.<\/p>  <p>   An advisory group, set up by my Department, has developed a set of recommendations in relation to Gender Balance in STEM in order to ensure improving gender balance, equity and inclusion for our young people. The implementation of the policy statement is already seeing favourable increases in relation to the numbers of schools offering STEM subjects other than mathematics and science. For example girls only schools offering more STEM subjects have increased from 55.7% to 63.3% between 2019 and 2020. The publication and implementation of the gender balance in STEM recommendations will ensure further improvements in the uptake of STEM subjects at post primary level. <\/p>  <p>  It is of utmost importance to provide our young people and their families with awareness of STEM education, the opportunities that exists and to ensure that they can see themselves in these STEM careers. Some of my Department&rsquo;s work in this area includes ongoing support of informal STEM education such as IWish, BT Young Scientist and Technology, Scifest and my Department&rsquo;s new partnership with Science Blast. Other work includes an ongoing STEM awareness campaign in conjunction with Science Foundation Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  Development of the second STEM Education implementation plan is underway which will guide implementation from 2022-2026. A public consultation has taken place from 17th December 2021 to 26th January 2022 with further consultations with education partners and stakeholders planned in the coming weeks. The new implementation plan will incorporate monitoring and review of the existing implementation plan and will allow actions to be revised and developed in line with identified needs. In addition to the priorities identified through this consultation the implementation plan will also be informed by the Gender balance in STEM recommendations and STEM and the Arts recommendations which are being developed at present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100067#WRF04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":160,"content":"<p>Question No. 111 answered with Question No. 104.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":161,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100067#WRF04400"},{"type":"question","counter":162,"qnumday":112,"qnumall":"[4820\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100067#WRF04500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the details of the supports she is providing to school leaders while they continue to navigate Covid-19 protocols in schools.","asker":"1460","askee":"1582"},{"type":"question","counter":163,"qnumday":152,"qnumall":"[4676\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100067#WRF04600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of the public health supports available to schools; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1597","askee":"1582"},{"type":"question","counter":164,"qnumday":164,"qnumall":"[4674\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100067#WRF04700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the strategy in place to support schools to review their current protective measures in place under Covid-19 plans; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1611","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":165,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 112, 152 and 164 together.<\/p>  <p>  Schools continue to operate in line with their Covid-19 Response Plans, which set out a range of mitigation measures focused on keeping Covid-19 out of schools and reducing the risk of the spread of infection in schools.

The review involved a very broad range of research, consultations and communications with a wide range of stakeholders, including the union referred to by the Deputy, on all aspects of review and redevelopment over a number of phases over the period of the review.<\/p>  <p>  The Advisory Report maps out an ambitious programme of work, which would enable the development and construction of the components that would make up a Framework for Senior Cycle and will involve further ongoing stakeholder engagement and consultation. This will also mean changes for the Leaving Certificate itself, and under the work of Senior Cycle Reform we will seek to capture the full range of skills and aptitudes of students.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware of the desire in the education community and more generally that the NCCA Advisory Report be published but we must first complete our consideration of the Report. I am currently focusing on what the implementation of the Report would involve and what we can do to best ensure the further evolution of Senior Cycle. My officials and I have been considering the Report carefully, with a view to delivering a Senior Cycle programme that meets the needs of the students of today and the future, and the Report will be published once those considerations are complete.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100067#WRF06700","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects","counter":185,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100067#WRF06800"},{"type":"question","counter":186,"qnumday":120,"qnumall":"[4708\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100067#WRF06900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if she will provide an overview of her Department&rsquo;s plans for the construction, extension and refurbishment of schools in County Clare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1517","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":187,"content":"<p>Under Project Ireland 2040, the education sector will receive a total of approximately &euro;4.4 billion capital investment over the period 2021-2025.

I have listened carefully to what each of these stakeholders has had to say and examined each of their points. <\/p>  <p>  Following consideration of this matter by Government today, I announced the decision: to operate an examinations  approach for Leaving Certificate in 2022, with significant further adjustments to the examinations; and to provide students with a commitment that the overall results of Leaving Certificate 2022 will not be lower than in 2021. As the Deputy may be aware, it would not have been possible to run Accredited Grades in the same manner as last year, as Junior Cycle data was unavailable for 25% of our students. <\/p>  <p>  The further extensive changes I have announced to the examination papers, over and above those announced in August 2021, mean that candidates: have greater choice in the papers; have less questions to answer; and still have the same amount of time as in a normal year to complete the examination. For example, in mathematics on each paper, instead of having to answer all ten questions, candidates will only have to answer six.<\/p>  <p>  This is in addition to previously announced changes, such as the running of the Leaving Certificate Oral Examinations and Music Practical over the first week of the Easter Break. <\/p>  <p>  Timeframes for certain assessment elements of the Leaving Certificate Applied examinations have also been pushed out.

Adjustments to the assessment arrangements for Junior Cycle were published in August 2021 and provide for more teaching time in schools.

Updated guidance for schools on Practical Steps for the Deployment of Good Ventilation Practices in Schools was provided at the end of May following the work of an expert group that carefully considered the role of ventilation in managing COVID-19. The updated guidance for schools is also fully in line with the most recent guidance on non-healthcare building ventilation during COVID-19, published by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre November 2021. <\/p><p>To provide additional support in the context of Covid-19 the payment of a minor works grant totalling &euro;45m for primary schools and special schools, plus a once-off Covid-19 minor works funding of &euro;17m for post-primary schools, was issued in December 2021. All recognised schools in the free scheme have received their grants, a table of funding by county is provided below.<\/p><p>Given that each school setting is different, individual schools are best placed to decide how best to use this funding to address their particular needs. Specialist advice\/assistance of a Chartered Engineer or Registered Architect is an important source of support for schools.  This will help ensure that appropriate solutions are being put in place to address ventilation issues including advice on whether a HEPA Air Cleaner Unit is required to deal with a poorly ventilated room.  There is no one solution that fits all scenarios, each application requires bespoke analysis and selection of the appropriate unit(s) matched to the specific room size and volume. <\/p><p>Air cleaning devices are not a substitute for good ventilation but can be considered pending the completion of interventions\/works where poor ventilation persists. This is line with the Expert Group recommendations. Air filtration does not negate the need for natural ventilation and opening windows as required. Furthermore Mike Ryan of the World Health Organization&rsquo;s Health Emergencies Programme has advised that schools not rely solely on air filters.<\/p><p>In the case where a school has difficulty engaging a Chartered Engineer or Registered Architect the Department can assist, with a dedicated ventilation team  available to support school principals in this regard.  Schools that identify inadequate ventilation in a room can utilise their minor work grant or apply for emergency works grant assistance to address ventilation enhancements where the minor work grant does not cover the full cost of the works required.<\/p><p>To date 19 schools have applied for additional funding under the emergency works scheme to assist with ventilation. Of these, 12 have been approved, 2 were returned to the school to review the scope of the application, 2 were incorrectly classified as ventilation related and assessed separately, 2 were rejected as the application form was not fully completed and 1 is currently being assessed by a member of the Department&rsquo;s technical team. None of the 12 approved identified a need for an air filter. <table>    <tr>       <th><div>County<\/div><\/th>       <th><div>Total (&euro;)<\/div><\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Carlow<\/td>       <td>0.88m<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan<\/td>       <td>1.23m<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Clare<\/td>       <td>1.75m<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork<\/td>       <td>6.97m<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal<\/td>       <td>2.74m<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin<\/td>       <td>12.91m<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway<\/td>       <td>4.04m<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry<\/td>       <td>2.30m<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare<\/td>       <td>2.58m<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny<\/td>       <td>1.46m<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois<\/td>       <td>1.11m<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Leitrim<\/td>       <td>0.56m<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick<\/td>       <td>2.56m<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Longford<\/td>       <td>0.71m<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth<\/td>       <td>1.63m<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Mayo<\/td>       <td>2.41m<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath<\/td>       <td>2.45m<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Monaghan<\/td>       <td>1.00m<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Offaly<\/td>       <td>1.14m<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Roscommon<\/td>       <td>1.20m<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Sligo<\/td>       <td>1.08m<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Tipperary<\/td>       <td>2.58m<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford<\/td>       <td>1.52m<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath<\/td>       <td>1.34m<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford<\/td>       <td>2.00m<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow<\/td>       <td>1.85m<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Total<\/td>       <td>62m<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100068#WRG03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Transport","counter":225,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100068#WRG03800"},{"type":"question","counter":226,"qnumday":135,"qnumall":"[4647\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100068#WRG03900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if officials of her Department will engage with Bus &Eacute;ireann in relation to an altered school bus route (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1501","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":227,"content":"<p>School Transport is a significant operation managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department of Education.

Learning experiences associated with this Statement of Learning would result in students learning how government and politics work in Ireland and elsewhere, including Europe, enabling students to develop an understanding that as citizens we all have rights and responsibilities who can contribute to building a better world within their local communities and in the wider world. <\/p><p>The Leaving Certificate Politics and Society curriculum includes a strand on Power and Decision making at national and European level and another on Human Rights and Responsibilities in Europe and the wider world.  <\/p><p>The Professional Development Support Services also help to raise awareness of the European Union through Continuous Professional Development (CPD), workshops, seminars etc provided to teachers in terms of the relevant curriculum areas.  For example, teachers are supported in demonstrating an understanding of, and the links between: the EU, sovereignty, intergovernmentalism and supranationalism.  The Support Services and teachers alike reference the European Union as a lens through which to examine a variety of the learning outcomes, topics and key concepts.  Current and emerging topics such as Brexit, immigration, democratic representation, sustainability and the &ldquo;othering&rdquo; of parts of our community are all examined through the European Union.  Scoilnet.ie, the Department&rsquo;s portal for teachers and schools hosts many resources in relation to the European Union.  Scoilnet also engages with the EU Commission office in Dublin to promote awareness of Ireland's engagement with the EU. <\/p><p>In addition to the raising of awareness through the curriculum and the supports provided to teachers, there are a number of programmes with which schools can engage with learning about the European Union.  <\/p><p>The Blue Star programme,<b><\/b>funded by the Department of Foreign Affairs and supported by the Department of Education, allows primary school pupils to learn about our rich European heritage, diverse European cultures and languages, and the importance of the European Union today.

This represents approximately 20% of the overall school population. The total Department spend on DEIS in 2021 is over &euro;150 million, which includes over &euro;26 million for the School Completion Programme (SCP). <\/p>  <p>  Budget 2022 has allocated the largest-ever increase in funding for the DEIS programme, providing for an additional allocation of &euro;18 million in 2022 (&euro;32 million over a full year) which will enable an expansion in 2022 of the DEIS programme to further schools. This means that by 2023 the Irish Government will target over &euro;180 million at addressing educational disadvantage through the DEIS programme, an increase of 20% on the 2021 allocation.<\/p>  <p>  All DEIS Schools are required to develop three-year action plans for improvement under the DEIS themes of: Attendance, Retention, Literacy &amp;amp; Numeracy, Supporting Educational Transitions, Partnership with parents and others and, (in the case of post-primary schools), Examination Attainment. Schools are expected to regularly monitor their progress and make necessary adjustments in light of experience. <\/p>  <p>  Tusla Education Support Service (TESS) has three strands namely the Statutory Educational Welfare Service (EWS) and the two school support services the Home School Community Liaison Scheme (HSCL) and the School Completion Programme (SCP). TESS is a key support to the schools participating in the DEIS programme. The three TESS strands work together collaboratively with schools, families and other relevant services to achieve the best educational outcomes for children and young people. All three strands share the same national outcomes:  improved attendance, participation and retention.<\/p>  <p>  The latest Retention Report published by my Department measures the percentage of students who entered the first year of post-primary school in 2014 and who completed Leaving Certificate in 2019, or 2020 (for those who availed of transition year). The Report shows that 91.5% of the students who entered first year of post primary school in 2014 completed their Leaving Certificate in 2019 or 2020, while 97.6% sat the Junior Certificate examination in 2017 or 2018. <\/p>  <p>  Schools participating in the DEIS programme have seen retention rates to Leaving Certificate improve since the introduction of DEIS - from 68.2% for the 2001 entry cohort to 84.8% for the 2014 entry cohort. The gap in retention rates between DEIS and non-DEIS schools has narrowed from a gap of 16.8% for the 2001 entry cohort to 8.6% for the 2014 entry cohort.<\/p>  <p>  In 2020, and again in 2021, all DEIS schools were provided with the opportunity to run a summer programme as a response to the challenges faced by schools due to school closures under Covid 19. Schools were asked to identify those students at greatest risk of educational disadvantage to participate in the programme.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition, in September last, I announced a Covid Learning and Support Scheme (CLASS) to help schools mitigate the adverse impacts of Covid-19 on student learning loss and wellbeing arising from the periods of school closures in 2020 and 2021.  Provision is being made for up to &euro;52 million in extra teaching hours for schools during the current school year. Under the programme, a block of additional teaching hours is being provided to each recognised school.  Enhanced allocations are provided under CLASS for DEIS schools. DEIS Schools may use the additional teaching hours in accordance with the needs of their students. This will enable DEIS schools to identify students most at risk of learning loss arising from the recent disrupted school experience and put in place specific targeted teaching supports to meet these students&rsquo; needs. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100069#WRH03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Examinations","counter":280,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100069#WRH04000"},{"type":"question","counter":281,"qnumday":155,"qnumall":"[4650\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100069#WRH04100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the contingency plans that have been enacted by her Department during the 2020-2021 and 2021-2022 academic years to date to prepare for the leaving certificate 2022; if she has similar plans for leaving certificate 2023; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":282,"content":"<p>Planning for the 2022 state examinations has been underway by my Department and the State Examinations Commission for some time. In similar fashion to 2020 and 2021, this work has been assisted by an advisory group of key stakeholders.<\/p>  <p>  In recent weeks, I have attended a meeting with the Advisory Group on State Examinations, which has representatives of students, parents, teachers, school managerial bodies, the further and higher education sector, and the State Examinations Commission. Following on from this meeting, I met with the members of the advisory group on a bilateral basis and also had further engagement with each of them thereafter.  I have listened carefully to what each of these stakeholders has had to say and examined each of their points. <\/p>  <p>  Following consideration of this matter by Government , I announced today the decision: to operate an examinations approach for Leaving Certificate in 2022, with significant further adjustments to the examinations; and to provide students with a commitment that the overall results of Leaving Certificate 2022 will not be lower than in 2021. As the Deputy may be aware, it would not have been possible to run Accredited Grades in the same manner as last year, as Junior Cycle data was unavailable for 25% of our students. <\/p>  <p>  The further extensive changes I have announced to the examination papers, over and above those announced in August 2021, mean that candidates: have greater choice in the papers; have less questions to answer; and still have the same amount of time as in a normal year to complete the examination. For example, in mathematics on each paper, instead of having to answer all ten questions, candidates will only have to answer six.<\/p>  <p>  This is in addition to previously announced changes, such as the running of the Leaving Certificate Oral Examinations and Music Practical over the first week of the Easter Break. <\/p>  <p>  Timeframes for certain assessment elements of the Leaving Certificate Applied examinations have also been pushed out.

This will be provided for students who, due to serious illness, close family bereavement, or for Covid-related reasons based on public health advice, are unable to sit one or more papers in the first sitting of the examinations. There will be strict eligibility criteria applying to this contingency sitting, to be developed by the State Examinations Commission.<\/p>  <p>  I believe that the decision I announced today will provide Leaving Certificate students of 2022 with an opportunity for their learning and attainment at the end of their post-primary education to be assessed, and will enable them to progress to the next stage of their lives.

In this regard, the NCSE recommended that a new national training programme at Level 5 of the National Qualification Framework be developed for existing SNAs who do not have the requisite level of training and for new SNAs on appointment.  The NCSE also recommended that training tailored to the specific complex needs of some students being cared for by SNAs would also be provided.<\/p>  <p>  The policy advice has been considered by the Department.

This was acknowledged in the Comprehensive Review of the Special Needs Assistant Scheme (SNAs) published by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) in 2018. <\/p>  <p>  The Review made a number of recommendations regarding SNAs including the training needs of SNAs.  In this regard, the NCSE recommended that a new national training programme at Level 5 of the National Qualification Framework be developed for existing SNAs who do not have the requisite level of training and for new SNAs on appointment.  The NCSE also recommended that training tailored to the complex needs of some students would also be provided. <\/p>  <p>  The policy advice has been considered by my Department. It was decided that priority would be given to the development of a training programme for SNAs who may not have had a recent opportunity to access a training programme tailored to their role.  <\/p>  <p>  The first national training programme for SNAs is now in place and it aims to enhance the knowledge, skills and expertise of SNAs whose work is central to the inclusion of students with additional care and complex needs in school life. The programme is fully funded by my Department and delivered at no cost to the SNA. <\/p>  <p>  There are 3,500 places available on the online programme over 4 years.  Each phase of the programme has been fully subscribed to date. 500 have completed the programme and a new cohort of 1,000 commenced the programme last September.<\/p>  <p>  As this is the first programme, it is appropriate to take the time to review outcomes and this will inform the future approach to ongoing training and professional development of SNAs.

My Department is engaging in that process.<\/p>  <p>  The recruitment and appointment of Special Needs Assistants is a matter for each individual school authority.

My Department is prioritising the contract review and this will be followed by a review of the entry qualifications.  <\/p>  <p>  II am satisfied that the approach outlined fully recognises the important place of SNAs in our schools.

This represents approximately 20% of the overall school population. The total Department spend on DEIS in 2021 was over &euro;150 million, which includes over &euro;26 million for the School Completion Programme (SCP).

Transitions is a key theme in DEIS schools&rsquo; planning processes and is part of the school self-evaluation (SSE) process. All DEIS schools were invited to a virtual Shared Learning Day organised by my Department in April 2021 on the theme of, &lsquo;Adapting and Managing Successful Transitions for Students&rsquo;. It was an opportunity for DEIS schools to listen to experiences of successful transition from early years to primary, through post-primary and onto further and higher education to inform their own planning processes. The entire event is available to view at <i>www.gov.ie\/en\/publication\/c5643-resources-for-deis-schools\/<\/i>.<\/p><p>The Higher Education Authority (HEA) Student Record System (SRS) data shows that in 2019\/20 academic year, 10% of new entrants came from DEIS Schools.

In an analysis carried out by the HEA at the start of the 2021, 98% of post-primary DEIS schools had links or engagement with a HEI.  <\/p><p>My Department works closely with the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science on tackling educational disadvantage and encouraging transitions to higher education. Initiatives under the Department of  Further and Higher Education,  Research, Innovation and Science include the following: <\/p><p>-  Funding is provided to seven Special Disadvantage Initiatives located in areas of socio-economic disadvantage in Dublin and Limerick cities. These projects specifically target children and young people in primary and post primary DEIS schools who are generally at risk of not reaching their full academic potential. They also seek to direct further targeted activities at children and young people who demonstrate high academic potential but may be at risk of not progressing to further or higher education for a variety of reasons. <\/p><p>-  Engagement with DEIS schools also features in Strand 3 of the Programme for Access to Higher Education (PATH). PATH 3 supports HEI capacity in developing regional and community partnership strategies (including with DEIS schools) for increasing access to higher education by specified groups. A number of projects approved under PATH 3 include engagement with local DEIS schools.  Similarly, a number of projects supported under Strand 1 of PATH, which is committed to increasing the diversity of initial teacher education for new entrants, involve engagement with DEIS schools. For example, several Centres collaborate with DEIS schools in mentoring programmes to improve the reach of access to higher education and in particular, access to initial teacher education. The PATH 2 bursaries, now with three tiers of support, take a wider range of indicators into consideration and students from DEIS schools can feature among the recipients.  <\/p><p>-  Work on the development of the next National Access Plan (NAP) 2022 - 2026 is currently underway.

This was acknowledged in the Comprehensive Review of the Special Needs Assistant Scheme (SNAs) published by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) in 2018. <\/p>  <p>  The Review made a number of recommendations regarding SNAs including referencing the training needs of SNAs.  In this regard, the NCSE recommended that a new national training programme at Level 5 of the National Qualification Framework be developed for existing SNAs who do not have the requisite level of training and for new SNAs on appointment.  The NCSE also recommended that training tailored to the specific complex needs of some students being cared for by SNAs would also be provided. <\/p>  <p>  The policy advice has been considered by the Department. It was decided that priority should be given to the development of a training programme for SNAs who may not have had a recent opportunity to access a training programme tailored to their role.

In particular, the LEOs offer Feasibility Grants, which help start-up companies or individual entrepreneurs with the cost of researching their proposed business or new business idea to see if it could be viable and sustainable, and Priming Grants, which aim to help with the associated costs of start-up. <\/p><p>However, it should be noted that the LEOs do not provide direct grant-aid to areas such as retail, personal services, local professional services, or local building services, as it may give rise to the displacement of existing businesses. <\/p><p>The LEOs provide a wide range of high-quality business and management development programmes that are tailored to meet specific business requirements. Whether it is starting a business or growing a business there is something suitable for anyone exploring self-employment as an option. <\/p><p>Any person considering starting a business should enquire about the LEO&rsquo;s Start Your Own Business Programme. The objective of this programme is to assist clients in assessing their business idea, its viability and helps them decide if they should proceed or take a step back. The programme covers topics such as Starting up \/ getting started, Identifying, understanding, and researching your target market, Developing your Business Plan amongst other vital areas of interest to a new business. <\/p><p>I would also suggest seeking the advice of a LEO Business Mentor; the Mentor programme is open to both new and existing businesses located within the LEO region and is designed to match up the knowledge, skills, insights and entrepreneurial capability of experienced business practitioners with small business owner\/ managers who need practical and strategic one to one advice and guidance. The mentor contributes independent, informed observation and advice to aid decision making. <\/p><p>Mentors can also advise on finance options available to entrepreneurs and can assist with applications and referrals to Micro-Finance Ireland, which provides vital support to eligible microenterprises by lending to businesses that cannot obtain loans from other commercial lenders and who do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by commercial lenders. It offers loan funding, including Start-up Loans, from &euro;5,000 to &euro;25,000. <\/p><p>The above supports along with a host of others can also be found on the supportingsmes.gov.ie website. This is a cross-governmental guide to help small businesses know which of the over 170 Government supports could fit their business. <\/p><p>By completing the questionnaire, a small business will, in one location:<\/p><p>- be able to find out which of the over 170 Government business supports from 27 different Government  Departments, Agencies and Initiatives are available.<\/p><p>- be able to get information on the range of Government supports for accessing credit. <\/p><p>- be given contact details for their nearest Local Enterprise Office.<\/p><p>- be able to download filtered results into a document for their further use.<\/p><p>The Department of Social Protection offers the Back to Work Enterprise Allowance scheme, which encourages people currently receiving certain social welfare payments to become self-employed. The scheme is a payment made by the Department of Social Protection to people aged under 66, who are in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment 3 out of the last 5 years. Participants in the Back to Work Enterprise Allowance scheme can keep a percentage of their social welfare payment for up to 2 years. <\/p><p>The Department of Social Protection also offer the Short-Term Enterprise Allowance scheme, which supports those who have lost their job and want to start their own business.

This was a landmark legislative project which was the result of many years of detailed and comprehensive work. The Act which was commenced in May 2015 consolidated, simplified and reformed company law to provide a modern framework for all companies regardless of the type of business being operated. The Act strikes a balance between simplifying the day to day running of a business, maintaining the necessary protections for those dealing with companies, such as creditors and investors, and putting in place an effective corporate governance regime to ensure compliance.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In particular, Part 4 deals with corporate governance and provides for the duties and responsibilities of directors and other officers as regards\u00a0their appointment, their proceedings in regard to the company and its members and the ways in which the activities of the company on a day-to-day basis are\u00a0conducted. Part 5 contains the duties of directors and other officers of the company which prior to the 2014 Act were to be found in the common law and in various statutory provisions. \u00a0Part 6 contains provisions regarding the accounting records to be kept by companies, the financial statements to be prepared by them, the periodic returns to be made to the Registrar of Companies, and the auditing of financial statements.

inclusive, together.  <\/p><p>The National Broadband Plan (NBP) is a Government policy initiative that is being achieved through a combination of accelerated commercial investment by telecoms operators, and a State intervention. <\/p><p>Information regarding the NBP is available on the Department&rsquo;s website at www.broadband.gov.ie.\u00a0 As a State intervention, the NBP must comply with the requirements of the European Commission&rsquo;s State Aid Guidelines (SAG) on the application of the State aid rules to broadband networks. \u00a0The SAG requires, amongst other things, that Member States carry out a detailed mapping exercise and public consultation process to identify, as far as reasonably possible, those areas where intervention is required. <\/p><p>Since 2013, the Department has engaged in an extensive Mapping Process to map broadband availability across Ireland, in order to identify which geographic areas already have or will have access to Next Generation Access (NGA) broadband services, i.e. a broadband service delivering at least 30Mbps download speeds and which areas required intervention from the State.\u00a0 Extensive information has been published at every stage of the overall NBP process, including each iteration of the NBP Map and extensive information on the Mapping Process and the development of the NBP Map itself. This information can be found at www.broadband.gov.ie.<\/p><p>The mapping process included a number of public consultations conducted over a six year period from 2013 to 2019.\u00a0\u00a0The most recent public consultation was in November 2019, which aimed to finalise the NBP Map in advance of signing the NBP contract. This public consultation confirmed the existing and planned coverage of NGA broadband services across Ireland. It relied on the most up to date information available, shared by commercial operators, of their existing and planned broadband services. The Department undertook an analysis of this information and determined where NGA broadband services existed and where it was planned. For example, in some cases, certain operators claimed they were already delivering NGA broadband services whereas the Department determined that, in fact, they were not. <\/p><p>The content of the operator submissions broadly included details of the operator&rsquo;s network design, technology solution, coverage area of the operator&rsquo;s network, the location and number of sites etc as well as their plans for future deployments if available.\u00a0 <\/p><p>Certain operator submissions claimed that NGA broadband services were already in place across the vast majority of rural Ireland and that there was no need for any State intervention in most rural areas, whereas other operators recognised the deficit in NGA broadband services and supported the State&rsquo;s planned intervention.<\/p><p>Since 2013 and in line with SAG recommendations, the Department has consulted with ComReg on the NBP mapping at every stage of the process. The Department and ComReg established an NBP Expert Group, to have engagement on the key issues and areas relevant to the NBP Intervention, including the Mapping Process.\u00a0 <\/p><p>In 2019 consistent with ComReg&rsquo;s role on the NBP Expert Group, ComReg was provided with copies of all operators submissions to the 2019 consultation. These comprised of 29 operator submissions and one group submission representing 28 fixed wireless operators. ComReg supported by their own advisors provided a number of observations on the analysis and draft findings, which were then taken into account when arriving at the conclusion of the Mapping process.<\/p><p>Each operator was subsequently informed of the outcome of the analysis and the conclusion as to whether their existing and\/or planned coverage was accepted as delivering NGA broadband services or not.\u00a0 The NBP Map was then updated and republished with the most up to date information. The NBP Map can be fou<i>nd at www.broadban<\/i>d.gov.ie.<\/p><p>Copies of these operator submissions are already published on my Department&rsquo;s website in the Consultation Submission section of the 2019 Mapping Consultation page at www.gov.ie\/en\/consultation\/61fcf-consultation-on-conclusion-of-the-nbp-mapping-exercise-for-the-intervention-area\/.<\/p><p>In addition, the overall findings and conclusion of the 2019 NBP Mapping Consultation Summary of Findings Report, can be found in the Update 17 December 2019 &ndash; Summary of Findings section of the 2019 Mapping Consultation page at .<\/p><p>ComReg overall expert opinion is also already published on both ComReg&rsquo;s and the Department&rsquo;s website and can be found in the Update 17 December 2019 &ndash; Summary of Findings section of the 2019 Mapping Consultation page at www.gov.ie\/en\/consultation\/61fcf-consultation-on-conclusion-of-the-nbp-mapping-exercise-for-the-intervention-area\/.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100072#WRL02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1479"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":445,"content":"<p>Question No. 211 answered with Question No. 210.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":446,"content":"<p>Question No. 212 answered with Question No. 210.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":447,"content":"<p>Question No. 213 answered with Question No. 210.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":448,"content":"<p>Question No. 214 answered with Question No. 210.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Renewable Energy Generation","counter":449,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100072#WRL03100"},{"type":"question","counter":450,"qnumday":215,"qnumall":"[4294\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100072#WRL03200","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"when the final draft of the renewable electricity support scheme terms and conditions will be published; the number of submissions that were made as part of the public consultation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1627","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":451,"content":"<p>My Department is developing Renewable Electricity Support Scheme\u00a0(RESS) auctions both for onshore and offshore renewables.

","asker":"1513","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":642,"content":"<p>Revenue&rsquo;s role in relation to the supply of taxable solid fuels in the State lies in the collection of Solid Fuel Carbon Tax (SFCT) and VAT.<\/p>  <p>  Solid fuel (coal and peat) is liable to excise duty in this jurisdiction in the form of Solid Fuel Carbon Tax (SFCT), which is a national excise that applies at different rates to four categories of solid fuel: coal, peat briquettes, milled peat and other peat. Liability to SFCT arises when solid fuel is first supplied in the State for use as a fuel. SFCT is payable by a taxable person who makes that first supply of solid fuel in the State. An SFCT return is required one month after the end of the two-month accounting period in which the supply is made.<\/p>  <p>  Coal and peat are not &ldquo;excisable&rdquo; products. This means that coal and peat are not covered by the EU Control and Movement regime for excisable products (e.g. alcohol, tobacco) so, under EU rules, Revenue cannot impose any barriers to their movement into the State from other Member States or Northern Ireland. The movement of solid fuel into the State from Northern Ireland (or from anywhere in the EU) does not generate a liability to SFCT nor does the physical presence of solid fuel in the State. It is not until solid fuel is first supplied within the State that SFCT becomes liable. Therefore, there is no smuggling offence, in terms of evasion of SFCT, attaching to coal coming into the State from Northern Ireland. No Revenue offence arises where coal or other solid fuels are brought into the State or placed on the market here. Even if controls were possible, a person transporting solid fuel from Northern Ireland could claim that SFCT will be accounted for in due course if relevant first supplies of the transported solid fuel are later made in the State. <\/p>  <p>  SFCT is not an import duty and does not become due until a first supply is made in the State. Every supplier who intends to make a first supply of liable solid fuel in the State must register with Revenue for the purposes of the tax. Where a solid fuel supplier based in the State sources some or all of their solid fuel supplies from outside the State, they will be accountable for SFCT when they make first supplies in the State and must register with Revenue to account for and pay SFCT. Where a supplier based outside the State delivers solid fuel into the State to a private individual, they must register with Revenue and pay the tax. This means that suppliers from outside the State, including Northern Ireland, who take orders for delivery to private individuals in the State are liable for SFCT and must register with Revenue. Similarly, courier companies who advertise on websites of solid fuel suppliers based in other jurisdictions offering to supply and deliver solid fuel direct to consumers in the State are liable for SFCT and must register with Revenue. It is important to note that where an individual personally purchases solid fuel outside the State and accompanies that solid fuel into the State, they do not have an SFCT liability provided the fuel is for their own private use. However, if that individual, instead of using the solid fuel themselves, supplies it to another person in the State, they will have made a first supply and will be liable to pay SFCT and must register with Revenue accordingly.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to VAT, under the terms of the Protocol on Ireland \/ Northern Ireland, transactions involving the movement of goods (not services) between Ireland and Northern Ireland in either direction continue to be treated as intra-Community transactions and subject to EU VAT rules. These rules apply to business to business (B2B) supplies of goods to \/ from Northern Ireland to taxable persons in Ireland and other EU Member States. The goods, including fuel products, are supplied at the zero rate of VAT and the taxable person in receipt of those goods self-accounts for VAT on a reverse-charge basis and, if applicable, takes a simultaneous VAT deduction in their next VAT return. The onward distribution and sale of a fuel product to a consumer in the State is subject to the normal VAT rules and the Irish supplier is liable to account for VAT, at the reduced rate of 13.5%, on the supply. The consideration for a supply of goods or services is defined in EU VAT law and consists of everything which the supplier is entitled to receive in return for goods or services supplied including taxes, duties, levies and charges, excluding the VAT itself. Therefore, VAT is chargeable on the solid fuel carbon tax element of fuel products.<\/p>  <p>  Where a business in Northern Ireland sells goods and arranges the transport of those goods to a consumer in Ireland, such sales of fuel products are referred to as intra-Community distance sales. Intra-Community distance sales of fuel products from Northern Ireland to a consumer in a Member State are subject to VAT in the destination Member State, which would be Ireland if the consumer is based in this State. In such cases, the supplier of those goods is required to register, subject to a threshold, in the State and account for VAT on those supplies.<\/p>  <p>  VAT and SFCT are self-assessed taxes and compliance with the law is enforced using the full range of compliance interventions and enforcement provisions for self-assessed taxes. Compliance interventions and audits are undertaken on a risk-assessed basis. Liable fuel suppliers must register with Revenue and file relevant VAT and SFCT returns and pay any tax due by the due dates. Where suppliers do not submit returns by the due date, Revenue will issue an estimate of the tax(es) due. The estimate is the amount of tax that Revenue will pursue if a supplier does not complete and file their return. If a taxpayer fails to pay the amount due, including any debt for which an estimate has issued, Revenue may refer the debt for enforcement action. This can include sheriff enforcement, civil proceedings through the courts or attachment of third parties.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy asks about the enforcement of the new environmental standards on solid fuel which are due to come into force in September 2022. This is separate to taxation matters.\u00a0 I understand that laws relating to national standards for solid fuel come under the ambit of the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communication and are enforced through the local authorities operating under those laws. I am advised that Revenue does not have a role in relation to these environmental enforcement matters. While Revenue cannot impose any obstacles to the free movement of solid fuels into the State from other Member States and Northern Ireland, I understand that such imports are open to challenge by Local Authorities if the fuel does not meet environmental standards in this State. The same environmental standards apply to all solid fuel regardless of how they have been placed on the market in Ireland, including through online sales or other forms of advertising. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100075#WRO03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":644,"qnumday":281,"qnumall":"[4785\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100075#WRO03700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the amount expected to be paid by Ireland to the European Union as part of the plastic own resources contribution; if it remains Government policy not to introduce a tax or levy on non-recyclable plastic; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The legislation which transposes Article 132 of the Directive, and Revenue&rsquo;s interpretation of the legislation, ensures that the exemption from VAT to the supply of dental services is applied consistently and in a manner which is not dependent on the legal form of the person supplying the service. In accordance with the Directive and CJEU jurisprudence the VAT exemption applies to dental services provided by a clinic, a principal dentist, or by an associate dentist, where those services are provided to a patient.<\/p>  <p>  Where a principal dentist receives consideration in respect of fee sharing arrangements and the nature of services consists of the supply of facilities for the carrying on of a dental practice, Revenue views this as a taxable supply of services within the scope of VAT. The final consumer in this fee sharing arrangement is not a patient availing of a supply of dental services to which the exemption applies.<\/p>  <p>  Revenue has been clear at all times regarding the VAT treatment of dental fee sharing arrangements and has outlined its position in correspondence and meetings with the Irish Dental Association.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100076#WRP01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":680,"content":"<p>Question No. 293 answered with Question No. 292.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":681,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100076#WRP01400"},{"type":"question","counter":682,"qnumday":294,"qnumall":"[5063\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100076#WRP01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that social care workers are not listed by the Revenue Commissioners as a profession and are unable to claim flat-rate expenses; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1628","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":683,"content":"<p>The flat rate expense (FRE) regime is operated by Revenue on an administrative basis, where both a specific commonality of expenditure exists across an employment category and the statutory requirement for the tax deduction as set out in section 114 of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997, is satisfied.

In situations where a couple is cohabiting, rather than married or in a civil partnership, each partner is treated for the purposes of income tax as a separate and unconnected individual. Because they are treated separately for tax purposes, credits, tax bands and reliefs cannot be transferred from one partner to the other.  <\/p><p>The basis for the current tax treatment of married couples derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy vs. Attorney General (1980). This decision was based on Article 41.3.1 of the Constitution where the State pledges to protect the institution of marriage. The decision held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple, both of whom are working, to pay more tax than two single people living together and having the same income. <\/p><p>To the extent that there are differences in the tax treatment of the different categories of couples, such differences arise from the objective of dealing with different types of circumstances while at the same time respecting the constitutional requirements to protect the institution of marriage. Cohabitants do not have the same legal rights and obligations as a married couple or couple in a civil partnership which is why they are not accorded similar tax treatment to couples who have a civil status that is recognised in law. Any change in the tax treatment of cohabiting couples can only be addressed in the broader context of future social and legal policy development in relation to such couples.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100076#WRP01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","counter":688,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100076#WRP02100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Environmental Policy","counter":687,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100076#WRP02000"},{"type":"question","counter":688,"qnumday":296,"qnumall":"[4319\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100076#WRP02100","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the status of the development of a roadmap to promote greater use of lower-carbon building material in construction; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1627","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":689,"content":"<p>A draft Roadmap document which was in preparation over the past number of months has now been completed by the OPW.

Commencing with steel and timber in the second half of 2020, inflationary pressures broadened out to impact a range of other commonly used materials throughout 2021. Not all materials are experiencing price increases but the breath of increases and the range of materials impacted has not been experienced in well over a decade.<\/p><p>It is important to note that not all projects are impacted to the same degree.  That will depend on whether the range of materials specified are subject to price increases in excess of the normal or anticipated level of inflation for that material, whether the contractor has agreed fixed prices with their suppliers in advance of the increases or whether the contractor was in a position to stockpile the necessary materials.<\/p><p>In addition to price inflation, there is a shortage of certain materials and longer delivery periods. These increases and shortages are predominantly associated with disruption to global supply chains from the onset of the pandemic, rising energy and transportation costs, Brexit trade disruption and increased demand driven by stimulus packages announced globally. It is not evident yet as to the duration of these market conditions, the potential for further volatility or price increases, or whether prices might return to prior levels.<\/p><p>Government policy (through Circular 33\/06) requires all public works projects that are delivered under the Exchequer-funded element of the National Development Plan to be procured in accordance with the provisions laid down in the Capital Works Management Framework (CWMF).  Public works contracts are fixed price contracts, which are to be comprehensively defined prior to tender. The contractor prices for the risk of increases in the cost of labour, materials and certain changes in law for the periods specified.<\/p><p>Whilst the provisions contained in the public works contracts dealing with price inflation have operated to deal with inflationary pressures over the years since their introduction, the price movements experienced on construction materials over the past 12 months have arisen suddenly and with no warning. In response to this challenge, I announced a series of measures in November to address the risks posed. <\/p><p>The Office of Government Procurement (OGP) issued procurement guidance to assist public bodies in managing the challenges they face concluding &lsquo;live&rsquo; tenders in light of the significant price increases that have arisen since tenders were submitted. This guidance is aimed at contracting authorities who have invited or received tenders and covers the following situations:<ol type=\"1\"><li>Where tenders have been received but a Contract is yet to be awarded,<li>Those live tenders where the deadline for receipt of tenders has not passed; and<li>Tenders that are yet to commence.<\/ol>With reference to future tenders, the OGP published interim amendments to the provisions in the public works contracts on 7 January 2022. Within certain parameters, these amendments will reduce the level of risk of extraordinary price inflation that contractors will have to bear, while also enabling the Exchequer to obtain cost reductions should exceptional price reductions occur during the course of the works.<\/p><p>The measures are designed to encourage confidence in the tender process and to mitigate against the over-provision for price inflation in tender prices.  This is achieved by addressing the risk of price inflation in the period between tender submission and award through the introduction of limited indexation of the tender price. The fixed price period has been reduced to 24 months from the date of contract award. Mutual cost recovery within the fixed price period is now permitted for material price changes in excess of 15%.<\/p><p>With respect to contracts that have been awarded prior to the introduction of these measures on 7 January 2022, the pre-existing provisions for inflation contained in the public works contracts published prior to that date continue to apply as these were the terms entered into by the parties. <\/p><p>Further amendments on price inflation will be developed for consultation with stakeholders in 2022, which will form part of the ongoing Capital Works Management Framework review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100076#WRP03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Process","counter":703,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100076#WRP03600"},{"type":"question","counter":704,"qnumday":302,"qnumall":"[4766\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100076#WRP03700","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will provide a list of Acts or sections or other provisions of Acts for which a commencement order has yet to be signed in his Department; the reason for the delay; when commencement orders will be signed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1603","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":705,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy is set out in the table below. <table>    <tr>       <th>Title of Act or sections\/provision of Act where commencement order not yet signed <\/th>       <th>Reason for timeframe<\/th>       <th>Planned date of signing<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Data Sharing and Governance Act 2019 <\/td>       <td>The Data Sharing and Governance Act 2019 was published in June 2018, passed in March 2019 and several sections of the legislation were immediately commenced.<br \/><br \/>  In July 2021, the remaining sections of the Data Sharing and Governance Act 2019 were commenced with the exception of subsections (2), (3) of s.6.

Over 300,000 new homes will be built by the end of 2030, including a projected 90,000 social homes, 36,000 affordable purchase homes and 18,000 cost rental homes.<\/p>  <p>  The Plan is backed by historic levels of investment with in excess of &euro;20bn through the Exchequer, the Land Development Agency and the Housing Finance Agency over the next 5 years. This will provide the sector with the stability and certainty it needs.<\/p>  <p>Housing for All is a whole-of-Government Plan, encompassing numerous policy areas across the four pathways to a sustainable housing system. My Department is working in close collaboration with all relevant Government Departments, State Agencies and other stakeholders, with a strong focus on implementation and delivery.<\/p>  <p>  Good progress has been made since the plans publication in September 2021: of the 213 actions set out in Housing for All, a total of 123 have either been completed already or are being delivered on an ongoing basis.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the Government has committed to publishing a Housing for All progress report each quarter throughout the lifetime of the plan. These detail the progress made on all Housing for All actions and policy objectives that have a delivery timeline relevant to the publication. Ongoing actions will be reported on in the Q2 and Q4 reports of each year to ensure continued focus and delivery of all actions. <\/p>  <p>  The first of these progress reports, for Q3 2021, was published on 20 October 2021 and can be accessed at the following link: www.gov.ie\/en\/publication\/44df1-housing-for-all-q3-2021-progress-report\/.  <\/p>  <p>  The second progress report, for Q4

Under this strategy, we have reinforced our network of eight offices across the US, including opening a new Consulate General in Los Angelus in 2018 and the opening in summer 2022 of a new Consulate General in Miami.  <\/p>  <p>  We have a broad range of priorities in our relations with the United States including: high level political engagement, in particular in support of the peace process in Northern Ireland; economic promotion; and in support of our citizens and the broader Irish American diaspora. <\/p>  <p>  There is ongoing advocacy and engagement at every level with the US administration and political leaders. During his St. Patrick's Day virtual visit last year, the Taoiseach raised a number of priority issues directly with President Biden, including the need to identify immigration pathways. I also advocated strongly on a number of important issues, including on Brexit and Northern Ireland and on  immigration, at meetings on Capitol Hill on my most recent visit to Washington D.C. These high level engagements will continue as we maintain close relations with Members of the US Congress, and as we seek opportunities to deepen and strengthen our bilateral relations with President Biden's Administration.<\/p>  <p>  Our Embassy in Washington D.C. is actively engaged across the political spectrum in the US, meeting regularly with both Members of the House of Representatives and of the Senate on a bipartisan basis. The efforts of the Embassy have been instrumental in ensuring consistent priority and support at the highest political level to protect peace on the island. They also continue to work towards finding innovative solutions and immigration pathways to address the challenges faced by the undocumented Irish in the US. <\/p>  <p>  Through our Embassy in Washington, D.C., as well as our Consulates across the US, my Department works closely in support of Irish and Irish American groups across the United States.

Engagement in support of our diaspora community in the US is a key platform for the delivery of our Diaspora Strategy 2020-2025. <\/p>  <p>  The Government continues to provide support and significant annual funding through the Government&rsquo;s Emigrant Support Programme to the US Coalition of Irish Immigration Centers, which provides support to Irish citizens, in particular to the undocumented Irish who are seeking to regularise their status. Last year, in response to the pandemic, a dedicated COVID-19 Response Fund for Irish Communities Abroad was set up to help these organisations meet the needs of those who are particularly vulnerable.

The Ambassador recently received an award from its Washington chapter in recognition of the Embassy&rsquo;s work in support of Irish America.  There is a longstanding history of cooperation with them on Irish issues.

This engagement has been continuing since late last week, over the weekend and into this week, with a view to reaching an appropriate solution which responds to the concerns and issues that have been raised. A further meeting of the Advisory Group will be held and I am working towards a decision in relation to the examinations being made as soon as reasonably practicable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100084#WRX01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Programmes","counter":1090,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100084#WRX01500"},{"type":"question","counter":1091,"qnumday":453,"qnumall":"[4239\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100084#WRX01600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the details of the operation of the ADAPT building programme of her Department; the way it operates in respect of taking projects from approval in principle to the construction stage; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1454","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1092,"content":"<p>The ADAPT programme is an innovative approach to project and programme delivery introduced by the Department in 2016.

I fully recognise that where parents have difficulties in securing an appropriate school placement for their child, particularly a child with special educational needs, it can be a stressful experience. My Department is working hard to ensure that there are sufficient school places, appropriate to the needs of all children, available on a timely basis nationwide.  <\/p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children with special educational needs and my Department works in close collaboration with the NCSE to ensure that the necessary provision is available. There are Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) located across the country and they have a specific remit in helping and supporting parents in accessing the education necessary for their children, including in identifying suitable school placements.  <\/p><p>The policy approach of the Department is that children with additional needs should receive their education in placements which are appropriate to their needs alongside their peers wherever possible unless such an approach would be inconsistent with the best interests of the individual child or other children in the school. This approach is consistent with the provisions of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act 2004.  <\/p><p>This policy is supported by significant investment by this Government.  This year, my Department will spend in excess of &euro;2 billion, or over 25% of the Department&rsquo;s budget on providing additional teaching and care supports for children with special educational needs. This includes funding for a wide range of schemes and supports including special classes, special school places, SNAs and teachers. <\/p><p>Only where it has been assessed that the child is unable to be supported in mainstream education, are special class placements or special school placements recommended and provided for.<\/p><p>Recognising some of the difficulties experienced by parents in securing appropriate school placements, my Department and the NCSE have worked closely on a more streamlined and joined up planning process which has ensured a targeted approach to meet demand for special education placements ahead of each new school year. This intensive intervention has seen an additional 301 special classes already opened nationwide for the 2021\/22 school year. <\/p><p>There is currently a network of 357 special classes in Cork, including Cork City,  of which 309 are special classes for children with autism.Of the 309 special classes for children with autism, 228 are at primary level including 21 Early Intervention classes and 81 are at post primary level. A total of 45 new ASD special classes were established in Cork for the 2021\/2022 school year.<\/p><p>Additional special school places have been created by the establishment of the new Carrigaline Community Special School and a planned increase in places in existing special schools for September next. The NCSE continues to work with special schools in Cork to increase the number of available places.<\/p><p>My Department is committed, through the NCSE and network of local SENOs, to continue to work with parents and schools to ensure that there are sufficient appropriate places for children with additional needs and to support all children to achieve their potential. <\/p><p>I can assure the Deputy that the local SENOs remain available to assist and advise parents.

They will then make a recommendation to my Department as to whether or not assistive technology is required; and based on this recommendation, my Department will decide on the level of grant, if any, to be provided. <\/p>  <p>  Although equipment is sanctioned under the Assistive Technology scheme for use by particular students, it is the property of the school, and the school&rsquo;s management authority\u00a0is responsible for maintenance, repair, and insurance of the equipment.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  An application has been received by my Department for this child on 21st January 2022\u00a0and\u00a0a\u00a0decision letter will\u00a0issue to the school in\u00a0due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100085#WRY05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Online Safety","counter":1185,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100085#WRY05100"},{"type":"question","counter":1186,"qnumday":487,"qnumall":"[4678\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100085#WRY05200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"her strategy to teach students in primary and secondary schools to stay safe online; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1545","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1187,"content":"<p>There are currently extensive training and curricular supports, including through the Social Personal Health Education (SPHE) curriculum, the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) and the Webwise Programme, to assist schools in the development of policies and practices on the safe use of the internet and on the prevention of bullying including cyber-bullying. <\/p>  <p>  The PDST and its Webwise team have developed dedicated resources for teachers, parents, children and young people which gives practical information and advice on the safe, ethical and responsible use of the internet and addresses key issues such as cyberbullying, sexting, image sharing, respectful communication, social media, popular apps and more. The Webwise resources are available at www.webwise.ie. <\/p>  <p>  The Report on the Review of Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) in primary and post-primary schools was published by the NCCA in December, 2019. The NCCA was asked to look at a number of specific issues in respect of RSE and the curriculum. These included but were not limited to consent; developments in relation to contraception; healthy positive, sexual expression and relationships; safe use of the Internet and social media and its effects on relationships and self-esteem; and LGBTQ+ matters.<\/p>  <p>  The immediate focus of the NCCA work has been on creating support materials for teachers for publication online as part of an Interim Guidance Toolkit. The toolkit's purpose is to support effective teaching and learning of SPHE\/RSE linked to the current curriculum and to provide guidance on how SPE\/RSE may be approached in a comprehensive way that meets the needs of young people today. These resources cover all topics including many of the topics that have been raised in the media during recent days as important for young people's education\u00a0 - there are resources to help teachers in teaching about rights and responsibilities in relationships, how to recognise healthy, unhealthy and abusive relationship, how to interact safely and respectfully (both online and face-to-face), the influence of the media (including pornography) on young people's understanding and expectations, sexual consent and assertive communication.<\/p>  <p>  The NCCA Toolkits will be expanded during 2022 to include further age and stage appropriate guidance for teachers on how to address these and other related topics within the SPHE classroom. The Toolkit provides practical help designed to deepen teachers' understanding and skills so that they feel more confident in addressing important and sensitive topics.<\/p>  <p>  In tandem with this work, preparation for the broader redeveloping and updating of the SPHE curriculum has begun. Updated curricula will be developed for Primary, Junior Cycle and Senior Cycle.\u00a0 It is expected that a revised Junior Cycle specification will be completed by the end of 2022, following a period of public consultation. Updated specifications for primary and senior cycle will follow immediately afterwards. <\/p>  <p>  On the 19th January, I provided an update to Cabinet on the measures to tackle and prevent bullying in schools including progress in relation to anti-bullying work currently being delivered by my Department and the commencement of a review of both the 2013 Action Plan on Bullying and the 2013 Anti-bullying procedures for Primary and Post-Primary schools. <\/p>  <p>  This review will take account of developments and relevant research since the action plan and procedures were published in 2013 and will specifically consider areas such as cyber bullying, gender identity bullying and sexual harassment. <\/p>  <p>  The review will also give detailed consideration to the recommendations contained in the Oireachtas Joint Committee Report on School Bullying and the Impact on Mental Health. <\/p>  <p>  It will involve significant consultation and collaboration across my Department, with other Government Departments and Bodies including the Ombudsman for Children, and will also involve consultation with a broad range of education stakeholders, including parents and students. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100085#WRY05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Accommodation","counter":1188,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100085#WRY05400"},{"type":"question","counter":1189,"qnumday":488,"qnumall":"[4853\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100085#WRY05500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if she will provide additional temporary accommodation to meet the September 2022 needs of a school (details supplied)","asker":"1627","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1190,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department received an application under the Additional School Accommodation (ASA) scheme\u00a0from the relevant school authority.\u00a0<\/p><p>The application from the school in question\u00a0is being\u00a0assessed by my Department and the decision will be issued to the school shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100085#WRY05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Patronage","counter":1191,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100085#WRY05700"},{"type":"question","counter":1192,"qnumday":489,"qnumall":"[4854\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100085#WRY05800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"her views on the expansion to a double stream school for a national school (details supplied) in County Wicklow.","asker":"1627","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1193,"content":"<p>I can confirm to the Deputy, that My Department received a request for a\u00a0change of status from\u00a0the school in question from a single stream fully vertical, co-educational school to a two stream, fully vertical co-educational school from September 2022.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As part of the assessment process, my Department has taken into account\u00a0the demographic projections and current capacity for the Greystones school planning area.\u00a0 These projections indicate that there is already significant additional capacity available and that an increase from a one stream to a two stream status for the school in question is not warranted.

The Department must\u00a0await a decision on planning from the local authority. A notification to grant planning can be received after 8 weeks, although there is a possibility for the Local Authority to request further information (RFI).

While the Department of Health has responsibility for these services in Ireland, my Department has an important role to support the wellbeing and positive mental health of all our young people. My Department&rsquo;s approach to supporting wellbeing and mental health of young people\u00a0is set out in its Wellbeing Policy Statement and Framework for Practice first published in 2018 and refreshed in 2019.\u00a0 The approach proposed is a whole school and preventative approach which has multiple components that include providing children and young people with opportunities to:<\/p><p>-  build core social and\u00a0emotional skills and competencies<\/p><p>-  experience supportive\u00a0relationships within the school setting<\/p><p>-  be part of a school\u00a0environment and culture that feels both physically and psychologically\u00a0safe, in which they feel a sense of belonging and connectedness,\u00a0that their voice is heard, and they feel supported<\/p><p>Embedded in the whole-school approach is the recognition that members of the school community may have different needs at different times and that a continuum of support in relation to wellbeing should be made available. <\/p><p>My Department&rsquo;s National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) provides educational psychological support to all primary and post-primary schools. This involves direct support in the event of a critical incident, access to national and regional support and development work to build school capacity to support students, access to a NEPS psychologist for responses to queries arising, and access to individual pupil casework where there is need via a NEPS psychologist. NEPS works closely with the HSE and its agencies to ensure those who may require the provision of therapy or counselling are referred on the appropriate clinical services for intervention and support.<\/p><p>The NEPS Support and Development service, reaching an estimated 25,000 teachers annually, is an applied psychological service for school staff to help build their capability to respond to the wellbeing, academic, social and emotional needs of all students, and particularly those who are experiencing barriers to their wellbeing, learning, inclusion and participation. Professional learning activities to support children\/young people with social\/emotional\/mental health difficulties and to promote positive wellbeing in school include the FRIENDS<b><\/b>programmes. These are evidence-based anxiety prevention and resilience building programmes, which foster self-concept and a sense of school belonging using Cognitive Behavioural Therapeutically-informed approaches. Friends programmes help students to develop resilience by teaching them effective strategies to cope with, problem solve and manage all kinds of emotional distress, including worry, stress, change and anxiety. The Incredible Years Teacher Classroom Management programme is an evidence-based programme that equips teachers to manage their classrooms effectively to prevent and reduce behavioural problems while promoting children&rsquo;s wellbeing and emotional and social competence. Since Covid-19 the training has been adapted to online format which increases accessibility for teachers.\u00a0 <\/p><p>NEPS has developed a range of workshops on the promotion of wellbeing and resilience in schools which include upskilling school staff on the use and implementation of therapeutically-informed approaches in schools.\u00a0 These include trauma-informed approaches, approaches based on the principles of cognitive behaviour therapy, and attachment-aware approaches. The approaches outlined in the workshops are based on research findings, on the experience of experts in their fields and on the experience of practicing psychologists working in schools. The workshops will be available to build the capability of school staff in both primary and post-primary settings, including for school leaders, teachers and SNAs. <\/p><p>My\u00a0Department has built strong links with the Department of Health and both Departments are exploring ways to improve supports for young people, including around increased awareness, promoting help-seeking behaviour and sign-posting to the wide range of available services.\u00a0 <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100086#WRZ04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Accommodation","counter":1237,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100086#WRZ04400"},{"type":"question","counter":1238,"qnumday":504,"qnumall":"[5105\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100086#WRZ04500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if her Department will communicate with residents whose homes back onto the yard of a school (details supplied) and the school leadership in relation to railings being installed onto the boundary wall.","asker":"1460","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1239,"content":"<p>My Department will undertake a site visit in the coming weeks to inform a technical assessment of the property.

The gas and electricity element is paid at a rate of &euro;35 per month, 12 months of the year. <\/p><p>Any decision to increase the electricity and gas aspect of the package would have budgetary consequences and would have to be considered in the context of overall budget negotiations.  <\/p><p>The Government is committed to protect vulnerable households from energy poverty.  In light of ESRI research and the commitment to ensure that the carbon tax is progressive, the Government has committed to very significant increases in a targeted package of social protection supports in Budget 2022.

The specific measures are:<\/p><p>- An increase to the Qualified Child Payment of &euro;2 per week for children under 12 and &euro;3 per week for children over 12.<\/p><p>- An increase in the Living Alone Allowance of &euro;3 per week.<\/p><p>- An increase to the Fuel Allowance of &euro;5 per week.<\/p><p>- An increase in the income threshold for Working Family Payment of &euro;10 per week  <b>.<\/b><\/p><p>Analysis undertaken estimates that the net impact of the combined measures is progressive.  Households in the bottom four income deciles will see all of the cost of the carbon tax increase offset, with the bottom three deciles being better off as a result of these measures.<\/p><p>As well as increasing the weekly rate of fuel allowance with immediate effect, we also made a number of reforms to the fuel allowance scheme in Budget 2022, including:<\/p><p>- Increasing the weekly means threshold by &euro;20 to &euro;120, representing a 20% increase and enabling more people to qualify for this support.<\/p><p>- The qualifying period for Jobseeker&rsquo;s and Supplementary Welfare Allowance recipients was reduced from 15 to 12 months with effect from September 2022, again enabling more people to qualify for the support.<\/p><p>The recently announced Electricity Costs Emergency Benefit Payment is a key measure being developed by the Government to help mitigate the effects of the recent unprecedented rise in electricity prices.

The objective of the programme is to provide regular, nutritious food to children who are unable, due to lack of good quality food, to take full advantage of the education provided to them.  The programme is an important component of policies to encourage school attendance and extra educational achievement. <\/p><p>A budget of &euro;68.1 million has been provided for the scheme in 2022. <\/p><p>In recent years entry to the School Meals Scheme has been confined to DEIS schools in addition to schools identified as having levels of concentrated disadvantage that would benefit from access to the School Meals Programme.<\/p><p>Prior to the introduction of DEIS in 2005, all schools and organisations that were part of one of a number of Department of Education and Skills&rsquo; initiatives for disadvantaged schools were eligible to participate in the programme, including Breaking the Cycle, Giving Children an Even Break, the Disadvantaged Area Scheme, Home School Community Liaison and the School Completion Programme.  <\/p><p>These schools and organisations have continued to remain in the scheme since the introduction of DEIS in 2005 but their level of funding has been capped at the same rate year on year to allow for the concentration of the scheme on DEIS schools. <\/p><p>Funding under the School Meals Programme is normally confined to the academic year but an exception was made in recognition of Covid-19.  Funding under the school meals programme remained available to schools to allow them to provide food during school closures and over the holiday periods. <\/p><p>Furthermore, funding was made available to schools participating in the Department of Education&rsquo;s School Based Education Programme, which focusses on pupils with complex special educational needs and those at risk of education disadvantage over the summer months. <\/p><p>The school referred to by the Deputy participated in the Department of Education&rsquo;s School Based Education Programme last summer and received funding to cover the cost of food for the duration of that programme. <\/p><p>Previously, this school applied to join the school meals programme and was informed that no provision could be provided as it does not have designated DEIS status. <\/p><p>Budget 2022 has provided the Department of Education an allocation of &euro;18million for 2022 and &euro;32million for 2023 to extend the DEIS programme to further schools with the highest levels of disadvantage. This represents an increase of over 20% in funding for the DEIS programme and will enable an expansion in 2022 to additional schools. <\/p><p>This package follows an extensive body of work which has been under taken by the DEIS technical group in relation to the development of a model to identify the concentrated levels of disadvantage of schools. The refined DEIS ID model is an objective, statistics based process, based on school enrolment data and data available from Census 2016 under the HP Deprivation Index. It is important to note that there is no application process for the DEIS programme and all schools will be considered by the Department of Education under the refined DEIS model when it is applied.  <\/p><p>In advance of the implementation of the refined DEIS identification model, I am advised that there will be further engagement by the Department of Education with relevant stakeholders. The purpose is to ensure that, as far as possible, the refined DEIS identification model can provide an objective and independent means of identifying schools serving high concentrations of pupils at risk of educational disadvantage and also to ensure there is a full understanding of the refined model and its potential application.I trust that this clarifies the position for the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100088#WRBB02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Registration of Births","counter":1345,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100088#WRBB02900"},{"type":"question","counter":1346,"qnumday":540,"qnumall":"[4335\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100088#WRBB03000","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the status of a birth registration application by a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1473","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1347,"content":"<p>The Civil Registration Act 2004, as amended, places a duty on the parents of a child to register his or her birth within three months of the date of birth.

The Commission was an independent body comprised of knowledgeable and experienced academics, pension experts, members of civil society and representatives of workers and employers.  Once it completed its work and fulfilled its obligations, the Commission was dissolved. The Commission's Report was published on 7th October 2021. The report, Technical Sub-Committee's working papers and submissions made to the Pensions Commission are available on the website, pensionscommission.gov.ie.<\/p>  <p>  The Commission's Report is a comprehensive report that takes account of an assessment of various analyses of population, labour force and expenditure projections; an examination of international approaches; and responses to an extensive consultation process. It has unambiguously established that the current State Pension system is not sustainable into the future and that changes are needed, and it has set out a wide range of recommendations in this regard - including measures to increase Social Insurance Fund (PRSI) income.<\/p>  <p>  The report has been referred to the Joint Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands for its views. Separately, as set out in its terms of reference, the Commission on Taxation and Welfare is considering the report of the Pensions Commission in the context of its review of potential changes to the social insurance system.<\/p>  <p>  In the interests both of older people and of future generations of older people, the Government intends to consider the comprehensive and far reaching recommendations in the Pensions Commission&rsquo;s Report very carefully and holistically. My officials will continue to work over the coming months to examine each of the recommendations. They will consult across Government through the Cabinet Committee system. I think it is really important that we complete that work before reaching conclusions. I intend to bring a recommended response and implementation plan to Government by the end of March 2022.<\/p>  <p>  The State Pension is the bedrock of the pension system in Ireland.  It is extremely effective at ensuring that our pensioners do not experience poverty. This Government is committed to ensuring that this remains the case for current pensioners, those nearing State Pension age and today&rsquo;s young workers including those who are only starting their careers.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100089#WRCC03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Rates","counter":1411,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100089#WRCC03400"},{"type":"question","counter":1412,"qnumday":562,"qnumall":"[5180\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100089#WRCC03500","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"her views on reviewing the maternity benefit payment rate.","asker":"1525","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1413,"content":"<p>Maternity Benefit is paid for 26 weeks to employed and self-employed women who satisfy certain pay related social insurance (PRSI) contribution and other conditions.

On that basis, planning for the opening up of society, including the further education, higher education and research sector, has commenced.<\/p>  <p>  Arising from the announcement, institutions have been advised that there should be an ongoing and continuing emphasis on the promotion and use of individual responsibility and personal protective measures including hand washing, hand sanitizing, respiratory etiquette and use of masks in appropriate circumstances based on individual and sectoral risk assessments.  Institutions will highlight and encourage the importance of exercising individual responsibility in relation to personal protective measures to underpin the opportunities for increased onsite activity now presenting across the higher and further education and research system. Formal requirements for physical distancing in hospitality settings and in general have also been removed and institutions may proceed to plan for increased levels of activity on that basis.<\/p>  <p>  The Safe Return Plan supports this approach and continues to provide a comprehensive framework for institutions to plan for the provision of significant on-site activity and a broader student experience fully supported by public health authorities and has the requisite flexibility to allow institutions to adjust activities for greater levels of on-site activity. In this way, institutions can now take opportunities to expand and intensify on-site learning in the phased way that is envisaged and institutions have been advised that the framework should be utilised in a way that enables this. <\/p>  <p>  As part of the ongoing national strategy, staff and students should be aware of the importance of following public health guidance in relation to self-isolation for cases and restricted movements for close contacts. In line with that guidance, those experiencing symptoms should not attend their educational institution and should immediately self-isolate and arrange for testing. In addition, there will be a continued strong emphasis on maximizing the vaccination uptake for both primary and booster vaccines. Staff and students are encouraged to avail of primary and booster vaccinations given the critical importance of vaccinations in offering protection against infection and transmission of the virus.<\/p>  <p>  Each institution will adapt to the changes in the public health environment in a phased manner and arising from local consultation, and I have emphasized that clear communications by institutions will be key to alleviating any concerns that staff and students have.

My Department continues to support a range of programmes to upskill employees to meet the evolving needs of the economy.<\/p>  <p>  The Skills to Advance initiative was launched by SOLAS in 2018 and is delivered through the Education and Training Boards (ETBs).  It aims to equip employees with the skills to progress in their current job, or to take advantage of new job opportunities.  Targeting support for vulnerable groups in the workforce it also supports SMEs who need assistance to invest in and develop their workforce.    New initiatives in key areas such as leadership and management have been rolled along with sectoral initiatives for the Hospitality and Tourism sector to assist a sector greatly impacted by COVID-19.  During 2021, Skills to Advance expanded its offering to include developing Green Skills for SMEs. Collaboration with over 30 enterprise agencies is central to effective implementation of these new initiatives and ensures that the Skills to Advance initiative continues to be agile and responsive to changing skills needs.<\/p>  <p>  The Innovation through Collaboration Fund, introduced as part of the Skills to Advance initiative, provides ETBs with an opportunity to bid for additional funding to enable a major step-up in innovation in employee development supports and training opportunities for individuals and enterprise.  10 proposals were awarded some &euro;3.3m  under the 2019 Innovation through Collaboration Call across a range of sectors. A further 7 proposals were received under the 2021 Call and I understand that SOLAS expects to confirm the funded proposals shortly.<\/p>  <p>  The Skills for Work programme also continues to provide training opportunities to help employees deal with the basic skills demands of the workplace.  <\/p>  <p>  Within the Higher Education institutions, modular courses have been introduced. These courses are shorter, more focused and offered in a flexible manner, allowing people to gain important skills without taking a considerable period away from work. They represent a new route into lifelong learning, and provide upskilling and reskilling opportunities for those who need it, while ensuring that they remain close to the labour market. <\/p>  <p>  My Department also funds Skillnet Ireland, which provides a wide range of talent development and upskilling supports primarily though the core Skillnet Business Networks programme. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, eCollege is the SOLAS-funded online training facility providing a range of high quality interactive online learning courses in business, project management, information technology, graphic design, web design, digital marketing, software development and basic computer literacy.   eCollege courses have been temporarily made available free of charge as additional supports to those impacted by Covid-19.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100090#WRDD05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1493"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Justice and Equality","counter":1496,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100091#WREE00300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prison Service","counter":1495,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100091#WREE00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1496,"qnumday":591,"qnumall":"[4244\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100091#WREE00300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will provide information regarding the current use of in-cell technology by the Irish Prison Service, aside from telephones, with specific reference to information technology; and the details of upcoming plans and pilots due to be rolled out.","asker":"1570","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":1497,"content":"<p>I can inform the Deputy that in-cell technology utilised in the Irish Prison Service, aside from telephones, includes the use of restricted mobile devices, such as laptops and tablets.<\/p>  <p>  The Prison Service Psychology Service piloted the use of a restricted mobile device in-cell to conduct individual appointments with a psychologist where clinically necessary during Covid 19.

This is a method of communicating information and specifically targeted content directly to prisoners in their cells.  It provides for instant universal messaging where an essential or urgent message can be broadcast from a single central source to every in-cell television across the estate in real time.

Ireland ratified the Convention in November 2011 and the Government is fully committed to its implementation and Irish Government delegations have participated in the Conferences of States Parties.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the Convention, Member States are also party to its review mechanism. The UNCAC review mechanism is a peer review process that assists countries to effectively implement the Convention. The review mechanism is comprised of two review cycles.<\/p>  <p>  The first review cycle, which commenced in 2010, covered Chapters III on Criminalisation and Law Enforcement and IV on International Cooperation. Ireland completed the first cycle in 2014.<\/p>  <p>  The second review cycle, which commenced in 2016, covered Chapter II on Preventive Measures and Chapter V on Asset Recovery. As part of the evaluation process, an on-site visit by the evaluation team took place in Dublin from 26-28 June 2018. An executive summary of the evaluation was published in February 2019 highlighting Ireland's successes and good practices in relation to its implementation of the Convention, and also identifying areas for improvement. The finalisation of the full country report was delayed due to the impact of COVID-19 and was published in December 2021.<\/p>  <p>  Related to this particular recommendation, the report of the Review of Structures and Strategies to Prevent, Investigate and Penalise Economic Crime and Corruption was published on 3 December 2020. This review group was led by Mr James Hamilton and their recommendations focused primarily on legislative, structural and resourcing measures to enhance agency and multi-agency enforcement and prevention capacity in the criminal justice sphere.<\/p>  <p>  One of the issues which they considered was the establishment of a Corporate Crime Agency. Ultimately, the review group came to the conclusion that the establishment of a new Corporate Crime Agency would represent a duplication of efforts and an inefficient use of resources. However, they did recommend the development of a multi-annual national Strategy to Combat Economic Crime and Corruption, and accompanying Action Plan, and the establishment, on a permanent basis, of a cross-sectoral, partnership-based Advisory Council to advise the Government on strategic and policy responses to all forms of economic crime and corruption, as well as a forum of operational representatives.<\/p>  <p>  An implementation plan to progress the report&rsquo;s recommendations was published on 19 April 2021, detailing the exact actions to be taken across government and by State agencies. The Economic Crime and Corruption Forum was established in June 2021 and has met regularly since then. Work is underway to finalise the membership of the Advisory Council thereby enabling its full establishment in Q1 2022 and allowing work to begin on the development of the multi-annual national strategy for combatting economic crime and corruption. The establishment of the Forum and the Advisory Council will in effect fulfil this UNCAC recommendation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100091#WREE02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na","counter":1522,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100091#WREE02900"},{"type":"question","counter":1523,"qnumday":600,"qnumall":"[4467\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100091#WREE03000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of civilian and Garda personnel assigned to the anti-corruption unit of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; the rank or grade of each; and an overview details of the role of the unit in preventing corruption.","asker":"1489","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":1524,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, in accordance with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the management and administration of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which includes decisions on the deployment of personnel among the various Garda Units.

The contract for this project was awarded in February 2019 with the construction element currently anticipated to be completed in the second quarter of this year.  This will be followed by the installation and commissioning of the various security and safety systems with the new facility expected to be operational in Q2\/Q3 of this year. This timeline assumes no further impact on construction activity or supply chain issues due to the pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  The new women's prison will provide accommodation for 50 female prisoners and is a core element of the redevelopment project.<\/p>  <p>  The design concept for the new women's prison was influenced by best practice in prison design and similar rehabilitation facilities found in Scandinavia and it will have perimeter security features associated with medium level security, as it forms part of the overall prison site.<\/p>  <p>  The women's prison facility will differ in many respects to the current prison, having been designed around the principles of normalisation, progression and rehabilitation, underpinned by a therapeutic environment to support women in prison to reintegrate back into society on completion of their sentence.<\/p>  <p>  A mix of accommodation is being provided comprising bedrooms units, some apartment style units, a mother and baby unit with the accommodation based is around an external landscaped courtyard setting in keeping with the design principles on creating a safe therapeutic space and supportive regime. In addition, the new female prison will also provide improved facilities for families visiting. When commissioned the new facility will represent a sea change in the standard of accommodation and rehabilitative supports for female prisoners.<\/p>  <p>  The Prison Service is acutely aware of the importance of assisting prisoners to maintain close contact with their children while in custody. The Deputy will be aware that in order to protect the prison population from the risk of Covid, a number of infection control measures were introduced. Regrettably, this included the suspension of physical visits to prisoners for extended periods of time.  The Prison Service introduced a new video visit system to ensure that prisoners could continue to have visual contact with their families.<\/p>  <p>  Limerick Prison has a Tusla approved and award winning visitors area and the Prison Service work closely with care workers, the courts and Tusla to provide access visits where appropriate.   <\/p>  <p>  Among the commitments of the Probation Service\/Irish Prison Service Women's joint strategy 2014-2016 was to improve outcomes for women offenders, including to explore the development of an open prison\/open conditions for women assessed at a low risk of re-offending.  A Joint Probation Service\/Irish Prison Service working group, when considering an open centre for women, recommended that a more practical and cost effective way to address the needs identified was to pursue a step down facility.  In this regard, the Probation and Prison Service worked collaboratively towards the identification of a suitable venue for a women's step down unit in Dublin, via a public procurement competition with the Office of Government Procurement.<\/p>  <p>  The vision of the Outlook Programme is to promote the rehabilitation and re-integration of women leaving prison and those who have accommodation needs requiring support in the community.  The Programme, which is managed by Focus Ireland, opened in May 2019, supports women serving sentences of imprisonment who pose a low risk to society to gradually re-integrate into the community.  The women the programme caters for are required to be drug free and have, in general, been convicted of one-off offences.  The Programme has capacity for 10 women.  8 spaces at the Outlook Programme at Stanhope Green and 2 apartments - the first apartment has been available since 7 July 2020 and another since 17 May 2021 and to date, 25 women have been supported by the project.<\/p>  <p>  The Abigail Centre is open since December 2014.  Two distinct organisations provide accommodation and other related services for women in the Centre.  NOVAS Initiatives provide supported temporary accommodation for 40 women in the main block of the building.  In a separate but connected unit, called T&uacute;s Nua, accommodation is provided for 15 women and is managed by De Paul Ireland.  T&uacute;s Nua work closely with the Prison and Probation Service to support women offenders to reintegrate into the community on their release from custody.  T&uacute;s Nua is funded by my Department through the Probation Service.<\/p>  <p>  Criminal Justice Housing First is a homeless assistance approach prioritising access to permanent housing for people experiencing homelessness.  Persons on community supervision, referred by the Probation Service, and persons in prison, are included within the broader national processes for Housing First.  A jointly commissioned three year pilot project, responding to the needs of 'harder to place' prisoners, was initiated in October 2020 in a partnership involving Dublin City Council, Probation Service, Irish Prison Service and my Department.  The plan strongly advocates that a cross departmental, cross sectoral approach to the needs of those with high support needs, including women who offend, harnessing the strengths of multiple agencies, is necessary to respond to the needs of this complex group, reduce the risk of homelessness and reduce the person's likelihood of re-offending.  Since the pilot programme commenced, 4 women prisoners have been accepted by Housing First.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100091#WREE05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Process","counter":1552,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100091#WREE05900"},{"type":"question","counter":1553,"qnumday":610,"qnumall":"[4765\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100091#WREE06000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will provide a list of Acts or sections or other provisions of Acts for which a commencement order has yet to be signed in her Department; the reason for the delay; when commencement orders will be signed; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1603","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":1554,"content":"<p>Details of Acts or sections or other provisions of Acts for which a commencement order has yet to be signed in my Department are provided in the table below, along with  he reason for any delay and when commencement orders will be signed. <table>    <tr>       <th><div>Relevant Act <\/div><\/th>       <th><div>Details <\/div><\/th>       <th><div>Reason for not having been commenced <\/div><\/th>       <th><div>When commencement order will be signed <\/div><\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Private Security Services (Amendment) Act 2021 <\/td>       <td>Section 2(1)(a) insofar as it relates to the insertion of the definitions of &ldquo;court messenger&rdquo; and &ldquo;enforcement guard&rdquo; not yet commenced.<\/td>       <td>The Private Security Authority is preparing the regulations which will be needed to prescribe the licensing of enforcement guards. <\/td>       <td>It is the intention to commence Section 2(1)(a) as soon as the regulations are complete. <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Judicial Council Act 2019 <\/td>       <td>Sections 3, 42, 53-64, 67-84, 86, 88 <\/td>       <td>These sections concern judicial conduct and ethics provisions of the Act, and have not been brought in to operation as the relevant guidelines have not been adopted by the Judicial Council. <\/td>       <td>The provisions will be brought into operation after the relevant guidelines have been adopted by the Judicial Council.  <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Civil Law and Criminal Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2020 <\/td>       <td>Section 32 <\/td>       <td>Concerns were raised by some members of the legal profession on this provision, relating to the execution of counterpart documents.

The Directive applies to EEA nationals who move to another Member State or who live in a Member State other than their own and to the family members who accompany them or join them in the State (Article 3 of Directive 2004\/38\/EC).<\/p>  <p>  Exceptions can apply in cases such as:<\/p>  <p>&mdash; Where the non-EEA national family member has previously held a &ldquo;residence card of a family member of a Union citizen&rdquo; that has been issued by another Member State under Article 10 of the Directive and where they and their non-EEA family member have subsequently moved to Ireland, or<\/p>  <p>&mdash; Where the Irish citizen has exercised their right to free movement in another Member State prior to returning to Ireland and their non-EEA national family member accompanies them on return, having resided with the Irish citizen as a family member in that other Member State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100092#WRFF01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na","counter":1565,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100092#WRFF01100"},{"type":"question","counter":1566,"qnumday":614,"qnumall":"[4890\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100092#WRFF01200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 761 of 2 November 2021, if she has received a response from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na regarding statistical information in relation to garda&iacute; assigned to County Longford in September 2021.","asker":"1597","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":1567,"content":"<p>The Deputy will recall that the information requested in Parliamentary Question No. 761 of 2 November 2021 could not be obtained in the time available and I undertook to consult with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and contact you again when the requested information was received.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Garda Commissioner is by law responsible for the management and administration of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including the deployment of Garda members throughout the State.

The General Scheme of the Criminal Justice (Exploitation of Children in the Commission of Offences) Bill was published in January 2021. The Bill underwent pre-legislative scrutiny in November 2021 and is currently being drafted by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel. <\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that this is a complex area as, in many cases, the adult in question is known to the child and may in some cases even be a family member, causing potential issues with regard to witness testimony.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, I published the new Youth Justice Strategy 2021-27 in April 2021 with Minister of State James Browne TD. This Strategy includes a commitment to develop the work of the Garda Youth Diversion Projects (GYDPs) to include targeted work with &lsquo;harder-to-reach&rsquo; young people. This includes young people heavily involved in crime and anti-social behaviour, for whom there are little supports and interventions available in practice, unless they are before the courts, in which case they may be under the supervision of the Probation Service. The Strategy also prioritises early intervention work, including with younger children who are assessed as being at serious risk. Both of these cohorts may include children at risk of recruitment by crime gangs.<\/p>  <p>  The development of this work within the GYDP network will be supported by the Research Evidence into Policy, Programmes and Practice (REPPP) project at the School of Law in the University of Limerick (UL).  The REPPP has led on the Greentown Project, which studied the influence of criminal networks on children in Ireland and a report was published in December 2016. The REPPP project is a strategic research partnership between UL and the Department of Justice.<\/p>  <p>  The Greentown Report identifies crime networks as a separate and plausible risk factor underlying criminal offending by certain children. It outlines how the influence of criminal networks increases the level of offending by a small number of children and entraps them in offending situations. <\/p>  <p>  The Greentown Report recommended the design of a programme to include interventions with children and their families to help them withstand the influence of criminal networks. The REPPP project team implemented a bespoke design process to produce a model for an Irish evidence-informed intervention programme. The Greentown programme has been designed with the input of leading international expertise on crime and criminal networks, together with Irish scientific, policy and practice expertise in child protection and welfare, drugs and community development.<\/p>  <p>  The Greentown programme, developed by the REPPP, commenced in two locations in 2020 and will run for three years. The learning from these trial sites will then be incorporated into mainstream GYDP practice. This specially designed intervention programme was developed with international expert advice, to tackle coercive control of children by criminal groups which entraps them in offending situations. Funds are already available for the initial trial sites from the Dormant Accounts Funds, with a total of &euro;4.2m allocated over three years. <\/p>  <p>  The implementation of the trial sites of the Greentown programme is part of the Strategic Objectives of the Youth Justice Strategy 2021-2027. This implementation process began with the establishment of the Governance and Strategy Group, and the Youth Justice Oversight Group. Both groups are chaired by my Department, which will provide oversight arrangements for Youth Justice Initiatives, including the Greentown pilots, to ensure that there is a cohesive response in practice to the needs of particular cohorts of children and particular communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100092#WRFF03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Health","counter":1587,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100092#WRFF03300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":1586,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100092#WRFF03200"},{"type":"question","counter":1587,"qnumday":621,"qnumall":"[4994\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100092#WRFF03300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if rehab care workers in the community are deemed eligible for the Covid recognition payment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1611","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1588,"content":"<p>Firstly I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to all healthcare workers for their efforts during this most challenging period.<\/p>  <p>  In recognition of the efforts of the general public, volunteers and all workers during the COVID-19 pandemic and in remembrance of people who lost their lives due to the COVID-19 pandemic, on Wednesday 19 January last, the Government announced a once-off public holiday will take place on Friday 18 March 2022.<\/p>  <p>  The Government also announced COVID-19 recognition payment for frontline public sector healthcare workers, to recognise their unique role during the pandemic.

While significant work continues to positively impact on waiting times and improve pathways to elective care, acute hospitals have been impacted by operational challenges arising from surges in cases related to the Delta and Omicron variants.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the response to this the HSE advised all Hospital Groups to take a series of immediate actions which included a period of prioritising unscheduled care, COVID care and urgent time sensitive work - in particular in Model 4 hospitals. Services are beginning to return to normal but elective procedures continue to be affected by staff absences due to Covid and emergency department pressures that are running above 2019 levels.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has confirmed to the Department that patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health continues to work with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to identify ways to improve access to care, including through increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services, providing virtual clinics, and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Department of Health, the HSE and the NTPF are also working on a Multi Annual Waiting List Plan to bring waiting lists in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets over the coming years.

The &euro;250 million will be used to fund additional activity in both the public and private sectors. The &euro;50 million additional funding provided to the NTPF brings its total allocation for 2022 to &euro;150 million, and as a consequence there will be a budget of &euro;350 million available to support vital initiatives to improve access to acute hospitals and community health services.<\/p>  <p>  The information requested by the Deputy is outlined in the attached document. <\/p>  <p>]<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100092#WRFF05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":1613,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100092#WRFF05900"},{"type":"question","counter":1614,"qnumday":630,"qnumall":"[4258\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100092#WRFF06000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if ophthalmology treatment can be facilitated at St. Conal's Hospital, Letterkenny, County Donegal, for a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1462","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1615,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100092#WRFF06100","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"question","counter":1618,"qnumday":631,"qnumall":"[4259\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100093#WRGG00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a person (details supplied) will receive an appointment for an operation in St. James's Hospital, Dublin; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1462","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1619,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

The vision of Sl&aacute;intecare is to achieve a universal single-tier health and social care system, where everyone has equitable access to services based on need, and not ability to pay.<\/p>  <p>  General practice policies central to the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare are the reform of the GMS GP contract and the roll out of a Chronic Disease Management (CDM) programme for GMS patients, and the move towards universal access to GP services without charges on a phased basis. The key primary care policy supporting the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare is the development of the Enhanced Community Care programme.  <\/p>  <p>  The 2019 GP Agreement helps to modernise and reform the GMS scheme, expanding services for patients and making general practice a more attractive career option for doctors. As part of the agreement, the CDM programme for type 2 diabetes, asthma, COPD, and cardiovascular disease, commenced in 2020 and will be fully rolled out by 2023. The CDM programme aims to bring the care for chronic disease further into the community and reduce hospital attendance by patients with the four conditions.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Agreement includes a commitment to undertake a strategic review of GP services within the lifetime of the Agreement, to examine how best to ensure the provision of GP services in Ireland for the future.  The outcome of this review will inform future contractual changes, with preparatory work for the review having begun this year. <\/p>  <p>  A number of measures have been introduced in recent years to expand access to GP care without charges. For example, since 2015, all children under the age of 6 years and all persons aged 70 and over are now automatically eligible for a GP visit card and since 2018, all those in receipt of either a full or half-rate Carer's Allowance or Carer's Benefit are automatically eligible for a GP visit card.

The utilisation of eHealth forms a central part of the ECC programme and is key to supporting integration of services.  <\/p>  <p>  The ECC&rsquo;s various components can be summarised as encompassing six areas of action: <\/p>  <p>  - Establishing CHNs to provide the foundation and organisational structure through which an integrated care system is provided locally based on population need and size.  <\/p>  <p>  - Implementing integrated care programmes for older people and chronic disease management;  <\/p>  <p>  - Expanding workforce and infrastructure capacity in the community through targeted application of resources to a defined population.  The focus will be on implementing best practice models of care to demonstrate the delivery of specific outcomes and sustainable services, which can be scaled for full national implementation;  <\/p>  <p>  - Expanding the range of services available in the community; <\/p>  <p>  - Developing working arrangements for staff and contracted professionals to enable the delivery of expanded services; <\/p>  <p>  - Developing an enabling environment for joined-up community working including ICT, data, clinical governance, patient safety and quality operating frameworks and systems.<\/p>  <p>  These policy aims clearly align with the principles set out in the Sl&aacute;intecare report, as well as with best practice principles enunciated internationally by WHO among others. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100094#WRHH00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":1699,"qnumday":654,"qnumall":"[4362\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100094#WRHH01100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the strategic work which has been conducted to assess and plan for future staffing requirements, workload and demographic pressures in general practice and primary care; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1615","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1700,"content":"<p>The Health Service Capacity Review 2018 estimated future capacity requirements in acute hospitals, primary care and in services for older persons (residential and homecare services) for the period to 2031.

A policy decision was made to extend the HPV immunisation programme to include boys, starting in September 2019, with the introduction of a 9-valent HPV vaccine.<\/p>  <p>  The ages at which vaccines are recommended in the immunisation schedule are chosen by the NIAC in order to give each child the best possible protection against vaccine preventable diseases. As the HPV vaccine is preventative it is intended to be administered, if possible, before a person becomes sexually active, that is, before a person is first exposed to HPV infection.<\/p>  <p>  Therefore, the gender-neutral HPV vaccination programme targets all girls and boys in first year of secondary school to provide maximum coverage. All vaccines administered through the School Immunisation Programme are provided free of charge.<\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to be guided by NIAC's recommendations on any emerging evidence on this issue in the future.<\/p>  <p>  Anyone not in 1st year of secondary school or age equivalent in special schools or home schooled during the 2020\/2021 school year who wishes to get the HPV vaccine, must go to their GP or sexual health clinic and pay privately for the vaccine and its administration. This applies to everyone whether or not they have a medical card\/GP visit card, as it is outside of the HPV immunisation programme.<\/p>  <p>  I have asked my officials to request the National Immunisation Advisory Committee consider the clinical effectiveness of providing the HPV vaccine to:<\/p>  <p>  - girls and boys in secondary school who were eligible to receive HPV vaccine in 1st year but who did not receive it; and<\/p>  <p>  - women up to the age of 25 years who have left secondary school and who did not receive the vaccine when eligible.<\/p>  <p>  If NIAC conclude that there is sufficient evidence to support providing the HPV vaccine to one or both groups, HIQA will undertake a cost-effectiveness assessment on that basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100095#WRJJ04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1786,"content":"<p>Question No. 687 answered with Question No. 632.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":1787,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100095#WRJJ04700"},{"type":"question","counter":1788,"qnumday":688,"qnumall":"[4518\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100095#WRJJ04800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will extend the &euro;1,000 bonus to carers who work in the homes of persons with disabilities and who worked 12-hour shifts and provided care for persons throughout the pandemic, placing their own health at risk to provide that service.","asker":"1595","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1789,"content":"<p>Firstly I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to all healthcare workers for their efforts during this most challenging period.<\/p>  <p>  In recognition of the efforts of the general public, volunteers and all workers during the COVID-19 pandemic and in remembrance of people who lost their lives due to the COVID-19 pandemic, on Wednesday 19 January, the Government announced a once-off public holiday will take place on Friday 18 March 2022.<\/p>  <p>  The Government also announced COVID-19 recognition payment for frontline public sector healthcare workers, to recognise their unique role during the pandemic.

The HSE now has IHIs assigned for the majority of individuals with a PPSN. The challenge now is to deploy these IHIs across the multitude of patient record systems and databases across the wider health system and to assign an IHI to each patient record within those systems. During the pandemic, where it was essential for public health to track and trace individual cases of Covid, the IHI was allocated to records on the national Covid Track &amp;amp; Trace (CTT) system. The national Covid Vaccination System (Covax) also assigned unique IHIs to vaccination records and this was vital when trying to link records between dose 1, 2 and booster. The IHI also facilitated the generation of unique EU Digital Covid Certificates (DCCs) as required under EU regulation. The IHI was also useful in matching between databases for individuals who had a positive PCR test and subsequently required a recovery certificate. The process of self-registration for vaccination, collection of PPSN and verification of identity as people arrived at mass vaccination centres made it possible to allocate IHIs more easily with approximately 97% of those who provided a PPNS, matched directly to their IHI. Plans to deploy the IHI to GP practice systems and hospital patient administration systems were delayed slightly whilst Covid took precedence, but that work will recommence as the impacts of the pandemic reduce and the health system returns to business as usual. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100096#WRKK00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":1801,"qnumday":692,"qnumall":"[4524\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100096#WRKK00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of the digital summary patient records system;

While significant work continues to positively impact on waiting times and improve pathways to elective care, acute hospitals have been impacted by operational challenges arising from surges in cases related to the Delta and Omicron variants.<\/p><p>As part of the response to this the HSE advised all Hospital Groups to take a series of immediate actions which included a period of prioritising unscheduled care, COVID care and urgent time sensitive work - in particular in Model 4 hospitals. Services are beginning to return to normal but elective procedures continue to be affected by staff absences due to Covid and emergency department pressures that are running above 2019 levels.<\/p><p>The HSE has confirmed to the Department that patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.<\/p><p>The Department of Health continues to work with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to identify ways to improve access to care, including through increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services, providing virtual clinics, and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.<\/p><p>In recent years, my Department has worked with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to improve access for patients waiting for high volume procedures, including cataracts. Ophthalmology services are provided throughout all hospital groups in the country, with cataract removal one of the key procedures carried out as part of this specialty.<\/p><p>A key development in improving access to Ophthalmology services was the opening of a stand-alone high-volume consultant-led cataract theatre by the University of Limerick Hospital Group in Nenagh Hospital in 2018, with the intention that it would facilitate patients from surrounding geographical areas to avail of their treatment there. The impact of such initiatives can be seen in the reduction in the waiting times to access cataract procedures since 2018. At the end of December 2021 there were 4,614 patients waiting for a cataract procedure compared to 6,440 in December 2018. <\/p><p>In addition, the Department of Health, the HSE and the NTPF are also working on a Multi Annual Waiting List Plan to bring waiting lists in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets over the coming years. This process will be overseen by a Ministerial Taskforce, chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Health and includes representatives from the HSE and National Treatment Purchase Fund.<\/p><p>For 2022 an additional allocation of &euro;250 million, comprised of &euro;200 million to the HSE and &euro;50 million to the National Treatment Purchase Fund has been provided in respect of work to reduce hospital and community waiting lists. The &euro;250 million will be used to fund additional activity in both the public and private sectors. The &euro;50 million additional funding provided to the NTPF brings its total allocation for 2022 to &euro;150 million, and as a consequence there will be a budget of &euro;350 million available to support vital initiatives to improve access to acute hospitals and community health services.<\/p><p>The information requested by the Deputy, concerning the cataract waiting list, is outlined in the attached document.<\/p><p>Cataracts Waiting List Dec-21 <table>    <tr>       <th>3 Months<\/th>       <th>6 Months<\/th>       <th>9 Months<\/th>       <th>12 Months<\/th>       <th>18 Months<\/th>       <th>Total<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>1,852<\/td>       <td>906<\/td>       <td>602<\/td>       <td>423<\/td>       <td>233<\/td>       <td>4,614<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100097#WRLL02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff","counter":1876,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100097#WRLL02200"},{"type":"question","counter":1877,"qnumday":718,"qnumall":"[4566\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100097#WRLL02300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if a definitive start date will be provided for the two newly-appointed psychologists to the Celbridge and Kilcock primary care centres; when a start date will be agreed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1878,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100097#WRLL02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":1879,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100097#WRLL02500"},{"type":"question","counter":1880,"qnumday":719,"qnumall":"[4567\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100097#WRLL02600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will address a matter regarding the case of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1509","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1881,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

These actions include amongst others, attention to issues around unmet medical needs, affordability of medicines for patients and health systems&rsquo; sustainability, a sound and flexible regulatory system, access to medicines, antimicrobial resistance, providing a fertile environment for Europe&rsquo;s industry, enabling innovation and digital transformation, enhancing Europe&rsquo;s crisis response mechanisms and securing supply of medicines and avoiding shortages.<\/p>  <p>  The Commission has recently launched a study to support the evaluation and impact assessment for the revision of the EU general pharmaceutical legislation, one of the key identified actions required to implement the Strategy. \u00a0It is expected that the outcome of this study will provide data, analysis and evidence to the Commission to evaluate the effects of the comprehensive revision of the general pharmaceutical legislation adopted in 2004, and to assess the impacts of possible future changes to the legislative framework.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>Ireland continues to watch and participate with interest in, the progression of the work activities underpinning the evolution of the aims of Pharmaceutical Strategy for Europe, and wishes to acknowledge the ongoing work being done by the Commission to date on this initiative.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100097#WRLL03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":1891,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100097#WRLL03700"},{"type":"question","counter":1892,"qnumday":723,"qnumall":"[4743\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100097#WRLL03800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a person (details supplied) in County Donegal will receive a date for surgery in Beaumont Hospital, Dublin; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1462","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1893,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

This Expert Panel report, published in August 2020, has added further to our knowledge and learning. This report clearly outlines the key protective measures that we must ensure are in place across our nursing homes. These actions are based on learning from our own and the international experience of COVID-19 to date.  In May 2021, HIQA and the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) jointly published an &ldquo;Analysis of factors associated with outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 in nursing homes in Ireland&rdquo;, delivering on recommendation 6.7 of the Expert Panel report, to further the learning from the pandemic. Further data analysis work and learning will also continue, in line with other recommendations of the Expert Panel and HIQA and the HPSC are developing a further update to this analysis. Work to progress the recommendations of the Expert Panel report, particularly those recommendations requiring a priority focus in the response to COVID-19, is ongoing across all of the health agencies and stakeholders. Continued learning and understanding of progression of the disease in Ireland is an integral part of those recommendations.<\/p>  <p>  More broadly, the Taoiseach has indicated that a comprehensive evaluation of how the country managed COVID-19 will provide an opportunity to learn lessons from our experiences in dealing with a pandemic over the past two years.

It normally takes about 2 years to get through a breast screening round, it will now take approximately 3 years to get through this current screening round. Importantly this is still within international norms, as countries such as England only screen every 3 years. The programme is prioritising people who would have been delayed due to COVID-19. BreastCheck aim to return to screening women every 2 years as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to remember that screening is for healthy people without symptoms. If anyone becomes aware of symptoms, or if they have concerns or worries, they should contact their GP who will arrange appropriate follow-up care. It is important that every woman is breast aware. This means knowing what is normal for them so that if any unusual change occurs, they will recognise it. The National Screening Service and BreastCheck have useful information in relation to self-checking breasts on their website. <\/p>  <p>  The Government provided &euro;10 million additional funding to the HSE for Cancer Screening in 2021, many of the new developments being funded will help increase capacity and enable the management of screening service users with deferred appointments due to COVID-19. This includes three new mobile screening units for BreastCheck, one of which is now operational in Roscommon since October 2021. The other two mobiles are expected to arrive in the near future.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding extending the age of eligibility for BreastCheck, I am pleased to inform that, in line with commitments in the Programme for Government, BreastCheck are now implementing the commitment on age-extension so that all women aged between 50 to 69 years are invited for routine breast screening.  <\/p>  <p>  Future decisions about changes to our national screening programmes, including changes to the age range, will be made on the advice of our National Screening Advisory Committee (NSAC).  This independent expert group considers the evidence for changes in a robust and transparent manner. The Committee&rsquo;s role is to undertake an independent assessment of the evidence for screening for a particular condition against internationally accepted criteria and make recommendations to me accordingly. This ensures policy decisions are informed by the best available evidence and advice.  In this regard I am pleased to advise the NSAC recently held its first 'Annual Call' for submissions from the public on new screening programmes, or proposed changes to existing programmes. I look forward to updates and recommendations from the NSAC when they have concluded their consideration of the proposals received.<\/p>  <p>  Your query regarding BreastCheck activity is also a service matter and therefore has been referred to the HSE for direct reply to you with further details.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100099#WROO04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":2013,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100099#WROO05000"},{"type":"question","counter":2014,"qnumday":767,"qnumall":"[4907\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100099#WROO05100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the way that a person that does not hold an Irish passport and has availed of two doses of a Covid-19 vaccine in two different countries can avail of the EU Digital COVID Certificate (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1583","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2015,"content":"<p>The EU Digital COVID Certificate is a document which is issued to help facilitate the safe and free international movement of people across the EU during the COVID-19 pandemic. <\/p><p>Ireland is currently accepting applications for vaccination certificates from Irish citizens vaccinated in third countries in line with Article 8 of the EU Regulation. \u00a0Currently, Irish passport holders, who have reliable proof a vaccination regime completed in a third country with a vaccine product authorised for use in Ireland, can apply for an EU Digital COVID Certificate online at covidcertificateportal.gov.ie.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100099#WROO05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Procedures","counter":2016,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100099#WROO05300"},{"type":"question","counter":2017,"qnumday":768,"qnumall":"[4986\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100099#WROO05400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when visiting hours will resume in nursing homes and hospitals given that pubs and restaurants are operating at normal hours (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2018,"content":"<p>The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) has recently published &ldquo;COVID-19: Normalising Access in Long Term Residential Care Facilities (LTRCFs)&rdquo;, which will come into effect on 8 February 2022. The guidance takes account of the significant changes to national public health measures in general, whilst also recognising the need for continued vigilance in healthcare settings, including Nursing homes due to the increased vulnerability of people receiving care and\/or living in these settings. The guidance continues to recognise the importance of visiting and meaningful social contact for residents. This is a positive further step forward to a return to more normalised access and visiting for people living in nursing homes and their families.<\/p>  <p>  Key changes of note to the guidance are as follows:<\/p>  <p>  - The minimum level of visiting should normally be daily visits by up to 2 people at one time.<\/p>  <p>  - The introduction of a &ldquo;nominated support person&rdquo;, who should normally have regular and unrestricted access to the resident in the nursing home for whom they are nominated, except if that person is a specific risk to residents (e.g., is subject to self-isolation) or there is specific public health or infection prevention and control advice to limit visitors. This will be in addition to regular visiting. <\/p>  <p>  - Unless specifically advised by public health, at an early stage of outbreak, the nominated support person should continue to have access for some part of each day. If a resident does not have a nominated support person, visiting should generally not be less than 2 visits per week by one person during an outbreak. <\/p>  <p>  - Limitations on visiting should be justified by an up-to-date risk assessment and should be reassessed twice each week.<\/p>  <p>  - There should be no restrictions on movement of residents within the nursing home after going on outings or visits outside of the nursing home unless a significant exposure risk occurred during the outing.<\/p>  <p>  - There will no longer be a need for visitors to show immunity through vaccination or previous infection.<\/p>  <p>  - In line with established guidance, there remains no infection prevention and control requirement to restrict window visits. <\/p>  <p>  This revised visiting guidance is yet another significant step forward in the return to more normalised access and visiting for people living in nursing homes and their families. I expect that all nursing home providers will ensure that they facilitate visiting in line with this new guidance to the greatest extent possible.<\/p>  <p>  Visitors are reminded of their responsibilities with regard to self-checks for COVID-19 in advance of visits, and infection and prevention control and social interaction with others other than the resident they are visiting whilst in the nursing home.<\/p>  <p>  COVID-19 is a continuing risk, especially when community transmission is high.

The number of entrants to GP training has increased from 120 in 2009 to 233 this year, with large increases made in recent years. Further increases are expected as responsibility for training has transferred from the HSE to the Irish College of General Practitioners. Changes have been made to the entry provisions to the GMS scheme to facilitate more flexible\/shared GMS contracts, and to the retirement provisions for GPs under the GMS scheme. An enhanced supports package for rural GP practices was also introduced.<\/p>  <p>  Recent developments in relation to general practice, in particular the 2019 Agreement on Contractual Reform and Service Development, have helped to re-establish general practice in Ireland as an attractive career choice.\u00a0 The additional investment, which will amount to &euro;210 million annually once the Agreement is fully implemented, provides for an increase in capitation fees, improved maternity and paternity arrangements as well as enhanced supports for rural practices. In addition, targeted on-going funding of &euro;2 million will be set aside to provide additional support to practices in deprived urban areas. The wider reforms in the health service will also help to provide an atmosphere in which the practice of medicine in Ireland will remain attractive.\u00a0The additional investment in general practice provides a sound basis for ensuring that GPs have access to a credible and rewarding career path in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100101#WRQQ03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Cards","counter":2122,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100101#WRQQ04000"},{"type":"question","counter":2123,"qnumday":804,"qnumall":"[5087\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100101#WRQQ04100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he plans to address the frequency with which persons with long-term illness are requested to reapply for their medical card; his views on the frequency of medical card reviews for such persons whose health status is unlikely to improve; his further views on an instance in which a person with a long-term illness has had their medical card reviewed twice in three years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1613","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2124,"content":"<p>In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE.

In addition, in 2021 there has been a significant uptake of cervical screening, ahead of their targets by 14%.  During Cervical Cancer Prevention Week (17 &ndash; 23 January), CervicalCheck promoted how women can reduce their risk of this disease and the steps they can take to look after their health.  CervicalCheck took this opportunity to highlight the importance of women over 50 accessing their services.  They are continuing to promote such throughout this year and are planning targeted media campaigns for specific age groups and geographical locations to encourage women to attend.   Further information can be found on the HSE website.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the current recorded uptake rate for the first dose of the HPV vaccine, in the 2020\/2021 academic year, is 76%. The current recorded uptake rate for the second dose of the HPV vaccine in this academic year is 65%. It should be noted that some areas are yet to input some, or all, of their data for both dose 1 and 2 so these figures are expected to increase. The roll-out of the 2021\/2022 HPV vaccination programme is underway and its delivery remains a priority for the HSE. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE National Immunisation Office (NIO) promote HPV vaccine at key opportunities in order to achieve an increase in uptake rates.  For example, during Cervical Cancer Prevention Week the NIO actively utilised social media to promote the facts surrounding HPV vaccination.  In addition, when the immunisation school teams are offering the 2nd dose of HPV vaccine during this school term, the HSE will again support their work through campaigns using social and traditional media channels.<\/p>  <p>  It may be of interest that the HSE has begun working with stakeholders and academics in Australia to develop a model to set a target date to work towards cervical cancer elimination in Ireland. We are in a fortunate position in Ireland to aim for this type of cancer to become a rare disease due to the combination of HPV vaccination programme and the CervicalCheck screening programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100102#WRRR02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":2167,"qnumday":819,"qnumall":"[5167\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100102#WRRR02700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the role of the liaison officers appointed to work with the persons affected by the CervicalCheck scandal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1525","askee":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":2168,"qnumday":820,"qnumall":"[5168\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100102#WRRR02800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will make the document concerning liaison officers for persons affected by the CervicalCheck scandal available; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1525","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2169,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 819 and 820 together.<\/p><p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100102#WRRR02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2170,"content":"<p>Question No. 820 answered with Question No. 819.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":2172,"qnumday":821,"qnumall":"[5169\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100102#WRRR03200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide details on the retrospective audit that will be offered for persons affected by the CervicalCheck scandal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1525","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2173,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for attention and direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100102#WRRR03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":2175,"qnumday":822,"qnumall":"[5170\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100102#WRRR03500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the steps he is taking to involve persons and groups affected by failures of the State to provide proper healthcare such as a group (details supplied) in the development of the Patient Safety (Notifiable Patient Safety Incidents) Bill 2019; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1525","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2176,"content":"<p>The Patient Safety (Notifiable Patient Safety Incidents) Bill 2019 provides the legislative framework for a number of important patient safety issues, including the mandatory open disclosure of a list of notifiable patient safety incidents and the notification of same externally to the Health Information and Quality Authority, Chief Inspector of Social Services and the Mental Health Commission, as appropriate, to contribute to national learning and system-wide improvements.

The working group included representation from key Government Departments, State Agencies and relevant public bodies, namely the Department of Rural and Community Development, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Enterprise Ireland, IDA, &Uacute;daras na Gaeltachta and the Western Development Commission. <\/p><p>The first deliverable from the interdepartmental group was to publish a composite national map of remote working hubs across the country by the end of quarter one 2021. In May 2021 I launched the National Connected Hubs network together with the connectedhubs.ie platform. The National Hub Network Working Group initially identified and mapped over 400 remote working hubs. To date, approximately 180 hubs have joined the Connected Hubs platform, with this number rising on an ongoing basis. <\/p><p>The Connected Hubs platform offers a suite of booking and hub management applications to its members. It will also facilitate the sharing of innovation, experience and best practices across the community. These supports will serve to maximise benefit to member hubs, hub clients, employers, local communities and the wider economy.  <\/p><p>Last year, through the Connected Hubs funding stream, I awarded close to &euro;9 million in funding to over 100 successful applicants.  This allowed for the expansion of remote working infrastructure in digital hubs, including broadband connection points throughout the country.  My Department also continues to invest significantly in the development of remote working facilities across the country through schemes such as the Town and Village Renewal Scheme and the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund.<\/p><p>A Connected Hubs marketing campaign is currently in the final stages of development and will be launched in the coming weeks.  To date, our focus has been to develop a critical mass of hubs on the connecthubs.ie platform, but this will now shift to raising awareness of the network to relevant stakeholders, including SMEs, business owners and hub users. <\/p><p>The right to request remote work is part of the Government's vision to make remote working a permanent feature of Ireland&rsquo;s workforce in a way that can benefit all &ndash; economically, socially and environmentally.<i><\/i>This is consistent with the recognition attached to the importance of remote working within <i>Our Rural Future, <\/i>and<i><\/i>this new legislation will bring us one step closer to making remote working a lasting feature for Ireland&rsquo;s workforce. This is one of many measures the Government has introduced to incentivise remote working, including the right to disconnect and investment in remote working hubs. <\/p><p>The Government recognises that not all occupations, industries, or particular roles within an enterprise will be appropriate or suitable for remote working. The Right to Request Remote Working Bill will provide employees with a right to request remote work and will provide a legal framework around which requesting, approving or refusing such a request can be based. It will also provide legal clarity to employers on their obligations for dealing with such requests. The intention is to introduce a mechanism for employees to request remote working that is fair but does not place an undue burden on employers.<\/p><p>I am confident that the range of supports and initiatives being implemented across Government Departments will help to ensure that the benefits of remote working are available for workers and employers throughout Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100104#WRTT05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Development Companies","counter":2309,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100104#WRTT05400"},{"type":"question","counter":2310,"qnumday":869,"qnumall":"[5044\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020100104#WRTT05500","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"the local development companies that mention sexual, domestic or gender-based abuse and or violence description in their action plans 2021-2022, in tabular form.","asker":"1466","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":2311,"content":"<p>The <b>Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme<\/b>(<b>SICAP)<\/b>, is our country&rsquo;s primary social inclusion intervention.
