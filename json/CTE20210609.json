The national climate objective talks of \"a climate resilient, biodiversity-rich, environmentally-sustainable and climate-neutral economy\".  When it comes to developing the roadmap of action the roadmap is pretty much confined to the climate dimension of this.  There has been some concern in the committee that although there is a biodiversity plan it falls outside the remit of the committee, which is one thing, but it also seems to fall outside the remit of the design of the climate plan.  Equally, there is a growing interest in the concept of a circular economy, on which I know the Minister of State is working.  That again raises wider issues than our own climate inventory, which is purely looked at from the point of view of production within Ireland and does not look at practices that might give rise to emissions in other countries.<\/p> <p>  For Report Stage, would the Minister of State consider whether the roadmap of actions that he will look at under this Bill should be extended to look specifically at initiatives in the area of biodiversity and the circular economy?  In other words, will he look at the entire supply chain not just the elements that are produced within Ireland and so have a wider remit?<\/p> <p>  This committee, in its deliberations, have found it a bit difficult to see that biodiversity challenges are not always co-produced with initiatives that are positive from a climate point of view.  Sometimes there is conflict.  Most of the time they work together but not all of the time.  How can a balance be struck?  Should the Bill in some way recognise the wider dimensions of policies that, I think, should be included?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12021060900002#D00700","speaker":"1549"},{"type":"speech","time":1623193200,"counter":44,"content":"<p>This Bill focuses on emission reduction and a lot of things are contingent on climate action.  Obviously there is a clear link between biodiversity and climate change and there is a clear link between biodiversity and the circular economy.  However, that does not mean everything that is affected by climate change needs to be stuffed into this Bill or that there needs to be actions produced as a result of this Bill on everything that is affected by climate change.<\/p> <p>  As the Deputy has said, we are developing biodiversity plans, a circular economy action plan and new circular economy legislation.  To make a general or thematic point, rather than see this Bill as being the repository for all of the things that we need to do to help the climate, really it is focused on emissions reduction.  All of the other legislation that the Government is producing should be climate compliant and help in those aims.<\/p> <p>  I will not give a glib answer.   I am willing to consider whether the scope of the climate action plan should be extended into areas like biodiversity or circular economy actions.  I am also aware that we are developing these aspects separately in other areas.  It is important that we draw a line somewhere and scope this legislation correctly.

Climate boundaries are ecological boundaries, which must be recognised.  We have had discussions on nature-based solutions and his response clearly indicates why my amendment to incorporate nature-based solutions and a definition of nature-based solutions within this legislation should have happened.  It is really unfortunate, and is looking even more unfortunate, that the Government voted my amendment down but I will resubmit it on the next Stage.<\/p> <p>  We and the D&aacute;il declared a climate and biodiversity crisis which were discussed in parallel because they are so connected.  Biodiversity needs to play a big part in the reduction of climate emissions and if it does not then we will have missed an opportunity.<\/p> <p>  When we respond to climate change and climate emissions we need to be absolutely certain that we do not impact further on our biodiversity or environment.  So any actions that are taken must either have no impact on biodiversity or, preferably, enhance biodiversity.  We have seen recent examples where trees were planted, which facilitates carbon storage, but they were planted on peat.  Therefore, the biodiversity impacts were enormous but there was also an impact on carbon so when landslides happened there was a great deal of carbon emissions from the peat.  We cannot separate the two elements.  The Minister of State's response gives me cause for concern because it seems that we have now rowed back on this.

To shrink that to emissions only would seem not to be in tune with the definition that has been set out in the Bill.<\/p><p>It also leaves these elements working in their own silos, whereas I think there is a feeling in the committee generally that biodiversity and the circular economy or supply chain should be more integrated so they are not looked at individually.  They must be looked at in the sense that there can be trade-offs and those should be done openly.  The other thing is we are setting up quite a strong framework for implementation with cross-Government capacity for delivery which is different from leaving items in their own silos.  When we define the broad objective in this way the cross-Government framework should in some way seek also to encompass that.<\/p><p> My last point is that, unfortunately, some areas of sequestration that could be very useful in potentially creating income in the agricultural sphere are not currently counted in the inventory of emissions.  Therefore looking more broadly at some of those elements of carbon sequestration through forestry, land management or whatever, if we leave them out of climate planning and the inventory they will inevitably get valued downward somewhat.

As I said to Deputy Bruton, I am certainly not dismissing requests out of hand at all.  I am certainly willing to consider it on the next Stage and consider where the scope should lie.<\/p> <p>  In response to Deputy Whitmore, climate change and biodiversity are deeply entwined and obviously very closely linked.  If emissions are increased, biodiversity can be damaged and if biodiversity is disimproved, say by cutting down a forest, emissions can disimprove; the two things are very closely linked.  In the same way, transport is very closely linked with emissions and so are home heating, agriculture and electricity generation, so we have these very close linkages all across the economy and they are not simple to disentangle.  As I said to Deputy Bruton, we will see to what extent we should include biodiversity aims in this particular Bill and to what extent it should be put into separate biodiversity legislation.<\/p> <p>  On Deputy Naughten's point about carbon leakage, as far as I know there is a definition of it in section 6 of the Bill.  Carbon leakage, as the Deputy says, is a really complex area; it is different for different sectors.  Sometimes, if a state stops doing something, if emissions are reduced in one sector in a country, it could automatically be replaced with increases in another sector.  In other areas there is simply no carbon leakage all.  It is, by definition, something to be solved by international cooperation.  The point of EU cooperation, the Paris Agreement, the next Conference of the Parties, COP, and so on is to work out those details on carbon leakage.  Carbon leakage should never be used as an excuse for inaction and for us to say that if we do not do this in our country, somebody is going to do it in another.  Clearly, there are some areas where there is zero carbon leakage.  For example, if one takes the bus instead of driving to work it is not like that is going cause something else in another country.  It is certainly something to be regarded and examined carefully.

The D&aacute;il did not declare a transport crisis but it did declare a biodiversity crisis.  I am not being flippant but if the Government is now looking at biodiversity in the same way as transport we are in serious trouble and the environment is in serious trouble.  I therefore ask the Minister of State to go back to the Minister and his advisors because we cannot silo these issues, we cannot separate them.  These issues must be recognised as intertwined, dependent on each other and not akin to an issue such as transport.  I ask the Minister of State to go back and have a discussion with the advisors just to ensure we are all on the same page.  My assumption was that the Minister was on the same page when it came to importance of including measures within this and addressing biodiversity in parallel and as part of climate action, so I ask that the Government do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12021060900002#E00700","speaker":"1627"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1623193200,"counter":56,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1623193200,"counter":57,"content":"<p>SECTION 7<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1623193200,"counter":58,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 95:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 12, line 25, to delete &ldquo;the Government&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;both Houses of the Oireachtas&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12021060900002#E01000","speaker":"1487"},{"type":"speech","time":1623193200,"counter":59,"content":"<p>Does the Deputy wish to speak to the amendment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12021060900002#E01100","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1623193200,"counter":60,"content":"<p>Not now, no.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12021060900002#E01200","speaker":"1487"},{"type":"speech","time":1623193200,"counter":61,"content":"<p>I understand the Deputy is moving the amendment and withdrawing it with leave to reintroduce it on Report Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12021060900002#E01300","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1623193200,"counter":62,"content":"<p>Yes, we will be bringing it back in again like the others have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12021060900002#E01400","speaker":"1487"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1623193200,"counter":63,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1623193200,"counter":64,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 96, in the names of Deputies O'Rourke, Cronin and Carthy was already discussed with Nos. 91 and 92.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12021060900002#E01600","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1623193200,"counter":65,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 96:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 12, between lines 28 and 29, to insert the following:  \t&ldquo;(c) in subsection (8), to delete &ldquo;A Minister of the Government shall, in the performance of his or her&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;The Government and a Minister of the Government shall, in the performance of his or her or its&rdquo;.&rdquo;.  <\/blockquote> <p>We discussed this earlier and had a vote on the same issue so we will move it with leave to reintroduce.

I am grateful to you for your forbearance in allowing me to speak to the amendment.

We put forward this amendment on the basis that we wished to support the Government's attempts to ensure there is a meaningful piece of legislation on climate action and low carbon development.  I merely wish, from a procedural point of view, to understand the logic of disallowing the amendment, which seeks a sectoral adaptation plan in respect of afforestation and targets therein, and similarly in respect of the remediation of bogs without impinging whatsoever on individuals' turbary rights, in the first instance.  I would hope that the Chairman or perhaps the Minister of State could help my understanding of the logic behind the decision to disallow the amendment in the first place.  That is merely what I wish to ascertain.<\/p> <p>  Second, and depending on the answer to that, I do not see how a sectoral adaptation plan in relation to afforestation which I would consider to be germane to the issue of climate action could be injurious to a Bill of this nature unless, of course, it is a matter of interpreting the Minister of State's position thus far, which is that \"not ... everything ... needs to be stuffed into this Bill\".  I would have thought that afforestation targets are absolutely germane to this legislation.  While we acknowledge the role of the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, in relation to her current afforestation travails, notwithstanding the challenges in relation to licensing, the Labour Party strongly feels there is an issue here that is absolutely germane to the issue of climate action.  I wish to seek a justification for ruling that amendment out of order.  Thank you, Chair, for allowing me to intercede.

It comes back to the issue of biogenic methane we discussed last week.  Again, I am not looking for agriculture to be given a free pass in this legislation but I am looking for a separate and distinct target for biogenic methane.  As I said last week, I am not referring to the issue of nitrous oxide but specifically to biogenic methane.  Substantial progress can be made in agriculture, particularly in terms of land use, which Deputy Se&aacute;n Sherlock spoke about earlier.  The reality is the first deadline for emissions reductions is now 233 weeks away.  The only way we can achieve significant reductions across the agricultural sector that will have a real impact in that period of time is through herd reduction.  At the weekend, we saw the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine point out that there will be a freeze on herd numbers in the dairy sector, which implicitly means there will be a reduction in the beef sector.  That would be of huge concern, particularly on marginal land where no other farming practice can manage that land and provide for the variation of biodiversity we spoke about this morning.<\/p> <p>  The issue of biogenic methane is clearly reflected in EU policy and in the contributions of the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and his predecessor Deputy Richard Bruton, last week.  It is enshrined in legislation in New Zealand, a country with a very similar climate profile to Ireland.  Insufficient recognition is being given to the issue of biogenic methane.  Perhaps the Minister of State can return to the issue of definitions in his response.  While reference is made to biogenic methane in the Bill, no specific definition is outlined.  As the Minister of State knows, the Climate Change Advisory Council explicitly stated there should be a very clear definition for biogenic methane and it should be accounted for separately in our emissions target.  The Climate Change Advisory Council goes on to state we should argue at EU level, and there is a valid argument, for a separate target for biogenic methane.<\/p> <p>  It is very hard to have an EU-wide target for biogenic methane when we are not prepared to differentiate it within our legislation.

I will first address the definition question and how we will define the impact of biogenic methane in particular.  Previously, the Deputy referred to carbon leakage and, as I said, addressing such an issue requires international co-operation.  International co-operation is needed on definitions, metrics and measurements even before starting to reduce emissions.  That is why a common measurement is needed for all these things.  An agreed common measurement is needed on the impact of every greenhouse gas, including methane.  We will use the agreed definitions from the UN, EU and other relevant international bodies so we can work, co-operate and collaborate with other countries, which we have to do because we are sharing an atmosphere.<\/p> <p>  The question of whether biogenic methane will be treated differently, and have a separate budget and so on, will be examined.  It is the responsibility of the climate change advisory committee to consider the effect of each greenhouse gas.  The Bill provides for the Climate Change Advisory Council, CCAC, when it proposes carbon budgets, to take account of the best scientific advice, including the special characteristics of biogenic methane, the most recent greenhouse gas inventory and projection reports, international best practice and the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions and removals, so far as practicable.  The Bill also includes the need to maximise employment, the attractiveness of the State for investment and the long-term competitiveness of the economy having regard to the principle of climate justice.  That is the guidance to the CCAC.<\/p><p>In general, the agricultural sector is distinctly different from other sectors in that it has the possibility of negative emissions, carbon sinks, approaches that involve biodiversity or bog rewetting, or other activities.  It has the possibility of reducing, storing and sequestering emissions that other sectors do not have.  The answer in short is that I oppose the amendment on the basis that it is not required.  The CCAC will examine the special characteristics of biogenic methane and other greenhouse gases and what their separate impacts are.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12021060900002#G01700","speaker":"1479","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623193200,"counter":108,"content":"<p>I want to speak to the Minister's amendment.

There are targets set out in the Bill.  It will have a statutory target of 51% coming from the programme for Government.  There are also EU targets under which we have obligations.  They are split into two factors.  One is an emissions trading system, ETS, and the other is the effort sharing element.  Emissions trading is predominantly heavy industry and electricity and the rest involve the other sectors such as agriculture, transport and so on.  What I am trying to understand is how the 51% target, however it is decided by the climate council and approved by the Government, will gel with ongoing negotiations as to what our EU responsibility should be under the Fit for 55 target.  The EU will develop targets in a different way from the methodology we use to develop them.  Do we expect the EU's Fit for 55 package to be reconciled before the climate council sits down to do its work?  Will the climate council effectively decide our position for Europe and has that been accepted?  I want to understand that process because, as I understand it, there is a lot of toing and froing and there are moving parts.  It includes the topic which Deputy Naughten raised.  How do we get credit for the sequestration which is possible in the agriculture sector, but not currently counted in the inventory?  There are many moving parts, the reconciliation of which will make it either more difficult or easier for us to develop policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12021060900002#H00400","speaker":"1549"},{"type":"speech","time":1623193200,"counter":111,"content":"<p>They are good questions.  This pattern is always a challenge: wanting to do something in one's own country while the EU is doing something on a general level.  How does one reconcile the two?  One option is to sit back and wait for the EU to do something and then try to row in with it.  We are quite far behind.  A previous Taoiseach described us as a climate laggard.  We do not have the luxury of sitting back and saying let us wait and see what comes out of Fit for 55 when it is due.  We have our own ambition which is a 51% reduction by 2030 and we must get on with it.  We are already at the back of the race and we need to catch up.  How will those things reconcile?  Deputy Ryan, who is not here because he has gone to Luxembourg to discuss this with the other environment ministers, will work out those details.<\/p> <p>  The ETS targets are likely to be tightened, Deputy Bruton is correct, in order to meet the Fit for 55 targets.  Many other environmental pieces of legislation are likely to come into force in all sectors, in addition to legislation that affects biodiversity and everything else.  There are likely to be targets to do with recycling and the circular economy.  This is likely to happen in the coming years and we cannot predict when the legislative changes will be made at EU level.  It is clear what is the strategic direction of travel.  It is to reduce emissions by a large amount and to protect the environment.  That is the direction this Bill goes in.  We may have to reconcile it with EU rules.

I have a fundamental issue with this Bill.  I agree with the principle of the Bill but my fundamental difficultly is that we do not know how this will be measured, even though we are going to enact the legislation.  We set the target for 2030 but we do not know how that will be measured over that period.  Deputy Bruton is correct in terms of carbon sequestrations.  It is left out of the European inventory, which is greatly frustrating.  The Minister of State is correct, negotiations are ongoing at the moment which will decide how this will be reconciled.  We must be more ambitious, but we are setting targets in stone without knowing how we will measure them.  The CCAC has specifically highlighted this challenge.  Under the UN climate mechanism and the EU reporting structures, agricultural emissions are calculated separately from the removal of sequestration associated with land use.  The Minister of State put the point across well when he responded to me initially that the opportunity is there within agriculture to sequester carbon.  However, the difficulty is that none of us knows how that will be measured in an Irish context, in a European context, because it is not measured now, or in an international context.<\/p> <p>  On the one hand we are setting overall targets, but we do know what the rules will be to achieve those targets.  What I am trying to do with my amendments is to separate out that target for agriculture.  We must have a plus and minus.  The Minister of State is correct that agriculture is unique in that there is the plus and minus capacity within it.  There is no doubt, and all of us agree, that land use and land use change are fundamentally important in terms of where we will be in agriculture in 2030.  The progress made in transport and heating, or lack thereof, will have a direct impact on what we can and cannot do and how things will be counted in agriculture.

We will keep going until we get this Bill passed and get our first carbon budget done this year so we can get working on this issue.  Agriculture has a unique position in Ireland.

He asked about the different calculation formulas.  I think he was asking whether we are moving from 2018 to 2030 as the start year.  That is correct.  It is a 51% reduction.  I think the Deputy was asking whether or not that aligns with the 7% reduction every year.  What the programme for Government says is an average of 7%.  What has to be taken into account is that, in practice, emissions reductions are variable from one year to the next.  They can be variable because of factors like weather.  There can be a very cold or a very warm winter.  There can be a pandemic, as we have had in the past year.  There can therefore be asymmetric shocks to the system that lead to great variability in year-on-year emissions.  This Act is about looking towards 2050 and then looking at that period in smaller sections: five-year sections for the carbon budgets and ten-year sections for the 51% target for 2030.  What is important is that we reach the goals we have set for 2030 and the goal we set for 2050, not that 2027 will see a particular percentage reduction compared with 2026.

The latter, as the committee will know, envisaged 1 million electric vehicles on the road, 500,000 homes being retrofitted, 600,000 electric heaters and so on.  We are now talking about a much more radical ambition and it would be quite unrealistic to think that that enhanced ambition could be delivered in year one.  The programme for Government was very clear that in the first five years we need to initiate a number of measures that will start to bear fruit only in the latter part of the decade and beyond.  I absolutely agree with the formulation the Minister of State has now set out.  We have to hit the 51% target by 2030, but it would be quite unrealistic to think we could deliver 7% each and every year.  Even last year, with all the disruption, 7% was, I think, barely achieved.  We are now embarking on a much more ambitious road but we need new policy measures to achieve this and they will not be delivered overnight.  I have seen letters suggesting that this Bill should enshrine 7% each and every year.  That is simply not practical.  It would not be practical for us as practising politicians.  I am not talking in party political terms.  None of us would not be able to agree that.<\/p> <p>  The other point I wish to take up is Deputy Michael Healy-Rae's point as to how we will measure emissions.  I know Deputy Healy-Rae would love to say all the existing hedges should see the farmer get a credit, but the reality is that we are in huge deficit on our climate commitments.  Therefore, if we are to give credit, it has to be to farmers who do new things to sequester.  There will not be credit for, if you like, the legacy element of what is going on on the farm.  It is new initiatives that we should seek to reward in order that if a farmer undertakes some initiative on his farm, which could involve dealing with and strengthening hedgerows and so on, that is what has to be rewarded.<\/p><p>We cannot, as a community, say we are going to pretend we are doing much better than we are and pay ourselves for things when we are already in deficit.<\/p><p> A point that is more for the Minister of State is that if one was to measure land use overall, Ireland would be in aggregate deficit.  Talking about net emissions will not cure this problem because in that regard we are minus 4 million tonnes on land use.   We need to start rewarding people who make changes in their land use rather than pretending they have to make changes to get that minus 4 million tonnes up to zero and only after that will we be in the business of awarding credits.  That is key to resolving the concerns expressed by Deputy Michael Healy-Rae and getting a workable policy.  It is an area the Minister and Minister of State need to explore in terms of how we can find ways of rewarding new sequestration rather than people thinking they should get credit for something their father may have done 100 years ago.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12021060900002#J01300","speaker":"1549","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623193200,"counter":129,"content":"<p>This is about emissions, sequestration and the change from one year to the next.

Amendment No. 125 provides that the second carbon budget would be formally presented to the Oireachtas.  As the legislation is currently drafted, the first carbon budget and the draft third carbon budget will be presented and the Oireachtas will have the opportunity to accept or reject those budgets.  If they are rejected, the Minister can, within 60 days, bring in whatever budget he or she likes.  That broader issue is one we have discussed already and to which we will return.  I am not going to deal with it now.  The issue here is that the second budget is not formally put before the Oireachtas other than in this legislation.  Some may argue that the Oireachtas is deciding on that now because it is deciding on this legislation.  That may well be the case.  I am sure it is the argument the Minister of State will put forward.  The point I am making is that it is not good parliamentary practice to introduce a budget, whether it is financial or otherwise, without having a formal ratification process by the Parliament.  Every year, the Minister for Finance must present his or her budget to the House for approval.  The national development plan must be presented for approval, as must the national planning framework.  However, the 2030 carbon budget will not be formally presented to the Oireachtas for approval.  I believe it should be so presented.  I will not dwell on the issue but it is good parliamentary practice for each budget to formally be presented, laid before the House and debated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12021060900002#K03300","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speech","time":1623193200,"counter":156,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 132 and 137 try to achieve the same thing and address the same issue relating to accountability to the Houses of the Oireachtas, as well as addressing the issue, which may come to fruition, of the Houses of the Oireachtas not supporting a budget but the Minister being able to come back with the exact same budget.<\/p><p>We want to rule out the option of coming back with an unrevised budget.

It is setting in place a process by which we can achieve that.  There are checks and balances along the way as we decide how it is done.  We have our CCAC and we have Oireachtas committees where Ministers can be brought in for cross-examination on their actions.  The question raised by these amendments is whether the Houses of the Oireachtas should be allowed to stop the carbon budgets from going through.  The danger, if we allow this to happen, is that we will be entering into a recurring cycle of carbon budgets.  In other words, if a compromise and collective agreement can be reached on a budget by the Houses that is fine, but if these budgets keep being rejected then there is no reason that any carbon budget can then be put through and we are left in a situation where we have nothing to work with.  We have agreed what the emission reduction is going to be.  When the carbon budget is presented to the House, it has the opportunity to reject it and to ask for it to be reconsidered.  We cannot allow that to be an infinite power.<\/p> <p>  There is an idea underlying these amendments that this is undemocratic and this is simply untrue.  The process provides an opportunity for the Houses to provide input into the carbon budget in the first two-month period on the publication of the CCAC budget but also to vote on the budget as presented.  There is, therefore, plenty of time for debate.  I strongly disagree with the proposal and the Government should be the final approval authority but should then be held accountable by the Oireachtas for its approved budgets.  If we were to delegate approval to the House as a whole that would undercut the role of the Executive to the detriment of accountability.  Who is the Oireachtas going to cross-examine and hold accountable if it has made the decisions itself?  I am calling therefore for the amendment to be withdrawn. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12021060900002#L00700","speaker":"1479"},{"type":"speech","time":1623193200,"counter":164,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Healy-Rae to speak.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12021060900002#L00800","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1623193200,"counter":165,"content":"<p>Surely, what the Minister of State has just said there is so wrong I cannot begin to explain how angry I am at his comments.

I have no problem whatsoever in democracy working to its fullest extent if a majority of Deputies on any day vote one way or another on any issue.  That is 100% okay, is beautiful and is democracy.  What the Minister has just said there is so undemocratic.  He is saying that we are putting this in place to bypass and minimise the amount of input that can be there from Deputies.  He wants to silence backbenchers of any party supporting the Government, to ensure that their hands will be tied so much that they will not know whether they are sitting on them handcuffed or where their hands are but they will certainly not be doing their job which is representing the people.  The Government has come along with this whole proposal, has wrapped it up and packaged it in such a way as to silence the future public representatives, whoever they are and from whatever party they belong.

We have not heard this from anyone else to date.  The Minister of State states that there are checks and balances along the way.  There certainly is a mechanism where there is engagement with the Oireachtas which is already in place in the 2015 legislation which we all accept is inadequate.  The Minister of State is basically regurgitating the engagement with the Oireachtas of the 2015 legislation.  The approval and ratification process, however, is now being taken out of the hands of the national Parliament and put into the hands of the Government.  The Minister of State said in his response that the Government should be the final approval process.  I inform the Minister of State that no, it should not.  It should not be the final approval process as the national Parliament should have that role.  If we were to replicate what the Minister of State has just been arguing in regard to public finances, one would have the Minister for Finance in the first budget after an election cycle presenting all of the taxation measures for the next five years, the taxes that are going to be introduced and how they will apply to every individual across the country, without saying how the Minister is actually going to spend any of that money over the five years.  If D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann rejects that budget as it is presented by the Minister for Finance, then the Minister for Finance can bring in any taxation measure he or she wants within 60 days without any recourse to Parliament.  That is an unbelievable power that we are giving to any Minister or Government.<\/p> <p>  The sectoral target plans are even worse and there is at least some mechanism and a veil of a type of approval process here with this legislation on the carbon budget.  There are none in respect of the sectoral targets.<\/p> <p>  On the overall carbon budget, the Oireachtas has the choice.  It either accepts it or leaves that to the Minister of the day to bring in whatever budget he or she so wishes.  That is completely unacceptable in any democracy.  I gave an analogy on the Second Stage of this legislation.  The powers that we are giving here are far in excess of what should be given to any one individual or Government of the day.  Ultimately, we as Deputies are the ones who are accountable to the people.  Anyone who accepts this legislation as it is currently drafted is basically writing him or herself out of any formal or legal input into either the carbon budgets or the sectoral targets from here onwards.  That is fundamentally wrong and I urge the Minister of State to reconsider this between now and Report Stage.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State will agree that the vast majority of Members of the Oireachtas are in support of moving forward in a very positive way in achieving our overall climate targets, not just to 2030 but beyond that to 2050.  Let us say, however, down the road that we have a Minister and a Government who are not ambitious in this.<\/p><p>They can put forward very inadequate carbon budgets while taking cognisance of what the CCAC says.  They can listen to what the committee says but, ultimately, they can set very minimal targets.  The Parliament elected by the people has no function.  If it rejects that budget because it believes it is insufficient to meet our global and domestic challenges, the Minister of the day can bring in whatever budget he or she wishes, which is unacceptable.

It is really important that the Minister of State hears the concerns being outlined here.  This legislation does two big things.  It sets ambitious interim targets and 2050 targets and sets out a framework for making a plan to achieve those targets.  For me, the framework is about whose voices are heard, who has a place at the table and the level of transparency and accountability.  The Minister of State's input will not provide assurance to people who are looking on and are concerned about their input into this process through their public representatives and outside of that.  That in itself will raise further concerns in respect of those people who for whatever motivation want to undermine the climate effort.  The Minister of State should look at the piece relating to just transition.  We had that argument yesterday and may have it again but this piece relating to democratic accountability is important because we are talking about a situation that is unlikely to arise in the first instance no more than in the case of the annual budget in October because we have parties and the Whip system.  This is all the more reason to afford the Houses of the Oireachtas a say in this rather than just the Government.  I made the point in terms of coming back with unrevised proposals or, as Deputy Naughten said, proposals that are completely revised to the extent that they look nothing like the first revision in any way.  It is an issue that needs to be heard and addressed here between now and Report Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12021060900002#M00200","speaker":"1507"},{"type":"speech","time":1623193200,"counter":169,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for their contributions.  As legislators, we decide the line that is drawn between what is an Executive action and what is an action for the Oireachtas and this is part of what is happening in respect of drawing up this Bill.  What this Bill does is set a very clear target.  As Deputy Naughten said, the 2015 Act was inadequate.  This is trying to address that.  I welcome the fact that we are all trying to achieve the same thing here.  By setting that target, that is the strategy and objective that must be achieved.  What then happens is that the Executive is the operational body that must carry out the actions to achieve that target.  It is not for the Oireachtas at that point to intervene in the Executive actions.  There is a reason why we have an Executive and a reason why we have a Legislature.  They are two different bodies and they each have different functions.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Naughten referred to a hypothetical future where a Minister arrives who has a very low degree of ambition and either brings along a carbon budget that will not achieve anything or is opposed to the whole idea of climate action.  What would happen in that case?  How could the Oireachtas stop that Minister?  That is what this law does.  That is what this Bill is doing.  It brings in a requirement for the Government to comply with international obligations and meet that 51% target.  It is justiciable.  It is something in respect of which one can go to court if the Government is not meeting the obligations it is required to meet under the Bill.  Those are the two levers.  In fact, we are more strengthened in our position than we would be.  Of course, it is always open to a future D&aacute;il to amend or repeal the legislation because at the end of the day, the Oireachtas is the body that makes those decisions but the Executive must be allowed to perform the actions once the targets have been set and for once, we are setting targets in this legislation.  There is a reduction target of 51%.  Every five years, a carbon budget will be set.  It is a long-term process so it is not like an annual financial budget where we look at how much money will be spent in a few months time.  This is a long-term objective involving a five-year carbon budget, a ten-year target to reach 2030 and the longer-term target to reach 2050.  I feel it has the right balance between the powers of the Executive and the powers of the Oireachtas and it does mean that the Government must perform the actions it is duly bound to perform by this legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12021060900002#M00300","speaker":"1479"},{"type":"speech","time":1623193200,"counter":170,"content":"<p>I must interrupt the Minister of State.

I do not dispute that point with the Minister of State at all.  Setting an overall budget on a five-yearly basis in respect of our overall carbon emissions and setting sectoral targets, however, are not operational actions and cannot be considered as such.  Such matters should be ratified and approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  Under no circumstances should a gun be placed to the heads of the Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to the effect that if they do not ratify these proposals, the power will then be handed over directly to the Minister of day to set whatever targets he or she wishes.  If the initial proposals are rejected by the D&aacute;il, it should still be necessary for any new proposals to come back to and be approved by the House.  This is the democratically elected Parliament of the country and there is no getting away from that fact.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State's defence is to say it would be possible to go to court and force the Government to do something.  However, the Judiciary and the Legislature are two very separate and distinct arms of constitutional authority in Ireland.  Therefore, for the Government and the Minister of State to be saying that if people are not happy with this situation they should toddle off to the steps of the Four Courts is not good enough.  The people who are accountable in this regard are the 160 Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la elected in all the constituencies in the country.  The Government should be able to justify and explain why it is taking an approach and that approach should have to be approved by the majority of the elected Members of Parliament.<\/p> <p>  We have said all along that we can only achieve our targets for 2030 or 2050 by bringing people along with us on the road.  Some people pay lip service to this point, but I firmly believe in it.  To legislate the D&aacute;il out of existence in respect of approving or rejecting the overall budgets and sectoral targets will undermine that principle.  This is one principle I am not prepared to bend on.  I believe that a fundamental aspect of this legislation should be that the D&aacute;il is the body that approves the five-year budget.  During the last D&aacute;il, colleagues of the Minister of State made the argument that the planning framework and national development plan, NDP, should be approved by the D&aacute;il and that these matters should not just be left to the Executive.  The objectives of the planning framework and the NDP must at least come before the D&aacute;il annually and go through the budget process in the form of the vote on the budget itself and then consideration of the Estimates for each Government Department.<\/p> <p>  These sectoral targets, however, are not going to be ratified by the parliamentary committees and will not be presented to the D&aacute;il for ratification in any form whatsoever.  The only function and role we will have as parliamentarians will be to accept a proposal once every five years or hand the power back to the Minister concerned.

I fell off the call there.  I do not know what happened.  I only caught the end of Deputy Naughten's contribution.  I understand where the Deputy is coming from, but throughout the hearings we have had on the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill 2021 we have been told to listen to the science.  We have also repeatedly heard all parties telling the Government that it needs to have a tighter legal framework which puts more legal obligations on Ministers to ensure they are accountable for delivery in their sectors.  These are solemn international treaties that we have signed up to and we must deliver on our obligations in that regard.<\/p><p>There has been a desire from most of the Opposition to have legislation that can be litigated.  However, the Oireachtas cannot be brought to court for failures.<\/p><p> There is something of a dilemma here.  If people want legislation which honours a treaty that the Government has entered into, want us to listen to the science as determined by the CCAC and want a tight framework according to which Ministers must be held to account by the Oireachtas and the wider public for the delivery on this global challenge, there is then a dilemma if we are going say that we want to have the opportunity to decide to reject the climate budget that is determined by the science and want a different approach to be taken.  I can see the argument that Deputy Naughten and others are making.  However, some of the very same people who are making that argument here today were strenuously making the opposite argument that we need to listen to the science and nail down Ministers because Governments are recalcitrant and will always fail, and we need to create a very tight legal framework for them.  If we then say, with one leap, our hero is free, because the Oireachtas can reject it, the whole thing goes up in smoke.<\/p><p> There is a dilemma for the committee members here.  I have had some doubts myself about creating these legal straitjackets.  We are politicians and must be given a bit of freedom, but most of the contributions we have heard have been in favour of making that straitjacket tighter and the obligations greater.  That has been a theme that has been coming across in contributions made by Opposition members in committee as we have considered this Bill.  It is again reflected here.  There is a scepticism of Government.  It could be argued that the Oireachtas may decide that the science will not apply after all.<\/p><p> While I can understand the arguments that Deputy Naughten and others are making, there is a line.  The Oireachtas is responsible for making laws.  That is the responsibility of the Oireachtas and we have to decide \"Yay\" or \"Nay\" on this.  However, it is not repugnant for us to decide that these treaties are so important that when we enter into them, and when the science pronounces on how we should proceed, that he Government has an obligation to push on with that and it is our job, as Members of the Oireachtas, to hold it to account for its work.<\/p><p> We need to give serious consideration to what the Minister of State is saying.  Most of the arguments that I have listened to over the last six months have come from a very different perspective.  The arguments are for more tight controls and a tighter straitjacket on Government to show that it will honour the commitments that were made in Paris.  That has been a strong theme.  If we believe that, the Minister of State's arguments deserve to be listened to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12021060900002#Q01100","speaker":"1549","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623193200,"counter":184,"content":"<p>The goal of the legislation is to create a process that is not easy to dismantle on a whim, either by the Executive or the Oireachtas.  Of course, it is possible to appeal it or amend it.  The Oireachtas always retains that power.  The D&aacute;il can reject the carbon budget if the Members do not like it.  There is going to be public consultation not just on the climate action plan, but also on the carbon budgets.  The legislation also provides not just for a public consultation, but for an ongoing regular engagement and dialogue on the climate actions that are contained in the climate action plan.  The Ministers will be accountable to the committees to ensure that they are doing what they are supposed to do and all of this has been designed and engineered, as Deputy Bruton stated, to be justiciable.<\/p> <p>  There are many levels and safeguards there.  Overall, the basic proposition is that we are setting an emission reductions target for 2030 and that the Members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad have to decide between them whether this a target that we want to achieve, this is our ambition on a large scale and this is our strategy.  If this is a strategy that we want to achieve, the Executive should be permitted to come up with an action plan that allows that objective to be met.  It must be ensured that the action plan is acceptable to the public, that it brings people with it and there is real engagement.  It cannot work without people believing and knowing that it is a fair plan, they are being listened to, the plan makes sense and everyone has been included.<\/p> <p>  That is our goal.  I do not think that it would help to remove the power of the Executive to implement it or to move that to the Oireachtas.  The Oireachtas is getting the power now to decide if it wants that 51% reduction and if it wants to reach that 2050 net zero target.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12021060900002#R00200","speaker":"1479"},{"type":"speech","time":1623193200,"counter":185,"content":"<p>I am conscious that we have had a very extensive, if enlightening, discussion on these amendments.

This legislation does provide for that.  I am not disputing that.  At the outset, I stated that this is important legislation.  I do not disagree with the principle of it.  However, science is not black and white.  Evidence changes.  If we were take the phrase \"Climate Change Advisory Council\" out of this debate and replace it with \"the National Public Health Emergency Team\", it would be different.  There is a very different view around the Houses of the Oireachtas today in respect of the black and white advice that has been given by NPHET over the last 12 months.  Yet, we are now enshrining in law a particular perspective on scientific advice that will be set in stone between now and 2050.  The only option that the Members of Parliament have is to accept what is presented by the Minister.  If they do not accept what is presented by the Minister, the Minister has a blank cheque to bring in whatever targets he or she wishes, which may have no bearing on the contents of the original proposal.<\/p> <p>  Yes, we do need to listen to the science, but ultimately we are the ones who are accountable to the people.  We have to explain and defend why we are taking an approach, just as every single one of the 160 Deputies who voted in the D&aacute;il last week on the extension of the emergency health provisions, had to.  Every one of us was held accountable to our constituents across the country in respect of why we took a particular approach in relation to that matter.  However, if this legislation is enacted as it is currently drafted, that mechanism is no longer available to the electorate.  I think that is wrong.<\/p> <p>  It is a fundamental difference in approach from that of the Minister of State and Deputy Bruton.  I know the views of members of the committee and the view that I have.  I think that it is a wrong approach to legislate the D&aacute;il out of existence in relation to this issue.

There are already huge provisions in the Bill that acknowledge the range of perspectives and voices that have to be heard.  This is built into it.  What is very important is the process by which we come to agree the budgets and various elements of the plan, whose voices are heard and how we make these decisions.  What we are speaking about here is how we agree the budgets, the strategies and the role of the Oireachtas with regard to it.  After this, it is entirely appropriate that there is leave to use the courts to ensure these roads are being followed and the plans are being implemented.  I do not accept that we should write the Oireachtas out of this piece in terms of its role for oversight, scrutiny and approval.  The Government's approach is completely unnecessary because there will be very limited circumstances and the situation might never arise.

In the same way NPHET is not sovereign, neither does the CCAC have a divine authority.  The Government will have the final say.  It is an advisory group that gives its advice, using the best economic and scientific knowledge it has, to the Government and the Government then takes it on board.  Obviously, the two bodies are not exactly the same, and NPHET is dealing with very new and emerging science.  It looks at papers published last week on a disease that emerged last year.  Climate science is more mature than this so the CCAC is not in quite the same short timeframes.  Covid is an emergency and there is an urgency to it.  It is a valid comparison but we cannot say the CCAC will have some kind of great authority over the Government.  It is the other way around.

Amendment No. 165 is related.  I know it is not grouped with the other amendments.  I will withdraw amendment No. 165.  I will speak to the whole lot together.<\/p> <p>  This comes back to the argument we had earlier about carbon budgets.  While there may be some justification for the Minister of State's argument on the carbon budgets, I believe it is fundamentally wrong that we have no approval process whatsoever for the sectoral emissions ceilings that are going to be set for each part of government in each Department.<\/p> <p>  I do not agree with the principle of sectoral emissions ceilings.  I fully understand the reason for it, which comes back to the point of principle that Ministers need to be held accountable.  As someone who was in the role prior to the current Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the previous Minister, Deputy Bruton, I know how frustrating it was when I did not have the leverage available to me that is provided for in this legislation.  I do not disagree with the principle of what is being set out in the legislation; where I disagree fundamentally is that these should be presented just like an Estimates process is presented to the sectoral committee for approval.  It comes back to the fundamental point I made at the outset, that it is going to be a significant challenge to reach a 51% reduction in heating and transport.  In fairness, the members of this committee have made that admission already.  The committee introduced a very worthwhile document last week on transport emissions, but only set out to reduce them by 51%.  If we set out a 51% reduction in transport, and a similar reduction in heating, which would be monumental achievements if we could achieve them by 2030, then that would put a massive challenge on to agriculture where it is much harder to make change and where the technology in that regard does not yet exist.  We must be honest: realistically, the only way that can be achieved is through substantial reductions in herd numbers.<\/p> <p>  Regardless of where the end result is, those sectoral targets should be presented to the D&aacute;il for approval via the sectoral committees.  The Minister for Transport should come before the transport committee and say what the target is, whether it is 51% or 70% up to 2030, and outline how he or she intends to get to that.  Naturally enough, that will have to chop and change as technology develops and as the returns come back in terms of the emissions profile.  That can be reviewed on an ongoing basis, but the overall target should be approved by the sectoral transport committee.  The same should happen for heating targets with the energy committee or the climate committee and for agriculture targets with the agriculture committee.  The Minister of the day should come in and explain the logic and reasoning for the targets and how he or she expects to achieve them.  This cannot be done without recourse to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.<\/p> <p>  The amendments I have tabled are very simple.  They ensure there would have to be an approval process whereby D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann must approve the sectoral emissions ceilings across the board, just like the current Estimates process for finances.  Our emissions ceilings will have a far greater impact than even the Estimates process, yet there is no ratification process envisaged for them.  There will be consultation and discussions with the sectoral committees, advice will be sought from the CCAC and there will be engagement with the public on this, but ultimately it should be down to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to agree the objectives.<\/p> <p>  It is not just to tie the Minister of the day into that process, but it is also important to tie in subsequent Ministers.  Deputy Bruton knows that I argued very strongly in the committee for the establishment of Sl&aacute;intecare because the difficulty was that when a new Minister sat down on his or her rear end in the Department of Health, he or she could have a new policy approach to deliver across the health service with no buy-in across the political spectrum for it.  Thankfully, we now have Sl&aacute;intecare.  We need the same type of political buy-in regardless of who the Minister of the day is, but that can only happen with a ratification process that incorporates D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  I urge the Minister of State to accept this series of amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12021060900002#T00900","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speech","time":1623193200,"counter":255,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  I appreciate and acknowledge his experience as a Minister and also his interest in this sector.  I remember his efforts to tackle issues like air pollution and so on in the past.<\/p> <p>  The sectoral targets will be decided by the Government, but that will not happen in a vacuum.  It will have to comply with section 4 of the legislation, which sets out a long list of criteria that have to be complied with.  The process is highly technical.  It will be a complex undertaking to make a legal sectoral division because of the need to satisfy the many criteria listed, including the overarching one of international agreements, but also climate justice, biodiversity and best scientific knowledge, among others.  It will be more expensive to get emissions reductions in some sectors than others.  There will be requirements to reduce at a certain rate in some sectors based on European directives and on international agreements.  It is not the case that we could just decide to move some emissions from one sector to another.  I am not suggesting anybody would do so.  It is not an opportunity to play politics and to decide it would be nicer to have some of these emissions moving to transport or agriculture.  It is a highly technical exercise and it must comply with all the criteria.  What the legislation is doing is setting out the way that the sectoral budget is made.  It is setting out what all the rules are to make a sectoral budget and it is up to the Oireachtas now to decide what those rules are going to be and what it wants to put in or to take out.  If we moved towards the Oireachtas agreeing sectoral budgets, we would have a bureaucratic overhead.  It would slow the process and, worst of all, we would be in danger of coming up with an answer that was either illegal or not in line with our international agreements, or that did not fulfil the many objectives we are trying to include in section 4, which many Deputies have referred to in previous amendments.<\/p><p>I know the Deputy has good intentions in this regard and I can see where he is coming from but I believe that this amendment should be refused.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12021060900002#T01000","speaker":"1479","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623193200,"counter":257,"content":"<p>I am disappointed.

The reality is that this will be little more than a box-ticking exercise.  He is right that the cost of taking measures in some areas is going to be significant and there is no doubt about that.  There are considerable financial implications to those decisions.  My fundamental problem is that the cheapest way to reduce emissions in Ireland is to reduce the size of the herd.  That is by far the cheapest way to do it and there is no doubt about that.  It is hugely challenging because of the types of targets this committee has set out, including a 51% reduction in transport emissions by 2030.  The same applies to heating.  There will be significant costs for the public and the Exchequer in implementing those targets.  That is the reason it is important that a fair and transparent set of sectoral targets is put in place and that it is not only about the bottom line and the ultimate price.  The fundamental problem with our approach up to now, sadly, is that it has been all about being penny wise and pound poor.  That is what has led us into the situation we are in now.  We should take strategic decisions which make perfect economic sense in the long term from a societal and budgetary point of view but cost a significant amount in the short term.

I have had plenty of experience of dealing with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I was involved in the specific negotiations about which we are talking with regard to the sectoral challenges that exist.  I know the thinking and the logic that is put on the area.  A cost and a price tag are put on absolutely everything.  That is why it is important that the D&aacute;il would legislate in a manner that brings about a fair and just transition across our society and not have one sector carrying the burden in the short term for other sectors.

Deputy Naughten is pointing up a serious issue that is going to arise.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, in its Ag Climatise policy, is envisaging a mitigation of 15% in the agricultural sector.  If agriculture accounts for 15% of an overall 51% reduction, that means a 70% reduction is required in transport and building.  That is probably beyond our reach.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy rightly said that if one was looking only at cost, one would say that herd reduction is the cheapest way to achieve reductions.  We are going to have to find difficult ways to deal with the very high costs.  To offer context, in the 2019 climate plan in which I was involved, we included marginal abatement costs in the transport and building sectors that cost over &euro;250 per tonne in order to go from a 40% or 45% reduction to a 70% reduction.  Those costs would soar.  I can see why Deputy Naughten is thinking that this will not happen and that the requirement to reduce emissions will fall back on the agriculture sector.  <\/p> <p>  On the other hand, the issue for agriculture is to look at how it can abate carbon.  If in other sectors such as building and transport, we are envisaging paying, say, &euro;500 a tonne for carbon abatement, can agriculture start to be farmers of carbon as well as producers of food?  I do not agree with Deputy Naughten that we can simply say the agricultural committee should decide that because the transport lobbies will then come before the transport committee, the agricultural lobbies will come before the agricultural committee and we will not move forward.  However, we need to find a way in which the potential losers as a result of transport abatements running at &euro;500 or &euro;600 per tonne can compensate people who could manage carbon, either through sequestration, carrying fewer cattle per acre, draining lands, wetting lands or the many things we know are out there.  We need to find ways in which those policy tools can be evolved.  There is a little bit of a vacuum in how those policy tools are going to be evolved.  We are all in favour of dialogue and we will have that dialogue but we need to have an intense discussion about how those policy tools are going to be evolved.  That has not happened to date.  There is no doubt that if the climate council is expected to meet the target of 51% reductions, it will face the dilemma that if agriculture is targeting 15% reductions, transport must target reductions of 70%.  The council will have to consider whether that can be done.  We will have an intense debate before the autumn, whenever this legislation comes back, and I do not think we have thought through at a political level how this is to be resolved.  <\/p> <p>  I do not agree with Deputy Naughten that the way to resolve it is to stick agriculture into the agricultural committee, transport into the transport committee and wait to see what comes out the other end.  I do not think that would achieve the obligations on which we all know we have to deliver.  Finding a way of working our way towards policy tools is the challenge for us, as politicians.  Deputy Naughten has enormous experience and we need to listen to people like him because they can help us to evolve these policy responses.  This is a genuine issue and we must find a common language to discuss it.<\/p><p>The risk, signs of which can be seen already, is that sectors will talk their own language and mount their own defences around the ramparts of their sectors.  For example, the transport sector is saying  we cannot ban combustion engines from 2030 and that it would be heresy but if we are to extend the ambition beyond what is in the existing plan, that seems like a no brainer to me.  It must happen along with other things outlined by the committee in its report this week.  I do not think Deputy Naughten's proposal to put it into sectoral committees will achieve the cross-silo debate we need.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12021060900002#U00500","speaker":"1549","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623193200,"counter":262,"content":"<p>I am only using that as an example and I am not hung up on it going into sectoral committees.

If it is not 100% correct in terms of technicalities, I ask him and the Department to look to reflect its intent in the Bill somewhere.  Essentially, the amendment puts a net zero target on the electricity sector for 2030.  When we are talking about a finite or polluting resource, the first principle is not to use it.  When we are talking about transport, we have the avoid principle and when we are talking about waste, we have the reduce principle.  However, when it comes to energy, there does not seem to be a similar principle on which we focus with this Bill or even from a policy perspective across Government.  There is no significant focus on demand management or trying to keep our energy usage emissions down.  In fact, we are seeing the opposite.  We are seeing two arms of the Government pulling against each other when it comes to this.  I am talking about data centres and electric vehicles.  Both are seen to be one of the highest users of electricity and the key drivers of increases in electricity usage over the next ten years.  I do not know whether the Minister of State noticed an article by Caroline O'Doherty in the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>today stating that EirGrid has said there are so many new applications from data centres looking for electricity connections that to power them would be the equivalent of 70% of our national usage.  This is an incredible statistic at a time when we are here debating how we are going to get our emissions down.  The projected electricity consumption by 2030 based on the current connection agreements is 33%, so 33% of our electricity usage will be from data centre usage.  It would be remiss of us to not look at this exponential growth in electricity usage from data centres.  <\/p><p>I know the Government has a target of 70% renewables for electricity by 2030 but I am putting in 100% because we need to cap it.  We need to say we are going to drive down our electricity usage until we are in a position to ensure that 100% of that can come from renewable resources.  We are not there yet.  I am staggered by the statistics in the article in the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>today.  A total of 70% of electricity usage could come from data centres.  I heard yesterday that one third of global data will be housed in Irish data centres so this is a runaway horse over which we have no control.  It does not seem as though we are taking it into consideration in the climate Bill.  I do not know whether there is real active and continued analysis by Government of the implications of having these data centres.  When I raised it at a meeting of the committee a couple of weeks ago, the comments were that there are economic benefits from it and data centres have storage capacity and may be able to play a role in storage of energy and slow release or off-peak release of it.  That is all well and good but it is not set in stone at the moment and until we have finalised our attitude to and policy on data centres, we need to say that 100% of our electricity needs to come from renewable sources.  I believe it is a target we can meet.  <\/p><p>We talk about all these other areas such as transport, which will be difficult.  The committee heard that having one million electric vehicles on the road by 2030 is a very difficult target to meet.  It will be difficult to get that cultural shift into our agriculture and land usage to address carbon usage.  When it comes to electricity, it is an easy target we could meet as long as we start controlling some of the usages of electricity such as data centres and start introducing demand management measures to deal with that.  We are going to tell people we expect them to buy electric vehicles and that, from 2030, we are going to ban anything other than electric vehicles so they will have to go and buy them.  It is a big investment for people.  They are going to buy those vehicles and the energy they use with them could still create emissions so, again, there is very little policy alignment coming from the Government on this issue.  <\/p><p>We had a lot of discussion about just transition and I made the point repeatedly that we cannot have a very narrow focus when we are talking about just transition; we need a broad focus.  This is what I am talking about.  As a nation, are we going to put the onus on individuals and individual households, who may not have the finance or capacity to own electric vehicles?  Are we going to tell them that those are the things we expect them to do and, at the same time, tell big corporations and data centres they can create and use up as much energy as they want and we will not control what they are doing?This would be unfair and would go against the principles of just transition, which is why I wanted that definition in the Bill.  It is important that it is in the Bill because we are already seeing how the Government is prioritising big players.<\/p><p>A business-as-usual approach will be taken with the big corporations while the barriers and onus are put on individuals.

If the EU needs data centres, the best approach for the EU to take is to run them in the most climate efficient way.  That is what the emissions trading system seeks to do.  In addition, they do pay carbon tax.  This is not some free ride for the business sector trampling on other people.  They pay.  Indeed, the carbon price within the emissions trading system is substantially higher than the carbon price we pay elsewhere.<\/p> <p>  Neither do I accept the suggestion that envisaging electric vehicles on our roads is, in some way, the Government having a misaligned policy.  The reality is that people need certain transport services.  Not all of them can be switched to public transport.  It is far better for the substantial number of journeys that cannot be substituted by public transport or by active travel that they be done with electric vehicles.  Of course, if some of that power is generated from non-renewable sources, that will have emissions, but they will be dramatically lower than if we are fuelling vehicles with petrol or diesel.  As we succeed in switching to renewable sources of power, we will be able to deliver transport services to everyone in a way that avoids an impact on the climate.<\/p> <p>  Many of the assumptions behind this amendment do not stand up to close scrutiny.  There is no choice between companies and not touching our lifestyle.  If we want to engage in travel and in all sorts of things, we must find ways of avoiding damaging emissions from them.  That is what all this endeavour is about.  In the long term, if we can get the electricity sector to be wholly renewable or supplemented by interconnection that is also from either nuclear or non-emitting sources, we can still deliver those transport services without impact on the environment.  Many of the assumptions that have been put forward by Deputy Whitmore are not beyond challenge.  We all have to change our lifestyles, not just big companies.  I have heard others articulate this, that 70% of emissions come from big corporates and everything would be resolved if we did not do that.  That is like saying an oil company that puts fuel into every car we drive is responsible for all those emissions.  That is not the reality.  They only exist because they are delivering a service that people want to have.  People want to be able to move around.<\/p> <p>  There are many assumptions in the amendment that do not stand up to scrutiny.  I do not believe net zero by 2030 is an achievable target to ask the Minister to report on.  The objective at present is minus 43%, and we will be required to make big changes to reach 70% renewables on the system.  I do not believe we should table amendments that are beyond the capacity of the Minister to deliver.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12021060900002#W00700","speaker":"1549"},{"type":"speech","time":1623193200,"counter":273,"content":"<p>Chairman, can I come in?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12021060900002#W00800","speaker":"1627"},{"type":"speech","time":1623193200,"counter":274,"content":"<p>No, I am going to call Deputy Naughten.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12021060900002#W00900","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1623193200,"counter":275,"content":"<p>I found Deputy Bruton's analogy in respect of oil companies interesting.  He is right in that regard, but the difficulty is that in agriculture we are quite happy to have the emissions levied on the farmer who produces the beef or milk, not where it is actually consumed.  This is the argument I have been making all along.  The system is perverse and has built in structures that benefit big industry rather than the type of economy we have in Ireland.  That is why Ireland must take a very different approach from that being taken in continental Europe, but we are not doing that.<\/p><p>Returning to the point raised by Deputy Whitmore, a fundamental point here is the number of data centres coming to this country.  There are two types of data centres.  I am not against data centres<i>per se<\/i>.  If they are strategically located in particular locations across the country, they can be of great benefit.  However, we should be discussing data centres that are directly connected with employment in this country, not speculative data centres.  Quite a number of the data centres in the planning process are speculative data centres.  We should not be facilitating those.  Second, we should not facilitate any data centres in the Dublin region, despite the determination of the Industrial Development Agency, IDA, to do that, because our electricity grid just cannot take them.  The cost of facilitating more data centres in the Dublin region will be astronomical in terms of the investment that will have to be made in the electricity grid, and communities across the country will have to cater for the additional pylons that will have to be brought into the Dublin region.<\/p><p>We are going to try to achieve 70% renewable electricity on the network by 2030, which is a very difficult challenge at this point in time.  However, it is one I believe we potentially can achieve, but continuing to load more data centres onto the system makes it an unachievable target.  What is morally wrong here is not only that aspect but also the fact that we are asking families across the country, through their electricity bill, to fund and subsidise the cost of that.  It is wrong that we should ask families, through the public service obligation, PSO, levy and the transmission charges, to subsidise the cost of electricity going into data centres.  The Government took a decision in June 2018 not to apply those charges to domestic customers and other business customers, but that has not been implemented.  Deputy Whitmore is right.  There must be a far broader debate and we must be far more selective with regard to the type of data centres we want to come into this country.  The impression is given that it is climate efficient to bring them into Ireland because of our climate.<\/p><p>However, the reality is we are an isolated electricity grid in Ireland.  Sadly, we will need to have a fossil fuel backup for the foreseeable future, which undermines our overall climate objectives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12021060900002#W01000","speaker":"1603","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623193200,"counter":277,"content":"<p>Deputy Whitmore's amendment asks for \"a sub-sectoral emissions ceiling\".  However, it subsequently appears to be a cross-sectoral measure so it is not sub-sectoral.  It applies to everything because everything that has electricity would be affected.  The amendment also says that if a sector switches towards electricity to save on emissions, that should not count towards its emissions savings.  I am confused by that.  Moving towards electricity in, for example transport and heating - it need not be electric vehicles, it might be electric trains, bikes or whatever - is an important tool.  It will be one element of trying to cut emissions.  I do not think it should count for nothing.  The EU, as some Deputies have mentioned, has agreed with us on a 70% use of renewable energy in electricity by 2030.  We have a target and I think the Deputy is proposing to change that to 100% net - whatever we interpret \"net\" to mean.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy talked about demand.  I think she was making a comparison with recycling, avoidance and reuse and proposing we should look at the same thing in electricity, which is absolutely true.  The suppression of demand is an important factor, as well as switching people from one power source to another.  If one can avoid the task being carried out or suppress the demand for it in some way, that is also a measure.  We see that in the smart meter roll-out, which is an attempt to price electricity differently at different times of the days and set demand in that way.  With this Bill, the Deputy is open to taking actions like this through the climate action plan.  That mechanism will have public consultation and ongoing citizen engagement whereby a feature like this can be introduced.<\/p> <p>  The EU has energy efficiency targets for 2030 that we have signed up to in order to achieve a 32.5% reduction in energy use compared to what it would be without those measures.  That comes back to demand management.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy spoke about data centres.  It is a big debate.  We have many of them and are planning to have more.  We also plan to have large quantities of renewable energy.  It is not in the amendment but I think it is in later amendments today.  It might be better to talk about it at that stage or have a separate debate about it.  It is a large area and I would be happy to talk about it at another session but I oppose the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12021060900002#X00200","speaker":"1479"},{"type":"speech","time":1623193200,"counter":278,"content":"<p>I will go back on a few things Deputy Bruton said.  He said my arguments do not stand up to scrutiny.  The Government target is 70% renewable energy for the electricity sector by 2030.  Over 30% of the electricity we will be using in 2030 is for data centres.  It is feasible to set a 100% target for renewable energy.  When setting a target, one should set a target that one has to stretch to and is ambitious, rather than something one can roll over and do easily.  We need to look to achieve such a target.  We are all aware that the roll-out of renewable energy, in terms of wind farms, options, guidelines and terms of reference for those corporations is taking place slowly and, if this target was there, it would bring more of a focus and impetus to get this done.  It is a feasible target and one we should look to achieve.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Bruton said there is a cross-EU policy on it and data centres are delivered in Ireland in a more climate-efficient way because we have a better climate for them.  Data centres do not just have an impact from a climate perspective.  They also have a visual and environmental impact.  I am a Deputy for Wicklow.  If all the wind farms proposed to deliver energy for these data centres are in existence in ten years time, we will be looking out at three large-scale wind farms off our coastline.  That will have an impact on communities in Wicklow.  I understand wind farms are an absolute necessity but I would rather we had those we need rather than providing them to enable data centres to undergo exponential growth to facilitate corporations across Europe.  We need to have that debate.  <\/p> <p>  Deputy Bruton referenced corporation tax, which is a completely separate issue.  I will be interested to know how our data centres are set regarding corporation tax.  I am not saying data centres get a free ride when it comes to things like carbon tax; I am saying there has not been the requisite level of Government scrutiny and forward planning when it comes to provision of data centres.  Here we are trying to set legislation to restrict our emissions while another part of government is saying that data centres can have a free ride from an energy usage perspective and it will facilitate as many centres as corporations see fit to invest in here in this country.<\/p> <p>  When I mentioned misaligned policy, I was not talking about the need for electric vehicles.  I understand they will play a large part in how we meet our transport targets.  I was saying that we expect people to put &euro;30,000, &euro;40,000 or &euro;50,000 into an electric vehicles to reduce their emissions and environmental impact.  However, if they use energy that does not come from renewable resources because we do not have the capacity to produce it as a result of the provision of increased electricity to data centres, that will undermine those individual efforts to do the right thing.  Most people in this country will want to play their part in meeting emission targets.  I think my arguments stand up to scrutiny.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State questioned the technicalities of the amendment.  I agree.  I asked the Minister of State at the outset to take the intent.  The intent is there.  I ask the Minister of State to bring it back, scrutinise it and get the Bills Office or his legal advisers to look at it.  There needs to be a sub-sectoral cap on emissions from electricity.  We need a target of 100%.  Whatever the Government feels is the best mechanism to meet it, I ask that it review that.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State said I did not specifically mention data centres.  I did not do that because we are looking at a framework document which should not look at one sector or energy user.  If I had mentioned data centres, it would have been ruled out of order.  I have no problem with data centres as long as the energy is renewable.  The Minister of State said there has been a big debate on data centres.  The problem is there has not been such a debate.  We need a big debate on it.<\/p> <p>  I ask the Minister of State to bring that back and have a look at it.  I will raise it at Report Stage as well.  It is an important issue and, considering recent reports in the paper, it will become more prominent.  I hope this discussion does become more prominent in the coming weeks and months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12021060900002#X00300","speaker":"1627"},{"type":"vote","time":1623193200,"counter":279,"content":"<p>Amendment put:<\/p><p>The Committee divided: T\u00e1, 3;

It provides for the alteration of carbon budgets.  One of those ways is carryover.  Obviously we are going to have a situation where either we exactly meet the carbon budget or our outturn is that we have over or underachieved, and the mechanism is there that the Minister must seek the advice of the Climate Change Advisory Council before making a proposal to carry forward and expand a future budget.  Thus, if there has been underachievement, in other words, if the carbon budget has been exceeded and there have been more emissions than expected, then excess emissions will be automatically brought forward to the next budget, so the next carbon budget will be reduced accordingly.  We have framed this Bill to provide a suitable balance of flexibility and long-term stability to support necessary investment and implementation over time.  Three consecutive five-year carbon budgets budgets are set out every five years, with the third and later carbon budget of the series being set as a provisional budget.  This means it can be reviewed and revised as part of finalising the next group of three carbon budgets.  Therefore, while the Bill provides certainty on our long-term climate goal, a level of flexibility within these statutory structures is important and will allow, where necessary, a degree of adjustment and reorientation of carbon budgets, plans and strategies over time and within different sectors.  This reflects, as acknowledged in the programme for Government, that not all measures realise our climate ambition in Ireland or other countries.  This is also relevant when considering flexibility on how to address any over or underachievement towards our carbon budget ceilings and if we do not achieve our targets then emissions must be carried.  Incentivising and encouraging early action, when we know early action is more cost-effective, should be allowed and encouraged.<\/p> <p>  If one looks at section 6D and the different possibilities or different situations where a carbon budget can be revised, one can see it includes situations like where we have had an agreement with the European Union to change to a new emissions obligation or we have entered into some kind of international agreement with other countries.

The Minister made it clear at the outset he would not be accepting amendments.  It is therefore disingenuous to suggest I would put forward an amendment when it has been made crystal clear the Government is not prepared to accept any amendments from the Opposition.  The point I am making here is very simple: if the D&aacute;il approves a carbon budget, then the alterations to that carbon budget should also have to come before the D&aacute;il for approval.  It is a very basic principle.  It reinforces the point I made earlier that effectively the D&aacute;il is only being used as a rubber stamp.<\/p><p>If the D&aacute;il rejects the carbon budget, the Minister can bring in whatever budget he likes.  Even if the D&aacute;il accepts the carbon budget, the Minister can make amendments without reverting to the House.  Again, one of the key provisions in last week's health legislation, and the reason the Government was forced to come back before the D&aacute;il, was my insistence that a sunset clause be put into it.  However, with this Bill, once the first carbon budget is ratified by the D&aacute;il, it does not have a role in approving the second.  Subsequent to the enactment of this legislation, the Minister does not have to consult the D&aacute;il, legally, regarding any alterations to both budgets.

In fact, three carbon budgets will be adopted.  Five years later, there will be another chance to look at the carbon budgets and decide where they go from there.  Deputy Naughten also stated that if the carbon budget is rejected by the D&aacute;il the Minister can then just go off and make up any carbon budget he or she wants.  Ministers are specifically not empowered to do that.  The law states they can only make a carbon budget that complies with all the international obligations, the 51% target and all the other categories of requirements in the Bill.  The Minister is absolutely not allowed to go off and make a carbon budget that has a terrible level of ambition or is unfair.

We have a Climate Change Advisory Council, we decided at the pre-legislative stage to revise the way in which that advisory council is composed and what its membership should be and we need to get that in place in order that we will be able to do our carbon budget this year.  We do not have enough time to go through a very lengthy process to do that.  What is proposed is not simply that the Minister just appoints the people to the advisory council; the legislation includes all the kinds of criteria that have to be matched in order to be on the advisory council, lists who the <i>ex officio<\/i>members shall be and details the gender balance.  The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications of the day, whoever he or she might be, will not just write down a list of names he or she thinks should be on the advisory council; the list has to match the legislation.  The Minister does not have the Executive power to appoint the members directly.  He or she has to bring that list to the Government and have it approved by the Cabinet, which is unusual because, typically, when a Minister appoints people to a board, it is by direct executive order.  We have a level of checks and legislative limits as to how the council is appointed.  We have had a discussion about who should be on it and how to reconstitute it.  The Climate Change Advisory Council will be significantly different from its predecessor.  I think that going down the route of the Public Appointments Service would just take us too long.

I thank the Chair for his indulgence.  I was at his other committee representing him well, I hope.  The agriculture committee met at the same time, so my apologies for being here at short notice.<\/p> <p>  This amendment is fundamental to the many concerns of some people in our farming community with regard to the outworking of the climate action plan and the Bill.  When this Bill is enacted, there will be a need to provide assurances that it is not about tokenism and certainly not about hypocrisy.  One way we can provide those assurances is by ensuring we do not expect actions to be taken at a domestic level, the net result of which is damaging to the environment.  To put this in a framework that people will understand, there would not be much point in us suggesting that we reduce the production of a certain type of food in Ireland, if the net outworking of that was the importation to the EU of food that was less sustainably produced.  People will be aware that there has been much discussion about the Mercosur trade deal, for example.  Notwithstanding the Mercosur trade deal, it is a matter of fact that substantial quantities of Brazilian beef already enter the European market.  We know there are other types of foods that are produced more sustainably either here in Ireland or in other EU member states.  Therefore, the outworking of amendment No. 194 ensures that whatever we do, it does not result in a net increase of global emissions as a result of increased importation to the EU.<\/p> <p>  In paragraph (g), the amendment proposes a specific reference to the beef sector.  There are some concerns in this regard because a substantial amount of the beef produced in Ireland from the suckler herd is among the most sustainably produced beef in the world.  It is the prime product for which Ireland is famous.  It is important to say that not all beef produced in Ireland meets that high-quality standard.  In fact, an increasing amount of the beef which is sold on the basis of the image of our suckler herd is produced within factory-owned feedlots in most instances.  This amendment sets forward a mechanism to allow us to ensure that a sustainable product, which is among the most sustainable in the world in relation to beef, is protected, encouraged and facilitated to ensure we do not do something I would regard as utter stupidity.  For example, if were to ask for a reduction in our suckler herd in Ireland, the net outworking of that would be an increased level of beef imported from countries like Brazil and other places where the production of that beef warrants the destruction of rainforests.  I hope the Minister of State will support this amendment.  I ask for the support of this committee.<\/p> <p>  I would like to make a point in relation to a number of amendments which have been disallowed.  They relate to our proposition that the measures in this climate Bill would be assessed to determine their impact on local communities.  We need to know the impact on rural, marginalised or peripheral communities as a result of actions taken.  Those amendments have been ruled out of order as a result of the budgetary impact they would apparently have.  Will the Minister of State consider inserting those amendments into the Bill to ensure, as we have all said, including the Minister of State, that this is not about penalising ordinary workers, families and communities?  A full social, economic and rural impact assessment should be carried out on any measures being proposed so that the Government of the day will have the full facts before measures are enacted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12021060900002#GG01000","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speech","time":1623193200,"counter":388,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Carthy for coming to the committee and asking his question.  He is right when he suggests that the job of cutting emissions and deciding where the emission cuts go is not just a matter of finding where the cheapest areas are or what is easiest or handiest.  It must take into account all the wider impacts and that is why the Bill provides for that.  If we look into that, we will see that section 9, which contains the carbon budgets and sets out how they are created, specifically states that the CCAC must take account of the different factors, including the effect on employment and the competitiveness of the economy.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Carthy made a point about on carbon leakage.  I am not sure if he used that phrase.  I refer to the idea that if we stop producing beef here, it will be produced somewhere else where it causes more harm.  This is a genuine concern and it must be addressed.  Deputy Carthy is right when he contends that there is no point in cutting emissions in one place if that leads to worse emissions elsewhere.  That is why, in this Bill, when the Government makes its climate action plan, it must take carbon leakage effects into account.  The same applies when it does the sectoral emissions ceilings.  When it decides what the maximum emissions in a particular sector are, it must consider carbon leakage.  It will be required to do that by the Act.  It is not the case that those things can be ignored and a simple view can be taken.  It is a complex area which requires much consultation with the public and expert input.  It requires cross-party co-operation because it is such a difficult problem facing us all.  I want to put the Deputy's mind at rest.  The Bill does not ignore carbon leakage and it does not ignore things like employment factors.<\/p> <p>  Specifically, this amendment, which I am opposing, ties the hands of the CCAC and introduces restrictions on what it can and cannot recommend.<\/p><p>It could limit its independence and effectiveness.  Also, I do not think it is needed, because the advice of the Climate Change Advisory Council has to be considered by Government.  It is a matter for the Government to determine and set climate policy.  The Climate Change Advisory Council does not set the policy.  It comes back to the comparison with NPHET.  The council is an advisory body, not a decision-making body.<\/p><p> On the question of sustainable farming and so on, we are not choosing between climate action and sustainable farming.  They are very much one and the same thing.  It is not an either-or approach.  The two things support each other.  As we move towards sustainable farming, we will reduce emissions.  We do not do that by pushing them off into another country.  For those reasons, I am requesting that the amendment be withdrawn.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12021060900002#GG01100","speaker":"1479","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623193200,"counter":390,"content":"<p>I must say that I am incredibly disappointed by the Minister of State's response.

This is a fundamental weapon, for want of a better term, that we have at our disposal to show that this House is serious about the concerns that have been raised within rural communities and the agriculture sector, in particular.  It sets out that no recommendation will be made whereby the domestic reduction or the cessation of a food production activity, for which there is no other more sustainable domestic alternative, will result in a net increase in global emissions as a result of increased importation to the EU.  This allays the very concerns that we have been hearing from people who believe this Bill is about tokenism or that there is a hypocritical element at the core of the measures that have been introduced.  It puts to rest all of those concerns.  It would be a fundamental part of the work we need to do and of addressing the core aspect to ensure our farming community is not seen as the enemy, but rather as a partner that can play an important role in addressing climate action.<\/p> <p>  I must say it is a crucial area for me, as agricultural spokesperson for my party, and for my party colleagues in the sense that we want to show that we can be serious about climate action without reverting to tokenistic or meaningless actions.

Key to those themes are the level of accountability, the democratic nature of the way decisions are made, who has a voice at the table and whose voice is heard and not heard.

thank the Chairman.  This amendment is fairly self-explanatory and is in respect of the broader issue of consultation with the Oireachtas.  Section 15 of the Bill,<i>inter alia<\/i>, states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe Minister may issue guidelines, consistent with furthering the achievement of the national climate objective, to local authorities in respect of the content and preparation of a local authority climate action plan and a local authority shall comply with any such guidelines. <\/blockquote> <p>While the word guideline is used, this is actually a directive because the local authority must comply with whatever direction is provided by the Minister.  I am putting forward here a very simple amendment which is that those directions be approved by the Oireachtas.  As I said, this is fairly self-explanatory and we have such approval with regard to planning regulations.  Where a direction is being issued to local authorities and there is an alteration in the planning regulations, these must come before the Oireachtas for approval before being issued to local authorities.  I am making the same argument here as to the direction that the Minister would make here.  It makes logical sense and is consistent with what happens across local government and our planning laws and it is important that we have that same level of consistency across the board.

The reality is that a Minister of the day could issue a directive to local authorities that they can no longer have one-off rural homes because of the impact that they have on our climate and emissions profile in respect of transport, in particular.  Each local authority would have to comply with that.  If the Minister made such a directive under planning regulations, that would then have to be presented to the D&aacute;il.  The Minister could, however, make the exact same regulation into a directive in the application of this legislation but because it is under the word \"climate\" then such a regulation does not have to be presented to the D&aacute;il.  It is not right that the Minister has such broad, sweeping powers that he or she can issue a directive to a local authority or authorities.  They have to comply with it without any oversight of such a directive by the parliamentary system.

This will not be welcomed by the public at this time.  There is enough oversight and busybodies trying to stop people and keep the rural countryside as a sort of national park and reserve for people to go and visit every so often, to look out the window of the car to say that this is beautiful, that we have no people here, and we want to keep it that way.  That is not a right way to proceed, will not give us a living, vibrant countryside, and is not about keeping our post offices, our small shops and pubs, and our small communities open.  Putting another way of stopping people, another layer of bureaucracy on them and another excuse to say \"No\" is not a welcome thing.  I would like to think that the Minister of State will see this.  It is surely the case that the Government does not want the message to go out that it does not want people to live in the countryside.

The idea of this is that local authorities will be to the forefront of driving climate action to ensure that by moving early, there will not be the sort of consequences that people might fear.  If one fails to adapt one's local authority or community to the challenges of climate action, one is going to see the prosperity of that community adversely impacted.  We cannot avoid the progressive nature of the global challenge of climate and we will see a progressively higher carbon price to be paid by those who fail to plan ahead.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State is seeking here to provide national expertise to support local authorities to be ahead of the curve in this respect.  To present this as some sort of negative conspiracy against local communities is unfair to the climate challenge.  In my time I have had occasion to meet with the Association of Irish Local Government and most of the local authorities are up for it.  They recognise that if they move ahead of this they will create opportunities within their community.  The Minister's guidelines are there to put them in a position to be leaders in climate responses to ensure that their community is ahead of the curve.<\/p><p>For people to perceive climate planning guidelines in the wholly negative way in which it seems it is being presented here is unfair to local authorities and communities right across the country.  They see what is coming and recognise that future generations will depend on the changes we make in our community today.  I put this counter argument to what we have heard.  Climate action is the correct thing for us to do if we want to secure more prosperous, competitive and sustainable communities.

Anyone over 40 or 50 years old in a rural community will remember when the ecosystem was in much better balance and, for example, bird species such as lapwing and curlew were much more common.

I will not permit a member, regrettably, to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.

I am very pleased to be with the committee this morning.  I will give a brief overview of where An Post is right now and what we see as our challenges.  Ms Byrne will then take the committee through where the post office network is, and its challenges.<\/p> <p>  As an overview of 2021 our annual report says that through the pandemic An Post in many ways discovered its soul, the soul of a public service.  We showed social solidarity, we were imaginative in responding to citizens&rsquo; needs, and we were empathetic in every community.  We were resourceful in self-sufficiency and we were industrious to scale the seismic logistical challenges we faced.<\/p> <p>  The transformation of An Post from 2017 to 2020 was the key for us in the pandemic.  It meant that we built up our balance sheet to be strong enough to be able to invest the &euro;50 million it cost us to get through Covid.  This meant that unlike almost any other postal service in Europe, we managed to keep our post office network and our delivery networks open all the time.<\/p><p>We calculate that was the case for 99% of routes and 99% of post offices.  That is a considerable of achievement by the people in the company I am lucky to lead.<\/p><p> Our infrastructure was invested in just in time to be able to deliver.  Of course, none of us could have anticipated the surge in parcels as we kept Ireland trading.  The only way to get anything other than groceries during the lockdowns was to have it delivered and most of that was delivered by An Post.  We opened our parcel hub in October 2019.  There are two major machines and the second only opened in October 2020.  I am delighted that we managed to achieve that just in time to allow us to deliver over Christmas.<\/p><p> We showed solidarity with citizens.  We stood up, in particular, for older and vulnerable customers in both of our networks.  We supported SMEs with grants and discounts on parcels, postage and stamps, and with direct mail and expert advice.  We also ensured the health and well-being of our employees.<\/p><p> Our transformation has accelerated all the time.  The switch from an old letters business to a modern e-commerce and logistics business massively accelerated.  The volume of parcels we had in 2020 was not anticipated until 2024 or 2025.  The post office network had to show dexterity to get through this period.  Sustainability was at our core and it will be something both Ms Byrne and I will emphasise in terms of how we build for the future.  Sustainability is at the core of Government strategy.<\/p><p> Finally on this point, we were commercially successfully and self-sufficient.  We had no access to, or call on, State subsidies, nor had we call on furlough payments or the pandemic unemployment, PUP, for any of our staff.  We are proud that we managed to get through that.<\/p><p> There has been transformation in recent years and our revenue has increased by &euro;90 million over the past five years.  The reality is that there has been a decline in letter volumes of 30% and &euro;120 million in real terms.  With that in mind, we have added revenue of &euro;210 million in five years, adding approximately 25% to our base.  That is a massive turnaround for a company, particularly one as old as An Post.<\/p><p> We delivered a profit of &euro;916 million before depreciation, which for us is the key metric as it is the closest proxy to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation, EBITDA, in 2020.  There was a loss after depreciation of &euro;10 million but that will turn around this year, as we will see.  We have cash on our balance sheet.  Our pension scheme is fully funded.  In fact, it is over-funded at 102%.  As I said, 99% of post office routes were open.  Our financial performance was strong and would have been stronger if we had not decided to set aside &euro;50 million as a response to Covid-19.  That money included &euro;10 million for personal protective equipment, PPE, and &euro;8 million for staff cover because we had complicated arrangements with social distancing.  We forfeited a price increase, and only introduced it in the past two weeks, because we did not want citizens to be hit with price increases when they were in lockdown.  The impact of Covid on post offices, which Ms Byrne will cover, was quite severe because of a change in social welfare scheduling and the general effects of the pandemic, including, in particular, no foreign exchange, which is a big business line for us.<\/p><p> The good news is we have started 2021 very well.  Trading has been very strong and our revenues are up 11% compared with the same period in 2020 on a like-for-like basis.  Our operating profit is &euro;4 million ahead.  We are performing strongly in profit and growth.  As the business normalises and price increases are reinstated, we expect this year to return to pre-pandemic levels of profitability.  The strategy has been accelerated, with the switch to e-commerce, more banking services through post offices and the rapid development of digital infrastructure.<\/p><p> The second part of our submission related to our strategy, going forward.  We outlined six big moves.  We will increase profitability through a remodelled logistics network.  We will provide an advanced digital platform.  Digital is, in many ways, the key to the future of both of our networks because it provides a seamless way to have physical transactions with customers and conduct business online.  The growth of An Post commerce, which is our delivery business for Irish businesses and consumers, and its expansion into international supply chains, will be important.  Small businesses, in particular, now realise what an essential infrastructure An Post is.  Ms Byrne will take the committee through the transformed and sustainable post office network and the expanded range of services under the better banking with An Post initiative.  We will also have an expert, lean corporate centre for a post-Covid world.<\/p><p> The delivery service of the business will provide more choice and value for customers with future-proofed services.  We will have the best delivery manager.  If someone is getting a parcel delivered, and the same will soon apply to letters, he or she will be able to know when it is being delivered, when a delivery has been collected and will be able to choose a delivery time, etc.  Some of that can be done now but we aim to have the best system available anywhere in the market.<\/p><p> We are going to rebuild our network for e-commerce.  All committee members have delivery units in their constituencies, most of those which are sub-scale or in the wrong place for a parcel service because they were built out for letters.  There will be a massive change in property.  We will have to exit a number of properties, enter new ones and create a network that is future proof.<\/p><p> We will help businesses to thrive with integrated products.  An Post commerce will launch in the next few weeks to deliver those.  Our business bundle will allow us to clean small businesses's data, print and deliver letters, etc.  We will then connect Irish businesses with the world, helping them scale up and connect with trade around the globe.<\/p><p> I will stop there and ask Ms Byrne to take the committee briefly through the post office network.  I will then conclude with a few remarks before handing over to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021060900002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. David McRedmond","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623193200,"counter":508,"content":"<p>As Mr. McRedmond said, we recognise that the post office is a vital national infrastructure.  We are committed to maintaining a strong network of co-located post offices.  That is the strategy in every community of more than 500 people.  We will also ensure there is at least one post office within 15 km of every such community in rural areas and within 3 km in an urban area.  There will be areas such as the islands and other remote areas that will not have a population of 500 but will have a post office because those two parameters are working together.<br\/><br\/>Since 2018, we have been working on a transformation of the post office which involves significant investment and much work on new products and services, as well as assisting postmasters moving to co-location.  We do not see the future of the network as small, stand-alone post offices because that is not a viable business.  Some 63% of the network is now co-located.  The pandemic got in the way of that expansion because we would have expected that figure to reach 70% last year.  We are working to catch up.  When we most recently analysed co-location, co-located offices were performing 11% better than their stand-alone counterparts.  That shows co-location is working.<br\/><br\/>What is the post office of the future?  It is a co-located post office with a new range of services.  It will be focused around social welfare, which remains the <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre <\/i>for post offices.  We want to be that backbone.  There have been many changes in social welfare, the bulk of which have been outside our control.  Consumers have opted to have payments, whether the old age pension or children's allowance, paid into their bank accounts.  That is a trend we cannot change.  The PUP that was introduced during the pandemic has adversely affected footfall into post offices because the payment goes into people's bank accounts.<\/p><p>That has adversely affected footfall in post offices because the payment goes into people's bank accounts.  There will come a time when there is a return to jobseeker's benefit, whatever the amount is.  That will be scaled back from August.  We need those recipients back in post offices.  That is good for the State because it safeguards against fraud as recipients have to present and check that they are not working or residing abroad.  It is a key change we need to reintroduce in order to increase footfall in post offices.<\/p><p> As Mr. McRedmond said, Covid has interrupted our transformation.  One of the three things that have sadly been hit during Covid was social welfare.  Last year double payments were introduced for a good reason in terms of the safety of citizens.  We managed to get that reverted to single payments in November, but we now need to work with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection on the PUP and get that footfall back into post offices. <\/p><p> Another key business line that has been hit is BillPay.  That is very much the social welfare customer who comes into a post office and pays &euro;10 off a utility bill.  There have been two business lines affected by Covid, but there is a fix for that.  The other major hit has been foreign exchange which, as we all know, has been pretty much decimated.  We are the largest provider of foreign exchange cash in the country and would have seen that as a key business line that would grow with the banks getting out of cash services.  It can take time for that to return. <\/p><p> We are working closely with the Government at the moment to put in place a Covid pandemic fund for postmasters.  That would benefit all offices.  We put the proposal to Government.  It should be approved any day now.  It will be based on the individual mix of an individual post office, such as a post office with a high level of social welfare, foreign exchange, etc.  It will be worked out based on the individual product mix of a business. <\/p><p> When the current transformation payments run out at the end of June, which has been the subject of a bit of press coverage, the idea would be that the pandemic fund would kick in for 18 months, allow businesses to normalise and, more importantly, allow postmasters to avail of the considerable supports that we have put in place over the past 18 months to two years.  We have invested very heavily in the infrastructure of post offices around co-location with the capital investment fund.  We need to accelerate that again. <\/p><p> We have also invested significantly in commercial training for postmasters.  That has not been ideal.  We have done it in a virtual world, but it is not the same thing.  We need to equip postmasters with the commercial skills and tools and marketing supports so that they can promote their businesses.  Post offices are businesses, no more than running a caf&eacute; or Spar shop.  We need to equip postmasters with the right tools.  <\/p><p> We also have a responsibility to introduce new products and services, which we have done with An Post Money.  Our credit card and loan products have gone from success to success.  Our current account figures increased by 40% last year, with those accounts largely being opened in post offices.  We launched a new current account app last week with a &euro;17 million investment.  That will encourage new customers into our current account product, in particular given the consolidation due to Ulster Bank and KBC leaving the market.  We are very actively targeting that customer base. <\/p><p> We are also looking at new products and services in the areas of mortgages and SME lending, a process which is continuing.  Community banking is a major issue.  There has been a lot of press coverage around the Bank of Ireland deal we have done.  That will launch in August and all of that IT integration and investment is ongoing at the moment.  We will also work with AIB and Ulster Bank to expand the business that we do with them.  <\/p><p> An important point to note is that as pillar banks consolidate, we have done some mapping which shows that there are 500 post offices which do not have a bank within a 5 km radius.  An Post can be the backbone of community banking in Ireland, whether that involves offering services for pillar banks or our own An Post Money brand, and let us not forget State savings.  Covid has helped with that for postmasters.  The fund now stands at &euro;23 billion.  While Covid has definitely adversely hit us in terms of social welfare payments and foreign exchange, we have seen a big influx of savings into the post office.  That is a new customer base, along with strong growth in mail and parcels during Covid. <\/p><p> Postmasters have told us younger cohorts are coming into post offices to buy stamps, send parcels and pick up online shopping.  That is good news in terms of a broader demographic of customers outside of a social welfare customer now coming into post offices.  We need to cross-sell such customers Postmobile, a lottery ticket, One4All gift vouchers and all of the other products and services that we offer. <\/p><p> I will wrap up by returning to Mr. McRedmond's point on sustainability.  We have big ambitions for e-commerce in terms of the post office network being the backbone of online shopping.  We will all return to work and we want the post office to be the place where people pick up online shopping or return a parcel.  Co-located post offices will allow customers to do that through the opening hours of a shop. <\/p><p> The green hub launched last year puts the post office network and postmasters at the heart of the Government strategy on the green economy.  Our partnership with SSE Airtricity in the area of home upgrades and the best green loan rate in the market, at 4.9%, equips postmasters to go out into communities and sell that product.  I know they were very enthusiastic about that until Covid hit.  Our new children's account, Money Mate, launched last year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021060900002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Debbie Byrne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623193200,"counter":510,"content":"<p>We are very tight on time.

I thank members of An Post, including the Irish Postmasters Union and staff, for the work they have done during the pandemic.  Ms Byrne mentioned scale payments in her contribution.  There is a significant concern that postmasters will lose income.  She might explain to me how they will not lose income because I have been told that they could face a cut of between 20% and 25% in their income from the end of this month.<\/p> <p>  In the context of the sustainability of the model into the future, Ms Byrne mentioned, in terms of co-location, rural post offices within a 15 km radius.  That is a significant amount of distance for a post office and I believe it is far too much.  I hope that is reconsidered.<\/p> <p>  As the witnesses will know, the Irish Postmasters Union came before the committee.  We have had a lot of engagement with it.  Does Mr. McRedmond share the view that our post office network is on the brink and at the edge of the cliff, in that 200 post offices could be closed?  I refer to the Grant Thornton report.  What has the board done in the context of Government around engaging in new services?  I will come back in again after the replies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021060900002#C00700","speaker":"1637"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623193200,"counter":516,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.  On the post office network, I have been in An Post for four and a half years.<\/p><p>I have not seen a brighter future for the network than I see now, in two areas in particular.  One is the banking services, which Ms Byrne outlined.  The other is the out-of-home e-commerce.  In Finland, for example, 90% of its e-commerce parcels are delivered out of home, that is, not to people's houses.  It has been easy to deliver parcels during the pandemic because everybody is at home, but that will change.  People's patterns of life will change.  We cannot predict exactly what that will be.  However, I believe they are two big growth areas.  They are in the future.  Emerging from the pandemic is difficult.  We feel for postmasters and the difficult time they have had during the Covid-19 pandemic.  That is why, as Ms Byrne outlined, we have been working with the Government on a post-Covid payment to help during this period.  We cannot go into the details of that yet because it is still under discussion, but we are working hard and actively on that.<\/p><p> As regards whether there is a future for the post office network, there is.  Will 200 post offices close?  Inevitably, some will close because there are approximately 200 outside of those communities of 500 people or more and some of them are just not viable.  The truth is that if there are three post offices in an area and the three are not viable, but if one closes and that means the other two become viable, that is about us having a really strong network for the future.  Co-location has been a key part of this strategy.  An Post has shown a real commitment to the network, to the brand and to ensuring those products and services are available.<\/p><p> I will hand over to Ms Byrne.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021060900002#C00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. David McRedmond","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623193200,"counter":518,"content":"<p>I have nothing further to add to that.

When there are post office consolidations, there tends to be three post offices within a 10 km radius.  The 15 km is really the outer limit.

From talking to postmasters at local level and An Post staff, many do not share Mr. McRedmond's optimism about the future.  They are concerned about the change.  I hope that his vision is different from what I am hearing.  I am hearing from people who have spent 30 to 40 years working in An Post, who have been postmasters for 20 to 25 years and people who have worked as postmen and postwomen.  They are concerned.  For example, there is the issue of district sorting offices, DSOs.  Why has there been a concentration of the larger DSOs, with the withdrawal of postmen and postwomen from what are now termed small local post offices to large regional operations, thus further reducing the income of the local post offices and making them unviable?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021060900002#D00300","speaker":"1637"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623193200,"counter":520,"content":"<p>One of the interesting things is that when I came to An Post four and a half years ago I was told it was a dying company, like many postal companies.  This is not a criticism of previous management, which did a very fine job of ensuring we had the highest quality service.  However, all postal services were in decline because letter volumes were switching to email and electronic.  That was the decline of An Post.  Likewise, post offices were seen to be in decline, both with regard to whether rural Ireland was in decline or whether certain services were in decline.  In fact, we have seen a reversal.  We have worked very hard to do that.<\/p> <p>  It is my fault if those people do not see a future.  It is my fault if they are not realising there are long-term prospects.  I have to sell that, and the Senator is quite right to raise it.  I and Ms Byrne have to sell that, and we must be clear that there is a really good future.  However, it is hard work.  It is hard work for every business.  It is hard work if someone is the manager of the Spar or is a butcher.  We have great postmasters who have seen an increase in incomes and are growing their businesses.  We must now support and strengthen that.  We will support it in every way we can.  I look to this committee for positivity about that future, which is important, while I respect the views the committee is getting from postmasters.  We have to sell that.<\/p> <p>  There is a difficult period.  Undoubtedly, the next year or 18 months are going to be a difficult period.  However, as the services we have worked hard to bring in proceed, we will see a change.  If the committee looks at our delivery network, it will see that the change to parcels has been quite dramatic.  We have grown our revenues every year for the past four years, so there is a future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021060900002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. David McRedmond"},{"type":"speech","time":1623193200,"counter":521,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Byrne and Mr. McRedmond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021060900002#D00500","speaker":"1637"},{"type":"speech","time":1623193200,"counter":522,"content":"<p>Have you concluded, Senator Buttimer?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021060900002#D00600","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speech","time":1623193200,"counter":523,"content":"<p>Yes.

Counter remuneration being reduced had the impact of reducing its income by &euro;30,000 per year.  It is a busy post office in an urban setting.  Is that similar to experiences elsewhere throughout the country?  To what degree has counter remuneration reduced across the post office network as part of the triennial reviews?  What funding has been taken out of the post office network relating to counter transactions and counter remuneration?  That is a significant point relating to the viability of the network.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021060900002#D01100","speaker":"1507"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623193200,"counter":528,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the comments about post office staff.<\/p><p>We are very proud to be in this company.

One was on postmaster remuneration and another on the size of the network.  I will deal with the size of the network first.  For want of a better phrase, we have a two-tier network.  We have approximately 300 postmasters on the old contract, which is where they have this triennial review.  The rest of the offices are on the new contract, which came into effect in 2018 and was voted for by a 70:30 majority of Irish Postmasters Union members.  The old contract reviews postmasters' income every three years.  These postmasters have not been affected by the pandemic because their incomes are cushioned for three years.  The plan with the pandemic recovery fund is that if somebody was up for review this year they would avail of the pandemic fund so that the hit to social welfare transactions would not reduce their income.<\/p> <p>  We then come to the new commercial contract, whereby postmasters are paid per transaction for the business they do every week and every month.  No postmaster on this has seen his or her income reduced because the three-year deal had a top-up mechanism that guaranteed people's income to 2019 levels.  It is true to say the top-up has reduced to 50%.  During Covid, postmasters saw a bit of a drop off.  The 50% top-up would have been fine because of the new services but the decrease in social welfare and foreign exchange transactions meant there was a Covid hit.<\/p> <p>  The idea is that from the end of June the pandemic fund will cushion postmasters for another 18 months.  I would love to see the detail of this but we cannot get into individual post offices.  There is no way an urban post office has seen a decline of &euro;30,000 because they have been cushioned by the top-up mechanism, unless it was a very busy social welfare office that was badly hit last year because of the move to double payments.  The idea with the pandemic fund is to normalise it for 18 months.<\/p> <p>  When postmasters in urban areas tender their resignations, for whatever reason, the posts are advertised and we tend to have two to three applications.  In a minority of cases we may not get a suitable applicant because there is no Spar or Centra with the space.  We work very hard to fill these vacancies.  Having two, three or four applications for a post office shows people see a viable future in them.  There are 110 postmasters on the new contract who were not in receipt of transformation payments because they came on after the agreement.  They have been making a viable living.<\/p> <p>  Post offices vary from town to town based on the demographics of the area and the skill of the postmasters.  It is our job to work with postmasters.  Some are more commercial and are taking on and managing three or four post offices because they see it as a viable business but others are not and perhaps need more help.  We help them to work on selling skills and on how to manage and run a business.  We are there to give this support and local marketing tools.  For example, with our new money mate accounts for children we give the post offices tools and flyers to use in their local communities to promote their business.  We have also supplied them with direct mail so they can market to small businesses when they return to their offices.  We enable them to sell labels at a discount to those with an advantage card and mail media with publicity posts.  Postmasters can now offer a local clothes shop tools to promote the business and the post office gets a commission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021060900002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Debbie Byrne"},{"type":"speech","time":1623193200,"counter":531,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for the response.

Is the organisation prepared to look at these four post offices, in particular Broadford post office in my constituency, which closed after 190 years.  Is An Post willing to re-examine these four post offices?  They need to be looked at in a different light.

This sounds very harsh but there is a reason for it.  Four years ago, we did a deal with the Irish Postmasters Union.  We agreed a protocol.  It took three months to negotiate.  It was mediated by a senior counsel.  It was a protocol for the future of the post office network.  It set down criteria for this, and these are the criteria that Ms Byrne took the committee through, including the distances between post offices and that they serve communities of 500 or more.  The reason we have to be so strict about this is because there are 931 post offices and 931 communities and we have to be fair.  We have to break this dynamic.  Members appreciate the pressure they themselves are under and what they want to do for their communities.  As soon as we reopen one post office we will have to go through all of the cases.<\/p><p>We will have to go through, not just the ten that Ms Byrne talked about but the 192 that have closed since July 2018.  We would have to go through each of them and answer for each of them so we have to stick by that criteria.  That was a solemn agreement with postmasters which was registered through mediation.  That is why we have to do it, to make sure we have a functioning network.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021060900002#E01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. David McRedmond","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623193200,"counter":540,"content":"<p>Mr. McRedmond talks about business plans, green light strategies and viability but there is a jigsaw element to this in terms of the 15 km rule that both witnesses have spoken about.  Ireland is like a jigsaw and if one takes one piece out, it has an effect on the adjoining piece.  That is what happened in Clare.  One can talk about business viability and all of that but the reality in the Broadford case was that An Post had a contract and was willing to stay with it and keep it operational.  However, a person became unwell and decided to retire from the position and An Post seized on the opportunity to close the branch permanently.  There is something wrong in that.  If one looks at the 15 km rule, if that misfortune had befallen another family in the neighbouring village, An Post would have closed that post office and then Broadford would have survived.  There is a bit of cherry picking going on here because 15 km works in a radius format - close one and it saves the other or <i>vice versa<\/i>.  That is totally unviable.  I do not think anyone would enter the profession of postmaster or postmistress knowing that the network is subject to constant review and that if one closes, the other survives.  It is a survival of the fittest model and is not a business model in the true sense.  It is the survival of the fittest and if a postmaster or postmistress experiences personal misfortune or if, owing to age, he or she needs to retire, the opportunity is seized upon, that jigsaw piece is taken out and the neighbouring office survives.<\/p><p>Did An Post fund in part, or in full, the Grant Thornton report on the future viability of the post office network?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021060900002#F00200","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623193200,"counter":541,"content":"<p>We worked with the Irish Postmasters Union, IPU, in supplying Grant Thornton with the data that went into the report.

The payment model is an arrears model.  An Post has made a submission to the Government.  Is Mr. McRedmond at liberty to give an indication of the contents of that submission?

I am grateful to Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; for raising the issue of Government services because it is a very important pillar of the post office network.  Sometimes the post office network is seen as something that is just used for so-called offline services or physical services.  We prefer to use the term \"omnichannel\", which reflects how people lead their lives nowadays.  They might order something online and pick it up from somewhere.  There is a mixture of the physical and the digital.  In An Post, we have invested massively in our digital infrastructure.  We have a first-class digital team and one of the best digital officers.  I ask any members who are involved with any Department, if there is a need for digital and physical infrastructure, An Post is there and we are ready to provide that.

That group brought in a number of experts over the last number of months.  We have not had the opportunity to meet with the group ourselves but we wold love to do so and are working on that.  It is due to deliberate in July.  That is important.  Everybody talks about new services in the post offices but there have not been any.  An Post has delivered lot of new products and services but we need to be an arm of the Government, deliver more services and provide a better service to citizens.  If I wanted to get a new driving licence, there are 60-odd offices across the country where I could do that.  Would it not be better if people could go to one of 300 post offices?  Granted, we are not going to put photo capture kit into 930 offices but there are many other services they could provide, like dealing with planning applications.  With the hybrid working model we have now, there will be a lot of Government and local offices across the country where full services will not be available because their staff will be working from home for whatever the designated period of time is.  There is an opportunity there for post offices to offer a wider range of services.  The technical infrastructure is there and it is robust because of our interactions with social welfare and the major banks.  This is a real opportunity to better serve communities.

I join with others in expressing my thanks to the staff across the country, both at the head office and working in post offices and on the ground, who did a sterling job during the pandemic.  I also recognise the role of Mr. McRedmond and his staff in stabilising the company over the last number of years.  I recall when the company had reached a point where its future viability was very uncertain.  Well done on that.  That is not to say I do not have some criticisms.  Maybe that was the pat on the back before the kick in the ass but I have always had concerns about the network and I have expressed them to both the witnesses at different stages.  While the profitability of the company is important as regards the proper structures and business model being in place, I have always seen the network as being on the hind tit of the organisation.<\/p><p>That is unfortunate.  Reference was made to the pandemic payment for another 16 or 18 months.  We have had that previously.  It is an interim measure and it does not show confidence in the size, scale or breadth of the network.  It would not give confidence to me if I was a postmaster.  I would like to get an understanding from the witnesses about what size of a network they are aiming towards.  This might take some of the mystery out of all this.<\/p><p> Mr. McRedmond identified, rightly, how An Post found its soul with regard to public service and its solidarity with the older and more vulnerable in our communities.  I have no doubt that this is Mr. McRedmond's vision for the company, but if you overlay that vision on the post office network and on the village of Broadford, which was mentioned already, I must wonder where is the public service and the solidarity with the older and vulnerable people in and around Broadford.  These people, who are known to me for a generation, now must travel much farther and seek the assistance of others to gain access to the service.  I would like Mr. McRedmond to reflect on that.  Broadford would fit the bill for co-location.  There is a shop there that would readily accept the post office service.  I fail to understand why, in An Post's necessity to consolidate operations and which we recognise, the consolidation should be on the ground in each of the villages.  It should be about getting an appropriate co-location in each of the villages where An Post believes there is not a viable operation.  When they are co-located with another business, a financial support mechanism could be put in place under a public service obligation.<\/p><p> An Post cannot have it all.  It cannot have a public service model that is built around solidarity with older and vulnerable people and have a highly profit-driven company on the other end.  An Post must find a means to marry the two.  For sure, there are locations around the country that will readily have a post office service that will be profitable with enough of a population.  There are, however, many villages like Broadford.  There will be many more such Broadfords as the payment structure changes that close the post offices.  It is not necessarily Government money that is required, although it requires Government support.  An Post must find a way to reinvest the profits through a public service obligation model that sees some of the profit reinvested to support smaller more rural villages that are seeing a potential future due to what the pandemic has delivered for them.  People can work from home and people will use services.  While I recognise the effort that has been made with the Irish Postmasters Union, I appeal to Mr. McRedmond to look again at the network, at Broadford, and at the possibility of retaining the network in its current strength in a more imaginative way than would have been done prior to the pandemic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021060900002#H01300","speaker":"1655","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623193200,"counter":609,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for his kind comments and for the kicking.

We welcome this from the Senator and from everyone else on the committee.<\/p> <p>  When I talk about  An Post and about us being profitable, the word \"profit\" can come across wrong.  It really means us being sustainable.  We have a low capital cost because the State owns us.  All we aim to do is to make sure we are making enough money to be sustainable for the long term and to be sustainable without recourse to Government funding.  When I came into the company, we had to get a Government loan because of risks to the company's funding.  We do not want to be in that position again.  We have committed to the Government to maintain a level of return so we can be sustainable.  When the Covid pandemic came, it really played well for us that we had some cash on our balance sheet, but we are not making super profits.  The post office network especially is not making super profits.  All we are trying to do is maintain enough money so we can invest in new infrastructure and invest in capital budgets.  We are looking at investing &euro;80 million in the post office network over the next five years in a number of areas, including in new products and services, in the digital and physical network, and in sustainability.  We must make that money to be able to make this investment.<\/p> <p>  I absolutely hear what the Senator is saying about us being a public service.

The worst thing would be not to have a post office network or a good delivery network in five years or ten years from now.

This has a very important meaning, which has the potential to encourage others to have faith in a village.

It might be greater than the Post Point and may not be the full bells and whistles of a full post office, but it could give enough to maintain that presence in a co-located fashion, to give the local community an acceptance that the service is there for them, especially the older and vulnerable.

We are expanding the scope of Post Point.  While I hear back when communities use the post office and when that service is gone from an individual community, we come back to the viability and sustainability of the network.  We now have very good data that show that of the post offices that closed in 2019 and 2020 as a result of the agreement, which was about 152 post offices, the business transferred to 128 neighbouring post offices.

I am concentrating on Broadford because it is right next door to me and I know it well.  If the people getting their social welfare in Broadford go to any of the other locations, they take with them their bit of business as well.  It can have an impact on shops so it is not just about the postmaster but the businesses around that post office.  It is also about the older and more vulnerable people who would find this a bigger task.  In Broadford people might drive a mile or two into the village.  They might not want to drive to Tulla or Kilkishen because there would be more cars and it might be considered more daunting.  Although I use the term in a jocular way, An Post is robbing from these people the opportunity to live an active and self-fulfilling life and affecting the viability of the local shop.<\/p> <p>  Will the witnesses look again at the sub-post office model and the potential to enhance the service with PostPoint, as has been mentioned?  Will An Post find a way to include the payment of pensions and social welfare?  In a place like Broadford that may not be a huge chunk of money; quite frankly, it was not and if it had been, the post office would have been more sustainable and viable.  It is not beyond the realms of a local shop to manage those transactions.  An Post has very good financial models and methods of ensuring that all of this is appropriately audited.<\/p> <p>  I ask the witnesses to look again at locations below the model of populations of 500 and the idea of an enhanced PostPoint service or maybe a post office with reduced bells and whistles.  This could deliver social welfare payments.  Some of that may come from some of the profits we all hope the company can continue to make in the years ahead.  That would bring sustainability and support for less than viable businesses.

I am looking at the presentation sent to us in advance and the figures therein.  There is a good gloss on them, which is great.  I was in the Seanad in 2016 - perhaps in the Chair - when a different Deputy Naughten was the Minister responsible for An Post delivering news of a price increase from 70 cent to a euro, which was an enormous increase per letter at the time.  It was delivered on the basis of it being the only way of keeping the post office working.  It has certainly saved it from many of the problems that might have been there otherwise.<\/p> <p>  The 2019 profit before net finance and income costs was a positive &euro;66 million and last year that figure was a negative &euro;32 million.  In the first quarter of this year, the company still lost nearly &euro;10 million after depreciation.  It is not as bad as it might be but it is not necessarily where we want it to be.  I presume the witnesses would prefer a bottom line figure adding to the reserves rather than reducing them.<\/p> <p>  There are some questions that were not asked.  Social welfare is great but I presume much of the pension and children's allowance payments are now going to bank accounts.  There was a point about the pandemic unemployment payment being transitioned to a jobseeker's payment so people having to appear in order to sign on would be good.  It makes sense and gives additional transaction volumes to the post office while providing security to the State that people claiming are genuinely entitled to do so.  I am sure the vast bulk of them are.<\/p> <p>  Are there any figures on the age profile of An Post's customers.  I have occasionally brought an older person in my neighbourhood to collect a pension and that person would usually spend it all on the other side of the shop.  Such people buy most of their groceries in the same place from where they got their pension.  It tends to be older people in those queues.  There is new technology and I am not terribly familiar with it, such as Revolut, and An Post seems to have a model based on social welfare, where many of those payments may go directly to accounts.  There is a bill payment service and many companies are trying to get people to pay bills more directly such as by direct debit and so on.  People going abroad do not need foreign exchange services as much either, especially with the euro.  We may not have as much travel in future and even when we do, people will use credit cards and tap technology.  Cash is becoming less important.  There is an opportunity with State savings and people are still very happy to see this as the safest place to put their money.<\/p> <p>  Do the witnesses have data on the age profile of customers and how An Post might try to attract younger people to use post offices?  They are not using them in the same way older people are.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021060900002#K00800","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623193200,"counter":621,"content":"<p>I will ask Ms Byrne to comment on that in a moment.  The Senator mentioned the financial performance of An Post and it has been strong.  Over the past four years, we have moved from losses to increased profit each year, and this level of profitability will maintain the long-term viability of the network.  It is not super-profit.<\/p> <p>  We consciously and deliberately took a hit last year.  We calculated that Covid-19 would cost us &euro;50 million and we have outlined in some detail what that is.  We said that would happen.  It is why in 2020 we made a loss after depreciation.  We made a profit before depreciation and if An Post was a private sector company, it would have earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation, EBITDA.  It is analogous.<\/p> <p>  Like many companies we make most of our money in the final quarter of the year because of Christmas trading.  We are forecasting a profit this year before and after depreciation.  We will still have the pandemic for half this year, which means we will not be quite back to the levels of profitability that we had beforehand but we fully expect to be there in 2022.  We are robust in our performance and delivering those numbers.  I will argue that strongly.<\/p> <p>  The Senator mentioned our products and how An Post is doing.  There is no doubt that every company must find a new revenue stream.  The key for us is whether the company is growing or declining.  The truth is we are growing.  The post office did not grow last year for many reasons outlined that relate to Covid-19.  Even still, as a company we managed to grow our revenues by 3%.<\/p><p>As the committee saw, in the first quarter of this year we grew them by 11%.  That growth is all the sign of the future viability, strength and success of An Post.  I am clear that An Post is moving in a strong, positive direction.

The post office, as we know it, for exactly all the reasons outlined here, is changing.  That social welfare business will continue to decline.  No more than in the letters business that is declining, the bucket needs to be topped back up with parcels.  We have got to find a way of topping up that footfall.<\/p> <p>  I will pick a few issues.  Stamps, obviously, are the lifeblood of the post office.  It has been a declining business.  During Covid, we are one of the few posts in Europe that successfully stimulated stamp sales.  I am talking about consumers now.  Obviously, some of the businessmen would have been down with businesses not being in the office.<\/p> <p>  When I joined, we launched what I called the \"sexy stamp\" programme.  We introduced stamps such as Father Ted, U2 and, a number of years ago, the Rugby World Cup.  All of that is in a bid to make sending mail more relevant.  We have the big schools programme at the moment where we are working with schools sending postcards, writing to people in nursing homes and re-engendering that whole activity of sending mail.  That is important.  We will be a case study for Europe in terms of stimulating that consumer spending on mail.<\/p> <p>  Financial services are really important.  On our current account, the latest analysis that we have done shows we have successfully brought in a younger customer demographic.  It is the same on our credit card.  We have the best balance transfer on our credit in the marketplace.  If you have a balance on your credit card, you can transfer to An Post credit card and there is 15 months 0% interest.  We are bringing out a new credit card later in the year that will appeal to people who do not have a balance on theirs.  With loans, it is the same.  We have the best rates in the market on a number of key lines.<\/p> <p>  The Green Hub that we launched last year is all about targeting homeowners who want to renovate their home and bring in a new customer demographic.<\/p> <p>  We have just launched our new children's account, Money Mate.  This is a big opportunity for postmasters who know families, have that link with schools and will give it to the children to go out into their community and talk.  Unfortunately, there are no communions this year.  We were launching that in time for the communions.  There is the big opportunity there.<\/p> <p>  It is all about trying to broaden the base beyond that social welfare base which is really important to the post office for example, to stamps and parcels.  As Mr. McRedmond said earlier in terms of e-commerce, we want people who bought their free dresses on Boohoo and then go and return too.  They will come in and return that parcel in the post office.  That is a new demographic, and then we have the financial services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021060900002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Debbie Byrne"},{"type":"speech","time":1623193200,"counter":624,"content":"<p>It is positive to hear.

Might An Post manage to have a system that it could offer to candidates, councillors, TDs, aspiring TDs, etc., stating that it has the exact boundaries of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown and it would deliver to every house because so many houses are &quot;No junk mail&quot; now?

I welcome Mr. McRedmond and Ms Byrne.  I suppose I should point out at the beginning that I am a sub-postmaster and I am also a member of the Irish Postmasters Union, IPU.<\/p> <p>  I, too, go along with what colleagues have said.  I recognise the work that was done throughout the network via mail, counters and clerks, all through the pandemic.  The service was kept going.  Every office was kept open.  In my local area, even on a Saturday, I saw post people using their private cars to bring shopping to elderly people who lived alone.  Compliments went above and beyond.  I compliment both witnesses on the work done by the company.<\/p> <p>  The brand name of An Post is up there at the top with the work.  The schemes that were brought in through the pandemic, be it the postcard scheme for people in nursing homes or the free posting of packets to people, were excellent initiatives.  I want to put that on the record and compliment them both.<\/p> <p>  I will not ask too many questions.  I do not think I should.  I have just a few comments.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Cathal Crowe mentioned something earlier on and I just want to go back to the negotiations in 2018 with regard to the transformation payment.  I was one of those postmasters who was at those public meetings.  Everything was put on the table to us to make a decision in a democratic fashion and that is what everyone did.  The vast majority voted.  I think over 80% were in favour.  I would like to clarify that issue.  I thought it was implied that we were not being given information at the time with regard to that decision.  That is not correct; from my point of view as one of those postmasters, I want to put that on record.  I have every confidence in the IPU to represent me and to work on our behalf with An Post.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the fact that a pandemic payment scheme is being put in place.  Personally, I would like to see it for longer than 18 months but I can understand why it is there.  The Grant Thornton report is with New Economy and Recovery Authority, NewERA.  We need to be looking at a retained earnings model to support the network for a longer period of possibly three to five years.  Mr. McRedmond mentioned earlier that this is about 931 communities as well as the jobs that are affected throughout that area.  It is about communities and the knock-on effect of those offices in those communities with footfall, etc., and the ancillary business that it drives in all of those communities.  There was a figure in the Grant Thornton report with regard to the social value of the network to the Irish economy and the average figure was &euro;550 million.<\/p><p>That is what the network gives to the Irish economy and that is why it must be supported.  There is an ideal opportunity to do that now.  We have a large number of banks closing and there will be many towns left without a main financial institution so it is important the network is supported to be able to provide that service.  One only needs to go back to 2010 when we had Postbank which had around 200,000 customers and no debt.  It was actually the only bank in the country which was not supported at that time.  It had to close and repay moneys while the State supported all the other banking institutions.  There is now an opportunity for the Government to support the An Post network to keep it surviving, to be honest.  That also fits in with our whole initiative for town centres.  If we are to get people to move back into towns to live, we must have services available to people in those towns.<\/p><p> I welcome the interdepartmental group and I am aware it is due to report in early July.  I am hoping it will look at areas such as motor tax and requiring all local authorities to allow council rent to be paid in post offices.  At the minute, not all do and that is an issue.<\/p><p> Driving licences were mentioned by Ms Byrne.  When that contract went out a number of years ago it was framed in such a way that we could not properly tender for it.  That is a point that must be made.  Sixty new offices for driving licence applications were set up around the country, some of them upstairs in shopping centres, etc., and all the while we had a network with the capability to deliver the service.  We were not given the opportunity to do so, however.  When that contract comes up again we should be given the opportunity to tender for it on a fair playing field.<\/p><p> I agree also with the comments made about the PUP.  In the short term, when switching back to jobseeker's allowance, it should be put through the post offices.<\/p><p> The age profile of postmasters was mentioned.  I am probably one of the younger ones.  Has further consideration been given to offering another retirement package at some stage in the near future?<\/p><p> As I said, there are huge opportunities for the company.  An Post has a very strong brand name.  The Money Mate account offers an opportunity to get kids to turn the Cyril the Squirrel stamps, which are very popular with schools, into bank accounts.  An Post could then build a suite of financial products that would keep those customers throughout their lives.<\/p><p> Once again I compliment the company on the work done over the past 15 months.  As I said, we have a very strong brand name.  I saw a report recently which was done last year, I think by Red C.  It showed almost 90% support for financial supports or services being put through the An Post Network.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021060900002#L00900","speaker":"1639","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623193200,"counter":632,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator very much for those comments.

What State services, in addition to those it currently provides and which are currently provided by other service providers, could the company provide?  Lastly, if we are looking at the post office network, 18 months is not long enough.  It is an interim measure as the company probably needs five years of a forward plan.

We provide rapid antigen testing at our clinics in Dublin and Cork.  Two colleagues and I established V1 Medical in November 2020, as no other facility was offering rapid antigen testing convenient to Dublin Airport, despite many EU countries already accepting antigen testing for travel.<\/p> <p>  In fact, when the Dutch Government updated its rules on 15 January requiring an antigen test within four hours of departure for every passenger to the Netherlands, including transit passengers, we were still the only company offering rapid antigen testing and were contacted by Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, KLM and Aer Lingus to provide and facilitate their passengers on their flights that day.<\/p> <p>  We offer a fast and convenient service and a vital service to air and shipping crews and engineering professionals, in particular, who need to travel for essential reasons.  Due to unforeseen circumstances, they may need to reschedule or cancel their travel plans at short notice.  We have contracts for services with ASL Airlines, Aer Lingus, CityJet, Doyle Shipping Group in Dublin and Cork, Candina Group, as well as several engineering companies.  We provide testing with results and certification within 30 minutes using the Roche\/SD Biosensor test which is validated by the HSE and on the EU Commission's list of mutually recognised tests.<\/p> <p>  We have developed robust and efficient procedures to ensure every customer makes his or her flight on time.  We provide full flexibility, including refunds up to two hours before appointment time.  We accommodate urgent cases, whether it be crews with schedule changes or people who need to travel at short notice due to family illness or bereavement.  With more than 60 years of experience in aviation between us, we understand flexibility around travel is key.  This is simply not achievable with PCR testing, even without taking into account the much higher cost of PCR.<\/p> <p>  Ireland is an outlier in the EU and among our most important trading partners with regard to antigen testing.  The USA, the UK, Germany, Netherlands, Italy, Poland, Croatia, Bulgaria, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Czechia, Lithuania, Finland, Luxembourg, Austria and Spain are some of the countries accepting antigen testing for travel.  Ireland is the most disconnected country and Dublin the most<\/p> <p>disconnected city in Europe, according to Eurocontrol.<\/p> <p>  As countries across the EU connect with the EU digital Covid certificate and with less than six weeks before Ireland is due to go live on 19 July, we have been unable to obtain any information or guidance on what is required for us to be involved.  We want to be prepared, so when the Government is ready to launch this important initiative, we too are ready.  Ireland and our aviation, travel and tourism industry cannot afford any further delays.  The US and overseas tourist spend is significantly higher than domestic tourist spend, so encouraging staycations will not be enough to save many businesses which depend on foreign tourism.<\/p> <p>  Our airports, especially Shannon Airport and Cork Airport, are in danger of further losing connectivity.  Our slots at Heathrow Airport are not ours - they belong to the International Airlines Group, IAG, which can easily repurpose them for more profitable routes.  Dublin Airport, which has been successfully serving as a transatlantic hub for flights from Europe, is already losing these customers to UK bases.  Our connectivity with the UK, once among the busiest routes in the world, is suffering because of restrictions within the common travel area, CTA, all on this side of the Irish Sea.<\/p> <p>  We need to plan urgently for the implementation of the EU digital Covid certificate, including allowing antigen testing for both inbound and outbound travel.

I thank the Chairman for the privilege and opportunity to address him and his fellow committee members here today.  I wish to convey ten points.<\/p> <p>  In conjunction with the vaccination programmes and other precautions, we want to help the Irish Government and the Irish people to eradicate the Covid-19 contagion as quickly as possible.  This can be achieved through an integrated technology and testing solution based on a combination of practical experience and technological expertise.  This system involves a digital platform and a multilayered testing programme which we combine.  It has been proven to work in pilot events and can be customised to suit any event, flight or form of travel.  All flights, ferry sailings and train journeys should be treated as mini-events and the same basic principles apply to all those activities.  This can all be achieved at an economical price in terms of time, effort and money.  It can also help to reboot the Irish economy and save the State a significant amount of money both now and in the future.  We would like the Irish Government and agencies of the State to avail of this great technological opportunity and to engage with us immediately.  Early and full engagement will yield the best results and the most savings.<\/p> <p>  The findings of ongoing mass testing and reporting are key to controlling the spread of this virus.  All such data will be retained in a secure Irish GDPR-compliant cloud platform, but it can be shared with the Irish public health authorities, as appropriate and agreed.  This technology affords operational connectivity and compatibility with the EU digital Covid certificate and other international platforms which are deemed appropriate.  This solution is absolutely no substitute for social responsibility.  Rapid test results and their results are not a licence for personal misbehaviour.  Rapid tests are additional tools for informing the further containment and curtailment of infection.  This tech and test solution is already activated and ready to go.  The software is already fully developed and ready to help schools, businesses, sport and society to get moving again as quickly and safely as possible.  Our strategy, processes and technology are all laid out in the submission which has been circulated to members and a brief explanatory video has also been circulated, which helps to explain the process in six simple steps.  It is my privilege to head up a team of dedicated professionals.  I am delighted to be joined by two members of that team, our pharmaceutical expert, Chris O'Grady and our technology expert, Simon Osman.  I ask Mr. O'Grady to say a word also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021060900002#BB00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry O'Brien"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623193200,"counter":657,"content":"<p>I am a registered pharmacist and a director of Duelchem Limited.  I apologise because my Gaeilge is not as polished as Mr. O'Brien's.  Duelchem is an Irish pharmaceutical retail and wholesale company based in County Kilkenny, which was set up in 2008.  We have been supplying the Irish healthcare sector with pharmaceutical products for more than a decade.  We have a strong working relationship with the HSE, collaborating on multiple projects, with a view to expanding this relationship.<br\/><br\/>As a pharmaceutical wholesaler, we hold a wholesale distribution authorisation licence which is regulated by the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA.  This HPRA regulation obligates us to verify the integrity of our suppliers and the products we distribute and to register with the Irish Medicines Verification Organisation, IMVO.  Our regulatory affairs team ensures we are prepared for and comply with legislative changes such as the falsified medicines directive, the recent medicinal devices regulation and the forthcoming May 2022 <i>in vitro <\/i>diagnostic medical devices regulation.<br\/><br\/>In response to the pandemic, Duelchem set up <i>reassurance.ie<\/i>, which operates a number of testing centres to help to identify and ultimately reduce the number of Covid-19 cases.  We offer both antigen and PCR tests and publish results, if required, on reporting applications such as <i>healthpassportworldwide.com.<\/i><br\/><br\/>Symptoms have been, to date, the main trigger for self-isolation and Covid-19 testing.<\/p><p>The success of the vaccine programme - the rate of vaccination is estimated to be approximately 50% - does, however, increase the chances of people getting Covid-19 asymptomatically.  The absence of symptoms increases the likelihood of Covid-19 spreading within the community because the triggers that we know for self-isolation and testing, such as temperature, loss of taste, flu-like symptoms, etc., are not as prevalent.<\/p><p> Currently, when an individual develops symptoms, he or she self-isolates and contacts his or her GP or the HSE to arrange a PCR test, but 51% to 70% of transmission of Covid-19 happens when no symptoms are present, either pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic.  The symptoms usually come from the body's immune response and, therefore, by the time people develop symptoms, they are at their peak viral load or possibly even already past it.  By the time they receive the PCR test result in 48 hours to 72 hours, assuming they were symptomatic when they got the test done, they are possibly no longer even transmitting the virus and are no longer infectious or contagious.  While the PCR captures the definitive result and initiates contact tracing, antigen tests have a significant role to play in stopping the spread of the virus.  The solution we propose today is the use of an antigen self-test in triplicate, with the digital platform to underpin the testing programme.  Mr. Osman, our technology expert, will now briefly illustrate the integrated solution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021060900002#BB00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Chris O'Grady","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623193200,"counter":659,"content":"<p>I am also honoured to be here today to take part in this meeting and represent the technology industry.  My background is building technology companies, specifically in the software space, and building applications and infrastructure businesses.  More than 12 months ago now, we formed <i>tested.me<\/i>.  The purpose of the company was built on the desire to help companies and individuals work through and recover from the challenges of the pandemic and beyond.  We realise that the need for an individual to be able to present a trusted health status using a mobile phone application would be hugely important, alongside a reporting solution and a health information platform.  Due to the nature of the information needed, we felt that the mobile application needed to include ID verification in order to create trust, so you go through this process when you download our app.  We also give individuals a sense of choice and ownership, so in our app you can see share history, you can choose the level of detail that you want to share, and you can also delete information.<br\/><br\/>Importantly, the third principle was to make sure that our system was interoperable.  As we have gone through the last year, we have found that this aspect is extremely important in terms of building a compliant digital platform.  This means that we understand that it is necessary to be able to connect with health platforms, labs, other patient applications, e-commerce systems and booking systems to create that end-to-end solution.<br\/><br\/>Version 1 of our solution went live in August of last year, with a focus on helping workplaces specifically.  Over time, we have developed the product to meet other needs such as travel and the events space.  We have had approximately 300,000 active connections on our platform and thousands of test results uploaded daily.  The active users are across many countries and we are very proud of the work we have done in schools, workplaces and hospitality.  We are now in discussions regarding supporting the travel area specifically, working with the island of Santorini in Greece and also reopening some major events this summer.  We also achieved a successful pilot within a main airport in the UK.<br\/><br\/>Our journey has been an extremely interesting one.  I am sure everyone on this call today has experienced an interesting 12 months with the challenges that we faced.  As a company we have been called in by the UK Government into many steering committees in terms of the Covid response.  We are part of the Digital Healthcare Council in the UK.  I have also presented to the Conservative Science &amp;amp; Technology Forum regarding digital identification and digital health passes.  We have been working with the NHS in terms of the app and integration.  We are HIQA compliant as a company.  We are working towards our ISO 27001 certification.  We are Cyber Essentials Plus certified, and we also have our own information security management system.<br\/><br\/>At a global level, we also work within the global health pass and we also sit on the Vaccination Credential Initiative group, which is important in terms of understanding the global standards and the protocols that need to be in place to create this borderless environment again in terms of travel and get society moving.  It has been an absolute pleasure to introduce myself.

Looking back at levels of travel from 2019, which would have been the last normal year, approximately 25 million passengers went through Dublin Airport alone.  All hands on deck are needed for this.<\/p> <p>  I understand the idea of self-testing would of course make things much more scalable and convenient.  As far as I am aware, however, the European Commission has stated self-testing will not be allowed for the EU digital green certificate.  That needs to be worked on.  From my own experience of self-testing, our company supervised a self-testing event of 300 airline pilots who are generally clever and well able to follow instructions.  There are definitely some issues there with practice.  In UK schools, for example, the kids self-test at school three times and then they are allowed to do so at home.  There is definitely a learning curve regarding swabbing and the actual processing of the tests.  While it is a learning curve, it can be overcome.  The European Commission would have to get on board with that.<\/p> <p>  Regarding resistance to antigen testing, as a medical doctor and having been involved in providing antigen testing for travel, I do not understand why there is such resistance.  I do not see any evidence for it.  I would like to see the evidence if it exists.  Several arguments have been made, one of which is antigen testing will encourage poor behaviour.  In fact, the Covid-SMART project in Liverpool in the UK did not support that argument.  It is back to the argument of seat belts and condoms that we have had, namely, applying a public health tool will not necessarily encourage poor behaviour.<\/p> <p>  From the aviation context, the poor behaviour argument is moot.  We have very well controlled environment both at airports and in aircraft.  Poor behaviour and non-compliance with regulations will not be tolerated.  Those passengers will just not be carried.  From the behavioural aspect, I do not think that is an issue for travel.<\/p> <p>  On the sensitivity argument and the public health risk, sensitivity can be improved by proper sampling techniques and use of the testing.  For the moment, this will mean that it should be monitored testing as per the EU guidelines.  There is a definite role for self-testing for screening purposes for schools, colleges, other forms of transport, workplaces, residential care homes etc.  Thousands of leaving certificate students will start their exams today.  Many of them will be told, unfortunately, that they cannot sit their exams because they have been designated a close contact.  Had we been organised to facilitate those students, they could have taken a rapid antigen test just before going into the exam and then be able to do it.  There are many opportunities that we have missed to roll out antigen testing for the good of society.<\/p> <p>  On sensitivity regarding travel, it has been shown in studies that an antigen test 24 hours before a flight is as good as a PCR test only two hours before.  That is a very simple fix.  One just requests an antigen test 24 hours before.  Professor Mina will have more statistics on this.  His studies will show that the real issue with sensitivity is the period of time before a person becomes positive on an antigen test when they are already positive on a PCR test.  That is just an eight-hour to 24-hour window.  Even a 48-hour antigen test would be as good as a 72-hour PCR test.  These can all be overcome and should not be a reason why we should discount antigen testing for travel.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021060900002#DD00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niamh Power"},{"type":"speech","time":1623193200,"counter":670,"content":"<p>I thank the guests for their continued engagement with the committee.

We also worked on the flow of the individual turning up to the flight and getting on it.  There was a lateral flow test taken on the morning of the journey to make that happen.  Lateral flow testing was part of the process.  At the point of go-live for this project on the route to Amsterdam, due to another lockdown, it was cancelled from moving into a full productive environment.  The process had been approved at that point.  We will be talking with them again in the next few days in terms of where we are with the status of that.  There was a moment where there was an agreement that the lateral flow test option was a good one.<\/p> <p>  The challenge we have with airline travel is the moving target around the guidelines and each country's different regulations.  The UK is running a traffic light system, which does not necessarily twin with the system at the other end.  It is that common set of guidelines that are now working their way through measures like the good health pass initiative.  The ability to interoperate with other platforms will become important.<\/p> <p>  In the UK, lateral flow has got wide adoption in a number of sectors.  We are seeing it in schools.  Individuals are now testing twice, maybe three times, a week depending on what setting they are going into.  We are seeing it used across the whole sector.  We have been working with UEFA and other large organisations around lateral flow testing as part of the solution.  As we see the vaccination percentage get to a good number, we will see lateral flow tests filling the space and becoming the day-to-day mitigation and management solution of transmissibility.<\/p> <p>  We have seen lateral flow testing in most of our proof of concepts that we have been running.  It is part of the process.  It is important to recognise it is different kind of solution or different products for different use cases.  To force things against each other into the same place is where there are clashes.  There is a use case for both products.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the public health solution, we believe the correct model is to look at lateral flow testing on a public health level.  In terms of science and accuracy, then one can move to PCR, for example, on a positive test.  I am a technologist - I want to make that clear - but that is my experience of what we are seeing in terms of data, the best way to mitigate risk and get things moving again in a safe and secure way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021060900002#DD00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Simon Osman"},{"type":"speech","time":1623193200,"counter":674,"content":"<p>I call Dr. Niamh Power.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021060900002#DD00700","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623193200,"counter":675,"content":"<p>We are operating out of Dublin and Cork and do not have any experience of airports abroad.  As Mr. Osman said, there is a massive difficulty in terms of moving targets, with some countries, such as the Netherlands, changing position overnight.  The big advantage antigen testing gives is that we can quickly adapt to those moving targets.  For instance, when the Netherlands introduced the requirement for a test four hours before a flight into the country, we were able to accommodate that.  People who had turned up at the airport without a test, the wrong test or an out-of-date test were able to come to us, have their antigen test and be back at check-in 20 minutes later with their certificates.  That simply cannot happen with PCR testing, whereas the scalability and flexibility are definitely there with antigen testing.<\/p> <p>  The difficulty I would worry about is that even though antigen testing is very rapid and adaptable, how will it be integrated in terms of uploading the digital green certificate?  The concern is that there will be a delay.  Will somebody else have to validate the test or will centres be able to validate and upload directly?  The beauty of antigen testing is its speed and adaptability.  If a centre is deemed eligible by the HSE or the Department of Health to be part of the digital green certificate system, then we should be able to upload directly.  If we have to go through a validation process after the tests, it really takes from the beauty, speed and flexibility of antigen testing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021060900002#EE00100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niamh Power"},{"type":"speech","time":1623193200,"counter":676,"content":"<p>Dr. Power's company offers a monitored antigen test rather than a self-administered one.

I emphasise their experience and expertise because I have raised the issue of the use of antigen tests on several occasions in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  Having raised it with the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and several Ministers, I came to the conclusion that the political establishment is in favour of the use of antigen testing.  In the most recent exchange I had with the T&aacute;naiste, he referred to differing opinions between scientists and public health doctors regarding its use.  He also referred to the report by Professor Mark Ferguson, the Government's chief scientific adviser, and indicated that the Government has now formally endorsed his report.  In that report, Professor Ferguson sees a very prominent position for antigen testing in our battle against Covid.<\/p> <p>  I want to raise an issue that has been brought to my attention by members of the public.  I firmly believe in the use of antigen testing.  It is my understanding that many of the large sporting organisations in this country, including the GAA, IRFU and the soccer authorities, had moved to the stage where they were prepared to go with antigen testing.  It is a misnomer to say that the Government is opening up sporting, cultural and entertainment events.  That is simply not factual.  The numbers allowed into venues under the new protocols are so low as to be meaningless.  It really is nonsensical.  The administrators of the national organisations had no option other than to go along with the proposals.  However, I am very much aware that they are privately very critical of the arrangements.  Compliance with these new regulations is massively time-consuming and cumbersome and there is a huge workload involved for very little gain.  For the number of people allowed into the venues, the workload is extremely high.  We have a situation now where voluntary organisations are giving out a sparse allocation of tickets and that will become a nightmare for officials.<\/p> <p>  I find it difficult to understand the resistance to antigen testing by the CMO and the National Public Health Emergency Team.  It is very baffling and defies all logic.  I must say, and I am doing so publicly, that the stubborn obstruction to its use must be questioned.  We need to invite the CMO and his team to come before this Oireachtas committee.  They must be given the opportunity, in public, to explain their rationale in this matter, justify their decision to disagree with the scientific evidence and explain the reasons they are not accepting Government advice and ignoring the advice of the European Commission.  As an island nation, we depend on aviation for connectivity.  We have to ask why antigen testing is being deliberately excluded as part of our weaponry in the battle to detect and control the spread of Covid.  As far as I am concerned, we, as a committee, have an obligation to demand an answer to that question.  I request that the CMO and his officials be brought before us at a very early stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021060900002#EE00500","speaker":"1609"},{"type":"speech","time":1623193200,"counter":680,"content":"<p>I apologise for interrupting but Deputy Lowry is off camera.

Has the HSE or any Irish agency reached out to his company for a presentation or information?<\/p> <p>  Will one of the witnesses address the comparative costs of PCR and antigen testing?  We are all very aware that Ireland depends on people being able to travel in and out of the country.  The aviation sector depends on that capability.  We know there are families who will want to go on holiday as soon as the restrictions are lifted, but they will have to look at the costs of testing.  For a family of four, comprising two adults and two children over seven years of age, the cost of PCR testing is absolutely enormous.  Antigen testing is much more favourably costed.  I ask one of the witnesses to address the cost factor.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021060900002#EE00700","speaker":"1609"},{"type":"speech","time":1623193200,"counter":682,"content":"<p>For the Deputy's information, we there is an open invitation to the CMO, Dr. Holohan, to come before the committee.

Obviously, this is an issue that is very commercially sensitive and subject to negotiations.  I can tell the committee that the cost of the construction of the technology has been largely funded outside Ireland.  We have a unique opportunity now to bring that technology here.  As I said, a lot of the cost of its construction has been incurred elsewhere.<\/p><p>However, there is a cost in maintaining it, maintaining the infrastructure and support that is necessary and customising the application to suit the individual event or flight - the aviation, train or ferry journey, or whatever it is.  That can all be done through consultation but Ireland has avoided the heavy investment in the technology because it has been done by others elsewhere.<\/p><p> Second, the critical issue with cost is the volume of the order.  The bigger the order and the number that is required, the lower the price will be.  There is the issue of available stocks of the approved products, and all of that can be ascertained.  As was indicated by Mr. O'Grady, we can access up to 8 million of these tests per week, if needs be, and the cost of that would be greatly reduced by a substantial order.  There is then the issue of the timeframe which has to be met and supply chains.<\/p><p> There is also the distribution issue.  For example, does the customer want an entity in the private sector, such as Dr. Power&rsquo;s company or Mr. O'Grady&rsquo;s company, to distribute it or does the customer want to use a commercial entity that will actually be required to distribute it, or perhaps use the organisation that is involved?  I give the example of the GAA in particular.  My goodness, there is no better organisation given it is organised on a county and parish basis and can have a prearranged system for distribution of these tests.  We can add to that the fact most people nowadays have a smartphone, and the linkage that can be done between the technology and the test is fantastic and can be scaled up immediately.<\/p><p> We try to minimise the manpower that will be required with the technology, and Dr. Power and Mr. O&rsquo;Grady indicated that trying to keep a clinic open on a day-to-day basis will result in manpower costs, but there are-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021060900002#EE00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623193200,"counter":685,"content":"<p>I am conscious of time.

It is adaptable and customisable but there is time and effort involved.  As someone who develops software, time is always our biggest battle.  It is not a matter of throwing teams and teams of developers at it because it gets inefficient at a certain scale.  Regarding the ability to build platforms and technology, there is an element of that, and the more developers there are, the more that can be done.  Equally, however, with a solution that needs to be pulled together and that is compliant between the science, the medical and the technology to develop it, there are lots of points where there are what I would call interfaces, which need to be thought through.

I will talk him through how it would work.  If people were to engage with this version of a solution that I will outline, I do not see any reason we could not approach upcoming events like all-Ireland hurling and football finals in August with the expectation of having full stadia.  I will give a brief outline of what I am proposing and how it will cater for different organisations, which will have different preferences on the exact details.  I will just give a flavour of how it would work.<\/p> <p>  Individuals would buy a ticket online.  They would be instructed to download the relevant app in order to retrieve their purchase ticket.  As part of the app download, they would be required to populate in their details.  The individual would then be furnished with a self-test pack containing three packs.  The app would display a demonstration video which would illustrate technique.  The app would also instruct on how to interpret the results and how to upload a verification photo of the result window.  As the application is web-based, whatever event co-ordinator is controlling it, be it the GAA, IRFU, FAI or otherwise, would have immediate access to the results and the verification photos in real time.  The app would notify or remind the individual three days before the event to perform the first test of the three-pack, to interpret and declare the result in the app and to upload the verification photo.  Then, assuming that first test was negative, on the day of the event, the app would notify and remind that individual to perform the second test of the triple-pack, to interpret and declare the result and to upload the verification photo.  Assuming that second test is negative, the app would assign a green tick health status.  The green tick health status in the app would grant the individual access to the event.  The app would then notify or remind the individual five days after the event to perform the third and final test, interpret and declare the result and upload the verification folder.<\/p> <p>  Obviously, if there is a positive result at any of these stages, that has to be dealt with.  For example, if there was a positive result at the first test, which is three days beforehand, this would allow the individual sufficient time to go and get a PCR test, which could confirm or overturn that positive antigen result.  If the positive result is confirmed, the individual would be refunded the cost of the ticket in the same way it was purchased.  If the positive result is overturned by the PCR test, the results can be uploaded into the app to supersede the antigen test result and grant access to the event.  The positive result for the second test, which is on the day of the event, would mean an automatic refund for the individual because there would not be time to go and get a confirmatory test.  This is the benefit of having it in triplicate.<\/p> <p>  If this, or a form of it, was embraced, the number of people in the stadium is irrelevant.  If the system is implemented, it works for 500, 5,000 or 100,000.  It is the same process.  It is just about filtering out contagious people at earlier stages in order to not bring them into the main group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021060900002#FF00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Chris O'Grady"},{"type":"speech","time":1623193200,"counter":690,"content":"<p>Has Duelchem put this proposal to the Government or to any of the sporting bodies?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021060900002#GG00100","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623193200,"counter":691,"content":"<p>We have written to all appropriate State Departments and agencies.

One obviously needs to do the first and second tests because, if one does not, one will not get a ticket to the event.

This is not something we get from tests carried out prior to an event.  The way to obligate people to take this test is, if they buy tickets on the website of the FAI, the GAA or the IRFU, the third test would be the final step of the transaction and would fulfil the requirements of the application.  An unfulfilled transaction would disqualify people from purchasing further tickets.<\/p><p>It would be made known to people at the time that the obligation involves a three-step phase.  With regard to the value got from the third test, where there is a case relating to an event an asymptomatic attendee would be referred for a PCR test but that would result in earlier isolation, earlier contact tracing and reduced community transmission.  It would also reassure the attendee.  People are socially responsible and want to know they have not contributed to the problem.  They want to know they are clear before they engage with colleagues or family members.  They get reassurance some days after the event that they are fine.  The event co-ordinator verifies that the event it has run has had no Covid impact.  If somebody says there was an outbreak in a certain geographical area, there will be data after the event to show the outbreak was not related to it and could be coincidental.  If there are positive results after an event, there is the application to notify anybody who may be affected.  The event co-ordinator can notify, through the application, and make people aware that there was a case and that they could be close contacts and should get a HSE confirmatory test.

I believe the pushback against the antigen tests is related to the spin about their accuracy by comparison with PCR tests.  Regarding the spin about antigen tests being only 60% as accurate as PCR tests, which I have read along with every member of the committee, the detail, while it might be available, is misinterpreted.  It is being found that an antigen test and a PCR test cannot be compared.  They are two different technologies looking for two different things.  The antigen test is looking for protein of the virus whereas the PCR test is looking for the RNA of the virus.  The analogy, which ironically is Professor Mina's, is that the PCR test looking for the RNA of the virus is like a detective looking for DNA at a crime scene.  More often than not, the crime is over.  A PCR test will continue to detect RNA of the virus after people have been infectious and contagious whereas the antigen test will be positive only when the viral load is high and, therefore, when somebody is transmitting the virus.  While research shows 71 out of 1,000 people tested positive using PCR whereas only 43 in the same group tested positive using an antigen test &ndash; I apologise because the figures are not dead on &ndash; that is not to say the antigen test is 40% less accurate; it is to say that the antigen test is testing for contagiousness and for whether the individual's viral load is high enough to mean he or she is transmitting the disease and infecting people.  The PCR test, while it has no problem detecting, is actually detecting pre-infectiousness and post-infectiousness.  It is not that the antigen test is less accurate but that it is looking for something different.  What I have described is the origin of the inaccurate spin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021060900002#HH00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Chris O'Grady"},{"type":"speech","time":1623193200,"counter":715,"content":"<p>I am conscious of time.

At the beginning of the pandemic, people had not asked how to use testing to really limit spread.  That has led to a lot of confusion.  I have seen it.  There is a lot of confusion in Ireland but it is not just in Ireland; it is also in the United States and every other country.  I have been advising governments across the world on this issue.<br\/><br\/>The biggest issue that I can see people are continuing to have regarding antigen tests concerns the questions of whether they are accurate and how to understand the likes of the Cochrane review, which showed a sensitivity rate in the order of 50%.  That needs to be placed in the context of the goal of testing.  This is where the biggest questions have arisen.  Testing is almost always used in the context of medical practice.  That is how we have devised all the metrics we use to evaluate a test but, in the middle of a pandemic, the question of how to use a test is much more about how well the test is limiting the spread and detecting people who are actually infectious.  If that is our question, the sensitivity metrics of the rapid antigen tests change dramatically.  We have published on this in <i>Science<\/i>, <i>The New England Journal of Medicine<\/i>and many more of the world's top medical journals.  All of the conclusions are essentially the same in that where there is an attempt to limit spread, the speed at which a result comes back is much more critical than getting every ounce of sensitivity to detect the RNA of the virus.<\/p><p>That is because the PCR can detect down to 100 or 1,000 copies, but people do not spread when they are at 100 or 1,000 copies of this virus.  People spread when they are at a million, billion or even a trillion copies of this virus.  If the question is whether we can detect a billion copies of the virus, these tests do it very well, down to about 100,000.  That is sufficient to detect anyone likely to be infectious.<\/p><p> The other downfall, if we compare these tests to PCR, is speed.  What we have to do when evaluating the sensitivity of a comparator test, like a PCR test, and which is not currently done because we do not even have the metrics to do it, is to question the effective sensitivity of the PCR.  A test taken two days before flying, for example, is a much poorer performing test than a rapid antigen test taken an hour before flying.  People are often worried about missing the first day after somebody is exposed, for example, and whether the antigen test would pick it up, but testing two days before flying means giving an inferior test for that flight versus a rapid antigen test one hour before the flight.  That is because if the real concern is transmission on the flight, or thereafter, we want to be able to test as close to the event as possible.  That will always be the better solution.<\/p><p> We have shown this innumerable times now, mathematically, and it is really not a question anymore of the mathematics or science.  It is now a question of how to create new language.  That is really what the world is confronting with testing in this pandemic.  We have never had the language before even to describe a test whose primary mode or purpose of use is the obstruction of transmission.  It is a very different set of metrics and uses compared with what we normally see.<\/p><p> False positives have also been a major concern for many people.  However, with many of the newer rapid tests and some of the older ones, such as Nova and Abbott, both of which we evaluated, for example, we are seeing about one in 10,000 false positives.  It is very small number of false positives.  If a test is positive, the nice thing is a second rapid test, or even a second rapid molecular RNA test, can confirm right then.  The rapid tests can be used for their greatest ability, which is that they are fast, so it does not mean a ten-day purgatory from a false positive.  It means a 20-minute purgatory and then the test is confirmed.  Again, those instances are rare if the right tests are chosen and selected.<\/p><p> I could go into as much detail as anyone wants, but I really want the take-home message to be that these tests are very accurate if you are concerned about limiting transmission.  If you are trying to diagnose somebody who has symptoms because of Covid, use a PCR test.  However, if the goal is trying to use a test as a way to limit spread, then use a rapid test, whether it is an antigen or rapid molecular test, both of which will be available in future.  Speed is much more important if your goal is to limit spread, especially on something like an aeroplane or at an event etc.  I will stop there but am very happy to take questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021060900002#HH01700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Michael Mina","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623193200,"counter":730,"content":"<p>I will go back to Senator Horkan.

It is incumbent on us as a committee to bring in the Chief Medical Officer, CMO, as soon as we can, to have a conversation with him about what we have heard today.<\/p> <p>  My last question, for whoever is most qualified to answer it, is, in the context of the vaccine roll-out, and it is fantastic it is being rolled out as quickly as it can be, the EU digital green certificate, the vaccine bonus and so many of the population being fully vaccinated, do we still need antigen or PCR testing for people once we know they have been vaccinated?  More than half the adult population is now vaccinated with at least one dose.  In three or four weeks that will be two doses.  I am not trying to take away anybody's commercial opportunity, but it is hoped in the fullness of time we will not need to do antigen testing at all.

However, we have also seen a lot of data that show distributions of the viral loads are actually not that different between vaccinated and unvaccinated people.  We know vaccinated people are likely to be transmitting less because we are starting to see herd effects, meaning when adults are vaccinated we see fewer cases in children.  That is a major win.<\/p> <p>  We need to be very cognisant that we continue monitoring the situation.  In my family, for example, which is not an example I usually give but shows how I am thinking, my wife is pregnant and currently has a single dose of vaccine.  I will not go into the details of why that is.  Even when people who are vaccinated come to our house, we ask them to take a rapid antigen test.  That is because we know that people can carry the virus asymptomatically when they are vaccinated, especially things like the Delta variant and the inevitable next variants that will come around.<\/p> <p>  We just have to very cautious and keep watching the data as they flow in but, at the moment, for travel on an enclosed plane, having pretty tight restrictions is still a good thing.

It is just an inaccurate assessment.  If the goal, again, is to limit and block transmission and track transmissible people, the mathematics is very simple.  I will give an example that everyone can understand.  A person is positive on a PCR for about 30 days.  We know the isolation window proposed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, is only ten days.  The WHO has seen that a ten-day isolation window is appropriate.  That means ten days is the maximum infectious period, but with a PCR positive test it is 30.  Doing the simple division of ten days of transmissibility divided by 30 days of being PCR positive, means that only around 30% to 40% sensitivity should be expected of a transmission-indicating test when comparing it against PCR.  A 50% accuracy rate is actually a good value when comparing a test with PCR.  If that test is only supposed to detect infectiousness, the accuracy rate should only be somewhere between 20% and 50%, taking variants into account.  It should not be more than 50% sensitive.  The other 50% that is being missed are almost always people who are post-infectious in those 20 days after the isolation period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021060900002#JJ00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Michael Mina"},{"type":"speech","time":1623193200,"counter":736,"content":"<p>We have been discussing the European green certificate, antigen testing and returning to sporting events.

The questions I had have already been asked and answered very effectively.  I am at a loss as to why the committee is still making this argument.  Such an effective job was done to diminish the efficacy of antigen testing early on in this pandemic.  Many people have done good work to push back on that.  I believe that our session with Professor Mark Ferguson once and for all ended any residual arguments about the efficacy of antigen testing.  Today has been very useful because it shows how sector-ready the industry is to provide this.  There are no barriers to implementing this effectively in aviation, at sporting events or at events in general, bar this blockage.<\/p> <p>  I acknowledge the work the Chairman is doing to ensure this stays on the agenda, but the arguments are increasingly stronger.  We certainly need the Chief Medical Officer, CMO, to appear before the committee to answer what has been proposed.  For me, it is unanswerable at this stage.

I ask him here publicly to engage with our committee and put his arguments on antigen testing.  The purpose of the committee is to get to the facts.  The missing piece of the jigsaw at this stage is that we need the CMO to appear before the committee to give his views on antigen testing.  I ask for that to happen very shortly.<\/p> <p>  I wish Dr. Mina well with his soon-to-be-born child.  Would it be fair to say that he believes that speed trumps perfection?  One of our fellow Irishmen, Dr. Ryan in the WHO, has always made that point.  Dr. Holohan's point that antigen testing is only 50% accurate has gone into the lexicon.  Dr. Mina has dealt with that very well today.<\/p> <p>  In layman's terms, my understanding is that Covid has a 14-day cycle.  For the first couple of days someone is not that infectious.  There is a peak period in between when the person is highly infectious and in the following days towards the latter end, they are not as infectious.  PCR testing will probably detect the Covid infection throughout that period.  Antigen testing will pick it up when it is at its most infectious.  Therefore, Dr. Mina's thesis is that with antigen testing if it is 50% accurate that means it is picking up the cohort who are most infectious and it is much faster.  His basic point is that an antigen test taken pre-departure is far more effective than a PCR test taken 72 hours prior to arrival.  <\/p> <p>  Dr. Mina had a very interesting exchange with Professor Phillip Nolan who spoke about snake oil regarding antigen testing.  Obviously, we saw the discourse they had on social media.  I ask Dr. Mina to dispel that notion about it being snake oil.  Does he regard antigen testing as complementary to PCR testing?  Does he see it as standing alone?  Does he believe it is more effective than PCR testing?  What role can it play as we move into a world increasingly vaccinated against Covid?  What practical things can we do in Ireland to get PCR testing to play a vital role in the fight against Covid?  If we do not have antigen testing, are we putting the population at greater risk of catching the infection than by having antigen testing?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021060900002#KK00700","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623193200,"counter":743,"content":"<p>One very important point is rarely brought up.  This gets to the question of why speed is so crucial.  For example, PCR tests are used three days before a flight.  When the virus grows in somebody's body everyone will be undetectable for the first couple of days after exposure.  Once they become detectable on either test, usually the PCR is first, the virus will grow from barely anything to 1 million or 1 billion copies within a day.  It grows very fast and that is the nature of exponential growth which is the only way viruses grow inside the body.<\/p> <p>  I bring that up because if somebody uses a PCR test two or three days before a flight and they get a negative result, by the time they walk onto that flight they could literally be at their peak of infection.  They could actually have 1 billion or 1 trillion viral particles in their nose, completely undetected, because they got a test before they were detectable.  The point is that the virus grows extremely quickly in the body.  This is why we get super-spreaders.  Someone at the peak of infectivity could actually be showing their negative PCR test from a swab taken two or three days earlier and walk onto a plane or into an event as a super spreader.  An antigen test right there would detect those people without any problem.  Those are the most important people to detect and have them rapidly removed from circulation.  That is essential.  <\/p> <p>  We then need to ask what is happening with vaccines.  We saw what happened with the New York Yankees players and staff recently, and now we see the CDC back-pedalling.  For about a year, I have tried to warn the CDC about this.  If we start to relax our safeguards because the population is getting vaccinated, PCR testing is so sensitive that if somebody gets exposed, we are very likely to start picking up really low fragments of RNA.<\/p><p>When the viral load is that low, especially in a vaccinated person, it is often the case that the person will not be transmitting.  Some people who have been vaccinated can transmit, and they will be protected on both tests.  We do not want to quarantine people who are no longer transmissible; that is a net negative for public health, and PCR would cause that.<\/p><p> Antigen tests, because of their speed, which I explained, are safer and better when our goal is simply to limit transmission, especially in an acute event such as a flight, and also because they are much more accessible.  They can be used on a more ongoing basis, if needed, over a longer period.  It is much easier to do that than it is with PCR.  Unfortunately, PCR, out the gate with this pandemic, was deemed to be the gold standard.  As a public health test, however, it has few, if any, of the qualities we want in such a test.  Rapid antigen testing, on the other hand, features speed, frequency of testing and many other qualities we would seek in a test that has a purpose of limiting transmission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021060900002#KK00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Michael Mina","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623193200,"counter":745,"content":"<p>Antigen testing could be introduced in Ireland for air travel and sporting and cultural events.

An epidemiological term that most people will have heard by this point is the R nought, or reproductive, number of the virus.  If that can be kept below 1, outbreaks will not take off.  Some people have thought that in order for a test programme to be effective, it needs to stop 100% of transmission, but that is a poor way to examine a population effect.  All we have to do to prevent outbreaks from occurring in a population at large is to ensure that for every ten people who are infected, nine others will go on to be infected from those people, instead of 13.  If the ratio can be kept below 1, outbreaks cannot take off.

It will be a big ask from a compliance point of view for people to get a healthcare professional antigen test a number of days after an event and communicate that result to the event co-ordinator.  When they have it in their house, it is already in their possession and they have paid for it.  It is just asking them to do the swab, interpret the result and upload the photo.

His model was to have people who have travelled from abroad isolate at home with rapid antigen tests being done every second day.  Self-administered antigen tests would cut down on tests considerably compared with monitored tests.  How does that feed into public health concerns?  What do the Department of Health and HSE need to do to properly regulate antigen testing so that it works as an additional aid to public health in Ireland?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021060900002#MM02100","speaker":"1593","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623193200,"counter":779,"content":"<p>The first question is whether a self-administered test works.  The short answer is \"Yes\".  Most of the initial studies that looked at self-administered antigen testing found that the efficacy was a bit lower but that was on the first attempt.  The first time people try to tie their shoes, they do not do it well, but they do it just fine the second time.  It is not different with an antigen test.  It is important to recognise and has been shown here, in Liverpool, and elsewhere, that those early reports that people could not do the test as well was because it was the first time and they were fumbling around trying to figure out what the plastic was.  These are so simple that the second time they used the test, the efficacy shot up.  We can use that knowledge as a test to say that if people need to use a test, maybe they can use it earlier, perhaps two weeks before a flight or event, or they can have a more sophisticated version.<\/p> <p>  There is a middle ground between healthcare-observed testing and completely independent at-home testing.  We have seen that utilised in the United States.  I want to be clear that I have no financial ties to any of the companies that we are talking about.  eMed is doing observed testing on computers using call centre workers rather than healthcare workers.  It allows it to scale to substantial numbers of observed tests.  If people are doing the test for the first time, maybe they can get help through a service such as eMed.  It is simple.  There are solutions to these issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021060900002#NN00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Michael Mina"},{"type":"speech","time":1623193200,"counter":780,"content":"<p>We have discussed using rapid antigen testing over time so that people do not have to quarantine or can self-isolate at home.

Instead if in a quarantine period, people can have a test daily or every other day.  That would be an effective way to stop outbreaks from spreading.  If an outbreak is ongoing in a community, antigen testing can be used across a large swathe of that community.  Our evaluations have shown that that would prevent an outbreak.  Even if cases start to emerge, it would prevent them from causing an outbreak that needs to be addressed.  The ongoing use of testing is an effective tool to limit spread.<\/p> <p>  Regarding regulation, it is important that we evaluate the different tests.  If a Government is going to have a contract with a company, it is important to regulate those tests and understand how they are performing.  Some of the tests that we saw in Taiwan and Korea were not performing well.  Others have performed exceedingly well.  It is important to create a panel with an independent group that is able to evaluate the different tests.  It could be done in one day.  A test could be taken from a company, with a box of 50 of the tests, and an answer could be provided by the end of the day.  It is simple and I am happy to advise on how that could work after the meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021060900002#NN00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Michael Mina"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623193200,"counter":782,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair and the members of the committee for their attention to detail and their courtesy in listening to everything that we said.
