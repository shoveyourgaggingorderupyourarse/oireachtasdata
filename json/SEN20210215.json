The allocation of &euro;9 billion in the budget for education indicated that investment in both children and their education is a strong priority of the Government.  For young people, this has been a really stressful year.  We have had 12 months of a pandemic but young people have been living with it in a different way from adults.  Young people, within their own families, have had to deal with the impact of infection.  More than 200,000 people have been infected.  Young people have had to live with the impact of their parents' loss of income and employment, and they have had to live with changed circumstances whereby they are trying to be educated remotely.  I accept that there has been an improvement in this lockdown by comparison with the previous one in terms of the delivery of remote teaching but remote teaching is no substitute for classroom learning.  The Minister of State would agree with that.  He did very well from the point of view of education.  He is a graduate of Trinity College and he also holds degrees from overseas.  Therefore, he understands the value of education and how important the leaving certificate is for young people.<\/p> <p>The members of the class of 2021 have lost five months of their senior cycle and have been denied the emotional and social supports that come with being in a classroom or in their school.  They have been struggling to connect with broadband.  Broadband is oversubscribed in many households because it is being used by siblings and parents who are trying to work.  Many leaving certificate subjects have a practical component.  Students in the class of 2021 have been denied the opportunity to have a practical learning experience.  It is not just formal teaching they are missing out on; they are also missing out on informal learning from their peers, on the exchange of information, on sharing their struggles and on the identification of interesting parts of the curriculum or things that excite them.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Mary Fitzpatrick:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MaryFitzpatrick&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The mocks have gone, the orals are uncertain and it was devastating for these students to see adults and unions withdraw from talks.

The leaving cert is not an end point; it is a part of their lifelong journey of education.  I spoke to the Minister for Education and she sent her apologies.  She is otherwise engaged but would like to have been here and has asked me to do this.<\/p><p>The Government is acutely aware of the challenges the pandemic has brought to the education system this year and last, particularly the unique challenges it poses to those preparing to sit State examinations.  For leaving cert students, the continued closure of schools for in-school learning results in these students missing out on significant in-person class contact time.  I pay tribute to those students and their teachers, in particular, who are continuing education despite the difficulties.  There has been a huge amount of development in the provision of education, as I see with my own children, between the first stage of this pandemic and now.  It will never be perfect, of course, and that is why we are having this discussion but there have been dramatic changes.  That is to everybody's credit and that of the education system.  <\/p><p>Planning for the 2021 leaving cert is under way by the Department and the State Examinations Commission.  It is recognised that a flexible and agile approach is necessary in light of the fast-moving changes linked to Covid-19 but the welfare of students and their families is front and centre in all decision-making.  The planning work under way is being helped by an advisory group of key stakeholders.  This includes students, most importantly, as well as parents, teachers, school leadership management bodies, the State Examinations Commission, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, the Higher Education Authority and obviously the Department of Education, including the National Educational Psychological Service.  The advisory group has met on a number of occasions and a subgroup has formed to consider in depth the issues towards planning the 2021 exams, including those identified by the Irish Second-Level Students' Union, ISSU, in its recently published report on the 2021 State examinations and the return to school.  I pay tribute to the ISSU for its key and central role in planning and its strength of voice on behalf of its members.<\/p><p>The Department of Education has indicated to the education partners that any corresponding process will need to include a number of features.  The State Examinations Commission has to run the examinations and corresponding processes.  This was an issue last year and the Department wants to address that.  There needs to be better provision for out-of-school learners in the corresponding process, which we also saw last year.  There must be some cognisance of performance and additional component elements of exams, such as course work, orals, practicals, etc., and timely progression to higher and further education using either exams or the outcome of any corresponding process.<\/p><p>Bilateral meetings began and continued last week and the weekend gone by and discussions continue today.  In other jurisdictions where State exams have been cancelled, I understand there is further work to be done to clarify what is intended.  This is natural because we are in an unprecedented situation.  In England, for example, a consultation process on possible arrangements closed on 29 January and feedback from that is being considered.  Ofqual in England has stated there are no straightforward options for how exams are to be replaced and we can all agree on that.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Thomas Byrne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2203\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2203&amp;amp;pid=ThomasByrne&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The best we can do is to work together and all of us talk to ensure we get the best possible solution for our students.  The Government, of course, is focused on identifying a solution for the students who are due to sit the leaving certificate this year, including the applied leaving certificate.  The priority afforded to education by the Government has been clear throughout, with the Minister and officials working with the partners to reopen schools safely and identify the best way forward for the leaving certificate class of 2021.<\/p><p>As Senators will be aware, one of the partners withdrew from the process last week.  Following engagements with the Association of Secondary Teachers Ireland, ASTI, however, the Minister for Education is very happy that it returned to discussions over the weekend.  I believe everybody will welcome that.  The Minister publicly welcomed it and the ASTI has returned now to confidential discussions with everybody else regarding the 2021 exams.  We note its willingness to engage on the agenda that has already been set out on this process.<\/p><p>The Minister has also thanked the Teachers Union of Ireland, TUI, parent bodies, the student body represented by the ISSU, as I have said already, and the managerial bodies that help run our schools for their constructive engagement. That continued over the weekend and is resuming this morning as the issues continue to be worked out.  Intensive engagement is therefore continuing with the education stakeholders to advance progress and provide certainty and clarity at the earliest possible time.  I understand from the Minister that it is hoped students will receive this clarity in the coming days.  That, however, is subject to ongoing engagement with all the education stakeholders.  I note the comments made by the Senator about the junior certificate.  I believe the Minister will address that issue in due course but I do not have an answer for the Senator on it today.  I believe that, clearly, we all agree the leaving certificate is the critical issue today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021021500002#C00200","speaker":"1503","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1613385000,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

Certainly, the big difference now from then, and probably more recently, is that the voice of the student is at the table.  It is not just at the table but also in the public realm and in the media and it is taken seriously.  That is a major change.  I compliment the ISSU on the work it is doing because up until now, when there was an education issue, the teachers' trade unions rightly took centre stage.  I have no doubt that will always be the case because they are key partners in education.  Now, however, more and more, and we saw it last year and this year, the voice of the student through the ISSU is prominent in the public media and private discussions and, ultimately, in what will be the solution to this.  I compliment it and encourage all students to support that organisation and get involved.

I also agree with the comments of Senator Fitzpatrick.<\/p> <p>I am jointly raising an issue with Senator Ward because, as legislators in a democracy, we should stand up for legislators in other democracies when they are faced with unfair threats.  I wish the Minister of State a happy Chinese new year and want to stress that in bringing forward this joint Commencement matter, we want to see greater trade, cultural and educational links with China.  However, we have serious concerns about the aggressive and repressive manner in which the Chinese Communist Party is currently expressing its economic and political ambition.  We have talked in this House previously about the Uyghur people, Tibet, the Falun Gong and other minorities.<\/p> <p>What we are seeing in Hong Kong is a suppression of the protests.  However, the introduction of the national security law is a very draconian measure that completely undermines the rule of law that we would expect to see in any democracy.  It engages in media censorship and does not allow dissenting views.  It represents a major threat to democratic principles.  We have seen the arrest and imprisonment of legislators, business people, journalists and of university and school students.  Many of them are either living in fear in Hong Kong or are forced to seek exile.<\/p> <p>I ask the Minister of State for a clear statement on this.  I ask also that the Government adopts a welcoming approach to those who, for a variety of reasons, may have to come here to seek asylum and who may require visas and that it takes the issue up with the Chinese Ambassador.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021021500002#E00300","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"speech","time":1613385000,"counter":21,"content":"<p>Gabhaim comhghairdeas leis an gCathaoirleach Gn&iacute;omhach as ucht a bheith sa Chathaoir inniu.  I echo what Senator Byrne said.  It is very important that we differentiate between the people of China and the Government of China.  <\/p> <p>What has been outlined in the matter is, in many ways, anathema to us in Ireland.  We benefit from a very democratic society, one where people have free speech, the right to raise issues and to criticise their Government.  They certainly avail of that opportunity as they should.  When we look to China, and to Hong Kong in recent times, people simply do not have that opportunity.  They are suppressed, oppressed and prevented from exercising their democratic rights and their right to free speech.  This is a major problem.<\/p> <p>This is not being done by Chinese people but by their Government which does not necessarily act in their name the way our Government acts in ours.  However, as we look at this situation now, Ireland is in a unique position, diplomatically and internationally, both as a member of the Security Council and as a State that does not directly compete with China in terms of military issues or industry.  We are not a threat to China.  There is an opportunity for the Minister of State and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Simon Coveney, and for other members of the Government to speak to China at a certain level and as friends, but also to be very clear about what cannot be tolerated on the international stage.<\/p> <p>If China wants to continue to be part of the international community, it must respect the norms of human rights and democracy that it claims to have but simply does not exercise on a day-to-day basis.  That is a message that we need to send very clearly as a country and as a Government to the Chinese Government and particularly the authorities in Hong Kong as regards the manner in which they approach their own citizenry and the rights of those citizens.  Like Senator Byrne, I would like a very clear statement from the Government that we cannot accept this, we do not accept this and we will not stand by.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021021500002#E00400","speaker":"1685"},{"type":"speech","time":1613385000,"counter":22,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis na Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; a chur an t-&aacute;bhar seo faoin&aacute;r mbr&aacute;id ar maidin.

These charges were made in relation to the holding of primary elections to select pro-democracy candidates for the next legislative council elections.  <\/p><p>In response, the EU made a statement on 7 January calling for the immediate release of those arrested and urged the authorities to respect Hong Kong's rule of law, human rights, democratic principles and its high degree of autonomy under the one country two systems principle, as enshrined in the Hong Kong basic law and in line with domestic and international obligations.  All but three of those detained have since been released.<\/p><p>Ireland and the EU have been active in raising concerns about the law and have issued a number of statements which outlined our concern regarding the situation.  We call on China to respect its international commitments and the high degree of autonomy granted to Hong Kong under the one country, two systems principle.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, made a statement on 1 July last year to express concern at the adoption of the law and to reiterate Ireland's full support for fundamental freedoms in Hong Kong, such as freedom of expression and the right to peaceful assembly.  <\/p><p>On 28 July, the EU adopted Council conclusions expressing grave concern over the national security legislation for Hong Kong.  These conclusions restated the EU's support for Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy.  We expressed our solidarity with the people of Hong Kong and set out a package of measures in various fields, including asylum, migration, visa and residence policy, controls on the exports of specific sensitive equipment and technologies for end-use in Hong Kong, the operation of member states' extradition arrangements and other relevant agreements with Hong Kong.<\/p><p>In line with these conclusions, the Government agreed, on 13 October 2020, to suspend Ireland's extradition agreement with Hong Kong.  This decision, taken in concert with a number of other EU member states, clearly signalled Ireland's concern for the rule of law in Hong Kong.

Project Ireland 2040 aims to make cities, towns and villages more attractive and liveable and offer a quality of life, which more people will be willing to choose in the years ahead.  It references reversing town-village and rural population decline by encouraging new roles and functions for buildings, streets and sites supporting the sustainable growth of rural economies and communities.  This project aims to address these and numerous other objectives by ensuring the reimagining of the existing community centre to deliver an expanded role within the community of Drumlish, allowing the local people to live and work locally while encouraging climate adaption.  The core objective of this is to create a flagship project by developing Drumlish into a competitive, low-carbon climate resilient and environmentally sustainable town through the redevelopment of the centre as a flagship green-energy building.  The building will also be used to showcase low-energy technologies and act as a training centre, which will be open to communities throughout the midlands, on reducing energy consumption in association with Longford warmer homes, among others.<\/p> <p>Significant consultation took place over the last number of years, which started with the establishment of the town team by my colleague, Councillor Paraic Brady, which led to the formation of the area development group.  The redevelopment of the centre emerged as a key priority along with the need to create economic opportunities for the local community, such as providing a remote working space and opportunities for innovation and collaboration.  The town has experienced significant population increases in recent years.  There was a 58% increase between 2006 and 2016.  However, the supporting infrastructure to facilitating the retention of employment in the area has not followed.  This project is expected to bring five direct jobs in the development and management of the centre, as well as space for five dedicated remote working places, additional meeting and training facilities and increased usability for music, dance and art.  The centre is located next door to the local national school, St. Mary's, which utilises its facilities.  Mulleady's waste and recycling centre is located two miles from the town and will collaborate with promoters, which include Longford County Council, Drumlish Community Centre Group, the Drumlish-Ballinamuck Area Development Group, and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, to deliver greater sustainable community goals.  This will be done by working together to develop school education programmes, information awareness, workshops and practical demonstrations.<\/p> <p>This project plans to support the community's transition to a low-carbon society by creating a new vision for Drumlish.  This application aligns with national, regional and local policy, and fully delivers on the policy priorities of the current funding call of economic development and addressing climate change.  It will be transformational, not only for Drumlish, but for the wider county of Longford and, indeed, parts of Cavan and Leitrim.  I ask the Minister of State to ensure that this project is made a priority for Government funding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021021500002#G00100","speaker":"1639"},{"type":"speech","time":1613385000,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021021500002#G00200","speaker":"1686"},{"type":"speech","time":1613385000,"counter":31,"content":"<p>The rural regeneration and development fund was established under the National Development Plan 2018-2027 to provide investment for ambitious projects in towns and villages, and outlying areas, with a population of less than 10,000, which will deliver on the national strategic objective of strengthening rural economies and communities, and which achieve sustainable economic and social development in these areas.  To date, the fund has provided &euro;166 million for 139 projects across Ireland, worth a total of &euro;237 million.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Peter Burke:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2457\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2457&amp;amp;pid=PeterBurke&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Projects that have been allocated funding to date include town and village regeneration; enterprise and development; tourism and development; digital and co-working initiatives; libraries; and community facilities.  Many projects are delivering across a number of sectors, for instance, providing libraries, co-working facilities or much-needed community facilities in repurposed town centre sites or previously unused heritage buildings.  To date, over half of the projects supported have had a strong focus on regeneration, ensuring that our rural towns and villages, and the communities and businesses within them, will benefit from returning footfall.<\/p><p>In that regard, the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and I believe the projects completed with the assistance of the fund will deliver significant impacts across rural Ireland, supporting sustainable communities, economic development and job creation that will help to deliver on the long-standing goal of rebalancing growth throughout the regions.  In addition, the investment provided will support rural Ireland in addressing the challenges arising from Covid-19.  It will provide a much-needed stimulus for the economy in rural areas, while also putting in place the necessary facilities to ensure rural towns, villages and communities can have the opportunity to recover and prosper over the months and years ahead.<\/p><p>As Senators will be aware, the third call for category 1 applications to the fund closed on 1 December.  Category 1 relates to large-scale ambitious capital projects with all necessary planning and other consents in place and ready to proceed.  Considering the circumstances prevailing, this category 1 call had a strong economic focus, with one of the main goals being to ensure the investment provided can act as a key driver for economic recovery in the post Covid-19 environment.  Another key focus was, once again, regeneration in towns and villages, with a view to driving greater economic activity and footfall, addressing dereliction and ensuring the reuse of buildings.<\/p><p>The response from rural Ireland was excellent.  Some 66 applications were received in response to this call from communities throughout the country, including Drumlish, as Senator Carrigy noted.  All the proposals have been planned and developed to meet the key needs, opportunities and expectations of their respective communities.  As Senator Carrigy will also be aware, the application process for the fund is competitive in nature.  The applications submitted in December are being assessed by the project advisory board, comprised of independent experts and representatives from key Departments.  I understand that arising from this process, the Minister will be furnished with a report detailing the projects which are recommended for funding.  She will make the final decisions in that regard at that juncture.  The Minister hopes to make an announcement to this effect at the end of March or the beginning of April.  I will convey the Senator's views on Drumlish to her.  I know it is a good project and  Councillor Paraic Brady and Senator Carrigy are doing huge work in articulating its merits for the community.  As the Senator has pointed out, it knits into St. Mary's Mixed National School and the wider area.

I am sure that the Minister of State is in no doubt as to the frustration among councillors regarding their pay and conditions and that he does not need reminding of the clear and unambiguous commitment in the programme for Government on the implementation of the Moorhead report within one year of the Government's formation.  We find ourselves just under 18 weeks out from the first anniversary of that formation but we still have zero inkling as to what the Government intends.  We have word that there is a report, produced by the Minister of State, sitting on the desk of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, but we have not seen it and we have no idea what the Cabinet intends to do with it.  That is not good enough because this is not just about the pay and conditions of councillors, who have had to put up with lip-service being paid in respect of this issue for many years.  Rather, it is not good enough because this is about respect for the important role that councillors undertake in policy making, advocacy and representation in their communities.  It is about affording dignity to those who serve their communities.  As a newly elected councillor, something that made an impression on me was a former lord mayor of Dublin racing out at the end of a meeting to go to a job in an An Post sorting office over Christmas because of a need to supplement that person's income as a councillor.<\/p> <p>This is about ensuring that we attract those who want to serve their communities and, importantly, retain them when they become elected.  We know that, if we are to improve the gender balance in local authorities and the Oireachtas, we must crack the nut of attracting more women to contest local elections.  We can then ensure a greater gender balance.  This is also about recognising that local government is the backbone of services across our communities.<\/p> <p>The Moorhead report makes ten recommendations.  All of them are important, but there are four that are within the Government's remit to enact.  These relate to salary, travel and subsistence expenses in the course of a councillor's work, travel and subsistence expenses in the course of attendance at external meetings, and retirement benefits.  With respect, I do not want to hear from the Minister of State about the work that is being done on the six other recommendations, which relate to flexibility in holding meetings, administrative support and other supports to councillors.  At this point, that work should be undertaken within local authorities anyway.  If we do not resolve the issue of pay and conditions, we will not resolve the six other conditions.  If we do resolve it, though, we will ensure that councillors can pay for childcare, are not racing out the door to try to attend other meetings and can actually depend on their incomes as councillors.<\/p> <p>I am conscious that there is not unanimity on the precise recommendations in the Moorhead report, particularly the recommended income level, but that is no reason to delay what the Government intends to do.  The Government has a mandate in the programme for Government.  I look forward to the Minister of State's reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021021500002#J00300","speaker":"1683"},{"type":"speech","time":1613385000,"counter":38,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising the important matter of the role and remuneration of elected local authority members.  She gave the example of a councillor who was working while also trying to hold down a council role.  I, too, was that councillor.  In 2009, I was elected to a council alongside Senator Davitt, who has also been active in the issue of reforming local government.  I went through the pressures and experiences of trying to attend to my council duties while also holding down a full-time job.

Councillors are responsible for a wide range of important functions, particularly with regard to statutory policymaking, strategic development, governance of local authorities, leadership and local advocacy, which is key.<\/p><p>As Senators are aware, Ms Sarah Moorhead, senior counsel, was appointed in June 2018 to carry out an independent review to examine the remuneration of councillors.  During the course of her review, Ms Moorhead consulted widely with local authority elected members and their representative organisations, political parties, local authority chief executives and other stakeholders.  Local authority members were also surveyed and detailed financial information regarding councillors' remuneration and role was sourced from all local authorities.  Ms Moorhead's final report was submitted to the Government and then published on Friday, 19 June 2020.  It was also circulated to all councillors and Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  As the Senator mentioned, the programme for Government, Our Shared Future, has a commitment to implement the Moorhead report on the role and remuneration of local authority members within 12 months.  Meeting this commitment is a priority for me and the Department.<\/p><p>Further engagement and input from elected members and their representative associations are taking place during the implementation process.  In this context, I have met local authority and elected members' representative associations over the months since my appointment.  On more than one occasion, I have listened to their viewpoints on the report.  They have welcomed some aspects of the report and rejected others, offering alternative proposals.  Implementing the Moorhead report can mean many things to many people.  It is important their concerns are given proper consideration.  This important engagement was very welcome and I appreciate the role of elected members in it.<\/p><p>Any changes to elected members' remuneration will require regulations under section 142 of the Local Government Act 2001, as amended, which must be given effect with consent by my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath.  Proposals in this regard have been provided to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform for his consideration and will be brought to the Government thereafter.<\/p><p>In addition to this, a working group has been established to examine the important non-pay recommendations contained in the Moorhead report and how these will be progressed in consultation with key stakeholders over a number of meetings through the working group.  These stakeholders include representatives from the County and City Management Association, the Association of Irish Local Government, the Local Authority Members Association and a number of Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage officials.  If needed, throughout the process other stakeholders or officials will be invited to contribute to the working group.  The objective of the working group is to examine these recommendations and explore options to allow for their implementation at the earliest opportunity.  The first meeting of the working group took place recently and the outcome of the group will devise a plan of action setting the key and valuable outcomes we need in this area.  The proposed completion date for the said action plan is the second quarter of 2021.<\/p><p>It is believed that addressing pay and non-pay issues of extreme importance, such as examining possible efficiencies, meetings, training supports and technological developments, would provide for a better balance between the role of councillors and their personal lives, thus facilitating the retention of existing councillors while maximising the accessibility of local government and future candidates.  This is key and one of my strong views is that a council chamber should be reflective of society and a microcosm of society at large.  We want to try to work to achieve this.

I want the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media to report on what stipulations have been made on the Airbnb website regarding the regulations that pertain to level 5 restrictions.  This is a very serious issue.  Obviously the Covid-19 crisis has afflicted this country for the last 11 months.  It is a very significant issue that has had a major impact on many parts of society.  We are now in the middle of level 5 restrictions that have meant a complete lockdown of society, including schools and the construction sector.  Every part of society has been grossly affected.<\/p> <p>On my way here from Cork today I was stopped twice by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which I view as very positive.  I complimented both of them on the courtesy and kindness they showed to me.  The big issue in my part of the world is the blatant breaches of the level 5 restrictions.  There is a phenomenon of weekend house parties where houses are being rented in scenic parts of rural Ireland and people have drinking parties for two nights.  A few weeks ago, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na discovered seven people from seven different households in one house in Kinsale.  That is the kind of scenario that is happening in rural Ireland and society.<\/p> <p>When I looked up the Airbnb website this morning, I saw that there are over 200 properties available to rent tonight in Cork and thousands of properties available to rent throughout Ireland.  Such properties are not for essential workers or people who have to go to work.  They are for leisure only.  The restrictions that are applied to other operators are not being enforced by the Airbnb website and we have a major issue with the lack of enforcement.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na cannot go door to door and it is unfeasible to think that would be an appropriate way to deal with this.  We need real regulation to be put in place so that this job can be done.  Unfortunately, such regulation is not there at the moment.<\/p> <p>When I contacted my local authority, which is supposed to be the regulator for Airbnb properties inside a rent pressure zone, it informed me that it does not have a complete list of all such properties in the county because such a list has not been furnished to it by Airbnb.  This is what we are dealing with.  It is totally appalling that we have an unregulated market that flies in the face of what we are all doing in level 5.  We need to know exactly what the Government proposes to do about this blatant breach of level 5 restrictions.  The general public have done so much in the last few weeks and have worked so hard to bring this virus under control.  It is the minority, and only the minority, who breach the restrictions but we need strong regulations to be enforced to ensure the minority do not breach the restrictions.<\/p> <p>I need to know the following.

Undoubtedly, he has raised an important issue.<\/p> <p>On level 5 restrictions, under Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with COVID-19, the Government has agreed that the current public health restrictions will remain in place until 5 March 2021.  This decision has been informed by the latest public health advice applying in the context of the current prevalence and the projected trajectory of the virus.  Level 5 essentially means a complete halt to tourism.  Paid accommodation services are only allowed to take guests travelling for permitted purposes, but not for social, recreational, cultural or tourism purposes, as the Senator said.  In addition, the Garda Commissioner was very clear on last Friday's \"The Late, Late Show\" that anybody in breach of many of the restrictions is running the risk of acquiring a criminal record.  That is how serious this is and how seriously we must take this pandemic.<\/p> <p>Airbnb is one of a number of online accommodation sales platforms and contains a variety of accommodation types, including not only self-catering properties but also bed and breakfast accommodation, hotels, guest-houses and more.  While neither the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media nor F&aring;ilte Ireland has any role in the regulation of these online sales platforms, accommodation providers offering services, online and otherwise, must abide by the Covid-19 regulations in place.  The regulations set out the legal requirements, including provisions, prohibitions and restrictions, for businesses operating in this jurisdiction, whether in the tourism or any other sector, and the rules in regard to travel from place of residence.  Neither the Department nor F&aacute;ilte Ireland imposes any additional requirements over and above these regulations.  However, to assist tourism businesses reopen and operate safely in the current climate, F&aring;ilte Ireland has published a suite of sectoral guidelines for various strands of the overall tourism sector.  These guidelines are designed to assist tourism businesses meet requirements in line with the plan for living with Covid-19, the working safely protocol and the latest Government public health advice.  For the types of accommodation businesses using the Airbnb platform, the most relevant of these guidelines are probably those for self-catering properties, bed and breakfast accommodation, hotels and guest-houses.<\/p> <p>In terms of monitoring and enforcing compliance with Covid-19 related regulations, I am aware that all relevant agencies with industry oversight and a relevant regulatory role are playing a part.  In this regard, the regulators forum, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach and including representatives from all key Departments, agencies and other bodies such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, is proving to be effective in dealing with any reports of non-compliant events and activities, through the relevant authorities.  Although we have seen a welcome reduction in Covid-19 cases recently, the overall number of cases and, significantly, the numbers of those in hospital and ICU are still too high.  For this reason, we must continue with all efforts to bring the virus under control by limiting mobility, social contacts and congregation as much as possible.  I acknowledge that maintaining level 5 restrictions will place continued demands on society and business.  Nonetheless, it is essential that we continue to hold firm and reduce cases in order to protect the vulnerable, protect our healthcare services, including maintaining non-Covid healthcare, and reopen schools at the earliest opportunity, which is a high priority.<\/p> <p>I thank Senator Lombard for his contribution.  We are under no illusions about the scale of the challenge and the many competing priorities facing the Government.

It is the second time I have brought it up in the Seanad.  It concerns the need for the expansion of the supports for homeowners whose dwellings are affected by pyrite.  The Minister of State is well aware that the pyrite remediation scheme eligibility conditions, specifically the construction date, limits the remediations to dwellings built after 1997 and before 2014.  I have been corresponding recently with the Pyrite Resolution Board over a particular couple and it told me that the reason for these dates was because the earliest identified cases related to 1997, hence a reference to the dwellings constructed thereafter when the eligibility for the pyrite scheme was first established.  While that might have been the case during the development of the pyrite panel in 2012, homeowners of dwellings built prior to 1997 are now noticing serious pyritic heave, and the associated damages that go along with it, to their homes.  While they fit nearly all the other eligibility criteria the construction date restriction is making sure that they cannot get access to this scheme.<\/p> <p>I recently moved to the constituency of Dublin Fingal.  I have had a number of families from Lusk and Rush contact me, including one particular family.  There should not be a hierarchy but the situation for this family is heartbreaking because they are an elderly retired couple.  They are deeply frustrated and upset.  I would go so far as to tell the Minister of State that their mental health is being seriously damaged because they see no resolution or way out and that the entire process is affecting them in a serious way.  They became so concerned that their house, which was constructed in 1990, was beginning to crumble around them that they commissioned their own chartered engineer's report to do a full investigation.  It included all block testing and analysis.  The findings noted that the blockwork used in the construction of the house contained the deleterious material pyrite and it caused an eventual gradual breakdown and a total loss to their structural integrity.<\/p> <p>I note the Department last year launched the new defective concrete blocks grant scheme for Mayo and Donegal.  That scheme might be relevant now in north County Dublin and the houses in Fingal because if a home is so badly affected by either pyrite or defective blocks the construction date should not be the limiting factor.  I understand and respect why that was the case in 2012 when we were in the onslaught of what was brand new to us at that stage and for this particular generation but as the Minister of State is well aware, as politicians we have all seen the deep distress people living with pyrite are under.  In the area where I live I have been lucky enough to see the relief when a house is finally remediated.  It is life-changing.  It is a moment when one finally gets one's keys back and can return to being a happy homeowner as opposed to the shadow of the people who are living under mental stress every day.  As far as they are concerned the only hope for them is if the State steps in because at this stage of their lives they certainly could not afford to remediate or even take out a loan to remediate their own homes.<\/p> <p>I do not know whether the solution is to amend the pyrite remediation scheme or to include these in the other scheme.  This issue is not unique to north County Dublin.  There are probably houses in every county that have the same issue.  Hundreds of people are excluded from both these schemes that have made such an impact and a difference to the lives of those who have benefited from them.  I ask the Minister of State to request the extension of either the pyrite remediation scheme or the defective concrete blocks grant scheme.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Regina Doherty:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This will allow those people with houses built prior to 1997 to access the supports they need to fix their homes and continue to live in them without the fear of them collapsing around them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021021500002#N00300","speaker":"1653","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1613385000,"counter":57,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this matter on behalf of her constituents and I fully understand how stressful this can be for families caught up in it.<\/p><p>Budget 2021 provides funding of &euro;40 million for the operation of the pyrite remediation scheme and the defective concrete blocks grant scheme.  As set out in the Programme for Government: Our Shared Future, the remediation of dwellings affected by reactive pyrite in hardcore and defective concrete blocks is a priority to ensure people can remain living in their homes.  The Pyrite Resolution Act 2013 provides the statutory framework for the establishment of the pyrite resolution board and for the making of a pyrite remediation scheme to be implemented by the board with support from the Housing Agency.  The provisions of the Act apply only to dwellings affected by significant damage attributable to pyritic heave consequent on the presence of reactive pyrite in the subfloor hardcore material and not to damage arising in any other circumstance, such as pyrite in concrete blocks.<\/p><p>The pyrite remediation scheme is a scheme of &quot;last resort&quot; for affected homeowners who have no other practical option to obtain redress and is limited in its application and scope. The full conditions for eligibility under the scheme are set out in the scheme, which is available on the board's website,<i>www.pyriteboard.ie<\/i>.  The scheme is applicable to dwellings that are subject to significant damage attributable to pyritic heave, established in accordance with SI 398-1:2017 reactive pyrite in subfloor hardcore material, part 1: testing and categorisation protocol.  In this regard, it is a condition of eligibility under the scheme that an application to the board must be accompanied by a building condition assessment with a damage condition rating of 2.  Dwellings which do not have a damage condition rating of 2 are not eligible to apply under the scheme.  This ensures that, having regard to the available resources, the focus of the scheme is on dwellings most severely damaged by pyritic heave.<\/p><p>As matters currently stand, the owners of dwellings located within the counties of Kildare, Meath or Offaly or the administrative areas of Fingal County Council, Dublin City Council, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, South Dublin County Council or Limerick City and County Council are eligible to apply for remediation works under the scheme.  The scheme is primarily based on the information that was available to the board at the time of its adoption in February 2014 and having regard to the detail set out in the report of the pyrite panel from July 2012.  The panel undertook a desktop study in conjunction with a stakeholder consultation to establish certain facts relating to the potential exposure of pyrite in dwellings.  The information was gathered from a number of sources, including local authorities, structural guarantee providers, representatives of homeowners, private builders, construction professionals and public representatives and was cross-referenced to verify, as far as practicable, its validity.<\/p><p>There is no time limit on when cases must present but the scheme stipulates that the dwelling must have been constructed and completed between 1 January 1997 and 12 December 2013.  This is consistent with the pyrite panel's findings in regard to the years of dwelling registration for which pyrite-related claims were made.  It is important to note that any proposal to amend the scheme is, in the first instance, a matter for the pyrite resolution board and any such proposal would require detailed consideration of the evidence.<\/p><p>In addition, the board may also make such further inquiries as it considers necessary in order to assist it in considering the matter.  The board may be contacted directly by telephone or email about this, including through the Oireachtas information line.  The Minister will consider any amendments or extensions which the pyrite resolution board considers are required to the scheme once submitted in accordance with the requirements of the Act.  The Minister fully intends to engage with all eligible homeowners of dwellings affected by significant damage attributable to pyritic heave who can have their homes remediated under the scheme. The Senator has articulated the points very well and it is a matter the Minister is prepared to look at.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021021500002#O00200","speaker":"1595"},{"type":"speech","time":1613385000,"counter":58,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply and I have much hope from the fact that the necessary amendments will be considered.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Regina Doherty:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The defective concrete blocks grant scheme must be extended, beyond the two counties for which it was established, to Dublin Fingal and indeed probably other areas.

They do not even have the ability to borrow money because of their age.  We must step in as a State to recognise that there are families who are living in extreme distress because of this issue.  I understand that when the criteria were established, a major catastrophe had occurred in Westmeath, Meath and Dublin, and in areas where there had been an onslaught of development in the early 2000s and where that development was being affected by pyrite heave in the product from certain quarries at that time.

This may seem like an insignificant news story to some, but I reiterate how important this is for a county such as Mayo.  I wish to highlight two projects in particular.  The first is the allocation of over &euro;850,000 to the R312.  For those not familiar with this road, it is the road connecting Belmullet to Castlebar town.  It is the road that that community and people on the peninsula use to access Mayo General Hospital.  People have been campaigning for improvements to the road for more than 20 years.  This is a really important funding announcement for the community, and I cannot overstate how happy people are to see that amount of money going into that roads project.  Second is the R332, which is the road from Kilmaine to Tuam.  Again, for the information of those not familiar with the road, since the opening of the new M17 motorway, this is the route that people in south Mayo now use to access the motorway to get to Dublin and other parts of the country.  It is a small regional road that has not been fit to take the capacity that has been on it for the past two years.  Again, it is a really welcome announcement for south Mayo and the surrounding area.  I also welcome the &euro;69,000 for roads in the town of Killala.

It is due to close this Friday, 19 February.  The date was extended.  This is an opportunity for citizens right across the country to have their say in the national development plan and how we plan, fund and spend our resources across every strand of Irish life, from housing to education, roads, infrastructure, communications and local amenities.  Since the onset of the pandemic, we have had a huge shift in working life and the use of public spaces and local amenities.

Many such workers have level 7 and 8 qualifications and are earning minimum wage or just above it.  That needs to change.

Last week, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, called me about this motion and requested that, because the matter was at a delicate stage of negotiation, I not have the House debate this matter in case it might set that process back.  I regard any request of that kind by a Minister very seriously and not as one to be lightly disregarded.<\/p><p>I have been involved in attempting to have Mr. O'Halloran's fate and the cruel treatment of him dealt with since last year.  I told the Minister I would consult Mr. O'Halloran's family about his request and that he could help by indicating the detail of what steps his Department was taking.  Years ago, the former Secretary General at the Department of the Taoiseach, Mr. P&aacute;draig &Oacute; hUiginn, said to me somewhat cynically that there were three stages for Iveagh House in any matter: the stage at which it was premature to do anything, the stage at which at it was too sensitive and the stage at which it was too late.

When this phase of lockdown was announced after Christmas, the Labour Party called for a monthly stay-at-home allowance to be targeted at our most vulnerable students, that is, those who receive the back to school clothing and footwear allowance, to allow families to cover the cost of additional outlays resulting from keeping children at home during the coldest months of the year.  Many of these families do not have access to broadband and so rely on data for remote learning.  Data are needed for them to access schoolwork, and there is also the cost of heating the home and the cost of feeding children at home.<\/p> <p>According to a report from the Institute for Fiscal Studies, IFS, in the UK, if schools do not go back until after Easter, children will have lost around two thirds of the normal school year, and the impact this has on those children in the UK can be replicated across Ireland.  The IFS says it will have a negative impact on all children but will have a catastrophic effect on the most vulnerable and most disadvantaged children.  The IFS report refers to the long-term effect this will have on this cohort of children.  It is likely to lead to a loss of earnings over their lifetime as children do not have the digital or home infrastructure to effectively learn remotely.  While this is likely to be neutralised among children from higher socio-economic backgrounds, children from lower socio-economic backgrounds will lose up to Stg&pound;40,000 over their lifetime.<\/p> <p>That is why the Labour Party has again focused in on this cohort of children and called for a &euro;1 million catch-up for children scheme to make up for lost school days and related activities.

Up to recently, the priority has been cars and it is a case of letting the cars go through the towns, but we forget that people live in these places, and elderly people and children want to be able to walk and cycle, and move around their towns and villages safely, which many people noticed during the first lockdown.<\/p> <p>It is good to see there is funding for cycle signs because we have a new minimum passing distance that we need to remember, as car drivers, myself included, even though I cycle as well.

Maybe we will have to stop calling them that and call them engineers for the people because we do not merely have to think about roads but about how people move.  As well as a crisis of air pollution, there is one in mental health and in disconnection in society.  The car has played a big part in that.  When one gets into a car, one moves in a metal box, detached from everyone else whereas those who are able to walk and cycle safely around where they live can meet their neighbours more.  No man or woman is an island.  The slower we move, the more connected we become with society and the people around us.  If I am in bad form and having a bad day, I only have to meet a person or two and I will be in better form.

The Seanad affords the opportunity to cut through some of the spin and some of the more misleading statements on the albeit imperfect protocol and the teething problems that many businesses have faced.  It is a seismic change in the life of this island and between these islands and continental Europe, so of course there will be problems.<\/p> <p>I do not want to rehash our united opposition to Brexit and all our unified warning calls on the dangers Brexit presents to us, but it is important for us to remember and articulate that there are opportunities for businesses as a result of the protections afforded to Ireland, North and South, as a result of the protocol that was arduously negotiated over a period of more than four years.  We need to refocus our efforts to identifying the opportunities and supporting businesses in helping them reorient and develop their supply chains across the entire island.<\/p> <p>There are other issues of concern beyond the macro issues around trade.

The legislation, the Public Health (Alcohol) Act, was praised by international policy experts as being model legislation that was well structured and evidence based.  One of its main provisions was minimum unit pricing, which is a targeted measure designed to reduce alcohol consumption.  It would enforce a set cost below which alcohol cannot be sold.  This is not the case currently.  It would mainly affect the price of very cheap drinks and alcoholic drinks with a very high alcohol content.  However, it has not yet been implemented in Ireland.<\/p> <p>There are compelling international data indicating that pricing is one of the most effective ways to reduce excessive alcohol consumption and tackle alcohol-related harm, especially in the home.  We can see this in Scotland, where in the two years in which minimum unit pricing has been in place, the rate of consumption has been at its lowest in 25 years.  More important, the number of hospital admissions for liver disease among the lowest income groups has been significantly reduced.  I recognise that the programme for Government pledges to introduce minimum unit pricing simultaneously with the North.  I appreciate the logic behind that considering the potential for the retail sector to be impacted by cross-Border shopping.  Northern Ireland's Minister for Health, Mr. Robin Swann, is developing a substance misuse strategy, but it has been delayed by the pandemic.  After the strategy has been finalised, the intention is to have public consultation on minimum unit pricing.  This suggests it could take well over two years before Northern Ireland is in a position to introduce minimum unit pricing.  I do not believe under any circumstances that we can afford to wait that long to introduce this measure given the impact alcohol is currently having.  I ask that the Minister of State responsible for public health be invited to this House to debate the issue at his earliest convenience.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021021500002#Y00100","speaker":"1646"},{"type":"speech","time":1613385000,"counter":74,"content":"<p>I support Senator Crowe on minimum unit pricing.

There was an allocation of &euro;5 million, in two funding rounds, to support Covid coverage but the print media have got no assistance at all.  In County Mayo, there are four print media, namely,<i>The Connaught Telegraph<\/i>, <i>The Mayo News<\/i>, <i>Western People<\/i>and the <i>Mayo Advertiser<\/i>.  They are embedded in their communities.  In a time when fake news is rife throughout the world, local communities depend greatly on the local media.  They bring balance to media.  We can depend on them to bring the right message, and people depend on them in that regard.  It is important, therefore, that they survive.  Sixteen local newspapers have closed since 2010.  The local newspaper employment level is now 50% of that in 2000.  Advertising revenue for 2020 reduced by 22%, and this year, 2021, has seen an even greater fall.

HAP does not offer security of tenure or help people in need of long-term housing and HAP limits are not in line with market rents.  HAP rates are particularly low for single people and this has long been raised as an issue.  It is near impossible to rent a property within the HAP limits as a single person in this State.  The problem is bad across the country, but Dublin has been especially impacted.  For example, in South Dublin County Council, there are 2,888 people on HAP and that figure does not include those on homeless HAP.  Of those 2,888 people, nearly 17% are in receipt of a discretionary top-up and of those, 46% are in receipt of the maximum top-up of 20%.

Many go to hospital to have their babies with the intention of breastfeeding but find that they do not get support.

We are told it is acceptable to travel in circumstances where that travel is for essential purposes.  Again, I have no difficulty with this.<\/p> <p>The difficulty arises in the definition of what are essential purposes for travel.  I have been contacted by councillors and their constituents regarding whether a particular scenario constitutes essential travel.  I have no guidance as to what essential travel means.  To give an example, I was contacted by a young man who is married to a South Korean national.  They are expecting their first child around St. Patrick's Day.  She returned to Korea before Christmas as they have planned to have the baby there, near her family supports.  He was due to travel to South Korea at the end of this month to be with her for the birth of their first child.  I believe this is essential but I cannot advise him that it is because there is no central reference point for me to find out what constitutes essential travel.<\/p> <p>I would like us to establish an authority or reference point for elected representatives or members of the public to check or verify what exactly constitutes essential travel, instead of having a situation where people have to book flights and then rely on the whim of a garda who might stop them at a checkpoint on the way to the airport.  This is no reflection on garda&iacute; because they do not have the guidance either.  If we are telling people they can only travel for essential purposes we need to make it clear to people what essential purposes are.  In particular circumstances that perhaps do not involve work but do involve an important personal event, such as the one I have described, we need to be able to give people certainty before they spend money, time and expense on travel plans.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021021500002#DD00200","speaker":"1685"},{"type":"speech","time":1613385000,"counter":91,"content":"<p>I want to raise a number of issues.  There has been recent notification from AIB and Bank of Ireland that they plan to charge negative interest on client accounts.  This is money which people have saved and on which they have already paid tax.  This includes client accounts in solicitors' practices.  If my solicitor draws down a loan from the bank because I have purchased a property I immediately start paying my mortgage interest on that money but now I will also be paying between 0.5% and 0.65% interest on the money until it is transferred to the seller.  This issue needs to be looked at.  Transactions in solicitors' practices such as this should be exempt.

I am concerned that the voices of parents, particularly the parents of children in the schools of my own county, have not been heard and I have been contacted by a number of parents.  At present, no post-primary school in my county is being represented by the National Parents Council that is in the talks.  In fact, 85% of schools, or 612 out of 726, accounting for 340,000 parents, in either the Catholic Secondary Schools Parents Association or the ETB Schools National Parents Association are not part of the National Parents Council at present, which is a worrying situation.  The ETB withdrew because of internal issues in October.  The elected directors of the Catholic Secondary Schools Parents Association have been denied access to meetings and are not being informed of what has been discussed.  This matter needs to be dealt with immediately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021021500002#DD00300","speaker":"1639","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1613385000,"counter":93,"content":"<p>I wish to clarify something for the benefit of the House.

To that end, I wrote to the Minister for Finance last week asking for his response to it and what plans he might have.  Otherwise we need to have a debate in the House to outline the impact on those who might not even realise yet that just holding money on deposit is going to start costing money now.  I know that we do not get an awful lot of payback for people who save in this country in terms of positive interest rates in our banks, but it certainly should not cost people money, especially in the examples that the Senator gave of people drawing down mortgages and holding them in solicitors' accounts for a short period.<\/p> <p>I am very surprised to hear about the National Parents Council.  What the Senator should do, if he does not mind, is write to the Minister for Education asking that every single sector of society be represented at the NPC.  Equal views should be highlighted in all of our representative organisations that are around the table, none so which as detrimental as what we saw happen in the past couple of days.  The only place that decisions get made is around the table.  If one is not at the table, then one's views are certainly not being heard.<\/p> <p>In response to Senator Ward, it is instrumental that we have legislation that is being implemented by the Garda, yet with no list of what is and is not essential.  I think we can all bear witness to the outcry arising from a number of RT&Eacute; reports last Thursday night and Friday about a particular dentist in a particular country.  That morning, the feedback from the Garda was that it was not essential to travel, but by that evening the Garda Commissioner had to come out and say that he had no way of stopping anybody from travelling to a dentist in a sunny climate.  There does need to be a list of what is and is not essential.  I will write to the Taoiseach today and ask him to include that in the living with Covid plans being prepared in the next couple of weeks.  We all need to have a little bit of certainty and stability, and certainly a lot of hope needs to be given in those commitments in the next couple of weeks.<\/p> <p>Senator Seery Kearney talked about the leaving certificate applied.  Last week, colleagues spoke about similar implications of Covid hampering people being able to do the practical parts of examinations.  The Senator talked about a certain cohort of leaving certificate students.  Senator Hoey was talking about third level students last week.  There has to be some accommodation made and I do not know why it cannot be assessments of their ongoing work during the course of the year or two years.  If that is not possible, then there definitely has to be some accommodation made, and I will email the Minister for Education this evening asking her to respond to the Senator directly.<\/p> <p>Many colleagues have talked about the &euro;555 million of annual funding that was announced by the Minister, Deputy Ryan, this morning, which is very welcome.  It is welcome in every single county and town.  It is what we use to maintain the roads network but also to establish new routes.  Senators will have heard Senator Chambers talk at the very beginning of today's session about the impact on people's lives when we put in new routes and travelways between towns, so the funding is very welcome.  I acknowledge everybody who referred to the funding allocated to their counties and constituencies.<\/p> <p>Senator O'Loughlin talked about breastfeeding, and she has raised the issue a number of times.  Breastfeeding is not easy.  For some people it comes perfectly naturally but for most women it does not so they need help and support.  A woman is at a low ebb, even though she is full of happy emotions after her baby is born.  She is knackered and tired.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Regina Doherty:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There are all those self-conscious feelings and if somebody does not have support, it is easy just to give up.  However, it is wonderful and fulfilling for both the mother and the child if the mother does not give up.  The fact that there are 30 lactation consultants for more than 65,000 births every year tells us everything we need to know.  If we do not put serious supports in place for something, is it a surprise that the Senator can cite <i>The Lancet<\/i>figures being so low for us implementing breastfeeding as a natural course of action for women?  We must put more resources behind the consultants, we need to have them in multiples in every county and we certainly do not need them to be redistributed to other tasks that are apparently far more important during the Covid pandemic.  If we do not put our money where our mouth is, we will not get the outcome we want.  I will support the Senator wholeheartedly in raising this with the Minister for Health.<br\/><br\/>Senator Kyne spoke about the roads funding and the impact on his town.  A new pedestrian crossing might appear to be something relatively small, but it has a massive impact on the safety of children going to and from school, as does the reduction of travel speed on the roads.  I note that many councils last week adopted the Love 30 Campaign to reduce speeds on the roads around schools.  It is very effective.  The roads funding is obviously welcome.<br\/><br\/>I accept the amendment proposed by Senator Moynihan regarding No. 11 on the Order Paper.  We can take that immediately before No. 1.<br\/><br\/>Senator Boylan spoke about the need for a review of the HAP system.  This is a long-standing review that must be done.  It should be done annually because, obviously, the rates and markets change and rents go up and down.  The associated reviews need to reflect that.  I have made a request to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to come to the Seanad to discuss housing, so I will add the rental sector to the list of items when he comes to the House.<br\/><br\/>Senator McGahon asked for a debate on aviation.  It is in the diary for next week, hopefully.  I hope to be able to give the House time not just to discuss aviation but also tourism.  They are two sectors in our society that have been desperately damaged over the last 12 months and do not see any hope for the next 12 months.  We have to give them reassurance that the State will continue to support them over and above the wage subsidy schemes and the PUP, which obviously will be maintained for as long as they are needed for people who are out of work.  We must be able to reassure the aviation sector that there will be an aviation sector in the future, and that there will be routes to enhance not only tourism, which is a massively important industry for Ireland, but also connectivity, which has to be secured for our open economy.  I hope that debate will be next Friday, but I will refer back to the House when I have a secure date.<br\/><br\/>Senator Bacik spoke about the proposed amendment to the Order of Business from Senator Moynihan, which I am happy to accept.  I must have misheard Senator Moynihan when she first mentioned the catch-up for children scheme.  It is a very good idea, but I heard the figure as &euro;1 million when she first raised it, but it is, in fact, &euro;100 million, which makes far more sense.  I will make the request today for the debate and, hopefully, schedule it in the next couple of weeks, if possible.  The Senator is correct that the impact of the last 12 months on children has been enormous.  We can see certain impacts, and the interruption of their education is one of them.  However, I believe there are far greater impacts on children which we have not yet seen.  There are underlying currents in households at present because children are not outside.  I hope the children are as resilient as they normally are and bounce back, but I fear we will be talking about the consequences of Covid-19 for many years to come, particularly for some of our younger children.  I will arrange that debate with haste.<br\/><br\/>Senator Cummins spoke about the roads funding, particularly the &euro;16.3 million for Waterford.  More importantly, he asked for a debate on the roll-out of broadband.  I can stand here with some satisfaction and say that I am happy the last Government made the decision to adopt the broadband plan.  Again, I realise there were misgivings, but there is no doubt now about the value and benefit of having high-speed broadband in every home, business and school in the country and the positive impact it can have on our lives, not just because we are in the midst of a pandemic but also for the improvement of services in the future, both nationally and locally.  I will arrange that debate as soon as I can.<br\/><br\/>Senator McGreehan talked about respect.  We had a discussion in the House last Friday about dog poop and dogs harming sheep, and I had a little rant that got me some attention.  One could hear from the emotion in the Senator's voice the impact there can be when we do not have respect.  We talk about litter wardens and dog wardens, and most of us could probably say they do not have the desired impact we would like to see in our towns and villages.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Regina Doherty:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Fly-tipping is on the increase and the production of dog faeces is not going to stop any time soon so we need to change tack.  Using the local authorities to manage both of those issues has not worked effectively to date so we may need to look at a different way of doing it.  We may need to talk about levies on dog bags or privatising this and putting it up to somebody to say that they can make money on it.  We have 800,000 dogs in the country yet every local authority, even some of the larger ones, has only one or two dog wardens.  The numbers speak for themselves, and if we want to take an issue seriously, we need to put the resources behind it.<\/p><p>On the legislation with regard to harmful drinking, two of our colleagues spoke about minimum pricing.  We talk about doing things when the time is ideal.  Introducing minimum prices in the North and the South at the same time would be the most impactful, but given that the Northern Assembly has told us that it will be at least years, perhaps we should not wait.  We should lead by example as we have done very successfully with other public health measures.<\/p><p>Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile asked for the statements on the protocol on Brexit to be taken.  It is in the diary.  I am just waiting on a date for the Minister, Deputy Coveney, to come back to me on it.  It will not be next week but I would suggest that it might be the week after that.  It is very much needed.  The European Commission Vice-President will be before the Joint Committee on European Affairs to talk about the impact of some of the decisions that were made, ill-advised or otherwise, over the past couple of weeks.<\/p><p>Senator Garvey welcomed the roads funding of &euro;555 million but also touched upon an issue that is very close to my heart.  Part of the funding is to be used for signage for the safety of cyclists on the roads.  I and Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon, following the serious and many years of successful lobbying by a gentleman in Wexford called Phil Skelton, got the then Minister, Shane Ross, to introduce regulations around 1.5 m for safe overtaking of cyclists on roads.  He could not pass the legislation because, apparently, it was unenforceable, but an advertising campaign and signage was to have the same effect.  However, if the signs do not exist, they cannot have any effect, so it is very welcome that the signs are being financed, as they should be in every town and county, by the end of this year.<\/p><p>No. 8 on the Order Paper was spoken about passionately and caringly by Senator McDowell.  I have no issue with scheduling a debate in the coming weeks if he so wishes.  He would have unanimous support in this House, and in any house in Ireland, for the safe return of Richard O'Halloran to his wife and three children.  I cannot begin to imagine the difficulty they have gone through in recent years with him being isolated in a faraway country and his three children and his wife being left here isolated in their own county.  We need to do everything we can to make sure that we get him home.  I would have enormous trust in and a positive outlook with regard to the actions of the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and his team.  It is to be hoped there will be a positive outcome before there is a need for a debate but there is no problem in the Seanad having one if that is where we find ourselves in a number of weeks.<\/p><p>Senator Chambers brought up the issue of the national development plan.  It is closing this Friday.  I am not sure that there have been as many submissions to it arising from the extension.  There are only four days remaining.  The national development plan has to be cognisant, as does every local county development plan all counties are going through, of the major impact that remote working, albeit forced on us in the past 12 months, has had on forming and shaping the future world of work.  I would very much encourage any Member of this House who has not already done so to get his or her constituents to make a submission to that plan before this Friday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021021500002#EE00700","speaker":"1653","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1613385000,"counter":101,"content":"<p>Senator Moynihan has proposed an amendment to the Order of Business: \"That No. 11 be taken before No. 1.\"  The Leader has indicated she is prepared to accept the amendment.

I have carefully considered the debate and the cross-party support Senator McDowell's amendment received.  The approach we are proposing in the amendment is in a similar spirit.  Senators will be aware that section 37(12) already provides for guidance to be issued to competent authorities in respect of the definition of \"prominent public function\".  These amendments insert a subsection (13) to provide that guidance may be issued more generally to competent authorities in respect of this section.  Such guidance will be issued only where the Minister believes it is necessary and expressly \"for the purpose of facilitating the consistent, effective and risk-based application of this section.\"  I wish to be clear on the distinction between subsections (12) and (13).  While guidance under subsection (12) on prominent public functions will be issued on, or soon after, the commencement of the Act, I do not envisage guidance being issued under subsection (13) in the short or medium term.  My hope is that the subsection (13) guidance will not be required at all.  We expect the designated persons and competent authorities to develop an appropriate and a reasonable approach without top-down guidance.<\/p> <p>In general, the Minister for Justice is also not the appropriate person to be issuing detailed operational instructions to financial services firms.  These are matters for the Central Bank.  However, I am conscious that politically exposed person, PEP, obligations apply to all designated persons, and so are relevant to all competent authorities.  I would like to see a consistent and effective approach.  I am conscious also that best practices in respect of the PEP regime will evolve both in Ireland and internationally.  <\/p> <p>Guidelines under this section will always be subject to consistency with the Act and must also be consistent with the directive.  We do not have discretion to exclude, for example, family members and their spouses, or to disapply the need to determine the sources of funds.  That is not our intention.  Rather, it is to provide a flexible tool that can be used if necessary, having seen how the regime develops over a period of time.<\/p> <p>Senator McDowell raised also the question of whether extended third party reliance under section 40 might be possible.  We are of the view that this is not possible under the directive at present.  Reliance on third parties is governed by Article 25 of the directive, as amended, and this specifically allows reliance in respect of Article 13(1)(a), (b) and (c).  These provisions are implemented in sections 33 and 35.  The provisions in section 37 instead transpose Article 18, which we do not believe falls under the Article 25 provisions.  However, this may be something which can be worked through on a practical level to minimise duplication.  I thank all Senators for their constructive contributions on this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021021500002#NN00600","speaker":"1618"},{"type":"speech","time":1613385000,"counter":132,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State's amendments.  Since we are dealing with amendments Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, I want to thank the Minister of State for listening to the debate and the contributions of the Members of this House, and responding in this manner to the proposal which I made.  I fully accept what the Minister of State said that it is not possible to effectively amend the requirements of an EU directive through guidelines or anything else.  The more complex amendment I proposed on Committee Stage was designed to achieve the maximum of what could be achieved within that parameter.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michael McDowell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=719\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Accepting what the Minister of State said about the advices received about section 40, as well as looking at the difficulties that have arisen under this particular rubric in which we are introducing guidelines on enhanced supervision of politically exposed persons' accounts, the Minister of State should put down on the departmental agenda that when this matter comes up at the next Justice and Home Affairs Council meeting some consideration should be given to dealing with the practicalities of what it has imposed.  I know the British minister expressed considerable doubts as to the extent and effect of this measure as it affected ordinary MPs in Westminster.  She said she hardly could go into the tearooms in Westminster without being besieged by people horrified by the extent of this enhanced surveillance of their activities.  Some real effort should be made to make it practical in its effect.<\/p><p>We are a small country and, therefore, the administrative council of the Labour Party might not be the same as the executive of the Labour Party in England or whatever.  However, when one thinks about it, the average county councillor has far more discretion to affect people's well-being and economic existence than anything we do in this House individually and certainly anything that anybody does at the national executive or national governing body level of any political party.  Accepting that the Central Bank and the other enforcement agencies for this legislation have to work within the letter of the law, will the Minister of State accept the letter of the law has been cast too wide here at the European level?  Will he accept that some degree of moderation is sensible in these circumstances?  It is bad enough that administrative council members of the Labour Party are subject to this regime every time they open a bank account or every time they want to continue an existing account when it is realised they have been appointed to that position.  It is bizarre that one could have been paying a mortgage for donkey's years, gets elected to the Labour Party's council and suddenly gets this letter from a bank or building society asking where did one get all one's money for the past 18 years.  It is bonkers by any standard.<\/p><p>If that is the literal interpretation of this, then there is a strong case for indicating at the Justice and Home Affairs Council that it has gone a little bit too far and asking if the Council could moderate it somewhat.  If it is mad to do that to a member of a particular body.  What about their parents, who to their horror find out, that their child, male or female, has been given this elevated position in the Labour Party or Sinn F&eacute;in and they suddenly get these letters requiring them, exactly on the same basis, to account for their wealth over their lifetime?  That is just crazy stuff.<\/p><p>Without pushing the matter any further, I fully accept the position the Minister of State is in.  I thank him for the reasonable approach he has taken.  It should not be necessary for the Minister or the Department to issue any guidelines.  Common sense should prevail in all of these matters.  Common sense should actually allow a two-line letter, if such is required, from the parent of a newly appointed member of the Labour Party's administrative council stating their wealth over their lifetime of work from A, B and C.  Asking them to produce audited accounts of their business and all their tax returns since the year dot, along with asking them to prove what they got in their parents' will by supplying a copy of that will, is just crazy.  If common sense cannot work out how this is implemented at the level of the Central Bank and other implementing bodies, we are in a sorry place.<\/p><p>I do not want to elaborate any further.  I said everything I needed to say - perhaps at too great a length - on the last occasion.  I thank the Minister of State for giving his Department and his successors the power to actually blow the whistle, say this has got to a ridiculous stage and ask if common sense could be applied.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michael McDowell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=719\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Therefore, I support and welcome the Minister of State's amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021021500002#NN00700","speaker":"1669","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1613385000,"counter":135,"content":"<p>Despite the gravity and seriousness of the matter, a little levity on a Monday is no harm.

It is a good day for the Seanad as regards reforms being made here as a result of Private Members' and Opposition amendments being tabled.  Clearly, however, there has been a problem with the overreach, as I said the other day, of these provisions.  I should hasten to say, in the spirit of levity, that Deputy Howlin first raised the issue of a member of Labour's national executive being concerned to discover that they too were covered by the PEP definition, so it is not that Labour has any monopoly on having persons on its executive councils or on national bodies-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021021500002#PP00300","speaker":"1631"},{"type":"speech","time":1613385000,"counter":137,"content":"<p>I did not want to mention Sinn F&eacute;in and-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021021500002#PP00400","speaker":"1669"},{"type":"speech","time":1613385000,"counter":138,"content":"<p>-----who are covered.  Joking aside, this is clearly a serious matter as regards political organisation, democracy and attracting people to become involved in political parties.  That is why I very much welcome these amendments.  I also welcome the Minister of State's positive comments on the previous Stages regarding the Magnitsky Act that Deputy Howlin and I, and others in Labour and other parties, have been proposing.  It is a long-overdue reform, so I thank the Minister of State for that.<\/p> <p>I ask the Minister of State to bring similar common sense to bear in respect of another aspect of this Bill to which my attention was, unfortunately, drawn too late for me to table amendments on it.  I was contacted over the weekend by the Union of Students in Ireland, USI.  The latter has legal advice on this and is concerned that because of later provisions in the Bill, namely, section 26 and related sections, every students' union which has a board of trustees will have to register every student as a beneficiary, and when any student drops out, it will have to update the register accordingly.  Clearly, this has massive implications for students' unions.  They are very concerned.  They have had legal advice on the matter.  I myself looked at section 26, which inserts a new section 106ZD into the 2010 Act.  Subsection (5) of that new section provides an exemption for bodies established for the purpose of promoting amateur games or sports so, clearly, the GAA had similar concerns but at an earlier stage was provided with an exemption - not just the GAA, but any amateur sports bodies.  It seems that there is a similar exemption for charitable trusts.<\/p> <p>I know it is too late in the day to amend this if, indeed, it is a problem.  It is too late in the day to amend it in the Seanad, but given that our amendments are now due to go back to the D&aacute;il, I ask that an amendment be made in the D&aacute;il to address this issue, if indeed it is an issue.  As I said, I have not had time to look into this in more detail because it came to my attention so late.  However, I am conveying, on behalf of the USI, a serious concern that this will create a major logistical and operational problem for students' unions.  I know from Trinity College Dublin Students' Union that many unions have boards of trustees now.  I am on the board of Trinity College Dublin Students' Union so I should declare an interest.  These were set up with a view to ensuring good governance for students' unions.  Many of us, me included, came into politics through student union activism.  It is really important that common sense prevails and that we do not see unforeseen consequences for bodies such as students' unions as a result of this Bill, in particular section 26 and the related sections related to trusts and trustees.  I ask again that this be looked at by the Minister of State and his Department.  The USI, I am sure, will make contact as well, but I ask that a sensible approach be taken similar to that which was taken in response to the concern Senator McDowell, I and others had raised about the PEP provisions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021021500002#PP00500","speaker":"1631"},{"type":"speech","time":1613385000,"counter":139,"content":"<p>Speaking of national executives, our next speaker is a distinguished member of his national executive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021021500002#PP00600","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1613385000,"counter":140,"content":"<p>I disagree with what the other Senators have said.

I cannot let stand the comment of Senator McDowell to the effect that councillors have more powers than anyone in this House individually.  While I accept the importance of the work local authorities do, it is important to note that the chief executive of each local authority wields the vast majority of the power and that these Houses have, during the lifetimes of successive Governments, been responsible for stripping councillors' powers away since the enactment of the Planning and Development Act 2000.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Barry Ward:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=BarryWard&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is my understanding that chief executives of local authorities would not be subject to the PEP provisions.

Section 5 of the Bill amends section 25 of the 2010 Act.  I suggested that that should be index linked.

The circumstances are quite particular to the facts as found in that case, one of which was that, in the end, the accused person was found not guilty by reason of insanity while the question of the child being identified as the alleged victim was the subject matter of the two judicial directions to which I have referred.<br\/><br\/>The matter was appealed to the court of civil appeal by the newspapers in question, and the judgment handed down on 29 October 2020 in effect rejected their appeal on the grounds that section 252 of the Children Act and the definition of &quot;child&quot; did not exclude a deceased child, the victim of an alleged offence.  Of course, the matter was decided on its narrow facts but the reasoning of the court had a much wider implication because it referred to cases where there were convictions to start with and also to cases in which a variety of offences could have occurred and a variety of circumstances might have arisen.  In response to that decision, and particularly in response to what was stated by the President of the Court of Appeal, Mr. Justice Birmingham, in paragraph 14 of his decision, this Bill was generated by the Independent group of Senators in this House, whose support I am grateful for.<br\/><br\/>Paragraph 14 states: <\/p><blockquote>\tI appreciate the media may find the ruling surprising and that they may say that it involves a radical departure from what had been a long-established practice.  They may say that the outcome is an undesirable one and may be in a position to make that argument with some force.  Nonetheless, the language of the statute is clear and unequivocal and, enjoying a presumption of constitutionality as it does, must be given effect to.  If change is required and if it is desired to return to previous practice where it was possible to report cases involving the deaths of children, then it is a matter requiring intervention by the Oireachtas. <\/blockquote><p>It is in that context, without challenging at all the correctness of the decision of the Court of Appeal, but bearing in mind its scope, that this Bill was introduced to the House.<br\/><br\/>In parallel with the Independent group's initiative in introducing this Bill to the House, my good friend Deputy Jim O'Callaghan introduced a Private Members' Bill to much the same effect in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  Both he and I discussed between us, and subsequently with the Minister, whom I welcome to the House today, and her officials, how this matter could best be remedied.  The fact that my Bill was chosen was partly the luck of the draw.  It does not reflect in any way on D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann or Deputy Jim O'Callaghan's Bill; it just has to do with what was considered the most expeditious way of dealing with the legislation.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michael McDowell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=719\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Obviously, it is a huge injustice to the parents of a child who is killed in a homicide that media cannot carry coverage of the fact that their child was the subject of court proceedings for an offence in which a conviction took place when the public will probably in most cases be well aware of the identity of the person convicted.  It is a major reduction in the rights of apparent free speech and the rights of parents to tell their story in public and to express their tragic loss in many cases and their feelings about what has happened to their child that the law should have this clearly unintended effect.<br\/><br\/>This House and the other House are intended to presume the consequences of the clear language we use.

Perhaps that is a signal warning to us all to be extremely careful in parsing and analysing legislation and not to rush things through without careful consideration of precisely what we are doing.  For 19 years after that legislation was passed, nobody thought of the dimension which arose in the DPP <i>v.<\/i>EC case and nobody thought to suggest there was a problem with it.  <br\/><br\/>I welcome the approach being taken by the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, to this matter.  All of us on all sides of both Houses, I presume, want to take up the invitation put by the President of the Court of Appeal, Mr. Justice Birmingham, that if this is not the desired outcome, then it is a matter for the Oireachtas to deal with.  I welcome the open attitude of the Minister in adopting one or other of the two Bills, either Deputy O'Callaghan's or mine, signalling her willingness to do that and getting on with the process of legislating in this matter.<br\/><br\/>Today is just the Second Stage and the Minister's Department has kindly indicated to me that it proposes making various amendments to the rather simple formulation which I and my colleagues have put forward as a remedy to this problem.  There are unforeseen consequences lurking here, whichever way we go.  To take one example, if a sibling who was a child murdered younger siblings, can those children be identified in circumstances where the person who murdered or killed those children is also a child?  There are corners around which we have to look and I welcome the fact that the Department is putting a lot of effort into making sure that in remedying one problem, we do not create another one or allow it be said that a rush to legislate opened up another problem.  I recognise the Minister's willingness to consider the matter and to proceed carefully with it.  I fully concede that it is not devoid of complexity.  Such amendments as the Minister has outlined to me through her officials seem to be going in the right direction but I ask that whatever is done be considered very carefully.<br\/><br\/>The example I gave is just one example.  I have never been overly attracted to the notion that in regard to all child offenders for all time, including 17-year-olds, it should never in any circumstances be permissible to refer to the fact that they were convicted of an offence.  I know this comes from a long line of law to the effect that children are in a special category, that they must be capable of redemption and that their reputations cannot be tainted for all time by a childhood offence.  I accept that but there are sometimes practical outworkings of that which cause immense difficulties.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michael McDowell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=719\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This House will be aware of the difficulties that arose in a similar case in the United Kingdom where the media did or did not behave well regarding a particular murder of a child, and all the complexities which followed on from that.<br\/><br\/>The principle of this Bill is, effectively, to take up the invitation given to the Houses of the Oireachtas by Mr. Justice Birmingham to legislate in the matter if the unexpected and unwanted implications of the judgment in the DPP <i>v<\/i>. EC case are to be readdressed by the Legislature.  I, therefore, believe there is all-party backing for the principle of this legislation.  I concede that it will require very careful tweaking this way or that and very careful consideration.  Although the Minister is under immense pressure to legislate very fast on this, and I have no problem with speeding legislation through the House, it will have to be careful.  These particular matters I have raised should be addressed.<br\/><br\/>We recently had a case, and again I will be very careful in what I say, in which a person legally considered a child was the subject of what appears to be a homicide of some kind, subject to defences.  It is strange that the result of section 252 and the judgment of the Court of Appeal has resulted in the situation that great publicity is given to an event and then a subsequent criminal prosecution is wholly divorced from that great publicity.  The public are not entitled to know whether there have or have not been prosecutorial consequences for that particular death.<br\/><br\/>We are under these kinds of pressures but we must get this right.  In those circumstances, I commend this Bill to the House.  I thank the Minister for the generous approach she has adopted.  I thank Deputy O'Callaghan for his generosity in his discussions with me on the matter.  I, therefore, have pleasure in moving the Bill on Second Stage.  I look forward to a detailed Committee Stage session on this Bill to make sure it is right and does not do anything none of us wish to be the consequence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021021500002#VV00200","speaker":"1669","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1613385000,"counter":167,"content":"<p>I thank Senator McDowell.

I commend Senator McDowell on introducing it so swiftly in the wake of this problem coming to light.  As he illustrated, it raises the issue of why the Oireachtas needs to take its legislative role so seriously.  I spoke last November during the hate crimes legislation about how careless drafting or rushed legislation can lead to unforeseen consequences.  This children's legislation was intensely and intensively scrutinised.  Therefore, it bears out all the more the importance of careful analysis of legislation.<\/p> <p>As we know, this particular issue arose from a dispute between the DPP and a number of media outlets over whether a person identified only as \"EC\", who had committed a homicide against her child, could be publicly identified, as had been the media practice up to that point.  We are familiar with Mr. Justice Birmingham's judgment at the Court of Appeal and, of course, it is clear, as has been said, the judge had no option but to interpret the law as he found it.  Section 252 of the legislation, which \"provides that a report which reveals the name, address or school of the child or includes any particulars likely to lead to his or her identification\" should not be published, was only modified by the possibility of the court dispensing with the requirements of that section where it is satisfied that it is appropriate to do so in the interest of this child.   It is clear that is so narrowly drawn that it could not possibly comprehend a situation where the child in question was deceased.  It is certainly not for me to prejudge what precise solution the Government will come up with having regard to the complexities to which Senator McDowell alluded.  It seems, however, that had the legislation provided a clause that, where otherwise, the court is of the view that it is just to publish, that such a saver would, perhaps, have prevented this particular decision.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->On any plain reading of section 252 as it stands, it is impossible to argue with the interpretation of the court.

This is an extremely important issue and I welcome this amendment Bill coming before the House.  It is a matter that needs to be rectified and I am glad the process is starting today.  I commend Senator McDowell, who brought this Bill before the House, and I want to acknowledge the work, as he did, that he and my colleague, Deputy Jim O'Callaghan, have done on the matter since the anomaly came to light.  I also must mention a similar Bill that Deputy Jim O'Callaghan laid before the D&aacute;il recently.<\/p> <p>This Bill is amending section 252 of the Children Act 2001.  The section provides that in any proceedings that involve a crime committed against a child, a child cannot be identified after proceedings have commenced.  The legislation makes complete sense if a child has been subject to sexual abuse or has been assaulted.  Quite rightly, a child's privacy and the protection of same are at the forefront of all of our minds as it would undoubtedly add tremendously to the trauma of that child if his or her details were to be publicised in the newspapers or the media.  It would add to the trauma of the attack already inflicted upon the child.<\/p> <p>However, as many have stated, it was not foreseen or wished that the provision would apply in respect of a child who has been killed.  This was never the situation before the Court of Appeal ruling last year.  The ruling meant that a child killed by someone else cannot be identified once that person is charged and the person accused of killing the child cannot be identified if doing so would also identify the child.  The judgment has led to an unusual situation whereby deceased child victims can be named up to the point at which a person is charged, at which point his or her name can no longer be reported.  Questions have also been raised on whether the judgment prevents a person, who was a victim of an offence as a child and who also seeks to waive his or her anonymity as an adult, from doing so.  The Court of Appeal judgment has been criticised.  It has brought a lot of hurt to the families of the victims who rightly feel aggrieved that they are unable to name their deceased children publicly as a result of it.<\/p> <p>The consequences of the ruling have resulted in significant harm and damage.  It is a significant issue of confusion for the public.  People are informed of the name of the child after the child has been killed, which is correct because the murder of a child is a major issue in our society.  Individuals are informed, the public is informed and the child is named.  However, once proceedings are commenced, the media cannot identify the name of that child.  This leads to absurd situations in which a child would still have been named in the media for a period of days and once the individual is charged in respect of a child's death, again the child cannot be named.  This is the reason the legislation needs to be changed.<\/p> <p>The Bill respects the requirement for a balance between protecting the public and the victims.  The protection of child victims may sometimes require anonymity for the perpetrator in offences such as female genital mutilation, sexual assault, serious non-fatal injury and incest cases.  The judgment has led to an unusual situation and questions have been raised on other issues.  These questions and many more, as Senator McDowell has noted, require the careful consideration of the Department in its approach to this amendment Bill.  The Department must re-examine the unforeseen circumstances that may arise due to the changing of section 252.  I am glad this will be rectified for the families who, after the passage of this Bill, will be able to name their children who tragically lost their lives.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Erin McGreehan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=ErinMcGreehan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I look forward to seeing the Bill in its final form in the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021021500002#ZZ00200","speaker":"1671","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1613385000,"counter":172,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the considerable work done by the Independent Senators, including Senator McDowell, and Deputy Jim O'Callaghan in rectifying what is a patently unjust situation arising out of the court's interpretation.  I thank the Minister for not standing on ceremony.  She has a sense of urgency about rectifying this situation for families who have experienced great hurt as a consequence of it, although there was no other conclusion that could have been arrived at by the judges deliberating on this matter.  In doing their job and making such a strict and literal interpretation, we have unfortunately arrived at a situation where it is possible that justice for child victims is not seen to be done.  It is urgent that we address this issue.  The section of the Children Act 2001 was clearly about ensuring that children would not be forever identified with the crime perpetrated against them or to which they were witnesses.  In so doing, I am confident that the view of legislators was towards child protection.  It is important that, as we deliberate on this Bill, we continue in that mindset.  This is about child protection at all times.  In addressing what is a narrow set of circumstances and interpretation, it is important that we not have many unintended consequences flowing from the Bill.<\/p> <p>The controversy arises around the child who has died.  No one would attest to there being anything controversial as regards the living child.  People understand that a child has a life to live and deserves his or her anonymity.  However, we need to allow the identities of children who are deceased because of the most unspeakable of crimes to be published.  It is the right of parents and families to speak of their children and to remember all that was lovely about them.  We could have arrived at a situation where families' victim impact statements or their statements on the steps of the court following the conclusion of a trial could not be reproduced in the media.  Families would not get to bring to life all that was good, lovely and to be remembered about their loved ones.  It is part of their mourning and memorialisation and part of keeping the memory of their children alive.<\/p> <p>Our adversarial judicial system is correct and I stand over it, having been in it many a time on the side of both the prosecution and defence, but we can sometimes end up with a defence narrative that is subsequently accused of being exaggerated or one-sided.  We have seen sordid details of the deceased coming out as the narrative builds on behalf of the defendant.  It is important that we have a right of reply and that the record is put straight.  The tenderness and humanity of the deceased needs to be brought out subsequently.  The media have a role to play in telling the victim's story following the conclusion of a trial, as we have seen in the past number of years, including in particular notorious cases.  Parents have the right to reclaim the identity of their child following the conclusion of a trial and to speak freely.<\/p> <p>It is important that adults who were victims of crimes as children get the opportunity to have the right to waive their anonymity.  We will see that being addressed in the Government's amendments.  Although the people in question were children at the material time of the offences perpetrated against them, for example, sexual abuse, they are entitled to waive that anonymity.<\/p> <p>We see through a different lens when we read the section now.  Previously, I would have seen nothing wrong with it, but then the case came through and I now see it differently.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Mary Seery Kearney:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarySeeryKearney&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->What I do see in the section now is that all of the power sits with the court whereas I believe victims should have a say in whether they have a right to lift that anonymity.

It is important that we do this.<\/p><p>I very much support the idea that child perpetrators are protected, that their anonymity is always protected and that there are not unintended consequences arising out of the Bill that affects this.  If we are going to have a restorative justice model and rehabilitation it is important that they get to start again.<\/p><p>I thank the Minister for her approach to this issue.  It has been great.  I thank her for all the hard work.  We could have had to wait for the Supreme Court and for the Bill to be struck down but, thankfully, we did not.

On behalf of the Labour Party I welcome this important Bill, which we are glad to support, and I commend Senator McDowell and his colleagues for bringing it forward so swiftly after the judgment was delivered in the Court of Appeal on 29 October 2020.  Senator McDowell had this Bill in with us in the first week of November.  Other Oireachtas Members, including Deputy O'Callaghan, also brought forward legislation to deal with what others have rightly described as this unforeseen consequence.<\/p> <p>I was struck by Senator Seery Kearney's point on the wording of section 252 of the Children Act.  Reading it before this line of case law, one might well have thought that subsection (2) would have governed against this interpretation but, in any case, that is to revisit perhaps a previous reading.  We have the very clear words now of Mr. Justice Birmingham.  We do need to move legislatively to address these words and ensure the terrible injustice that has resulted for bereaved parents is not allowed to continue.  The Minister has spoken very eloquently about this and all of us have been deeply moved by those who have come forward through the media to describe the pain and trauma of being faced with this consequence whereby the wishes of victims and families of victims are not respected, and where people are left voiceless.<\/p> <p>I want to speak briefly about our views of victims in the criminal law more generally.  I know we will be able to parse the detailed provisions of the Bill on Committee Stage, and I am glad we will be able to do so, but we should see it as fitting within a general package of reforms to give victims more of a voice in our criminal justice system.  I am really glad the Minister announced on foot of the O'Malley report into the review of law and sexual offences that she will look at giving complainants more of a voice through sex offence trials.  Many years ago, along with colleagues in Trinity College, I did a report with the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre on the legal process and victims of rape, as a result of which we recommended separate legal representation for complainants in rape cases where applications were made by the defence in the absence of the jury to bring forward evidence of prior sexual history.  It is a recommendation that is now established in our law through the Sex Offenders Act 2001.  It is something that the Gillen report in Northern Ireland looked at very closely and made recommendations on foot of it, and we will see change there also.<\/p> <p>The Bill is part of a number of ways in which we moved to look at how we can encompass more of a voice for victims in our criminal justice system, without encroaching unduly of course on the rights of the defence.  This came home to me last night again looking at a programme about Gerry Ryan's life.  On his radio show he gave a voice to Lavinia Kerwick, who so bravely came forward in the early 1990s.  Her voiced experience of being the anonymous complainant in a rape trial gave rise to the introduction in 1993 of the victim impact statement, which has made a huge difference in practice in our criminal courts and has enabled victims to feel they have more of a voice in the process.  Of course, it took some time, however, for it to be recognised that the families of victims of homicide also needed that voice.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Ivana Bacik:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2248\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The legislation had not adequately addressed that.  Indeed, a sort of practice had built up among trial judges of allowing families of victims of homicide to speak about the impact the homicide had on them.  That change was made in 2010.  So we are learning and this legislation is part of that process of learning.<\/p><p>I want to speak briefly on a number of other points arising from this Private Members' Bill and the context in which it was brought forward.  Others have spoken about the need for careful scrutiny of legislation, particularly criminal justice legislation.  That is absolutely true and clearly exemplified by the case law we have now seen on section 252.  The 2001 Act itself was heavily scrutinised.  It was seen as a major reforming piece of law relating to children at the time.  I have to say that subsequently, it was somewhat shambolic in the way in which it was commenced.  I recall at the time, as a practitioner, representing children as young as eight and nine years of age before the criminal courts.  We all eagerly anticipated the change in the age of criminal responsibility which the 2001 Act was supposed to usher in.  It did not happen in the end and the provision lay dormant.  It was finally amended in 2006 and only brought into law in July 2007.  There were a lot of well-meaning reforms but due to a lot of difficulty with their commencement, it was brought in somewhat in a piecemeal way.  Again, this raised the need for codification to ensure we have a very clear body of criminal statute law and of law relating to children, in particular.  If we have piecemeal reform, the danger is that provisions are not parsed properly, unforeseen consequences occur and we see developments occurring as we have seen with section 252.<\/p><p>I will finish by thanking the Minister for her engagement with members of the Opposition on a number of Bills, including this one.  I thank her for her engagement with Deputy Howlin on important pieces of law relating to children's rights and young adults, particularly Coco's law.  I thank her for engagement with me and my Labour Party colleagues on the Born Here Belong Here campaign, which seeks to amend citizenship law for children born in Ireland to parents who are not Irish citizens.  It is very important that we continue to engage.  I thank the Minister for her willingness to do so constructively with those of us in opposition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021021500002#BBB00200","speaker":"1631","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1613385000,"counter":176,"content":"<p>The next speaker is Senator Warfield and he has s&eacute; n&oacute;im&eacute;ad.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021021500002#CCC00200","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"speech","time":1613385000,"counter":177,"content":"<p>I will not use all of my time.

We would hope to see more examples of such co-operation in this House.  We have seen it this year in this House.  I think it is more akin to the co-operation we saw in the Twenty-fifth Seanad.<\/p> <p>I extend my sympathies to all of the families who have been affected by the subject of today's Bill.  Of course, it will not change their situation but I hope it will bring some measure of comfort.  We want to see a situation where parents of children who have been killed can use their victim impact statements to the court to tell the story of their loved ones.  This is a frustration that many families have felt.  It should not have been left to the families to worry about possible legal implications.  Many families of children who have been killed will always want to remain out of the public eye and that right should always be fully respected.  Others draw comfort from talking publicly about their children and want to celebrate their memories.  Part of this may involve referring to the circumstances of their deaths.  Therefore, we obviously need to remove the barrier that prevents families from fully remembering and celebrating the lives of those tragically taken from them.  They may seek to remember them in the name of an organisation, foundation or charity and that example was mentioned to me by a friend with whom I spoke before this debate.<\/p> <p>I welcome the Minister for Justice to the House.  She said recently that issues have arisen on foot of the original ruling regarding the cases of people who were children at the time of the offence but adults when proceedings were taken against the perpetrators.

It is good to see the Government supporting constructive legislation from the Opposition benches.  One of the ways we can most effectively make good legislation is when we take good ideas, regardless of where they come from.<\/p> <p>As other Members said, the legislation follows the Court of Appeal's decision regarding whether a child can be named after the child has been murdered and the interpretation of section 252 of the Children Act 2001.  While the interpretation is understandable on a reading of the law, it is the case that a situation in which a family that has lost a child cannot speak about that child, the loss of the child and the circumstances is an unforeseen cruelty on top of cruelty for that family.  It is very sad, and it is important to try to address it expeditiously.<\/p> <p>I have certain concerns about the Bill, and other Members have mentioned them.  I recognise that the proposer of the Bill has been clear that work will have to be done to tease these out.  Sadly, there are situations where not only is the victim of a murder, attempted murder or manslaughter a child, but the perpetrator is also a minor or a child.  It is a major additional tragedy when somebody has committed such an awful crime so early in his or her life.  It is important we would reflect and manage in the law mechanisms which give priority to the rights, to the story and to honouring the victim of a crime, but we must also give due regard and respect to protecting the childhood status of a perpetrator.  There are other sections of the Children Act, such as section 93, which address some of the situations when a case is before the court.  That gives certain safeguards whereby, except in such circumstances where, for example, somebody is at large or where it is in the public interest, the perpetrator would not be named.  Those address situations when a case is before the court, but this legislation might have to deal with more nuanced situations subsequent to a ruling or to the case concluding.  I am sure we will be able to tease this out together in a way that ensures that while a victim and the family are able to discuss what matters to them, at the same time we respect the fact of a perpetrator being a minor and find a way to do that appropriately.<\/p> <p>On the question of the media's interest in the right to name a deceased child, the media naming is important but it is also important to have a culture of respect in that regard and regarding those questions of the public interest safeguards and what are the appropriate measures or checks and balances.  It may be that this is not simply a matter of an absolute right or no right, but a right with safeguards and caveats.  We will be able to tease those out.  I am confident that the legislators in both Houses who have the intent of the public good in mind will be able to address those issues.<\/p> <p>There is a related issue.  We might propose amendments to this Bill on Committee Stage, although I will certainly support it today.  I recognise that it is an important step forward.  However, I wish to identify an issue which, for me, is related.  It is the trauma that is inflicted by the silencing when a tragedy or abuse takes place, and it then becomes invisible.  Sadly, there is that related situation under way, at present, in respect of institutional abuse.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Minister will be very aware of the serious and time-pressing concerns expressed by many of those who testified to the mother and baby homes commission about their data protection rights and also their more immediate rights in terms of the recordings of their testimony - their voices - being deleted or them not having access to their own stories.  In one way, this is a side issue to the one we are debating but, in another, it goes to that same core matter of respecting children and their stories, even in the many years that follow.<\/p><p>Many people who were children at the time of the mother and baby homes and testified to the commission as adults are very concerned.  They are asking that the Minister would support her colleague, the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O&rsquo;Gorman, in seeking to extend, if necessary, the terms of the commission to ensure that appropriate actions can be taken in respect of the rights of those who were children at that time and are now adults who want to have their rights vindicated.  They want their stories to be heard.  They want a copy of their stories.  They want their rights and to see justice done.  I want to flag that issue to the Minister.<\/p><p>This Bill is positive.  It is a good step forward in addressing an unforeseen consequence.  We will have to avoid other unforeseen consequences.  In general, this legislation, and all our legislation, needs scrutiny again in the light of the referendum on children&rsquo;s rights, which was that collective decision we, as a nation, made to look to children's rights.  I imagine this will not be the first legislative measure we will need to review and strengthen to ensure that Ireland can be a leader in respect of the rights of the child.  I again commend the proposers of the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021021500002#DDD00200","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1613385000,"counter":181,"content":"<p>I commend Senator McDowell on bringing forward this legislation so soon after it was pointed out that it was needed.  I acknowledge also the contribution of my colleague, Deputy O'Callaghan, in bringing forward legislation.  It is very welcome that this legislation has been produced and that the Government is supporting it because it has been very clear that there is a need to address the Court of Appeal ruling that has prevented parents from speaking publicly about their deceased child in cases where the child was unlawfully killed.  We cannot begin to imagine the death of a child but, in particular, the violent and tragic killing of a child.  It is important that the memory of that child be revered in a way that is appropriate to the wishes of the parents.  The situation often arises where the parent wants to address what happened to the child.  Part of that is honouring the life of the child but another part is trying to ensure that similar tragedies do not happen again and that lessons can be learned from everybody.<\/p> <p>This Bill permits the identification of those accused of and convicted of the homicide of children.  We need to ensure that it is expedited.  Having the Bill taken so early and the Government making a swift decision on it is welcome.  We must change the law promptly because it is unfair to the memory of children who have been killed that we allow the current position to continue to obtain.<\/p> <p>The background to the Bill is that it came about as a result of an unintended consequence of the Court of Appeal's ruling last year to the effect that the provision in the Children Act 2001 preventing the identification of a child where someone is charged with an offence against him or her does not exclude deceased children.  This ruling meant that a child killed by a person cannot be identified once that person is charged.  In addition, the person accused of killing a child cannot be identified if doing so would also lead to that child being identified.  That is wrong for many different reasons.  It is enormously unfair on the families of deceased children that they have to go through this process whereby the memory of their children is being removed from history.  The mother of an 11-year-old boy who had been murdered was compelled recently to disguise her identity on television as though she was some type of criminal who could not be identified on the news.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Fiona O'Loughlin:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2441\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2441&amp;amp;pid=FionaOLoughlin&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->By revealing her identity, the identity of her dead child would also have been revealed.  It is manifestly unfair to the families of deceased children that the law operates as it does.<\/p><p>This has been a major source of confusion for the public.  People are informed of the name of a child if that child has been killed, which is absolutely correct, because it is such a major event in society when a child is killed.  Individuals are informed, the public is informed and the child is identified.  However, once proceedings commence, the media cannot name the child, leading to absurd cases where a child would have been named in the media for a period of days but once an individual is charged in respect of the child's death, the child can no longer be named.  That is even just one reason this legislation must be changed.<\/p><p>I know the Government has a number of amendments to the Bill to ensure it delivers its vision and shared aim.  It is important these amendments do not give rise to any unintended consequences that might affect the protection afforded by the Act to child witnesses or child victims in the criminal justice process.  Section 252 of the Children Act 2001 currently provides that in any proceedings involving a crime committed against a child, the child cannot be identified after the proceedings have commenced.<\/p><p>This legislation makes sense if the child is being subjected to sexual abuse or has been assaulted and it would clearly exacerbate the trauma for the child if his or her victimhood would become a media story.  It would aggravate the trauma of the attack already inflicted upon the child.  However, it was never intended that the provision would apply in respect of a child who had been killed.  It has not applied to that extent because before 2019 there was no such understanding of the application of that provision.  It was never the case that children who had been killed were anonymised once a case came to trial.<\/p><p>I commend Senator McDowell on all his work to bring this forward and the Government on taking this Bill and bringing forward the necessary amendments to ensure we can achieve these necessary aims.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021021500002#EEE00200","speaker":"1689","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1613385000,"counter":183,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.

The only way they can keep the memory of the child alive is by telling their story.  I am mindful today of the Dullard family and Jo Jo Dullard who disappeared so many years ago now that I cannot remember.  The family has kept her memory alive by constantly talking about her and bringing her story into the media spotlight.  I meant to speak of the young boy, who was about 12 years of age, who disappeared in Dublin during his lunch break one day.  I forget his name.  Again, until recently, his mother has kept his memory alive by discussing him.<\/p><p>As part of the healing and grieving process, it is most important for parents to be able to name their loved child.  If that grieving process is served by having the child's name in the public domain, then that is where it should be.  I cannot but think of the most recent case of the mother who had to anonymise herself.  What must she feel?  All she wanted to do was to talk about her beautiful child who was lost.  Those of us who have children know that if anything happens to them, we want to remember them as they were.  We want to remember everything about them.<\/p><p>I commend the Minister on taking this on board.  I hope that this Bill is passed quickly in order that those parents who are grieving today can start to speak about their children to journalists again, because that is the only way they can keep their children alive in their own minds.  There is nothing worse in this world than losing a child, but losing a child to murder must be absolutely desperate.  I am not going to take up any more of the Minister's time.

As we are all aware, and as the Senator and others have clearly explained, the Bill is in response to issues from the recent decision of the Courts in DPP and EC <i>v<\/i>.  <i>The Irish Times<\/i>and others.<\/p><p>Section 252 of the Children Act 2001 contains mandatory reporting restrictions where the trial relates to &quot;an offence against a child or where a child is a witness in any such proceedings&quot;.  Mr. Justice Birmingham, in the Court of Appeal on 29 October 2020, upheld the High Court's interpretation of section 252 to mean that the reporting restrictions in relation to offences against children also apply in circumstances where the child is deceased or has turned 18 years of age.  The identity of the person responsible for the child's death cannot be published if it would directly or indirectly reveal the child's identity.<\/p><p>The profound negative impact the ruling is having on grieving parents who are unable to remember their deceased children's names or legacies is very clear to me.  Like the Senators here and many others, I want to give power back to those parents so that they can remember their children or their family members in the way that they wish to do so.  I have been working with Senator McDowell and Deputy Jim O'Callaghan on this issue, and we agreed that a collaborative approach is the right one to take.  Having committed to finding the fastest way to address this issue, Cabinet agreed last week to support the Private Members' Bill introduced by Senator McDowell as the most expeditious way of delivering on this commitment.<\/p><p>To outline the current law, section 252 of the Children Act 2001 was designed to protect child witnesses and child victims from the negative impact of being publicly identified in criminal proceedings.  The current section 252(1) states that: <\/p> <blockquote> \tin relation to any proceedings for an offence against a child or where a child is a witness in any such proceedings&mdash;  \t(a) no report which reveals the name, address or school of the child or includes any particulars likely to lead to his or her identification, and<br \/><br \/>(b) no picture which purports to be or include a picture of the child or which is likely to lead 10 his or her identification, shall be published or included in a broadcast.  <\/blockquote> <p>Section 252(2) does permit a court to lift reporting restrictions if it is satisfied that this would be in the interests of the child.<\/p><p>Previous to the judgment of the Court of Appeal in the EC case, the issue of reporting restrictions in the case of a deceased child victim had not arisen.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Helen McEntee:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2394\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2394&amp;amp;pid=HelenMcEntee&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The judgment of Mr. Justice Birmingham outlines this is the natural consequence of a perfectly plain reading and interpretation of section 252.  Mr. Justice Birmingham was of the view that &ldquo;it is not possible to interpret this section as not including a deceased person who was a child at the time of death.&rdquo;<\/p><p>The main issue to be addressed is to allow the identity of a child who has been unlawfully killed to be published and it would also remove the current difficulties with identifying the person charged in connection with the child's death.<\/p><p>A further issue which has arisen on foot of the ruling relates to cases with respect to persons who were children at the time of the offence but adults when the proceedings were taken against the perpetrators.  Mr. Justice Birmingham also added on this point that \"Neither, in my view, is it possible to exclude proceedings relating to offences committed against a child, as a child, if they come on for hearing after the child has attained his or her majority.\"  This issue will also be addressed by way of Government amendment.<\/p><p>Regarding this Bill, the text of subsection (1) is the same as the existing text of section 252, but for the inclusion of the two references to &ldquo;image&rdquo;.  Subsection (2) is entirely new.  The focus of the provision is on the publication of reports, pictures or images identifying the person accused or convicted of homicide offences.<\/p><p>The new subsection (3) is based on the existing subsection (2) of section 252.  The current provision permits the court to make an order dispensing with the requirements of subsection (1) where satisfied that it is appropriate to do so in the interests of the child.  By contrast, the new subsection requires the court to be satisfied that it is appropriate to do so having regard to the interests of the child and to the public interest, including the protection of children generally.<\/p><p>Subsections (4) to (6), inclusive, reflect the wording of the current subsections (3) to (5), inclusive.  The intention of section 3 is to allow the provisions of the new section 252 to apply retrospectively.<\/p><p>I have received Cabinet approval to support this Bill, subject to proposed Government amendments.  There are some policy and drafting issues with the Bill which I propose to address by way of Government amendments.<\/p><p>The focus of the Bill is to permit the identification of a person accused or convicted of homicide offences against a child rather than the identification of the child victim.  Subsection 2 does not include the offence of dangerous driving causing death or serious bodily harm pursuant to section 53 of the Road Traffic Act 1961 against a child.  I will introduce an amendment to address this.<\/p><p>Subsection (2) does not provide for the publication of reports, pictures or images of a deceased child victim in the absence of an order of the court under the new subsection (3).  I will introduce a new subsection, by way of amendment, to allow the identity of a child against whom an offence was committed to be published in reporting on such proceedings.<\/p><p>This will also allow reporting where parents wish to speak publicly about their child who has died.  This amendment will be subject to the provisions of section 93 which involves restrictions on reports of proceedings in which children are concerned.  This means that where an accused is a child, his or her identity will be protected.  The amended section will also continue to protect the identity of living child witnesses and victims who are involved in the proceedings.<\/p><p>Even though subsection (3) expands the grounds for lifting the restriction, it is not clear that this would permit the media to report on parents of a murdered child who speak about their bereavement and pay tribute to their child, or on the content of victim impact statements in such circumstances.  It would not necessarily allow for the publication of the identity of a deceased child victim, nor would it necessarily protect other child witnesses.<\/p><p>Expanding the grounds for lifting the restriction in this way would provide that a court could make an order permitting the publication of details of a child victim, whether alive or deceased, or details of a child witness, provided that it was both in the interests of the child and in the public interest to do so.  It could be difficult to reconcile these interests in a given case.<\/p><p>The details of a deceased child victim could only be published if, and where, an order was made.  Accordingly, if an application was not made to the court, the media would not have the right to publish details of the victim.  There is a policy issue as to whether newspapers and journalists should be put to the expense of having to apply to court for such an order where no order is sought by a party to the proceedings.<\/p><p>I have outlined that I will bring a separate amendment to allow the identity of a deceased child against whom an offence was committed to be published in reporting on such proceedings.  This will apply automatically and will not require an order of the court.  It is therefore not necessary to expand the grounds in subsection (3) for the lifting of restrictions.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Helen McEntee:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2394\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2394&amp;amp;pid=HelenMcEntee&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I will, however, bring forward an amendment to substitute \"best interests of the child\" for \"interests of the child\".  The concept of the best interests of the child is an important principle under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and a well established principle in Irish law and policy.  This key principle is central to the national policy framework for children and young people, or the BOBF framework.  It is increasingly incorporated into new legislation affecting children and increasingly referred to in case law since the constitutional amendment on children.<\/p><p>A further issue which many Senators have mentioned and which has arisen on foot of the ruling concerns cases in respect of persons who were children at the time of the offence but adults when the proceedings were taken against the perpetrators.  I will bring forward an amendment to address this issue insofar as the recent judgment has affected it.  However, it is not the purpose of the Bill to stray outside the issue of child protection.  The protection of adult victims and the lifting of that protection are a separate issue.  There was a woman who spoke on \"Prime Time\", I think, last week who could not name herself.  We have all heard of many examples of victims of abuse who wish to name themselves, who are now adults and who cannot do so.  We need to address that where it is their wish to waive their right to anonymity.<\/p><p>I will also bring forward an amendment which would allow the court, of its own motion or on the application of the DPP or another party to proceedings, to make a direction restricting any publication that is likely to lead to the identification of a deceased child or a person who was a child at the time the offence was committed but who is an adult at the time of proceedings.  In this example the person may have been a child but a few weeks later or less than a year later may have turned 18 but there is still perhaps a need for his or her identity to be restricted.  Such examples arise in other cases in the same way that the DPP can apply for that restriction not to be lifted where there is another child, perhaps a sibling, who may be hurt by the naming of his or her sibling.<\/p><p>I will bring forward an amendment to ensure that the new section 252 will apply in respect of proceedings which took place before the enactment of this Act and proceedings commenced after this Act.  The wording of the section as drafted requires amending to ensure we do not inadvertently undermine protections for children who are deceased.  Senator McDowell mentioned one case only in the past two weeks which this ruling has already impacted.  We need to make sure that this legislation will apply to those families.<\/p><p>Senators Warfield and Bacik both mentioned supporting victims.  This is an area to which I am absolutely committed.  Last week we updated the victims charter and launched a new online platform not only to ensure that victims know the supports that are available to them but also to give them a clear route through the criminal justice system, which is often difficult and complex.  There are also the different organisations that support victims of crime.  I am absolutely committed to making sure they are fully funded in order that they can plan for multiple years ahead.  That work is ongoing following on from the publication of the O'Malley report and the implementation of Supporting a Victim's Journey.<\/p><p>We will go into many of the amendments to the Bill in greater detail as we go through the Stages.  I thank Senator McDowell for introducing the Bill and for his significant engagement on this issue.  I thank Deputy Jim O'Callaghan also for his engagement on the issue.  He published a Bill just in the past week on the very same issue with Deputy Murnane O'Connor.  The collective and collaborative approach in which we are dealing with this is the best way to proceed.  It is about doing this as quickly as possible and making sure we get it right and that the legislation is correct.  I have no doubt but that as we pass through the various Stages, Senator McDowell will have the full support of all other Senators and Deputies to make sure that the parents on whose behalf we are all speaking will very soon be able to speak about and name their children publicly and remember them in the way that they want to do so and should be able to do so.  Again, I have no doubt but that we will work together to bring this legislation into effect as quickly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021021500002#GGG00200","speaker":"1502","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1613385000,"counter":188,"content":"<p>I do not wish to add very much to what the Minister has said.

If there were a homicide within a family where a father killed one child and another child is a witness to that, it cannot be the case that the mother cannot name the child because her other child was a witness who was on the record as having seen what happened.  I am simply saying we cannot use a sledgehammer to crack that particular nut.  If we want to afford anonymity to the sibling witness, so be it but it cannot be the case that the only way to do that is to make the child victim unidentifiable forever.  I am just making that point.  I fully accept the Government is concerned to achieve the best possible outcome but it does occur to me that there are subtleties here which would, in all probability, have us all back here in another 12 months.  We have had cases where there have been child witnesses to their siblings being killed or gave important evidence in the trial.  We cannot have a situation where the identity of the deceased in those particular crimes can never be disclosed because the incidental consequence would be that a child witness who was not the victim of a crime in any sense but just saw what happened would be identified.<\/p><p>I am just throwing that out as an example.  It is not an inconceivable one and the Court of Appeal would apply the same kind of strict interpretive criteria to whatever we produce in this House now as it did to the last effort.  Let us be very careful about what we actually achieve.  I am not precious at all.  If there are faults in what I have put forward, so be it.  I fully appreciate the point the Minister made about not requiring the media to constantly have a team of counsel down in court to ask for permission to do fairly obvious things.  We must have a law which is presumed to go one way unless the court goes the other way and there must be a presumption in favour of publicity rather than against it.<\/p><p>On whether this should apply retrospectively, I do not want to tear up that Court of Appeal decision.  However, I do not want a situation where, for instance, in a specific case in west Dublin, the parents of the child in question become prohibited from ever mentioning that case again because we are not affording retrospection.  This is fraught with difficulty and we must be very subtle in our approach to it to ensure we arrive at the correct result.<\/p><p>Having said those few words, I thank all the Members of the House who contributed to the debate.  I thank the Minister and the Government for adopting the course they have.  I again thank Deputy O&rsquo;Callaghan for his co-operation on the matter and the Minister&rsquo;s officials for their co-operation.  I am anxious that we get on with Committee Stage as soon as the drafting is done.  I ask the Minister not to close her mind now to amendments at that stage because we must tweak this to get it absolutely right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021021500002#JJJ00200","speaker":"1669","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1613385000,"counter":190,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1613385000,"counter":191,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to take Committee Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021021500002#KKK00250","speaker":"1689"},{"type":"speech","time":1613385000,"counter":192,"content":"<p>Next Monday week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021021500002#KKK00275","speaker":"1669"},{"type":"speech","time":1613385000,"counter":193,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?
