I discussed the issue of mortgage interest rates with the Governor of the Central Bank on 2 April.  As a result of this meeting, the Governor is currently reviewing the issue of the standard variable rates charged by the lenders.  The Governor should be in a position to present this analysis to me in the coming days.  I will then meet the six principal mortgage lenders in order to discuss this issue.<\/p>  <p>  The lending institutions in Ireland, including those in which the State has a significant shareholding, are independent commercial entities.  I, as Minister for Finance, have no statutory role in regard to regulated financial institutions setting interest rates.  The mortgage interest rates that financial institutions operating in Ireland charge to customers are determined as a result of a commercial decision by the institutions concerned.<\/p>  <p>  Equally, the Central Bank has no statutory role in the setting of interest rates by regulated entities, apart from the interest rate cap imposed on the credit union sector in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Union Act 1997 and the requirement to be notified of penalty or surcharge interest imposed in respect of arrears.  However, if the Central Bank proposed to me that it should get control of the regulation of interest rates, I would legislate for that.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that there have been moves on interest rates.  As the Deputy will be aware, on 1 May AIB Group announced a number of reductions to its mortgage interest rates for owner-occupier and buy-to-let mortgages.<\/p>  <p>  A series of reductions over a fixed timeframe would be acceptable to me, and in that context I welcome AIB's announcement as a good first step.  Competition between the banks will be crucial in ensuring that the price that the customers have to pay moves in the right direction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700003#A00600","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1430987400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply.<\/p>  <p>  Most people understand \"variable rate\" to mean that the rate will vary in line with market conditions.  I am sure the Minister will agree that the banks would not be too slow in hiking up their variable interest rate if conditions deteriorated in terms their cost of funding, for example.  Therefore, the rates need to come down.  It is very clear now that Bank of Ireland, Ulster Bank and a number of other banks are playing hardball.  They are not just going to roll over when they are called in to a meeting in the Department of Finance.  Therefore, the Minister for Finance will need to have a plan B.<\/p>  <p>  The AIB reduction is very welcome.  It is modest but a step in the right direction.  We need further rate cuts.  A 1% cut in standard variable rates across the board would put about &euro;400 million into the pockets of mortgage holders throughout the country, or 300,000 families.  That would be a very significant boost and stimulus to the domestic economy.  There is clear discrimination against existing customers.  Bank of Ireland, Permanent TSB and KBC charge 4.5% to existing customers but significantly lower rates to new customers.  That is simply unfair.  The Minister needs to outline what he will do to bring competition into the market.

Like Deputy McGrath, I welcome AIB's reduction, announced last week.  It is the second reduction that AIB has made, and I hope the other banks will follow suit.<\/p>  <p>  As I explained previously, the Central Bank is currently doing analytical work on the main lenders, namely, AIB, Bank of Ireland, Permanent TSB, Ulster Bank, KBC and ACC.  It is analysing the margin above the cost of money that the institutions are imposing for variable-rate mortgages.  As soon as I get the data from the Central Bank, I intend to engage with each of the banks separately.  I will ask them to justify their margin and explain why what they are doing is different from what the Central Bank analysis suggests.  We will proceed from there.  Ultimately, competition in the marketplace is the best lever to encourage lower interest rates.  AIB has started the process and I hope others will follow.  There are now some smaller lenders entering the mortgage market, so competition is increasing.  I would encourage that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700003#A00800","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1430987400,"counter":13,"content":"<p>Just as IDA Ireland is knocking on the doors of multinationals abroad, the Department of Finance and agents working on the Minister's behalf should be knocking on the doors of banks abroad to determine whether they would be willing to enter the Irish mortgage market to provide badly needed competition.<\/p>  <p>  We also need an active switcher market.  AIB, which now has the lowest rates in the market, should be encouraged to make resources available to advertise that and actively encourage customers of other banks to switch their mortgage.  That is the kind of dynamic we need in the market.  It is only when consumers have the option of switching mortgage from one bank to another to avail of a better interest rate that some of the other banks that are charging higher rates might reduce theirs.<\/p>  <p>  This issue will simply not go away.  It is gaining momentum.  The fact is that the rates in Ireland are way out of line with the average eurozone rate, as the Minister knows.  He read into the record the average rate in Ireland of 4.2%.  It is 2.09% in the eurozone area, which is exactly half the rate here.  Can the Minister clarify when he plans to meet the Governor of the Central Bank?  He indicated it would be this week.  Is that still the plan?

As the Deputy is aware, the Government has put in place a broad strategy to address the problem of mortgage arrears and family home repossessions.  The primary focus of this strategy is to support those home owners in difficulty with their mortgage repayments and, in so far as possible, to avoid repossession of the family home.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank of Ireland's code of conduct on mortgage arrears sets out requirements for mortgage lenders dealing with borrowers facing or in mortgage arrears on their primary residence and provides a strong consumer protection framework to ensure that borrowers struggling to keep up mortgage repayments are treated in a fair and transparent manner by their lender and that long-term resolution is sought by lenders with each of their borrowers.<\/p>  <p>  Where a borrower engages with his or her lender, a sustainable restructure arrangement to address his or her mortgage arrears situation is put in place in the majority of cases.  The Central Bank's most recent quarterly release on residential mortgage arrears and repossessions, that is, for quarter 4 of 2014, indicates that almost 115,000 restructure arrangements have been put in place.<\/p><p><i>10 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p> A key focus of any forthcoming initiative from the Government will be to ensure that distressed borrowers are fully informed about appropriate supports, how to access them and how these can help.  Many borrowers can find solutions through the options offered by the Insolvency Service of Ireland, ISI, and the Government will ensure that the personal insolvency process is as fair and effective as it can be and that the objectives as set out in the Personal Insolvency Act are realised as much as possible.  My colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, and her officials are actively preparing amendments to the legislative framework for personal insolvency.  This is aimed at enabling the Government's objectives to be met.  The aim is to ensure that more people in distressed debt access the available mechanisms than has been the case to date.<\/p> <p> Where a mortgage in arrears is deemed to be unsustainable by the lender, the mortgage to rent scheme administered by my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Kelly, may be a viable alternative and enable families to remain in the family home.  His Department is examining the possibilities for more throughput via this mechanism.<\/p> <p> The effective management of the mortgage arrears issue is an issue that remains under continual review.  More concerted action can be undertaken by the banks to assist customers in arrears.  As the Deputy is aware, the Taoiseach announced that the Government was considering a range of options to support the existing framework and to improve the uptake of personal insolvency solutions.  Given the importance of the issue, his Department is co-ordinating the response across various Departments and Government agencies and I anticipate that a detailed announcement will be forthcoming shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700005#C03600","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1430989200,"counter":74,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.  We need a greater throughput on the issue of mortgage to rent.  Fewer than 100 cases have been completed.  The process needs to be revamped, streamlined and made more efficient.  We need a clear definition of what a sustainable solution is from the point of view of the borrower and we need consistency in its application.  Personal insolvency practitioners, PIPs, need to be more available via a publicly funded panel of PIPs to persons who are dealing with debt.  We need those solutions that are working to be deployed.  The most popular is one of the least effective, namely, arrears capitalisation.  We need consistency in the way split mortgages are treated.<\/p>  <p>  I will revert to my initial point.  Above all else, we need the final say in the restructuring of a person's mortgage to be taken out of the hands of the bank and put in the hands of someone or something that is independent, be it the Insolvency Service of Ireland or a court of law.  Perhaps the Minister will address this issue and confirm the accuracy of media reports to the effect that the Government is planning changes along these lines so as to dilute the banks' veto at a minimum or, ideally, to remove it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700006#D00200","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speech","time":1430989200,"counter":75,"content":"<p>When we entered into office, we quickly put a range of options in place so that banks and lenders could interrelate with people who were in arrears and devise solutions that would enable the latter to remain in their homes while continuing to pay all or part of their mortgages.

By and large, this approach has been successful, with 115,000 mortgages reconstructed.  There are more mortgages reconstructed than there are in arrears.<\/p>  <p>  Going down the scale of difficulty, however, there is a residue of mortgages that the menu of options is not addressing or seen to be addressing.

I call on the Minister to do this because the figures are frightening.  More than 100,000 restructurings have been put in place, but we still have 110,000 accounts in arrears.  As the Minister knows, under the targets programme, the figures show that the banks have proposed 30,000 so-called solutions that involve the loss of the family home, with 16,000 of those under the heading \"Concluded\".  While that many houses have not been repossessed, if there is not a fundamental shift in thinking and in how mortgage arrears are dealt with, there will be a major ramping up of enforcement activity and the loss of family homes.

Where a tenant has been in occupation of a dwelling for a continuous period of six months and no notice of termination has been served in respect of that tenancy prior to the expiry of the six months, the tenancy is established for the remainder of the four year period and it becomes a Part 4 tenancy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700007#E00200","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1430989800,"counter":85,"content":"<p>If the bank and the receiver decide to sell the property, the tenant can do nothing about it.

In this regard, the SES outlined that fiscal space of the order of &euro;1.2 to &euro;1.5 billion will be available for budget 2016, while still complying with our obligations under the Stability and Growth Pact.  Indeed, one of the key purposes of the SES is to provide a basis for debate with relevant stakeholders in the national economic dialogue on how this fiscal space should be best used.

The 50:50 split reflects the strategy of Government to marry the objectives of encouraging economic growth while increasing the resources available to deliver quality public services.  With regard to the taxation element, according to the OECD hierarchy of taxes, labour taxes are considered one of the most harmful to economic growth.  Therefore, the Government has committed to reducing the tax burden for low and middle income earners as a means of encouraging labour market participation and subsequently economic growth.  Given the expenditure reductions over recent years, certain sectors require expenditure increases to accommodate demographic and other demand pressures.  For example, given the increase in the number of children of school-going age, the need for additional teachers has become evident.  It should be noted that expenditure on education will facilitate a more productive workforce over the longer term which will improve Ireland's potential growth rate.<\/p>  <p>  Similarly, Ireland's investment in capital is operating at a level only just below depreciation.  Further investment in capital stock will add to Ireland's growth potential.

Ultimately, the Government will use the available fiscal space to strike a balance between encouraging economic growth and ensuring that our public services are improving and fit for purpose.

First, she talked about how we were continuing to cut public expenditure.  We are not.  In the last budget, the Government increased public expenditure.  The spring statement states that we will continue to increase public expenditure between now and 2020.  We have spelled it out in precise terms for 2016.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, will spend another &euro;750 million on top of what he spent in 2015 on enhancing public services.  From 2016 to 2020, the figures provided in the spring statement have built in the extra expenditure, which runs from demographic changes.  In other words, the extra teachers, nursing home beds and so on that will be needed because of demographic changes are built into the figures.  On top of that, we think we will have space slightly in advance of the precise space identified for the 2016 budget in 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020.  There is no suggestion that we will do anything other than target the incomes of low-paid and middle income people to give them extra relief.  There are three personal taxes: USC, income tax and PRSI.  Different reliefs affect different cohorts of people.  As the Taoiseach announced in this House, we intend to reduce the burden of the universal social charge on taxpayers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700009#G00800","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1430991000,"counter":126,"content":"<p>With inflation, the increase in spending on public services that the Minister mentioned will actually amount to a decrease of 1% in real terms, according to the estimate of economists.

From 2006 to 2013, which includes some time under the Minister's watch, taxes on capital have plummeted.  There is a conscious policy not to tax those who have wealth and those who control wealth.

When the initial proposal was put to the authorities in Brussels, certain difficulties emerged, so there was a rethink and the scheme was extended to the six main cities.  The local authorities were charged with designating the areas they considered suitable.  An independent outside consultant was retained to give independent adjudication on whether the areas being included were appropriate.  All that has been resolved now, and the six local authorities have designated their areas.  The Revenue Commissioners have the arrangements in place for the tax relief.  It is now up to the private sector to see whether there will be an uptake.<\/p>  <p>  It is very difficult to know, when one conceives of such schemes, whether there will be an uptake.  Much depends on the amount of credit in the community and the level of the incentives.  In this case the incentives are of two kinds.  If, for example, somebody purchases a pre-1915 house in Waterford and pays &euro;100,000 for it, if the person then puts another &euro;100,000 into the refurbishment, he or she can write off &euro;10,000 a year for ten years against income tax.  Previously, the write-offs were not against income tax, and the persons concerned had to be owner-occupiers.  That will suit some people.  For the commercial sector, there are capital allowances for seven years, with a cap of &euro;200,000.  It is possible to combine the two.  One could refurbish a shop with an apartment overhead that is owner-occupied and avail of the double relief.  I hope it works.  The scheme is generous.

The offset was limited to 50% of the\u00a0profit of the year.  It did not disallow any tax losses from being utilised but\u00a0instead lengthened the period over which they could be used.  It is important to highlight\u00a0that the provision to allow the carry-forward of tax losses for setting off against future trading\u00a0profits\u00a0is available not only for banks but for all Irish corporates.  Accordingly, the removal of section 396C\u00a0put the covered banks in the same position as other\u00a0corporates, including other banks operating in Ireland, so it was a levelling of the playing field.<\/p><p>Section 396C was\u00a0introduced as a form of clawback\u00a0for the taxpayer.

Accordingly, in the Finance Act 2014, I decided it was appropriate to remove this provision.  The factors informing\u00a0this decision\u00a0were as follows: it improved the capital ratios under the new standards that were being introduced at the time under CRD IV; it reduced the risk to the State in its role of backstop provider of capital; and it improved the existing value of the State's equity and debt investments in the banks.  The net effect of the removal of section 396C in terms of tax receipts for the Exchequer is largely one of timing.

Most investors value banks off the new, more stringent capital rules or what is referred to as a fully loaded basis, in other words, capital when calculated when all the new CRD IV rules are taken on board.

Our Union, it is fair to say, is in a very different position from where it was a decade ago.  Financial uncertainty, conflict on our borders and a heightened threat from terrorism mean that the EU is facing challenges beyond what we could have imagined in 2005.  However, the European Union is no stranger to challenge and adversity.  After all, this is a Union which was forged in the wake of a brutal and devastating war.  As we look to the challenges of today and of the future, I am confident that the Union will draw strength from our vision of a shared future and from the shared interests and values which have successfully bound 28 member states together.<\/p>  <p>  Over recent years, the Union has had to grapple with the most serious economic crisis in its history.  Tackling the crisis has required difficult and often painful decisions, collectively and particularly by individual member states.  Today, we are in a stronger place.  Faced with grave and systematic challenges, the Union's response has been enhanced economic policy co-ordination and oversight, together with the roll-out of banking union.  This has helped both to weather the storm that originated in the 2008 global financial crisis and also to ensure that we are better able to respond to any future crises.  Most importantly, a genuine, if fragile, economic recovery is now beginning to take hold across Europe.  Ireland has been leading the way, with a growth rate of 4.8% last year.  The economies in our partner states are also increasingly beginning to recover.<\/p>  <p>  The challenge now is to ensure not just that this recovery is sustainable, but that it translates into real and tangible benefits for Europe's citizens, most importantly in the area of job creation.  There is some evidence that the improved economic outlook is feeding into the labour market, but we must do more to get people back to work.  We are particularly aware of the real difficulties faced by the Greek people.  Notwithstanding the scale of the challenge, it is my sincere hope that the ongoing negotiations between the Greek Government and the three institutions will deliver a successful outcome.<\/p>  <p>  For the European Union to be truly strong, it must have the trust and confidence of its citizens.  Unfortunately, this trust has been eroded in some ways by the painful realities of the crisis as people, and particularly young people, suffered from its most serious effects.  It is no surprise that there is a corollary between reduced economic opportunities and heightened levels of euroscepticism.  Rebuilding trust means ensuring that people can have hope again for the future.  It means supporting job creation, kick-starting investment and ensuring that credit can flow to small and medium-sized enterprises.  I hope that governments and parliaments across the Union will take the opportunity afforded by Europe Day to reflect on their own role in enhancing understanding of the Union and encouraging a more positive citizens' engagement.  The Union touches almost every aspect of our daily lives and it should, and must, be firmly part of our national dialogue.<\/p>  <p>  The European Union's neighbourhood, both to the east and to the south, has become increasingly unpredictable and unstable over the past 12 years.  This presents a challenge to the security and stability of the Union, but can also represent a challenge to our fundamental values and democratic principles.  The Union has taken decisive action by imposing sanctions on Russia in respect of its actions in Ukraine, and it has unequivocally condemned the illegal annexation of Crimea.  It also stands in solidarity with the Ukrainian Government as it works to roll out an ambitious reform programme; this support was reaffirmed at the EU-Ukraine summit on 27 April last.<\/p>  <p>  Significantly, and notwithstanding some differing perspectives among member states, the EU has maintained a unified approach to this crisis in our neighbourhood.  This will continue to be critical to our credibility and influence as we consider next steps, particularly in light of implementation of the Minsk agreements.  Key to the Union's effectiveness as a foreign policy actor is our ability to bring an array of complementary strategies to bear in a comprehensive response, from diplomacy to development assistance to civilian and military crisis response.  The world around us is being shaped by increased connectivity, but also increased complexity.<\/p>  <p>  The terrible attacks in Paris, Copenhagen and Brussels earlier this year reminded us that security threats are not just beyond the Union's borders, but also within the Union.  These were direct strikes against the values that underpin Europe.  The threat of terrorism is a problem for which there is no easy solution or magic wand.  Combatting it requires constant vigilance on the part of the EU and its member states and close and effective co-operation between our respective national policing and judicial authorities.  It also demands that we address the factors which contribute to radicalisation of Europe's citizens.  The EU's determined response to the attacks in Paris and Copenhagen has shown that such acts only serve to bring us closer together, rather than to divide us.  Member states and the Union's institutions have resolved to work more closely together than ever before in fighting terrorism.  A number of steps were agreed earlier this year and the European Council in June will review the progress achieved on these very serious matters.<\/p>  <p>  On the issue of migration, the scale of the recent terrible tragedies in the Mediterranean rightly prompted widespread shock and sorrow.  It was crucial that the EU responded with compassion and urgency; to do otherwise would have been to forsake the moral authority of our Union.  On a basic human level, we simply cannot turn the other way when innocent people are drowning off our shores.  At a specially convened summit, Heads of State and Government committed to a number of steps to help save lives, alleviate suffering and strengthen co-operation with countries in our neighbourhood.  The member states have also committed to an ambitious plan to implement these steps.  Ireland has been playing a key part in this.  We have increased the level of our humanitarian assistance to those directly affected.  We are also contributing a naval vessel to participate in the reinforced EU mission in the Mediterranean.<\/p><p><i>11 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>We have made clear that we are standing shoulder-to-shoulder with our southern EU partners who carry a substantial load when confronting these challenges.<\/p> <p> We are all aware that the British people go to the polls today.  It is no surprise that the United Kingdom's future within the European Union remains the subject of speculation.  British membership of the European Union is vital to Ireland's interests.  It is important for our economic well-being, central to the continuing development of strong British-Irish relations and vital to our long-term strategic positioning within the European Union.  We should not forget the positive influence and the benefits that joint Irish and British membership of the European Union has brought to Northern Ireland.  Given that it is central to our interests, we have been very clear about our views and these are on the record.  With today's election likely to have a significant bearing on how this issue is treated across the Irish Sea, we will be watching the results very closely.  No matter who is elected and who forms part of the next British Government we will continue to put the case to our British friends as to why our particular and shared interests are best served with Britain playing a leading role in the European Union.<\/p> <p> In considering the challenges which face the European Union today - I have only touched on some - we should not lose sight of the fact that in many of these challenges there are also very real opportunities for building a stronger and more comprehensive Internal Market, for building fairer and more equal societies, and for using our collective weight as a European Union of 28 member states to promote global peace, security and development.  The interconnected nature of our world means that the challenges of today cannot be tackled by states acting in isolation.  We must and we will work together as a European Union with focused determination.<\/p> <p> On this important day for Europe, I assure the House that Ireland will continue to play a positive, active and engaged role as a proud member of the European Union in tackling those challenges and in harnessing new opportunities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700011#J00400","speaker":"985","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1430992800,"counter":158,"content":"<p>Fianna F&aacute;il is committed to a democratic and accountable European Union of member states who work together for the mutual benefit of all Europe's citizens.  We believe strongly In the principle of subsidiarity which guarantees the freedom of member states to act where they are most effective.  In the past two decades we have seen a number of European institutional developments which have sought to deepen and enhance the process of European integration.  While we do not wish to see any of these rolled back, we recognise that the speed and nature of some of these moves have left many citizens unsure and disconnected from the European Union.  The EU must pursue policies which promote growth, equality and fairness for all its citizens.  While we strongly believe that Ireland's best interests politically and economically are best served by our remaining at the centre of the European Union and the eurozone, we also believe that we must critically analyse all political developments in the European Union to ensure that the interests of the Irish people are best served by those developments.  As the Minister of State said this debate takes place as the British people go to the polls today.  The outcome would appear too close to call at this point.  We must be conscious that the Conservative party has contested the election with a pledge to a referendum on continued membership of the European Union.<\/p>  <p>  In the event of the Tory party leading the next British Government, there will be legislation in the first session of the next parliament for an in-out referendum to be held on Britain's membership of the European Union before the end of 2017.  The Tories pledge to negotiate a new settlement for Britain in the European Union and then will ask the British people whether they want to stay in on this basis, or leave.  A key part of this will be immigration and the Tories want to renegotiate welfare rules so that immigrants have to be working for a certain period in Britain before they can claim benefits.  That is the pledge that has been made.  Britain is Ireland's biggest trading partner and close ally in the European institutions.  We can have strong, robust differences on particular issues but I know from my own experience, I am sure the Minister of State will agree, that Britain is a close ally on a huge number of important issues of mutual concern and interest to both countries.  It is also the only country with whom we share a land border.<\/p>  <p>  It is essential that we have a contingency plan in the event that the UK decides to leave the European Union.  Such an action plan in place would outline the policy to be pursued to lessen the impact of any British decision to leave on our economy, on our position in European Union and our vital relationship with the UK overall.  Coming from a rural parish that borders County Fermanagh I grew up with the customs posts and the permanent vehicle checkpoints.  At our recent Ard-Fheis on a session on Northern Ireland, there was huge participation from the floor in regard to the question of British continued membership of the European Union.  Many of the contributions from the floor were from people who live in Northern Ireland who are party members and people originally from the North of Ireland who are now living in the State.  Their absolute concern was in regard to possible developments and Britain's continued membership of the European Union.  It would be an absolute nightmare if Ireland was a member of the Single Market and Britain was not which would necessitate it leaving the Single Market if it left the European Union.  We do not want customs posts back in south Ulster and along part of Leinster and Connacht.  That would be a nightmare from the point of view of trade, commerce and developing business.  Thankfully, since the mid 1990s we have had huge progress on a North-South basis and on an east-west basis also and we want that progress to continue.  It has been asserted by some in Britain that they can quit the European Union but retain full access to the Single Market.  This is a ludicrous contention. Membership of the European Union must have some distinct advantages and responsibilities.<\/p>  <p>  The Greek situation remains very serious.  We have consistently argued as a party that Greece needs further substantial action on its debt if it is to be given a credible path to growth.  There have been encouraging signs in recent days in regard to dealing with the particular issues that will arise shortly in regard to debt repayments and hopefully the necessary progress can be made.<\/p>  <p>  One of the very difficult issues the European Union has to face up to is relationships with the East and, particularly, with Russia.  We should be developing stronger relationships with Russia.  It is not the European Union's fault that there have been negative developments in the past 18 months.  It is clear that all is not well with the political system in Moscow.  Increasing Russian aggression towards its neighbours and internally towards political opponents is a most frightening development.  There appears to be an increasing culture of fear in Russia.  Current Russian foreign policy has resulted in war in Ukraine with untold devastation and the undermining of that country's sovereignty.  Even Ireland, a country which has traditionally had a distinctly cordial relationship with Russia, has been touched by this aggression through the infringement of Irish controlled air space by Russian military aircraft.  This we have learned resulted in commercial air traffic having to be diverted or suspended when travelling to and from Irish airports.  That is not acceptable.  Irish controlled air space has to be under the control of the relevant authorities.  That abuse by the Russians is not acceptable.  There is so much potential with regard to possible increased trade.  We have witnessed the results of sanctions being imposed by the European Union and the negative effect they have had on various sectors particularly in the food area.  We would like to see agreement reached from the point of view of commitments being made and conditions established to ensure trade can resume.<\/p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il calls for a re-examination of the structures of the Economic and Monetary Union as well as the mandate of the European Central Bank.  The architecture to ensure the long-term sustainability of the eurozone still needs to be put in place to provide a secure basis for the future prosperity of the European Union.  The ECB's mandate must require policies for targeted growth as well as targeting inflation.  The European Union must fulfil its commitment to separate sovereign debt and banking debt within the Union.  The Euro Area Heads of State or Government agreed in June 2012 to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns.  It is now time to fulfil this commitment by retroactively recapitalising Irish banks and recognising the unfair burden Ireland has largely due to ECB insistence at critical points of the financial crisis.<\/p>  <p>  Europe must lead in the fight against climate change.  We must ensure that the European Union supports sustainable, sensible and renewable energy policies at a European level.  The European Union must also ensure that our international partners keep their commitments to reduce the causes of climate change internationally.  The implementation of policies to tackle climate change must ensure the safeguarding of sustainable food production systems, which are vitally important in the fight against hunger and malnutrition.  We support policies which reduce European dependency on outside energy resources.  The EU must pursue policies which increase energy security and stability within the Union.<\/p><p>Fianna F&aacute;il believes that the EU's enlargement policy is one of the most effective foreign policy tools the Union has at its disposal.  Our party has, however, consistently outlined that it is important to consolidate the new EU legislative structures introduced in the Treaty of Lisbon and to continue to build economic stability in the EU in advance of any further enlargement.<\/p> <p> I do not think the Minister of State referred to the proposed transatlantic trade and investment partnership, TTIP.  Fianna F&aacute;il supports the successful and balanced conclusion of the EU-US free trade agreement.  It has the potential to boost the European economy but we have to be conscious of concerns surrounding food standards and safety.  The EU must ensure that food standards are not diminished in Europe by this agreement.  In that regard, the Irish Government must raise its voice to defend Ireland's interests in agriculture and the agrifood sector in the negotiation of this deal.  Fianna F&aacute;il is also opposed to any agreement which allows for the undermining of the Irish courts' jurisdiction through an investor-state dispute settlement, ISDS, clause.  The EU must make a clear decision and commitment in the negotiations that there be no dumbing down of workers' rights in any proposed agreement.  That has to be a kernel of our position. <\/p> <p> This is the first time that a round of funding for the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, has been reduced, between 2014 and 2020.  Thankfully, the milk quotas were abolished at the end of March.  We secured a commitment at the health check of the CAP review in November 2008 to the ending of milk quotas at the end of March 2015.  That was a very good decision but many members of the EU did not support it enthusiastically.  We were one of the few countries that were very vigorous and forceful in demanding that the EU abolish milk quotas.  Subsequently, and it was utterly crazy, many member states made an effort in late 2009 to pause that decision to abolish quotas, which would have sent a terrible mixed message to the farmers in the EU who would not know whether or not quotas would be abolished.  We fought that vigorously.  The decision confirmed in 2008 remained in place and, thankfully, that restriction has been removed from our farmers.<\/p> <p> It is disappointing that the EU is imposing a super levy on farmers just at the time when they need to invest to expand.  All of us who represent rural counties are particularly conscious of the opportunity there is for farmers to expand but that needs investment.  Unfortunately, the EU is imposing that super levy on farmers which is most regrettable.  The levy goes back into central funds and is not necessarily kept to support the dairy sector.  I hope the Government will try to get the EU to change on this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700012#K00200","speaker":"970","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1430993400,"counter":160,"content":"<p>Seventy years ago today the remaining Nazi leaders signed a total and unconditional surrender order which ended the Second World War.  Out of the ashes and devastation that the war brought there was a growing realisation that something needed to change in order to ensure that Europe never fought another war of this magnitude and the need for greater co-operation and solidarity was obvious.  The evils of fascism remained in some European countries, but many others marched forward progressively, creating more inclusive societies by building public health services and welfare systems which worked to create a safety net for millions who were experiencing poverty and hunger.<\/p><p>This Saturday, 9 May, marks the EU celebration of Europe Day.  There will be a handful of official parties but it will go unnoticed by millions of citizens across Europe.  It marks the date of the Schuman Declaration in 1950, which proposed the pooling of French and West German coal and steel industries and led to the creation of the European Coal and Steel Community.  The people of this State voted to join what was then the European Economic Community on 10 May 1972.  Many who argued against joining, highlighted issues such as sovereignty, independence, neutrality and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, NATO, the exploitation and use of natural resources, including mineral wealth, and the critical issue of jobs.  There was also a discussion at that time about the direction of European and how it would evolve.  Much has changed since then but many of the concerns raised at that time are equally relevant today.  The EU is now made up of 27 members.<\/p><p>Two of the biggest challenges facing Europe now are the crisis in Greece and the drownings in the Mediterranean.  At the heart of both issues lies the absence or the complete misunderstanding of the responsibilities and nature of solidarity.  The Mediterranean is quickly becoming a graveyard.  Last year, 3,200 men, women and children died while trying to cross the Mediterranean in coffin ships to reach the EU.  Many came from impoverished countries in Africa and Asia and were fleeing conflict, persecution, and hunger.  A total of 170,000 made the journey safely and landed in Italy in 2014.  Over 1,700 people have died in the first four months of this year while trying to cross the Mediterranean.  That is 100 times more than this time last year.  How can we, as human beings and Europeans, turn aside and ignore this huge humanitarian crisis?  This summer hundreds of thousands of tourists will be flying to the beaches of the Mediterranean to enjoy themselves.  At the same time hundreds of thousands of adults and children will be making their perilous journeys, placed in overcrowded and unsafe rafts, dinghies and boats, desperately trying to reach the beaches, towns and cities of Europe.  Thousands more face drowning.<\/p><p>We have heard that EU governments have planned to triple Triton&rsquo;s mission budget to &euro;9 million per month and provide some more rescue boats.  As we face into this worsening crisis the plans for more money and rescue ships have yet to be realised.  Just last weekend 6,770 people were rescued by the Italian coastguard.  The Italian navy is still conducting search and rescue missions, while the EU&rsquo;s Triton mission is primarily concerned with patrolling the EU&rsquo;s borders.  This is wrong and needs to be changed.  It does not matter how much money is pumped into the Triton mission unless it has an active search and rescue mandate.<\/p><p>I welcome the fact the Minister for Defence is planning to send the<i>LE Eithne<\/i>to the region.  However, we also need to examine and increase the number of refugees that Ireland accepts.  For our population size we are taking far too few.  We cannot rescue migrants and just drop them off in Malta and Italy and forget about them.  We need to show greater solidarity with southern Mediterranean countries.  There needs to be an EU focus on increasing our collective support and help to southern European countries which are on the front line and one of those initiatives must be to increase Europe&rsquo;s refugee quota.  The world is experiencing an unprecedented number of simultaneous humanitarian crises and the UN estimates that 50 million people are currently displaced.  Ireland must play its part on the front line and at home.<\/p><p>The EU continues to mishandle Greece&rsquo;s unstable debt and economic crisis.  It is unacceptable that it fails to recognise that Greece&rsquo;s debt is unsustainable and that this is also causing a humanitarian crisis, and needs to be reformed.  The EU and the IMF are stalling progress on these vital issues.  They continue to disagree on Greece&rsquo;s reforms and debt, and this is to the widespread detriment of Greece and its people.<\/p><p> Where is the solidarity that was supposed to be the spine of the EU when it was established?  The EU's decisions on Greece continue to be led by the Eurogroup.  The Eurogroup is now a key body in the EU&rsquo;s economic governance but it is not democratically accountable to anyone.  Legally speaking, it is not an institution of the EU.  It cannot make any laws.  Regardless of that, however, no money will be released to Greece unless the Eurogroup says so.  The Eurogroup does not have to update the public or the institutions on its work and no minutes of its meetings are kept.  It is clearly in need of significant reform to tackle its lack of accountability and transparency.  The Eurogroup, with the connivance of Europe&rsquo;s finance Ministers, continues to bully and punish the Greek people for voicing their democratic wishes and seeking a fairer way forward.  <\/p> <p> Europe and its leaders would do well to reflect on the lessons of the past and to remember the issues that led to the rise of fascism in the past and that are leading to the growth of right-wing groups across Europe, as well as the decisions to cancel mass unsustainable debts after the Second World War and how this allowed European countries to recover and invest in their welfare states.  This type of solidarity is hugely important in building a Europe of equals.  Sadly, the EU is instead creating a two-tier Europe filled with inequality.  It is a dangerous route and we need to learn the lessons from the tragedies that happened in the past.  We can move forward.  <\/p> <p> People describe my party as anti-European, but it is far from that.  We are critical of Europe and want to see a different Europe emerge.  This message is growing across Europe.  People want to see a different type of Europe - a Europe of solidarity.  Those in need must be supported by all of us.  The two issues I highlighted here this morning are clearly two messages that we can resolve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700013#L00200","speaker":"1037","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1430994000,"counter":162,"content":"<p>I am not sure why we are having this debate.  I know it is Europe Day but it would be absurd to imagine that anybody in Europe is going to take the slightest bit of notice of what we say in this debate today.  It is a grandiose title.  We talk about the challenges facing the EU.  The cursory speech from the Minister of State did not really paint any vision of the future.  If this was of some significance, the German ambassador or someone like that might be in the Visitors Gallery listening to what we have say.<\/p>  <p>  We know that this debate will cause no ripples in Europe.  I will illustrate this with one incident that took place last week.  Our relationship with Europe is one of supplicant and master.  The Minister of State will be aware that last Friday, the former president of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, came over here to appear before our democratic representatives at the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis.  It was a lap of honour by a man who is not elected but who is obviously more powerful than the democratically elected representatives here.  Mr. Trichet appeared on his own terms before the committee.  His appearance was prefaced by a 50-minute speech from him which was applauded by the europhiles in the audience.  It was followed by two speeches, one by Michael Somers, the deputy chairman of AIB, which applauded Mr. Trichet, and another by a professor of European affairs.  After that, a couple of tame questions were thrown in by people involved in European business, followed by the democratic representatives, on limited time, who asked questions that Mr. Trichet failed to answer.  Unfortunately, this is the kind of relationship Ireland has with Europe.  It was symbolic of the attitude we have.  We do as we are told, bow and scrape and let them away with that sort of dictatorial attitude.  That is not how it should be.  The Minister of State's speech today should have spelt out the consequences of a victory for the Tories in the British general election, which is happening today, and the consequences for Ireland if the UK does leave the EU, because this is the most serious issue and the big challenge that faces us.  There is absolutely no mention of what should be there, which is plan B.  If this happens to us, we will no longer be semi-detached members.  We will virtually cut off because of the decision of our biggest trading partner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700014#M00200","speaker":"953"},{"type":"speech","time":1430994000,"counter":163,"content":"<p>If Europe is supposed to mean anything, it should be about international solidarity among the peoples of Europe and creating a beacon of progress and an agency of peace in the world.  However, that is not what the EU looks like today.  We have war in Ukraine, in which Europe has a hand, hundreds of people desperately trying to get into Europe to escape terrible situations in the developing world and losing their lives in the Mediterranean, and cruel austerity inflicted for the past seven years at the behest of the people who seem to really run Europe - the bankers, bondholders and money men.  They are inflicting really vicious austerity on the ordinary citizens of Europe, to the point at which the EU is threatened with a break-up.  This is what we are looking at with the possibility that the general election in the UK could lead to the possible exit of that country from the EU.  There is also the very precarious situation in Greece, which could be forced out of the EU because of the really bloody-minded and vindictive attitude of the European authorities, and, behind them, the ECB and the financial markets in Europe, which find it acceptable to sacrifice the livelihoods, services, dignity and rights of the people of Greece on the altar of profit and maintaining the international financial system of speculation, banking and so on.  Europe is in a very precarious situation, and one can add to that the very alarming rise of neo-fascist organisations in Germany, Greece and France and the rise of the far right in the UK.  These are very worrying signs.  One can add to that the shameful collaboration of the EU with Israel, which has been given favoured trading status.  While Israel crushes the Palestinian people in a most obscene and brutal way, Europe does nothing about it but continues to do business with it.<\/p>  <p>  If we want to save the European project, we must remember that human beings come first.  Europe must not be a place of money men, bankers, bondholders and people who only see the bottom line.  It must be a place that puts the rights and dignity of human beings front and centre, regardless of whether they are human beings trying to enter Europe or ordinary working people across the Europe.  If we fail to do that, the EU is riding towards a crisis and a break-up, and the darker possibility of a return to the sort of crises we saw in the 1930s, with all the horrendous consequences that followed from that.<\/p><p>We are at a critical crossroads.

Like every other Deputy, I abhor the Russian aggression in the Ukraine.  However, there is a danger that the West will overlook the ongoing widespread corruption in the Ukraine, which does not appear to have abated since President Yanukovych was removed from power.  In 2014, the Ukraine was ranked 142 out of 175 countries in the Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index, which makes puts it among what are considered to be the most highly corruptible countries and on a par with Uganda and Nigeria.  I acknowledge that Russia has played an important role in bolstering this system of corruption.  I have no truck for Putin's methods or his relationships with some of the oligarchs in the Ukraine.  However, besides a couple of stunts on camera, few meaningful steps have been taken by the current administration in the Ukraine since taking office to tackle the imbedded system of corruption.  A package of anti-corruption measures-laws were passed but the new coalition government comprises many of the same people suspected of having milked millions out of the system.  <\/p>  <p>  The old ways of doing business in the Ukraine remain in operation.  For years, an elite, ruthless few churned elicit profits into bank accounts around the world while the West turned a blind eye.  These oligarchs are still holding the Ukraine economy to hostage.  They will not hesitate to resort to additional legal means to maintain their sources of income and power.  They have no interest in building a new country.  As acknowledged by many governments across Europe, the infamous Right Sector still holds enormous power in the Ukraine.  Only two weeks ago, the press secretary of the Right Sector said in an interview that Europe needed to be told the right way to go so as to save it from the terrible situation of total liberalism.  This is what members of the Ukraine Government are telling those who do not go to church or are tolerant of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights.  It is crucial that we in the West take a strong position on the participation of the far right in the new government and on the uncontrolled rightist paramilitaries on the streets of Ukraine.  The new government must run the country properly.  Currently, the Ukraine is crippled by war and corruption and there is no point in the West seeking an end for the former without a willingness to rule out the latter.  <\/p>  <p>  I take this opportunity to acknowledge the tremendous work being done by Deputy Dominic Hannigan as Chairman of the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs.  It is an honour to work with him on that committee.  He does superb work right across Europe, which is recognised across Europe.  <\/p>  <p>  We need to monitor the situation in the Ukraine, which may become critical in the coming months.  We need to be careful how we line up in terms of our dealings with this absolutely corrupt regime that appears to have some influence with Europe.

I welcome this debate on the challenges facing the European Union.  As Chairman of the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs, it is a pleasure to speak on this issue on Europe Day.  It is fitting that we mark Europe Day and recall that Europe, notwithstanding the flaws and many difficulties with which we are faced, about which we heard earlier from other Deputies, has developed into a place that values cultural diversity and has brought lasting peace to member states and religious freedom, fundamental rights and human rights to the citizens within its borders.  I am delighted to be here today and welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, to the House for this debate.<\/p>  <p>  Europe Day is not just a one day event for the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs in that it engages in ongoing debate on issues of importance.  Only last week, the committee held a debate with former EU Commissioner Peter Sutherland, the Italian Ambassador and others on the migration crisis in the European Mediterranean region and how we can react to that humanitarian crisis.  As a result of that meeting, we will be sending a letter to the Taoiseach outlining the views of the committee in regard to what needs to be done in the region.  One of the clear views expressed by all members of the committee was that Europe is not doing enough to tackle this crisis, including in terms of the number of refugees being taken in by all member states.  We expect and hope that the Taoiseach will take on board our views and ensure that other European leaders are aware of the comments of the citizens of Ireland and act on them.<\/p>  <p>  The joint committee tries to play an integral role on behalf of the Oireachtas in the developing role of national parliaments in the European Union and ensuring that national parliamentarians have a role at European level.  The role of the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs has evolved over time from that of a committee which scrutinises the laws and legislation coming from Europe to that of a committee which now also focuses on policy, which is one of the reasons for the meeting last week on the migration issue.  The committee also addresses other issues such as the gap that exists between citizens and Europe and what Europe is doing.  <\/p>  <p>  This afternoon, the committee will engage in a discussion on changing attitudes towards the European Union.  Members will be aware from talking to Irish citizens during various referenda campaigns that the level of support for Ireland's continued membership of the European Union has decreased.  The committee is seeking to gain an understanding of the reason people are turning against the European project.  The question of why support for the European Union is declining must be asked.  As such, the committee will hear at its meeting this afternoon with the Irish Countrywomen's Association, the National Youth Council of Ireland and others what they believe can be done to combat the decrease in buy-in to Europe.<\/p>  <p>  Another vital issue, which was raised earlier by Deputy Ross, is the reason nobody is speaking about the elephant in the room when it comes to Europe, namely, what Britain will do.  As members will be aware, a general election is underway in Britain today.  For the past three months, the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs has been addressing the issue of a possible exit by Britain from Europe.  Deputy Ross may not be aware of that but members of the committee, some of whom are in the House now, are well aware of the implications of such an exit on Ireland.  The committee will in the coming weeks present a report on what it considers to be the implications for Ireland of a British exit.  It is no secret that outgoing Prime Minister Cameron has said that if returned to government he will hold a referendum on this matter within the next two years.  The view of the committee is that regardless of who is in government in the UK, a referenda will be held.  There is a boil in terms of Britain's ongoing involved with the European Union that needs to be lanced.  The implications of this for Ireland will be profound.  This issue has been considered by the committee.  I have no doubt the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs, other committees and the Department will be monitoring this issue on an ongoing basis to ensure there is clarity regarding the implications of such an exit for Ireland and how we should react to it, including what negotiation strategies to employ to ensure we mitigate any impact on our citizens.<\/p>  <p>  When it comes to the role of national parliaments, we are trying to ensure that national parliaments utilise the powers given to them under the Lisbon treaty to the fullest extent.  An issue often raised by national parliamentarians, not only by Irish parliamentarians but parliamentarians from other countries, is the relative shift in power away from national parliamentarians towards the European Parliament and European Commission as a result of the Lisbon treaty.  The Lisbon treaty gives national parliamentarians additional powers, some of which were ground-breaking at the time of their introduction.  The right of national parliaments to scrutinise and influence EU legislation on the basis of subsidiarity was enshrined in the treaties at the time of the adoption of the Lisbon treaty.  There are issues in relation to what the definition means and what we can do with it.<\/p><p>After five years of experience there is a growing sense that we need to develop those powers further.  My committee is dealing with a number of other national parliaments, notably with the British, Dutch, Danish and Polish parliaments.  Next week a number of committee members will attend a meeting in Warsaw on the yellow card issue and how the role of national parliaments can be improved.  I expect an outcome of that meeting will be proposals that can be put to the European Commission and to the new First Vice-President, Mr. Frans Timmermans, on how the role of national parliamentarians can be improved over the coming years.  We have received a firm commitment from the new European Union Commission to better engage with national parliaments.  There is an understanding on its part that national parliaments have lost out somewhat, relatively speaking, since the Lisbon treaty.  This is acknowledged by the Commission and it is willing to see an improved and increased role for national parliamentarians.  We will do what we can to improve our engagement with the Commission.<\/p> <p> In the past two years we have set out a number of considered political contributions to the Commission.  Last year, we put forward our views on how the Europe 2020 strategy could be improved.  We also talked about how we wanted to see the social rights of European citizens more enshrined in European Union legislation and policy, looking at issues such as the pay gender gap, part-time work and the need to ensure that jobs, when created, provide a living wage.  Conditions of work such as zero contract hours have a negative impact on the lives of employees.  We have been making political contributions to the European Commission on a number of issues over the past number of years and we will continue to do so.  We need to communicate better the message of the work done by the Oireachtas and by the European Union.<\/p> <p> I note a previous speaker said that nobody would be watching this debate.  However, I know that many ambassadors watch these debates all the time.  They may not be in the public audience today but I can guarantee that they are watching on television as this debate is broadcast live on Oireachtas TV and on the Oireachtas website.  People watch these debates and they find them very useful and I often get feedback from ambassadors and others as to the nature of our discussions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700015#N00300","speaker":"1076","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1430995200,"counter":168,"content":"<p>I am pleased to have the opportunity to make a brief contribution to this important debate at this time in Ireland's history.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Party is committed to a democratic and accountable European Union of member states who work together for the mutual benefit of all Europe's citizens.  We believe strongly in the principle of subsidiarity which guarantees the freedom of member states to act where they are most effective.<\/p><p>I wish to focus on an issue that is coming down the tracks.  David Cameron, the outgoing British Prime Minister has stated:<blockquote>I am in favour of a referendum.  I believe in confronting this issue - shaping it, leading the debate.  Not simply hoping a difficult situation will go away.<\/blockquote>The big question is if the UK votes to leave the EU, where does Ireland stand as Britain's largest trading partner?  Our trade with Britain was clearly important in the process of economic recovery over the past three or four years.  Where will the trading arrangement stand if Britain decides to opt out of membership?  Given the close economic as well as geographical, political, cultural, social and historic connections between Ireland and the UK, we are extremely exposed if Britain decides to leave the EU.  The UK is Ireland's biggest trading partner and close ally in the European institutions.  It is also the only country with whom we share a land border.  It is essential that we have a contingency plan in the event that the UK decides to leave the European Union.<\/p><p>The voting in the United Kingdom general election is being held today.  The Conservatives have indicated that they are in favour of a referendum.  The view has been expressed by previous speakers that other parties will opt for a referendum, given the general attitude prevailing in Britain towards EU membership.  <\/p><p>Ireland and Britain trade over &euro;1 billion worth of goods and services every week.  Almost 200,000 people in Ireland are employed as a result of our exports to the UK.  Recent data from the Central Statistics Office shows that 43% of exports from Irish firms were destined for the UK.  To put this in real numbers, approximately &euro;6.8 billion was destined for the UK.  This is the same amount that the Government is planning to invest in commercial projects of benefit to the economy and which will be overseen by the National Treasury Management Agency over the next five years.  The move could also lead to the re-introduction of border controls between Ireland and Northern Ireland.  This would have a disastrous effect on the people of County Louth and the Louth constituency who travel across the Border for trade, business and family reasons, on a regular basis.  A UK exit from the EU would also damage co-operation in tackling cross-Border crime and would put in jeopardy the strong relationship that has been built between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI in recent years.<\/p><p>It is for the people of the UK to decide for themselves in a referendum as to whether they want to remain part of the EU.  However, Ireland has an obligation to highlight the profound benefits associated with EU membership both for them and for us.  The Government needs to continue advocating the benefits of EU membership for both Ireland and the UK.  None the less, the Government needs to have a contingency plan in place certainly for the period of the referendum campaign.  I call on the Taoiseach and the Government to develop a strategic position for Ireland that takes into account the risks for Ireland should the UK decide to leave the EU.  These risks need to be identified and minimised as quickly as possible.<\/p><p>Another market in which Ireland and the UK are interlinked is the energy market.  Ireland imports 89% of its oil products and 93% of its gas from the UK.  The Irish electricity grid has been linked to Britain since 2001.  The gas grids are also connected via Scotland.  A UK exit from the EU could impact negatively on security of energy supplies and might increase the cost of connecting to the internal energy market.<\/p><p>Clearly, more than any other country, we want Britain to stay in the European Union.  We have to ask how high a price we will pay in order to keep Britain in the EU.  The undermining of the core of the Union, stripping away consumer and worker protections and restricting the ability to address clear problems in the Union, would be too high a price to pay.  It has been asserted by some in the UK that they can quit the Union but retain full access to the single market.  This is profoundly ludicrous.  Membership of the Union must have some distinct advantages and responsibilities.  We have no difficulty with the UK staying out of the eurozone.  If it wishes to opt out of a broader budget there are means of accommodating it but the Union has to be about something more than trade.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700016#O00200","speaker":"945"},{"type":"speech","time":1430995200,"counter":169,"content":"<p>My colleagues will focus on different aspects of the challenges facing the EU while I will focus on TTIP and ISDS.  The Government is claiming that 8,000 jobs could be created and GDP could increase by 1.1% through TTIP2.  We have heard all the spin before.  I recall all the jobs promised at the time of the Lisbon negotiations but these have yet to materialise for many in Ireland or across the EU.  TTIP is aimed at stimulating trade.  However, trade between the two blocs has never been better and goods worth &euro;1.8 billion are exchanged every day between the US and EU.<\/p><p> Ireland has a strong and arguably unique alliance with America with a range of existing bilateral agreements.  Irish exports to the United States grew year-on-year by almost 1.3% in 2013 and are now in the region of &euro;18.4 billion.  I believe the Government, probably to suit its own agenda, is drawing on best case scenario figures.  It is suggested that figures used by those in favour of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership are vastly overblown and are being used to convince a sceptical electorate of the benefits of what is a risky agreement.  TTIP could have an adverse effect on Irish exports to the European Union, which account for over 60% of total exports.  One study has quantified this and suggested that in a deep liberalisation scenario intra-EU trade could fall by approximately 30%.<\/p> <p> We are calling on the Government to commission an objective study and report to assess the real benefits and risks facing Ireland as a result of TTIP.  It is not good enough that we sit on our hands and cling hard to bloated statistics.  Rhetoric alone is not going to address this.  We need informed negotiators who can show leadership and ensure a fair deal for people.  The European Commission is negotiating this deal on behalf of Europe.  The Lisbon treaty gave that power to the European Commission without any input or transparency.  Furthermore, as a result of the Lisbon treaty, member states have lost the power to veto these types of agreements.  The European Parliament only has the power to reject or approve the entire deal after it has been negotiated.<\/p> <p> The negotiations thus far have been shrouded in secrecy.  An EU mandate document was leaked in early October 2014 and was subsequently declassified.  The EU is considered to have high regulatory standards, a characteristic some industries have long complained about as representing a barrier to trade.  However, these standards are in place for a reason, that is, to protect communities and consumers.  Some vested interests want TTIP to become a platform for making changes to regulation to make industry more profitable for companies.  This would have negative impacts on public policy and would come at a great social cost.  These behind closed doors negotiations are being carried out by people who are neither elected nor accountable to Irish or EU citizens.  The greatest threat to democracy in all of this is the investor-state dispute settlement, ISDS, mechanism.  The ISDS mechanism allows corporations to sue governments even for loss of expected revenue when government regulations are seen to affect expected profits.  Through ISDS, companies can bypass the national court systems and appeal directly to international investor-based tribunals.  For example, a company could potentially sue for loss of profits if a government banned fracking in its area.  We know that Australia is being sued for damages by a major tobacco giant in response to public health measures to restrict smoking.  There have been several threats by companies to sue Ireland to compensate for lost profits.  Currently, there is no mechanism for companies to do this in Ireland but with the ISDS mechanism that will no longer be the case.  Many member states, including Germany, have stated their opposition to the inclusion of the ISDS mechanism.<\/p> <p> Irish people are becoming increasingly aware of the presence and activities of a golden circle of those in big business who always seem to benefit from Government decisions and choices.  I maintain that TTIP and the ISDS mechanism represent a framework for a worldwide golden circle.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700016#O00300","speaker":"1083","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1430995800,"counter":171,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan whom I understand is sharing time with Deputy Catherine Murphy and Deputy Paul Murphy.

In particular, the ISDS mechanism represents a challenge because it will enable foreign investors to directly sue state governments which have been democratically elected.  These companies will have the legal right to challenge any regulatory or policy measures of a host state that interfere with their ability to make profits or access markets.  There are consequences for the ability of countries to maintain domestic regulatory space.  The question for Europe is how foreign investors will be held accountable for damage caused through their operations.  Although we are told of the potential market of 800 million people for European business, this represents giving too much power to profit-making companies.  There is an example of this from Canada, where gas and oil exploration companies have taken the Canadian Government to court for millions.  The implication is that this will have an effect on that government's ability in respect of policy-making on the environment.<\/p><p>Yesterday, I referred specifically to education and the potential, through the ISDS mechanism, for an increased commercialisation and privatisation of our colleges and educational establishments.  There is pressure to expand the scope of education commitments in TTIP.  The EU must ensure that education is excluded.<\/p><p>There are also implications for culture and the arts.  France was able to secure an exception for its film industry to protect it from the Hollywood blockbuster industry, but there are implications for the arts and theatre in this country.  The challenge for Europe is to ensure the protection of workers' rights, food and the environment as well as to ensure that governments act in the public good.  It is vital that we have an open and frank debate on the issue in the House.<\/p><p>The other challenge I am keen to explore is derived from my chairing of the Irish section of the Association of European Parliamentarians with Africa, AWEPA.  This has to do with the EU relationship with the developing world.  Despite the progress made on the millennium development goals, poverty and inequality remain major challenges in the world and for the EU, as do political instability and conflict.  These problems are causing people to risk their lives.  Today over 1,000 people who lost their lives on the <i>Lusitania<\/i>are being commemorated but we must think of the thousands who have lost their lives.  Europe has been found wanting in this regard.<\/p><p>Part of the reason for this inequality is the multinational and transnational companies moving into the developing world.  Through coercion, bribes, fraud and the use of military goods they are clearing people off their land.  This is having severe effects on food security and the environment.<\/p><p>There has been a process at European level towards a more transparent international tax regime but Europe must face this challenge and continue to press for transparency, country-by-country reporting and ensure no illicit flows of capital.  Moreover, EU member states must implement legally-binding limits to the vulture fund claims in national jurisdictions.<\/p><p>A new report to be launched next week will call for Ireland and the EU to make clear the level of human rights due diligence that they expect of Irish and European companies working in the developing world.  The report will be about Africa but it should equally apply to Irish and European companies working in Asia and South America.  Some of these companies have offices in the European countries.  I offer one final statistic.  International trade union conferences are claiming that 4,000 workers could lose their lives before a ball is kicked at the Qatar World Cup football finals in 2020.  That is a major challenge for the EU.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700017#P00300","speaker":"1005"},{"type":"speech","time":1430995800,"counter":173,"content":"<p>I want to focus on debt, climate and social Europe.  We need to get to grips with the European debt mountain and to reset our ambition away from the idea that has dominated Europe in the past seven years, that is, the sense that the EU has become an agency of fiscal control more than anything else.  What of the Lisbon treaty, the social chapter, social solidarity and a European Union that puts citizens first?<\/p>  <p>  A debt conference is absolutely essential.  It is not only programme countries that have a problem with the debt mountain.  For example, other countries above the 60% target include Germany, France, Belgium, the United Kingdom and Netherlands.  These are in addition to the likes of Italy, Spain, Cyprus, Slovenia, Portugal and, of course, Greece.<\/p>  <p>  We cannot grow the European economy without a fiscal expansion into key areas.  In respect of our country, we need to appreciate fully the requirement to tackle climate change.  We were told last week by the Minister that this would cost us &euro;300 million per year in hard cash because we will not meet the 2020 targets.  That cost will apply every year.  We run the risk of these fines.  Ireland is importing approximately &euro;7 billion in fossil fuels annually and we are almost 90% dependent on these imports.  Therefore, we need to invest in public transport.<\/p><p><i>12 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>That is where the fiscal expansion is needed.  We need to have a major programme of home energy retrofitting and we also need to invest in areas such as broadband.

We have saved the euro at the expense of democratic accountability.  Inter-governmentalism has dominated the Council throughout the crisis.  We have to move away from being led by politicians who are only concerned with the pragmatic present, and we need to have a vision for the kind of Europe we need to become.<br\/><br\/>I have quoted J&uuml;rgen Habermas in the past.  He said:<blockquote>If one wants to preserve the monetary union, it is no longer enough ... to provide loans to over-indebted states so that each should improve its competitiveness by its own efforts.  What is required is solidarity instead, a co-operative effort from a shared political perspective to promote growth and competitiveness in the eurozone as a whole.<br \/><br \/>Such an effort would require Germany and several other countries to accept short and medium-term negative redistribution effects in its own longer term self-interest - a classic example of solidarity...<\/blockquote>We need to see that kind of solidarity.  It is a big challenge for Europe to combine and seek that solidarity, but there is no evidence that we have seen it.

Recalling reductions in social welfare, I do not think people will ever forget that Fianna F&aacute;il cut people's social welfare by &euro;16 to &euro;17 a week.  That is its legacy, what it has to live with and what it has to explain to people.  That is the cause of the fall in people's incomes in respect of social welfare.  Deputy Kelleher was a Minister of State at the time and was probably party to those decisions.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to the Deputy's point about Irish Water, over 1.2 million people have registered with Irish Water.  At the moment, as Members of the House are aware, the bills are going out.  In fact, the Deputy will probably know from conversations that a lot of people are pleasantly surprised to find they have actually beaten the cap.  However, where they have not beaten the cap, the quarterly charge for a larger household is &euro;65.<\/p>  <p>  This decision by the Government is essentially to distinguish between those who cannot pay and those who will not pay, and, in the case of people who will not pay, to lay out a clear path for the recovery of civil debt.  We know there are a lot of Deputies in this House who earn over &euro;80,000 gross, so I think they are people who can afford to pay.  As we know from the record of the House, however, a lot of them have said they will not pay, and they want everybody else to pay for them.  That is not acceptable.<\/p>  <p>  Coming back to the question, the first thing about this legislation, which is based on a report by the Law Reform Commission in 2010, is that it removes from people any threat of imprisonment in regard to civil debt.  The threat of imprisonment in regard to civil debt, as I am sure people know, goes back to the times of Charles Dickens, when people were imprisoned as debtors.  It is a very fundamental reform to take that threat away.  I have to say I am very pleased that various organisations have welcomed this legislation.<\/p>  <p>  The second issue is how we set out the details of the legislation and how we distinguish between the people Deputy Kelleher was rightly concerned about and the people on good incomes who just say: \"Let everyone else pay for me.  I am not paying.\"  Notwithstanding the fact that our water services cost a lot of money, and despite all the work that Irish Water is doing, we know about the leaks and other difficulties such as lead in pipes that were not addressed for decades by local authorities.  This reform of court-related debt procedures will be dealt with by the Department of Justice and Equality and we will then have a series of other reforms.  The Bill now needs to be drafted.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to social protection, if somebody on social protection is faced with debts, we have long-established principles which remain absolutely intact in regard to how and when money can be deducted from a debt.  It has been subjected to very detailed discussion in this House at different times and actually deals with very small amounts.<\/p><p>More importantly, we want to have easy pay systems, in particular through An Post, something which is under discussion and is currently being finalised, through the household budgeting scheme.  It will allow people to pay a small amount on a weekly basis.

I will take lectures from many people but on this issue, I will not take a lecture from the T&aacute;naiste.<\/p>  <p>  There are thousands of families who simply cannot afford to make a contribution to bills for water because they do not have the money.  That is evidenced by the fact that people are queuing up before community welfare officers across the State week in, week out to try to access additional payments because of the cuts to social welfare over the past number of years.  <\/p>  <p>  I will name the cuts.  There have been cuts to the education allowance, fuel allowance, back to school allowance, one-parent family allowance, farm assist, household packages and respite care grants and a cap on rent allowance.  That is the legacy of the T&aacute;naiste.  The Government will pass legislation which will take no account of ability to pay.  Reference was made to the fact those in the House earn &euro;84,000 a year.  Nobody in the Chamber is on social welfare but there are hundreds of thousands of people in the country who are and who cannot afford to make their weekly payments.  I am not making up those figures; every statistic and survey show that there is a major problem with poverty in the country.  Some one in eight children are living in abject poverty.  Some 30% of household incomes are on the breadline.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700019#R00600","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1430997000,"counter":188,"content":"<p>A question please, Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700019#R00700","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1430997000,"counter":189,"content":"<p>It is very true that the pathway out of poverty is returning to work.

The previous Leader scheme was a lifesaver to say the least for rural Ireland, and communities throughout the country benefited from funding for various projects which created jobs, supported and financed several community projects and promoted involvement by the public in projects with a bottom-up approach.  The previous Leader scheme had &euro;400 million available for the partnership local development companies.  The latest funding allocation for 2014 until 2020 has been cut drastically to &euro;220 million.  This is a massive cut of 45% across the board.<\/p>  <p>  This drastic cut for vital services in rural Ireland is a devastating blow for rural groups.  It is a further indication of the slash and burn policies which apply to our rural countryside.  The decreased allocation will have a significant detrimental impact on the ability of the new realigned partnership groups to deliver community-based projects and support vital community services and facilities.  The impact on business development, growth and jobs is looking very bleak.  Will the T&aacute;naiste and the Government immediately review the Government's contribution and raise the amount of matching funds from the Exchequer to compliment EU funding, and at least have a fund which is similar to what existed for past Leader groups?  It is probably one of our most successful schemes ever for the delivery of services in rural Ireland.  Will the T&aacute;naiste go back to the drawing board and finance it properly?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700021#T04800","speaker":"1050"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1430998200,"counter":296,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700021#T04900","nonspeaker":"Deputies"},{"type":"speech","time":1430998200,"counter":297,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Fleming.  As he is probably aware, the European Union in its budgetary programme for the next number of years has reduced the amount which countries such as Ireland receive under this heading.  This is alongside the various changes happening in farming and the Common Agricultural Policy.  I absolutely accept what Deputy Fleming said, that Leader has been an enormously important force in rural Ireland.  Even in rural north County Dublin, part of which I represent, it has been a huge force for positive economic and social good.  One of the consequences of the change, which will be very positive for rural Ireland, is the new programme being rolled out will be heavily concentrated not simply on what has been done in the past but on creating rural employment and rural enterprise.  This will continue.<\/p>  <p>  The one area which I understand has been reviewed is that in some Leader programmes, and I stress some Leader programmes, the level of administration costs was very high.  In some cases it was more than one quarter of the total cost.  As we look forward to the forthcoming budget the Government will look at how to support these rural initiatives and rural enterprise.  We have already given a significant indicative allocation to, for instance, the development of an IDA presence throughout the country in regional enterprise development programmes.  As these programmes develop, with the IDA and Enterprise Ireland, I am hopeful and confident they will link in with the existing Leader network.  I and the Minister of State, Deputy Humphreys, have had the privilege of visiting many of these schemes in various parts of rural Ireland, and what we are doing, which is complimentary and parallel, is to expand community employment.  In recent years we have created the T&uacute;s scheme, which is very popular particularly in rural Ireland with regard to initiatives on the environment, tourism and beautifying our villages and towns.<\/p>  <p>  There has been a reduction in the EU allocation for Ireland under this heading, but the Government has recently committed to a regional development and industrial programme.  We now have IDA officials based in the regions for the first time in a long time, to look for new businesses, new initiatives and foreign direct investment to come to the regions.  I hope that as we go forward ConnectIreland will work closely with Leader and with the new arrangements for the Leader companies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700021#T05000","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1430998200,"counter":298,"content":"<p>I welcome the T&aacute;naiste's statement that the Government will look into additional moneys, in particular with a view to the forthcoming budget.  This certainly will be very much a corrective action by the Government to address this matter whereby there is a total reduction of approximately &euro;180 million from the funding available from 2009 to 2014.<\/p><p>The Leader model adopted by Europe is the most efficient and the best value for money Leader programmes have been conducted in this country, which has been recognised.  The European Commission is concerned at the methodology used in the tendering process.  Protective notice is being given to staff of current Leader groups, which have been delivering productively.  Staff have been mentoring and advising in the community and they have delivered top-class administration and wonderful management.  This is throwing out the baby with the bath water.  If we dispose of these, we cannot allow it to happen through neglect or careless action by the Government.  I am very impressed by, and I welcome, the T&aacute;naiste's reference to the involvement of IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland and job creation companies.  Leader is an appropriate word because these bodies have been the leaders in delivering jobs in rural Ireland.  Since 2009, some 8,698 rural enterprises were funded by the Leader programme, supporting the creation of 4,084 rural jobs in the worst economic recession in the country.  From today, I hope we work positively with Leader groups for future development, for the good of our countryside and to keep people in jobs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700021#T05100","speaker":"1050","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1430998800,"counter":300,"content":"<p>I look forward to seeing a closer working relationship between Leader, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland.  I was in Kerry recently and, if IDA Ireland were to invest in the Kerry Technology Park beside the institute of technology and facilities for entrepreneurs in IT, from listening to the Tralee chamber of commerce it sees great potential for employment in the south west and specifically in Kerry.  Deputy Tom Fleming saw the Enterprise Ireland statistics last week, where new enterprises and smaller enterprises growing into larger enterprises are now exporting significantly.  If, as a country, we can harness the energy of the Leader groups and the significant community contribution and participation in the Leader groups and bring it together with IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, we can create new enterprises and employment in rural areas.  ConnectIreland has been working very successfully since it started a few years ago and almost all of its jobs have been in rural Ireland.  This is not just into the bigger towns and cities.<\/p>  <p>  The tendering system for the Leader groups was conducted under the auspices of Pobal and it was challenging for people to be involved in it.  The main issue is that the European Union has significantly reduced the funding heading.  The Government is committed to matching funding but the amount we can commit depends on budgetary issues.  It is a priority of the Government to ensure the recovery, as it begins to take hold, goes right into rural Ireland as much as in urban Ireland.  In that respect, I welcome the comments of Deputy Tom Fleming and I will give them my support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700022#U00200","speaker":"946"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Order of Business","time":1430998800,"counter":301,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700022#U00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1430998800,"counter":302,"content":"<p>It is proposed to take No. 34, statements on challenges facing the European Union (resumed), to adjourn at 2 p.m. if not previously concluded; No. 13, motion re proposal that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann adopts the &ldquo;EU Scrutiny Work Programme 2015, Joint Committees&rsquo; Priorities&rdquo;, to be moved on the adjournment or conclusion of No. 34; and No. 1, Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) (Amendment) Bill 2014 [Seanad] - Second Stage.

Already, additional funding has been given to the Minister for Health in respect of specific areas discussed on previous occasions.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to debt, the Department of Social Protection has a very well set out and well-established system in respect of the recovery of overpayments, which is protected by legislation in the consolidated Social Welfare Act.  This limits the amount of money people can pay out of social welfare income, whether through the household budgeting system run through An Post or for any other purpose.  The legislation is a cornerstone of how people on social welfare are protected.  The legislation was worked on by the previous Government and since the current Government has been in office.  It is a well-established system and I would not like the Deputy to frighten people.  It is not in the best traditions of Fianna F&aacute;il.  We have a well-established system and the Department of Social Protection officials operate it up and down the country.  They have done so for years and will continue to operate it.<\/p><p>The supplementary welfare allowance part of the social welfare system absolutely protects people's incomes where there are issues with debt.  What I am saying in respect of the legislation is that we want to avoid a situation in which anyone has to get into debt, because I have seen the catastrophic consequences, particularly for working-class families, of allowing debts to build up.  People are then faced with debts of hundreds of euro, which are incredibly difficult for them to meet, and a repayment system must be worked out to allow them to repay that over a long period.  Without this reform, people with debts would have faced the risk of going to prison.  There may be some people who do not like to see the end of that system, but the announcement has been strongly welcomed by various organisations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700022#U00800","speaker":"946","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1430999400,"counter":308,"content":"<p>The T&aacute;naiste might address the question of timing which Deputy Kelleher raised.

The approach of the establishment in this country is to be so-called good Europeans.  What it means by that is that it votes for - again and again if necessary - successive neoliberal, militaristic treaties.  What it also means is that it does the bidding of the central bankers in Europe and of the establishment within Germany by stabbing the Greek people in the back by saying no write-off is possible for them, while at the same time overseeing write-offs for the rich in this country.

In 2012, Mario Draghi accurately said that the &quot;European social model has already gone.&quot;  The head of the ECB was right then.  It goes back further than that in the sense that the dream of a social Europe never actually existed.  What we always had was a big business project from the top, which as a result of major struggles in particular on the Continent, was forced to give important concessions.  But now, in the age of neoliberalism, all of the illusions of a social Europe have been swept away.  We have an openly authoritarian neoliberal, aggressive and imperialistic Europe.<\/p><p>The horror of the deaths of thousands of migrants in the Mediterranean is the face of this European project.  For all its crocodile tears, the EU cannot wash its hands of that.  It bears responsibility on a number of different levels.  It bears responsibility for the humanitarian crisis from which people are fleeing in Libya, Syria and elsewhere in North Africa and the Middle East where its interventions for its own interests have played a role in developing these crises.  The EU also bears a responsibility for its policy of &quot;fortress Europe&quot; whereby it refuses legal access to those fleeing crises.  As a result of the crocodile tears there is talk of allowing 5,000 refugees into Europe, whereas last year more than 200,000 people attempted to make the crossing in desperation.  The EU forces people into the hands of the criminal people smugglers who have no interest in their lives and who treat them as commodities.  The EU bears responsibility more directly because of the cut in the Mare Nostrum programme, which is responsible for the deaths of hundreds if not thousands of migrants.  It is a cut to save money but it is also a cut to move away from a vision of saving lives towards the securitisation and militarisation of European borders.<\/p><p>Externally, one has the horrific and murderous approach by the European Union to keep the consequences of its policies around the world away from European shores.  Internally, the same reality is increasingly evident.  In particular, it is manifest in the treatment of the Greek people and their government.  The democratic mandate of the Syriza-led government has been thoroughly trampled upon by the mostly unelected European authorities.  Blackmail has been threatened by the European Central Bank.  The European Commission has demanded total defeat and retreat by the government and the European Council, composed of governments like that in Ireland, has said there is no possible deal for the Greek people.  The EU is determined to prevent any political contagion of the <i>status quo<\/i>or to allow the idea that one can do things differently or break from the mantra that there is no alternative to austerity.<\/p><p>There are profound lessons for the left in how to challenge the Europe of the millionaires and billionaires.  There are no mechanisms to change the existing situation in Europe incrementally in a social or progressive direction.  Any Government which breaks with the austerity consensus is then faced with an onslaught of attacks and a denial of their democratic mandate.  We therefore need governments willing to say &quot;No, we are not going to pay debt of the bankers and bondholders&quot; and to engage in a strategy, if necessary, of unilateral debt repudiation.  We need governments willing to break with the logic of austerity and capitalism, which are written down within the rules governing the euro and the EU.  We also need governments to stand up and refuse to be blackmailed by the threat of bringing down the banking system and forcing countries outside of the euro to respond through radical socialist measures, such as capital controls, public ownership of key sources of wealth and planning in the interests of people.<\/p><p>In that way we will lay the basis for a different, humane, democratic and socialist Europe operating in the interests of the millions and no longer for the millionaires.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700024#W02900","speaker":"1197","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431000600,"counter":347,"content":"<p>As Vice Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs, I am delighted to speak on challenges facing the European Union.  The European Union is a unique organisation which transcends national boundaries and pools sovereignty from the 28 member states.  The fact that it is unique and that no other organisations follow the path that the Union has taken means that the EU faces a number of challenges.  One of the main challenges is interaction with people of the various member states.  At times, the European Union is viewed as something outside of this country which does not directly impact on us.  The reality, however, is that the European Union and its institutions and laws have an impact on Irish people on a daily basis.  Regulations and directives govern a myriad of issues ranging from social and health to economic and financial matters.  The impact is often not felt, primarily because some of the laws, such as safety regulations, are common sense.  One cannot imagine a time without them.  However, on other occasions, the impact of the EU, particularly specific EU laws, is keenly felt and has an enormous impact on life.  In my constituency of Galway West, for example, there is news today of the publication of the preferred route for a Galway bypass.  We were at this stage 14 or 15 years ago, but because of European designations and court challenges to the High Court, the Supreme Court and the European Court of Justice the process was delayed.  That has had a direct and lasting impact on the process to alleviate traffic in Galway.  It is one area where the EU has had an impact and where it is often viewed in a less than positive light.  It is a case of whether habitat or human beings - the people of Galway - are more important.  The debate has been ongoing in Galway for a number of years.<\/p>  <p>  Another challenge facing the EU and related to the interaction of the Union with the citizens of the member states is the role of national parliaments.  The Lisbon treaty envisaged a much greater role for national parliaments in the workings of the Union, including in the legislative process.  I am not convinced that the national parliaments are playing the role that was envisaged.  There is such a plethora of legislation, directives, regulations and rules from Europe that scrutiny by national parliamentarians presents a major challenge.  In the aftermath of the referendum on the Seanad, I proposed that the Seanad adopt a European approach.  I believe the Seanad could play a valuable role in scrutinising legislation from Europe, not just when the legislation is at an advanced stage in the process but from the start and at each stage.  As a small member state, this would be significant to ensure our voice is heard.<\/p>  <p>  Recently, I participated in a European delegation to the UK to discuss the implications of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.  I wish all the candidates the best of luck in the UK elections taking place today.  It will be a very important decision for the future of this country.  Obviously, we share a common land border with the UK via Northern Ireland and we conduct a huge amount of trade with the UK, as it does with us.  There would be huge implications if it decided to withdraw from the EU.  It would have a huge impact.  We met with a variety of groups during our visit, including Irish people, Irish companies involved in trade there, emigrant groups, representatives of State agencies such as Bord Bia, the ambassador, government and opposition Members of Parliament.  There were wide and varied discussions, and we were all conscious of the special relationship between Ireland and the UK and the impact of a possible withdrawal by the UK from the EU.  We will not know until the new British Government is formed whether it is likely that a referendum will take place.  We were careful not to suggest how anybody might vote in such a referendum, but to convey to people that we have a stake in the result of that referendum.  I believe we got our point across and they acknowledged the strong relationship and the strong role this country has with the UK.<\/p>  <p>  The other primary challenge at present is the migrants sailing from the coast of Libya to Italy.  At the meeting of the European affairs committee we expressed our appreciation to the Italian ambassador for the role Italy has played in dealing with this challenge.  It is beholden on every country to take its fair share of migrants arising from this crisis.  No single country can handle it.  A number of countries have stepped up to the plate, but many others have not.  All countries have a responsibility to do something.  This is a crisis.  One cannot fault people who wish to come to Europe to improve their lives and to take whatever chances they might think they have.  Nobody would blame them for that.  Irish people have a strong reputation for emigrating and seeking to improve their lives as well.  I do not blame anybody, but we must ensure that every country does its fair share.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700025#X00200","speaker":"1110"},{"type":"speech","time":1431000600,"counter":348,"content":"<p>Sinn F&eacute;in is very critical of the democratic deficit at the heart of the European Union and of the Government's compliant attitude to the EU elites.  We have long argued for a social Europe based on equality and the rights of all EU citizens.  However, I will concentrate my remarks today on one of a range of challenges facing the EU, which is that if the outgoing British Prime Minister, Mr. David Cameron, wins the British general election he has pledged that he will hold a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU by 2017.  This is a paranoid political reaction to the perceived electoral threat of the eurosceptic United Kingdom Independence Party, UKIP.  It is also further evidence that the political considerations of British political parties are primarily about England and English issues.<\/p>  <p>  The stark reality of an EU referendum is that it could take the North out of the European Union.  The referendum will allow the views of English voters to dictate the future relationships of the North, and therefore of this island, with the European Union.  It also further underlines the folly of the Democratic Unionist Party, DUP, and Ulster Unionist Party, UUP, in supporting the Tories.  It is selfish, insular politics in action, with implications for Ireland as a whole.  It would reinforce the partition of this island.  The partition of this island is illegitimate, immoral, an intrusion in our affairs and economically disruptive.  If Mr. Cameron is re-elected and has his way, this disruptive Border would be reinforced by an international frontier with passport checkpoints and customs controls.  All of the work in recent years on cross-Border co-operation and the work with everybody across the island to our mutual advantage would be set to naught.  This highlights the fact that the real threat to the economy in the North comes from Britain, and that the real threat to the island economy comes from partition.<\/p>  <p>  The exit from the EU of part of this island will hinder free movement and severely disrupt the daily lives of people, particularly of people living in the Border counties on both sides of the Border.  Irish workers, farmers and local enterprises already pay, and will continue to pay, the human, social and economic price of partition.  There will be no single farm payment, rural development fund, Structural Funds or PEACE funding.  Almost 1 million citizens living in Border counties pay the price for all of this daily.  They do so through roaming charges, the cost of using two currencies and additional bank charges, and barriers to accessing the nearest public services, particularly health services, social housing and education.  These are the people who will face increased challenges which are not of their choice.  Of course, partition has resulted in ongoing violence in every decade since it was imposed on our people.  Island-wide trade, which currently generates &pound;3 billion, will be severely disrupted.<\/p>  <p>  The Tory proposal for a referendum, without a separate binding vote in the North, denies people in the North the power to make decisions about their lives.  It is the people of this island who should decide the economic, social and political future of Ireland.  That includes the right to a separate and binding referendum in the North on European Union membership.  The Taoiseach has spoken about this issue on a number of occasions in Britain and, most recently, in Belfast.  I ask the Government to focus its mind on this.<\/p><p>It may be that some Unionists may support David Cameron's proposition but the fact is the economies of Ireland, North and South, are interlinked and interdependent.  Many ordinary Unionists I met particularly from the rural areas of the Six Counties and the farming community are conscious of the interdependency and interlinking of an island economy.  <\/p> <p> It is time to build and strengthen the economy, not to split it up or divide it.  It goes without saying that working together our economic output would be stronger.  Splintering merely weakens the economy, undermines public services and undermines the spirit of citizens.  While Sinn F&eacute;in is critical of the European Union's deficit, the European Union has the potential to provide a bridge towards the greater integration of Ireland, North and South, towards a single economic and political unit.  It is the responsibility of the Government to actively promote and pursue this objective and there is a constitutional imperative on the Government to do so.  It is past time that the European Parliament deal with Ireland as one, and not two, systems.  The potential for the North to positively reshape our relationship with the European Union in the context of a limited and narrow British vote on EU membership should not be overlooked.  Parties with no democratic mandate in any part of this island cannot be allowed by the Government the power to dictate the political or economic future of this country.  <\/p> <p> Political and economic decision making powers must be increasingly transferred from London to Belfast.  As I said earlier, all citizens in the North should have the right to express their will through a separate legally binding vote on European Union membership.  That is the only position which makes any sense whatsoever.  It is a position which the Taoiseach needs to support and if in the future - we will know this within the coming days or weeks - a referendum is to be organised by an incoming British Government, he needs to assertively pursue with his British counterpart the need and the right for a separate and legally binding referendum for citizens in the North of Ireland on this issue.  I, therefore, call on the Taoiseach to seek an urgent meeting with the new British Government to pursue this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700025#X00300","speaker":"1066","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431001200,"counter":350,"content":"<p>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to contribute to this debate on the challenges facing the European Union.  From the outset it is important to state that I am supportive of what membership of the European Union has achieved for us over many years and its potential into the future.  However, that is not to say it works perfectly for everyone all the time.  It is important on a rolling basis that member states have a conversation as to where they can seek to make improvements where challenges exist and how it is important to move it on from there.<\/p>  <p>  Having been a county councillor and a backbench Deputy and having spent a good deal of time in the constituency, I have heard many conversations on the European Union.  At times the European Union is blamed for things it had nothing to do with whatsoever.  It is an easy scapegoat.  There are other times when one understands that there are some concerns.  One basic example, and something that is parochial to Galway and Roscommon, is turf cutting.  The directive was signed by the European Union many years ago.  The European Union gets the blame for this but it approached the issue from an environmental perspective.  While I would wish for a greater degree of flexibility on how to solve the problem, it was created in Ireland by Department officials who did not do their job correctly 13 or 14 years ago.  When this conversation comes up, often it is the European Union that is blamed.  While it has a part to play in it, that is simply not the case. <\/p>  <p>  Given that some 75% of our legislation comes from the European Union the question is how we impose, understand and implement directives.  Nothing seems to drive people crazy like directives.  For some reason, to the very letter of the law as stated, we implement them without proper consultation with the people on the ground whom they will affect most.  Let us take CAP reform, from which Ireland has done very well, as an example.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, and the Taoiseach did a great job negotiating it.  One of the measures involved in it was a directive from the European Union that all farmers had to have their details, names and addresses and the amounts they receive from the European Union, printed and published.  That is completely and utterly bonkers.  There is already enough accountability and traceability in the system.  Why do we have to publish every farmer's details?  This is where the common sense element has been lost.  While it might appear good in Brussels, it certainly does not work well on the ground.  How much consultation took place before that measure was introduced?  This is not an issue or a concern with accountability or transparency.  That has nothing to do with it, and nobody is trying to hide anything.  The relevant Department knows exactly what is coming in and going out of the country and what is going to farmers and yet we have to take this extra step.  From the point of view of a rural security measure, it is completely over the top.  This is one of the reasons people may become a bit more eurosceptic because they think there is no relationship whatsoever with the decisions it takes and what is implemented on the ground.  If we were to do nothing else in the coming period, I suggest that directives be examined as to how they will work in practice.  <\/p>  <p>  Another major issue we are facing is designations of land, such as SPAs, NHAs and SACs, all over the country.  All of these designations were introduced for environmental reasons.  There is nothing whatsoever wrong with that.  They were introduced at a time when the State had a great deal more money and the farming community bought into them.  The European Union brought in the directives stating this is what it wanted.  We have now entered a situation where the directives still stand on farmers' land but the money has run out.  It is not acceptable for anybody, whether the European Union or the Government, to take over a person's land, promise him or her compensation for X number of years, and then withdraw the compensation, following which the value of the land is worthless to many of these people.  This is what leads to much friction.<\/p>  <p>  There is one other area on which I wish to concentrate, as raised by Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne, and this is the major humanitarian issue off the coast of Italy where people are trying to escape terrible situations for a better life.  Our reaction in the European Union was slow but it has happened.  It is incumbent on the entire Union to try to help solve this problem.  However, there is a much longer term problem here also.  Political stability in these countries is of paramount importance and is the reason people are leaving.  We may be able to solve the problem in the short term for a few weeks but the European Union has to show some direction in helping to improve political stability in these areas.  That means dealing with our trading parties or the United States and other countries who caused the political instability in the first place.  While it might become a European Union problem to help solve it at a humanitarian level, there is a much longer-term issue that has not been concentrated on half enough.  Why was the political instability there in the first place?  Who got involved at all the wrong levels, whether it was the US or any other country?  We have to be very strong and firm on the basis that the reason this is happening is because of their involvement.  There is no point in coming back here in five or ten years' time when the crisis blows up again and some other dictator has taken over and is destroying half of Africa.  We can ask ourselves what we did to solve the problem in the first place.  It is one thing to solve the problem in the next few weeks but if we are serious as a European Union, the one thing we have to do is get involved in the political side of things.  I am not talking about going to war.  Who are the vested interests who are getting involved in these countries, causing the political instability that is now causing the current situation?  <\/p>  <p>  There is a bright future for Ireland in the European Union.  The biggest challenge is happening today in Britain with the election and nobody knows what the result will be.  If the Conservatives get back in to Government, there will certainly be an in-out referendum in Britain, the outcome of this would be very important to us.  We will then have to have that conversation on the basis of the facts.  It is my firm belief that we are better off within the European Union and I hope Britain will remain in there.  Until that time comes, it is important that we set out clearly the pros and cons of what that will mean.  The biggest challenge that faces us is happening today, the outcome of which will find out at the weekend.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700026#Y00200","speaker":"1041"},{"type":"speech","time":1431001200,"counter":351,"content":"<p>As there are no other speakers, I call the Minister of State to reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700026#Y00300","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1431001200,"counter":352,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies from all sides who contributed to the debate which was a good debate.

Europe Day is an opportunity to consider in a small way the importance of the EU to the Irish people and our importance to, and the role we play in, the EU.  Given the important role the Union plays in all our lives every day should, to an extent, be Europe Day.  Many issues were raised and I did not have the opportunity in my opening remarks to touch on all the areas where the EU is important to us.<\/p> <p> Many speakers referred to the United Kingdom.  There is no question but that a British departure from the EU would have serious and potentially adverse consequences for the country.  That is why the Government has been monitoring developments in the EU-UK relationship extremely carefully.  The Department of the Taoiseach has been co-ordinating interdepartmental efforts to ensure Ireland is best prepared for any situation that could arise.  Given that polling is going on in the UK today, we will not have long to wait to see the likely shape of the new UK Government.  It was decided to create a new division within the Department, which is up and running.  Several other Departments are conducting detailed research in their areas of competence.  The Department of Finance, for example, has commissioned a report on the macroeconomic links between the UK and Ireland in the context of our EU membership.  Our ambassador in London and his team are also actively engaged on this issue. <\/p> <p> I did not speak about the TTIP negotiations in my opening remarks.  It is very important to re-state that TTIP is not, is not intended to be, and will not be, a race to the bottom in regulatory standards.  It will not automatically overrule, repeal or amend EU laws and regulations and, consequently, Irish laws and regulations.  Such laws as relate to genetically modified organisms, GMOs, for example, protecting the environment, animal welfare and workers&rsquo; rights and conditions are not part of the negotiations.  Legitimate concerns have, however, been raised by civil society in Ireland and elsewhere in Europe about certain elements of the TTIP talks.  It is important that we listen, which we are doing, to these concerns and learn from international best practice.  On contentious issues mentioned today, such as investor-state dispute settlement mechanism, TTIP presents a prime opportunity to devise novel and mutually acceptable procedures consistent with our legal system and with relevant safeguards to prevent abusive cases.  We have to be balanced in how we consider the TTIP negotiations.  We have many companies operating in the rest of the world.  As many American people work for Irish companies in the US as Irish people work for US companies here.  That is an interesting statistic to remind people of.  We have to consider TTIP from both sides of that equation.  We are resolute in our belief that it will provide significant benefits to the Irish people and economy and to the EU. <\/p> <p> I thank Deputies for their contributions.  I have not had time to cover all their remarks.  It was an excellent debate and as members of the Opposition pointed out, continuous excellent work is being conducted by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Union Affairs, under the chairmanship of Deputy Hannigan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700026#Y00400","speaker":"985","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"EU Scrutiny Work Programme 2015: Motion","time":1431001800,"counter":354,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700027#Z00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1431001800,"counter":355,"content":"<p>I move:<blockquote>That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann adopts, in accordance with Standing Order 102A(2)(c), the &lsquo;EU Scrutiny Work Programme 2015, Joint Committees&rsquo; Priorities&rsquo; which was laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 9th April, 2015 by the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700027#Z00300","speaker":"985"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1431001800,"counter":356,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) (Amendment) Bill 2014 [Seanad]: Second Stage (Resumed)","time":1431001800,"counter":357,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700027#Z00500"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1431001800,"counter":358,"content":"<p>Question again proposed: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1431001800,"counter":359,"content":"<p>The Bill before us amends the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005 by creating three new offences in order to give effect to two Council Framework Decisions from 2008 and 2002.  These offences, as we all know, are public provocation to commit a terrorist offence; recruitment for terrorism and training for terrorism.  I and my party broadly support this Bill but we have some concerns about it.  I am conscious that the Government is implementing a European directive but there several points contained within the Bill that we are concerned about and are seeking clarification or reassurance from the Minister on.<\/p>  <p>  Why has it taken the Government so long to transpose this?  It seems highly unusual that the transposition of something like this would take such a long time.  Perhaps the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Murphy, can explain this to the House or ask the Minister for Justice and Equality to respond on Committee Stage or later.<\/p>  <p>  Our main concern regarding this Bill is the definition of terrorism as it is formulated in the Framework Decision 2002\/475\/JHA.  It is a very broad definition which could include virtually every act that has some element of organisation or planning.  This seems unworkable and something we would be quite concerned about.  By reiterating the framework decision definition, the Bill legitimately raises the question whether this instrument has a built-in function creep in order not only to combat terrorism, but to extend the definition in such a manner as to cover most public order situations and more common criminal acts as they apply under national law.<\/p>  <p>  While there is a definite need for cross-Border co-operation in this area, even international co-operation, criminal sanctions and definitions should be solely the realm of the member state.  We do not want to hand over this type of power to Europe.  Such issues are for member states alone to deal with.  We do not want to see the EU become involved in this area of our citizens&rsquo; lives.  We would like to see greater checks and balances contained within the Bill to ensure there is no such function creep in this area.<\/p>  <p>  To deal with the threat from the dark net, it is not all bad.  There are human rights activists and journalists in some countries who need to protect themselves from very dangerous regimes and need something that could not be monitored in order for them to communicate and tell the stories of their communities.  It can be a benign force.  However, it has also been used by very dangerous criminals and issues such as child abuse are a real concern.  I have raised with the Minister the poor resourcing of the Garda computer crime investigation unit's information technology equipment and its capacity to conduct forensic examination.  We need to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is resourced and has the most up to date equipment possible to combat this threat.  We need to make sure that people engaged in serious criminality, organised criminal gangs and paedophile rings, who pose a threat to our communities, have nowhere to hide and there is nothing in the Internet they can use as some kind of haven for their heinous activities.  To combat that we need to resource An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na properly.<\/p><p>The milestone Garda Inspectorate reports into the investigation of crime, which were carried out over three years, contained very serious criticism of the IT equipment within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na so I wanted to avail of this opportunity to draw attention to that as a real challenge.<\/p> <p> I want to briefly mention another concern, namely, data protection issues.  Any data collected under this legislation should have to comply with standards in this State and not those of any other member state.  We do not want to see a situation where data shared in good faith leaves the hands of another member state and is no longer under the standard at which it left Ireland.  We simply cannot afford to see an abuse of power by governments in this area.  The clearest example of this in recent years was the case of Frank McBrearty from my county of Donegal.  He tried to enter the US with his family and was refused entry by the US authorities because according to US immigration records, he had a conviction for assault despite the fact that the conviction had been overturned and he was found to be innocent of the charges levelled against him.  This case raises very serious concerns and questions about how data on individuals is retained in this State and exchanged with agencies from other jurisdictions.  This is something we will seek to strengthen on Committee Stage of this Bill.<\/p> <p> The challenge with all these measures in the area of justice and protecting our citizens from real threats is that we must strike a balance between a state's responsibility for security with civil liberties.  We want to ensure that any of the powers being introduced do not impinge on civil liberties and are not used to spy on law-abiding citizens who challenge the Government and foreign policies.  We know in this House that there is grave concern about the use of Shannon Airport by the US military in the theatre of war in Iraq, a war that was not sanctioned by the UN.  We have concerns about the tolerance of the Israeli regime and how it essentially imprisoned millions of Palestinian people in Gaza and the West Bank and keeps stealing land.  An appalling government has been formed there and its approach to settlements is very worrying.  There are many regimes we tolerate or co-operate with under the guise of the EU which are a concern for the Irish people.  We need to ensure that we have a balanced approach and that we protect our citizens from real threats.  All of us are appalled by the development of Islamic State and reject utterly that creed which is an insult to the honourable people who follow the Muslim faith in Ireland and across the world.  It is an honourable faith and I have huge respect for many people who adhere to the Islamic faith.  We need to get that balance right in terms of the civil rights and liberties of our citizens and those across the EU versus a state's need for security mechanisms.  <\/p> <p> I will wrap up by mentioning the need for consistency.  If we tolerate the Israeli regime and what it has done in Palestine and what is happening in Egypt, we send out a signal to young Muslims in the Middle East.  In Egypt, the former government has been locked up and sentenced to death and an Irish citizen, Ibrahim Halawa, is locked up there.  When we tolerate these regimes and co-operate with them, we send a message to young people that radicalises them and allows them to fall into the hands of the very organisations we seek to protect our citizens from.  We need consistency in foreign policy and courage from our Government.  One step we can take very soon is to recognise the state of Palestine.  The two Houses of Oireachtas have asked for this to happen and our Government needs to ensure it happens.  If we are consistent in our approach to human rights internationally and if we live up to some of the great names who have come before us - Irish leaders who have advocated for human rights across the globe - we are in a strong position to confront the terrorist threat and extremists out there.  That is my plea.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700027#Z00700","speaker":"998","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431002400,"counter":361,"content":"<p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) (Amendment) Bill 2014.  I welcome the debate because it is an opportunity to look in detail at the legislation and what is going on in the modern world.  In recent weeks, we have seen significant levels of violence in Ireland and internationally.  We have seen the kidnapping of children, women and children being killed in different conflicts and sectarianism across Europe and Africa and even in our own country.  One hears a lot about terrorism in the debate but when one is talking about violence, one must also look at the impact of state violence, which is often ignored.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill is designed to give effect to European law on terrorism.  It creates three new offences - public provocation to commit a terrorist offence, recruitment for terrorism and training for terrorism.  We must all strongly oppose indiscriminate and sectarian violence, regardless of whether it happens in the Middle East or Africa and whether it involves the killing of Christians, Muslims or other innocent people.  We must face up to the reality that this cannot be tolerated in any society.  We as legislators and Members of the Oireachtas must constantly harp on about this issue.  There is no point in staying silent, sitting on the fence and being selective in our opposition to violence.  <\/p>  <p>  Recently, we have seen horrific attacks on members of Sinn F&eacute;in and the murder of Gerard Davison in Belfast and yet the silence in this House and in broader society has been deafening, which is not acceptable.  These double standards should always be challenged.  It is not acceptable in any democratic society for people to be shot or blown up or for their families to be attacked or for people to be shot down on their way to work.  It is not an option to stay silent.  It is very important that we say this because I found the silence in the past 24 hours to be deafening.  Yesterday, the Taoiseach had to be asked to condemn the violence.  <\/p>  <p>  When I talk about violence, I go right across the spectrum.  I am talking about sectarian violence and the kidnapping of young girls.  In respect of state terrorism, one cannot have double standards if one wants to convince people internationally that peaceful and democratic politics are the way forward.  The Dublin-Monaghan bombings and the Miami show band massacre are examples in our recent history.  There was considerable silence about these events because there were serious concerns about the role of the state in these acts.  We asked the question and the D&aacute;il passed a motion relating to the Dublin-Monaghan bombings and yet we have seen no real action.  <\/p>  <p>  There was a strong state dimension to the Dublin bombings in 1972.  I was a member of the joint Oireachtas committee which dealt with these bombings.  One aspect that arose during our work was the urgent need for a Garda liaison officer to work closely with the families.  The families of the victims of the 1974 bombings in Dublin got a Garda liaison officer but the families of the victims of the 1972 bombings did not.<\/p><p>I ask that the Minister of State, Deputy Murphy, bring that message back to the Minister.<br\/><br\/>On the issue of terrorism, international terrorism and who is a terrorist and so on, people find it nauseating that some states engage in violence while at the same time lecturing fringe groups involved in terrorist activities.  Over the past 15 years I have many times raised the issue of Cuba and the famous case of the Miami Five, who thankfully were released.  I welcome recent developments between President Obama, Ra&uacute;l Castro and the Pope in relation to building dialogue and a peace process.  Over the past 15 years many people here ignored the plight of the Miami Five, five Cubans who were trying to stop Miami-based terrorist groups from carrying out violent acts against the people of Cuba.  They were found guilty of charges ranging from murder to espionage by a court in Miami which relied on the evidence of convicted terrorists.  All were innocent of the charges brought against them.  Extensive intimidation of jurors by these same terrorists was a feature of the trial, following which the Miami Five were imprisoned.  Many of us in this House were involved in the release of the Miami Five, whose imprisonment was a blatant miscarriage of justice.  In terms of the history of Cuba in these types of situations, the campaign was dedicated to the memory of the 3,478 Cubans killed and the 2,099 maimed at the hands of US based terrorists since 1959.  These are issues we have to face up to as well.  States cannot be allowed to do one thing while preaching another.  I commend Dr. David Hickey on his magnificent work in the building of a relationship with Cuba and also Che Guevara's daughter who has done a great deal of work with Beaumont Hospital, which is in my constituency.  It is important we acknowledge that many people are now working together to build bridges.  There is significant potential to further develop this relationship, including in the context of small business and jobs.<br\/><br\/>On the Bill, section 5 provides for the insertion of into the Principal Act of a new section 4B which provides:<blockquote>For the purposes of this Part, recruitment for terrorism means&mdash;<br \/><br \/>(a) the intentional recruitment of another person&mdash;(i) to commit, or participate in the commission of, a terrorist activity,...<\/blockquote>We will need to monitor the impact of this legislation.  It is important to make that point.  In debating the issue of terrorism and violence, it should not be forgotten that there have been 12 gangland deaths in this city over the past 12 months in respect of which there have been no prosecutions.  We also have a problem in Ireland in terms of violent acts.  The Bill provides that a person convicted of this offence is liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for up to ten years.  <br\/><br\/>Section 6 inserts a new section 4C which states:<blockquote>For the purposes of this Part, training for terrorism means intentionally providing instruction or training in the skills of&mdash;<br \/><br \/>(a) making or using, for the purpose of committing, or contributing to the commission of, a terrorist activity&mdash;<br \/><br \/>(i) firearms or explosives,<br \/><br \/>(ii) nuclear material,...<\/blockquote>The issue of Shannon was mentioned earlier by some of my colleagues.  It is not acceptable that peaceful demonstrators should be brought before the courts for highlighting a State's involvement in violence.  This is an issue on which we should all also speak out.<br\/><br\/>The issue of conflict and the Palestinians was mentioned.  If the Palestine conflict ended, the result would be the disappearance from this earth of a lot of violence.  <br\/><br\/>Returning to the definition of terrorism, earlier I asked whether the definition in the Bill is too broad.  My concern is in relation to public order issues and my advice to the Minister and Government is that they should not go over the top in this regard.  They should also be careful about handing over powers in this regard to the EU and other authorities.  I do not support violence or violent acts but I do support civil disobedience.  That is the way forward because it creates a healthier society.<br\/><br\/>According to the latest EU statistics on terrorism, seven people died as a result of terrorist attacks in the EU; 152 terrorist attacks were carried out in EU member states; and 535 individuals were arrested in the EU in relation to terrorism-related offences and court proceedings in respect of terrorism charges concluded in relation to 313 individuals.  Earlier I referred to the violent attacks being carried out on our own doorstep.  We must remain conscious of what is going on in our own country.  We must be very vigilant about defending and protecting the peace process and those who took major risks in that regard.  <br\/><br\/>Overall, I welcome the Bill and this debate which provides us with an opportunity to see where we have reached.  Again, I do not support violence but I do support the protection of civil liberties and the right of people to participate in peaceful and democratic protest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700028#AA00200","speaker":"1017","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431003000,"counter":363,"content":"<p>With no disrespect to the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, it is shameful that the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, is not in the House to listen to the opening contributions to the debate on this important legislation.  I am particularly concerned that despite the fact that the Minister had 30 minutes to deliver her opening speech on this issue yesterday, she chose to speak for only 15 minutes and did not bother to read the complete script provided to her into the record.  To me, this indicates the cavalier attitude of this Government to critically important issues of civil liberties.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister in her opening remarks attempted to perpetuate the idea that repression can beat terrorism.  Have we really learned nothing?  Repression does not stop terrorism; it spawns terrorism and the facts prove it.  The Minister spoke last night about the rise of ISIS and referred to the fact that 80% of European foreign fighters are engaged in activity with ISIS.  From where did ISIS come?  Obviously, it arose out of the illegal invasion of Iraq and the decimation of the population there.  Another breeding ground for ISIS is the break-up of Libya and interference in the civil war in Syria and so on.  This is the roots of terrorism.  Unless these issues are addressed, we will never have world peace.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister referred last night to Turkey being a main route into the combat areas of Syria and Iraq.  Why are these combat areas?  It is because the West invaded and destabilised them for their own interests.  We know from provisions in earlier legislation in this area, which are added to through this Bill, that civil liberties and big brother watching us is not in any way making the world a safer place, rather it is probably a more dangerous place.  The Minister also spoke of those who seek to destroy our democratic society.  Of what democratic society was she speaking?  Is it the one in which people vote for a Government which prior to an election promises to do one thing and then does another when it gets into office?  Is it an EU democracy that allows the people of Greece to vote for a different government and then seeks to blackmail that government into not fulfilling its election promises or is it the democracy that the Fianna F&aacute;il Party wants to protect?  Last night, the Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson talked about concern for the safety of Irish citizens from returning radicalised combatants.  This is the same Fianna F&aacute;il Party that facilitated the active use of Shannon Airport by the US military.  It is beyond a joke at this stage. <\/p>  <p>  This Bill transposes an EU Council Directive into Irish law and, as stated by other speakers, introduces three new offences, including provocation, recruitment and training for terrorism.  It also amends the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005 while retaining all of the blithe and widely sweeping definitions of terrorism contained in the original Act, which includes phrases such as \"unduly compelling a government or an international organisation to perform or abstain from performing an act\", with no definition whatsoever of what makes this compulsion undue.  We could have acts that might seriously destabilise the political or economic structures of the State, but no attempts to come to grips with how we define such destabilisation, which begs the question of whether protest or civil disobedience are acts that might fall under the definition of destabilising the State.  Obviously, the response of Government will be that we should not worry about that but, of course, we should worry about it.  There is some hypocrisy in relation to the introduction by way of this Bill of further measures to combat terrorism when on a daily basis we facilitate terrorism at Shannon.  The Government has been happily complicit in US wars of imperial aggression throughout the past decade, many of which wars were illegal.<\/p><p><i>2 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>I refer to the definitions in the 2005 Act.  That Act refers to seriously intimidating populations; unduly compelling governments to perform acts; and wars which have seriously destabilised and destroyed the fundamental political, constitutional, economic and social structure of a variety of states.  Does this not meet the criteria of the actions of the US military in parts of the globe or the actions of NATO?  It fits perfectly with the definition of terrorist activity in the original Act but, of course, we are not really talking about that now because we have one law for one type of terrorist and another rule for all the other types of terrorist.  This is not good enough.  Large and imperial states have a taken for granted monopoly to engage in violent military activity, regardless of its extra legality.  In fact, they are even encouraged to do so, which is crazy.  That repression is maintained in the Bill.<\/p> <p> One of the most troubling aspects of the Bill is the new offence of public provocation to commit a terrorist offence.  The potential for abuse of this is absolutely rampant, given that it encourages not just directly encouraging the commission of a terrorist act but indirectly encouraging it.  For example, someone might say: \"I am sorry about that; I committed that act because I read something somewhere where I thought somebody meant I should do it.\"  Is this what we are talking about?  Could saying publicly that Palestinians, Iraqis and Afghans have the right to resist occupation and aggression through armed struggle be construed as public provocation?  Could a person who targets by direct action against corporations, government policies and inter-government organisations, like the EU, fall under the remit of this new Bill and this new definition of terrorism?  This is so broad and such an invasion of our public and civil liberties.  It even envisages that a charge of public provocation could be brought even when no terrorist offence was committed.  What does this mean for free speech?  Are we really putting into law something that says a person could be prosecuted for an offence that does not even take place?  This shows how ludicrous and broad this legislation is.<\/p> <p> I have no doubt the Government will tell us not to worry about it and that this does not cover civil disobedience or such like.  The Government may argue that if somebody sits down in front of a Minister's car in a housing estate in Tallaght, that could not possibly come under the definition of provocation.  I remind the Minister of State that one of the Government's backbenchers thought the activities of anti-water charges protesters were akin to those of ISIS.  If this Bill is about ISIS, what is to say it cannot be used against Irish citizens?  We have to look at the use of anti-provocation laws internationally - for example, the case of Eynulla Fatullayev from Azerbaijan who was convicted for incitement to terrorism in 2007 and was given a sentence of eight and a half years for writing an article about his country's support of US policies in Iran.  Is this the direction we are taking?  Even if not, it creates a chilling effect whereby people will self-censor.  Assuring people that this is not the case will not stop somebody from thinking that he or she does not wish to be the first to be prosecuted under this legislation.  Therefore, it will stifle dissent and will stifle opposition and alternative opinion.  I think it is a radically disproportionate response to what is an over-stated terrorist threat.<\/p> <p> I refer to the European Union terrorism situation and trend report in 2014.  In 2013 there were no terrorist attacks in Ireland.  How many religiously inspired terrorist attacks occurred in the EU in 2013?  There were none.  The vast majority of them were by separatist groups and took place in France and Spain and the House passing this legislation would have no impact on such events.  It is a ludicrous response to a situation which has been caused by western interference in the first place.<\/p> <p> We have to be clear and strong on these matters.  International human rights law requires that any interference with a human right has to be necessary and proportionate.  Interference with freedom of expression will be deemed to be necessary only if it fulfils a pressing social need.  Where is the pressing social need in this situation?  Under the European Convention on Human Rights, states have a certain margin within which to decide whether to curb freedom of expression through legislating to prohibit speech which seeks to incite or provoke terrorist acts.  This is necessary according to circumstances and laws of each country.  I do not think there is any pressing need.  The so-called threat of Islamic terrorism has been exploited across the EU and internationally in order to curtail freedom, to abuse human rights, to expand the scope of state security, to increase surveillance on citizens, to militarise everyday life and to restrict freedom of movement.  It certainly has not made the world a safer place because the world is more unstable now than ever because of interference and destabilisation and not because of insufficient repressive legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700029#BB00200","speaker":"1192","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431003600,"counter":365,"content":"<p><blockquote>In January, in the wake of the Paris attacks, the Taoiseach stated in the House that: &quot;The comprehensive international approach that is needed should tackle the underlying causes, prevent radicalisation, share information more effectively, deter and disrupt terrorist travel and bring the perpetrators of terrorism to justice.&quot;  Before we continue a conversation about terrorism, we need to consider the definition of &quot;terrorist activity&quot; as set out in the principal Act.  A terrorist activity is defined as an offence that is committed with the intention of:(i) seriously intimidating a population,<br \/><br \/>(ii) unduly compelling a government or an international organisation to perform or abstain from performing an act, or <br \/><br \/>(iii) seriously destabilising or destroying the fundamental political, constitutional, economic or social structures of a state or an international organisation;In March, a report authored by the Physicians for Social Responsibility, Physicians for Global Survival and the Nobel Prize-winning International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War concluded that in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan alone, the US-led war on terror has directly and indirectly killed, at the most conservative estimate, a possible 1.3 million people since 2001.  They note that the total number of deaths in the three countries is probably in excess of 2 million.<br \/><br \/>The US and its coalition of the willing have led a war that is killing people at a rate that is encroaching on some of the greatest horrors of the 20th century, and they show no signs of slowing down the carnage.  This Government refuses to see this action and its complicity in it for what it is - terrorism, plain and simple.  We are participants in the largest terrorist organisation on earth.  Ireland, by allowing munitions, military aircraft and almost 2.5 million troops through Shannon, is complicit in this mass slaughter of so many innocent people.  We have supported a regime that seriously intimidates populations by flying drones over their heads and that bombs their villages, infrastructure, schools, hospitals, farms, roads, weddings and lives to dust.  We support and instigate the radicalisation of those who survive the carnage, those who can no longer tolerate their humiliation, pain, anger and sorrow.<br \/><br \/>The Taoiseach says we have to deter and disrupt terrorist travel and yet the army that is responsible for the deaths of so many people and the destruction and destabilisation of vast swathes of the Middle East, travels freely and unchecked though our borders.  The Minister of State refers to bringing the perpetrators of terrorism to justice.  However, when we name the US President for what he is, which is a war criminal, the Government does not want to know.  The man is ordering the execution, without trial, of thousands of people, including hundreds of children, and yet he faces no consequences nor censure.<br \/><br \/>In theory, the wording of the Bill is sound and sections of it could possibly be supported if the intentions of its authors were not dripping with hypocrisy.  The crimes of Islamic State are horrific and it should be brought to justice but the same goes for the terrorist activities of Assad, Putin, Netanyahu, the US Administration and its allies.  The same goes for Irish Government personnel who have facilitated the murder of innocent civilians by allowing Shannon Airport to be used as a forward military base for the US war machine.<br \/><br \/>The Saudis are as fond of beheading people as ISIS, while pouring money and arms into terrorist organisations.  The Irish Government does not seem to have any problem with them.  This week, the Saudi Arabia-led coalition has been condemned by Human Rights Watch for dropping banned cluster bombs manufactured and supplied by the US on civilian areas in Yemen.  Ireland signed and ratified this treaty in December 2008.  We are widely considered to have been a driving force in the advancement of the treaty and we are held up as an example of international best practice in our implementation of the treaty.  Only two weeks ago, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade reaffirmed his commitment to the implementation of the Convention on Cluster Munitions and the Arms Trade Treaty.<\/blockquote><\/p><p>He went on to state: &quot;The commitment of Ireland to the promotion and protection of human rights is a foreign policy priority for the Government.&quot;  This stance is perplexing in light of the fact that the Government has repeatedly refused to bring up human rights concerns with Saudi or US officials when it has had the opportunity.  This situation simply serves to underscore the poverty of the Government's foundation when it speaks about human rights.  What Administration could be taken seriously when its members pat themselves on the back for having legislation that protects human rights, such as the cluster bomb munitions treaty or the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, while the National Pensions Reserve Fund has investments in a number of companies that manufacture nuclear weapons, including Boeing, Honeywell International, Jacobs Engineering, Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro, Rolls-Royce, Safran, Thales, Rockwell Collins, Airbus, Fluor, Leidos, ThyssenKrupp and Babcock and Wilcox, to which AIB provided a four-year revolving credit package valued at $700 million in 2010?  I wish the bank had been as good to me.<br\/><br\/>The Taoiseach once berated Bertie Ahern for not raising the issue of India's refusal to sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty on a trade mission.  Now, the State invests in an Indian company that manufactures weapons, Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro.  The official line, to use the words of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, seems to be that trade missions are not the place to raise human rights issues effectively.<br\/><br\/>I fear that apart from highlighting the dishonesty, duplicity and double standards of this Government, the Bill and the principal Act may be used to restrict and clamp down on civil rights, freedom of expression, freedom of association and freedom of movement - similar legislation has been used in this way elsewhere - while simultaneously embedding institutionalised racism into our criminal justice system.<br\/><br\/>The inclusion of a series of new terrorist offences and the qualification that they need not necessarily be committed to be crimes is bewildering in its broad scope.  For example, the proposed section 4A defines the public provocation to commit a terrorist offence as &quot;the intentional distribution, or otherwise making available, by whatever means of communication by a person of a message to the public, with the intent of encouraging, directly or indirectly, the commission by a person of a terrorist activity&quot;.  If this meant that every time the Taoiseach or a Minister was held to account for trying to justify American warmongering, then I might consider it.  Sadly, however, this law will only be used to undermine the free speech of those whom it is politically expedient to criminalise.  By holding a monopoly on the definition of the word &quot;terrorism&quot; to the effect that terrorism is only something people other than us undertake, the Bill is built upon a false, unjust and hypocritical premise.<br\/><br\/>The great Nigerian-American novelist, Teju Cole, wrote in the wake of the Paris attacks:<blockquote>A tone of genuine puzzlement always seems to accompany terrorist attacks in the centers of Western power.  Why have they visited violent horror on our peaceful societies?  Why do they kill when we don't?<\/blockquote>This puzzlement is the product of a situation where the West, particularly the USA, &quot;has consolidated its traditional monopoly on extreme violence&quot;.  Accordingly, when the US and their Allies &quot;commit torture or war crimes, no matter how illegal or depraved, there is little expectation of a full accounting or of the prosecution of the parties responsible&quot;.  Some weeks ago Gary Younge of <i>The Guardian<\/i>framed the situation perfectly, stating that the West &quot;promotes itself as the upholder of principles it does not keep, and a morality it does not practise&quot;.<br\/><br\/>At the crux is the fact that we are discussing the extension of terrorism laws handed down from the planners of the great fortress that is Europe.  We close our borders, monitor our citizens, police our waters and build walls to keep out the threat of violence.<br\/><br\/>At least six children under the age of ten were among a reported 25 people killed in Saudi Arabian-led airstrikes in the Yemeni capital Sana'a early one morning a month ago.  What protections did these children have from our trade partner, Saudi Arabia?  Where are their border controls, defence systems and anti-terrorism legislation?  What recourse do the remaining family members of the 14 demolished houses have to attain justice against the powerful US-supported Saudi Arabia?  What structures are in place to prevent the surviving members of the family from being killed and maimed by the US-made cluster bombs that now scatter their countryside?  What incentive is there not to become one of our feared terrorists?  We need to tackle the root problem that this Bill is trying to address, not simply the symptom.<br\/><br\/>Last night, the Minister said there was no doubt that this was significant and timely legislation, particularly in view of the deplorable terrorism witnessed in Europe and beyond in recent times.  We agree that terrorist acts are terrible, but as long as we continue to ignore the fact that the US military machine has created more damage in this area than anyone else and that we are complicit by allowing that machine to continue to use Shannon Airport, then how in God's name can we say anything about human rights?  What can we possibly say in defence of people who suffer at the hands of terrorism when we stay silent and remain complicit?  It is too bad.  Are we going to ignore the reality forever?  When is an Irish Government going to stand up, behave like a neutral country and call a spade a spade?  Let us call the truth for what it is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700030#CC00200","speaker":"956","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431004200,"counter":367,"content":"<p>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this significant new criminal justice Bill, and I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to do so.  I pledge my full support for the enactment of this Bill by all Members from every side of this House.  I firmly believe that terrorism has no place in any modern society, or any country, for that matter, and that those criminals who choose to encourage, recruit or train others to carry out acts of terrorism, either domestically or internationally, should feel the full wrath of the Irish criminal justice system.<\/p>  <p>  Given our country's long and difficult history of dealing with terrorism and the long-lasting effects of terrorist atrocities, it is unfortunate that we are still affected somewhat by deranged criminals who believe that terrorising or attempting to terrorise innocent citizens is acceptable so long as it helps them to achieve their twisted ideology.  That is not acceptable.  As legislators, we need to act now to criminalise certain activities, such as terrorist recruitment or training and public provocation of terrorism offences, to try to prevent any further incidents from occurring in this country or abroad in conflicts such as the Syrian civil war and the ISIS conflict.<\/p>  <p>  Many counties in this country have experienced the full effects of terrorism in some way, shape or form in recent decades.  My county of Sligo has had its fair share of incidents in the past.  The most notable incident was the tragic event of 27 August 1979 in which Lord Mountbatten and two innocent children were murdered in Mullaghmore by the IRA during the height of the Troubles.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, despite the success of the peace process, the dreadful use of an explosive device as an act of terror is not confined to that troubled period in our history.  In recent times, the threat of domestic terrorism has increased again from dissident republican groups, subversives and large-scale criminal organisations.  A worrying example of this intensification occurred only last month in the quiet village of Ballysadare, County Sligo, where a dangerous pipe bomb device was detonated in a large estate where many children live and play.  I have been advised that had the timing of the explosion been different, there may well have been fatalities at this incident.  A similar incident occurred recently in County Leitrim, where another pipe bomb device was found in a rural community near Drumshanbo.  Both of these incidents required the Irish Defences Forces explosive ordnance disposal team to be deployed alongside the Garda.  These are only two examples of incidents in which explosive devices intended to kill were placed in my constituency.  There are many more to which I could refer if I had the time to do so.  The criminals behind these types of incident need to be stopped.  I am hopeful that the proposed Bill, which will create three new terrorist offences aimed at hitting terrorist training and recruitment, will be effective at stopping this worrying trend from developing any further.  Certainly, the introduction of the proposed crime of a public provocation to commit a terrorist offence is needed.<\/p><p> I say this because I am very concerned about how the use of the Internet and social media, in particular as a method of recruiting and promoting both domestic and international terrorism, is potentially affecting our citizens.  This is of particular importance to the international conflicts involving Islamic State in Syria and Iraq currently.  As I am sure the House is aware, ISIS openly uses social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook to promote its ideology and to post gruesome updates on its sectarian wars to a wide international audience, including Ireland.<\/p> <p> Alarmingly, up to 40 Irish passport holders are believed to be fighting with ISIS in Syria currently.  My first thought when I heard about this alarming figure was to wonder if they were radicalised online in Ireland, as many of the people from other countries who have joined ISIS claimed to be.  It is a worrying aspect which needs swift action from Government and I am happy to see this new Bill contains measures to combat this particular instance.<\/p> <p> I fully agree with the Minister when she says there should be no hiding place in domestic society for those who encourage, recruit or train others to carry out acts of terrorism.  I also know that it has taken a great deal of time and effort to get this Bill onto the floor of the House and I commend the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, and her officials at the Department of Justice and Equality on the work they have put into this Bill to get it this far.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700031#DD00200","speaker":"1082","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431004800,"counter":369,"content":"<p>I am pleased to support this very important legislation.  As the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, said in her opening remarks, we already have a body of anti-terrorist legislation but the last major legislation was almost ten years ago and, since then, the geopolitical landscape has changed utterly.  We have seen the inexorable growth of terrorism striking right into the heart of Europe, most recently in Paris, and also in Yemen, Tunisia and Nigeria.<\/p>  <p>  By definition, we know nowhere is safe because the essence of terrorism is that the terrorists instil fear of attack, even if no attack happens.  Their way of terrorising is to instil fear and use threat, stealth and intimidation.  Unfortunately, as we now know, the jihadists are increasingly successful in attracting young recruits, as well as money, to their cause.  They use social media and all of their psychological skills to persuade not just vulnerable young people, but also well-adjusted, educated young people, to abandon everything they know and everybody they love to travel thousands of miles in pursuit of what is an alleged religious ideal, which is incomprehensible to all of the rest of us, and, I might say, also incomprehensible to the vast majority of Muslims.<\/p>  <p>  In my own constituency, in Clonskeagh, we have the largest mosque and Muslim school in the country, so we have a very large Muslim population.  I have to say that these are extremely law-abiding citizens.  I have sympathy with them because many must feel they are regarded as, in some way, tainted by association with this terrorism, in much the way that Irish people felt when they lived in Britain during the IRA attacks in the 1980s and 1990s.  There is that fear that, simply because one is of the same religion or origin, one is in some way tainted by terrorism.<\/p>  <p>  Garda&iacute; here in Ireland, through their own efforts and their engagement with Interpol and Europol, have excellent intelligence.  Despite what some media reports seem to suggest, there are no more than a couple of dozen individuals here who garda&iacute; feel it is prudent to keep an eye on.  Therefore, I think we can be fairly confident that Ireland is not, in fact, a hotbed of terrorist activity.  I know also that, in addition to their intelligence, garda&iacute; are also proactive in prevention work and in engaging with the Muslim community to ensure that the young Muslim population is not subject to recruitment or any kind of grooming on social media or otherwise.<\/p>  <p>  Vigilance is necessary for all of us, however, particularly so with the ever-increasing movement of great numbers of people to Europe from Africa and the Middle East.  Those in this wave of immigrants are, for the most part, trying to escape war and want in either sub-Saharan Africa or the Middle East, in particular Syria and Iraq.  However, as part of its objective of instilling fear, Islamic State has threatened in the most cynical way to infiltrate Europe by posing as hapless migrants.<\/p>  <p>  It may well be, and I hope and pray it is, that Ireland is never subject to a terrorist attack but that does not in any way lessen the need for this legislation.  I say so for a number of reasons.  The new protocol to the European Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism covers this whole area of procuring terrorists.  It is essential for us to sign this protocol.  Once the legislation is in place, it opens the way for us to ratify the convention and it is absolutely timely that we do that, given the rapidly changing landscape.<\/p>  <p>  We owe it to the international community to show determined solidarity with it, and particularly with those who, unlike Ireland, have been attacked and are probably still vulnerable to further attacks in the future.  By ratifying the European Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism, we and all of the countries that ratify it send a strong signal that, no matter where these attacks take place, there will be no safe haven anywhere, either here or in any of the ratifying countries, for those perpetrating this kind of attack.  This will be the case no matter where they attack, be it in Nigeria, where young girls were taken from school and subjected to God knows what fate, because they have never been found; in Tunisia, where utterly blameless tourists were shot dead; or in Paris, where journalists suffered a similar fate.  In no case is it possible for us to identify any rationale behind these attacks, other than to try to strike terror into the civilised world.  By their actions, they show their utter disregard not just for the rule of law or for life or culture, but for all of the human rights which we aspire to and which distinguish civilised man from what is the very worst in human nature.<\/p>  <p>  Even in parts of Syria where Islamic State has taken control, its rule is not for the betterment of the people under it.  In fact, it still terrorises the population it rules.  In many cases, women in particular have not left their houses for months on end for fear of their lives or of enslavement.  People have not been able to send children to school for three years.  Life expectancy under Islamic State has fallen by 30%, from 79 years of age, which is typical of a western European country, down to 55 years of age in a mere four years.  Unfortunately, most of that drop in life expectancy is due to the high mortality rate among youth and children, as medicines, vaccines and medical services have all but disappeared under Islamic State.  In a mere four years, this is what terrorism can do to a country, transform it from being, if not a democratic country, then at least a peaceful and educated one, to the unspeakable conditions that now pertain for citizens today.  It is a lesson to all of us that if this can happen in Syria, it can literally happen anywhere.<\/p>  <p>  Only yesterday I read of girls and women who were rescued by the new Nigerian Government from terrorists in Nigeria.  Of the 324 who were rescued, 314 had been raped and were pregnant, many of them just young girls of 12 and 13 years of age.  This shows the utter ruthless brutality of this regime.  Therefore, I fully support this legislation as a step towards ratifying the European Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism and dealing specifically with the growing evidence of the widespread practice of procuring young male recruits and, indeed, female recruits, training them and financing them, and, if they do not die for their cause in some faraway land, returning them as fully-fledged jihadis to their home country to spread further terrorism.<\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, I want to say how much I support this legislation.  I know it is largely ignored by the media, and we are dealing with it on a quiet Thursday afternoon, but I suspect it is probably one of the most important Bills we will put through this term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700032#EE00200","speaker":"1026"},{"type":"speech","time":1431004800,"counter":370,"content":"<p>The Anti-Austerity Alliance will not be supporting this Bill.<\/p><p>We are, of course, opposed to terrorism.  It and all terrorist acts are currently illegal and will remain so, subject to very strict and severe sanctions, even if this Bill is defeated.  The Bill represents a broadening of the 2002 Council framework decision on combating terrorism, and that legislation represented a very serious erosion of civil liberties as well as playing into and encouraging a climate of Islamophobia.  <br\/><br\/>The framework decision defined terrorism as &quot;unduly compelling a Government to perform or abstain from performing an act&quot;, a definition so broad as to encompass the majority of people active in politics in this country.  It is so broad as to include everybody who participated in anti-water charge protests and mass protests in towns comprising hundreds of thousands of people, who could be said to be unduly seeking to pressurise the Government to scrap the water charges.  It defines it as seriously destabilising or destroying the fundamental political, constitutional, economic or social structures of a state or international organisation.  That definition is so broad that it covers anybody who is opposed to our structure of neoliberalism and capitalism.  By that definition, I am a terrorist, and the Labour Party of old may well have been defined as a terrorist group.  Some of those that would have come under the definition of terrorism in the past include the ANC in South Africa, which had the aim of overthrowing the racist apartheid constitution and regime, the Greenpeace occupation of oil rigs, which was aimed at large oil companies destroying the planet for profit, and protesters in Genoa against various organisations of international capital.  The safeguards introduced by the Council at the time are simply not enough.<br\/><br\/>The 2002 and 2008 framework decisions are part of a series of so-called counter-terrorism measures that have played a part in the serious erosion of democratic rights and freedoms in the European Union.  In total, 239 counter-terrorism measures were introduced in the EU from September 2001 until December 2013.  This is part of an international attack on civil liberties, which had its zenith in the US in terms of the USA PATRIOT Act and everything else in the aftermath of September 2001.  Those horrific crimes, for which ordinary people paid the price, were used to rightly whip up horror and revulsion against those terrorist acts.  They were also used as a whip to try to get people to accept an erosion of democratic rights, giving the illusion that with increased repression and decreased rights in terms of people's freedoms, civil liberties and right to information and data protection, we could somehow eliminate the threat of terrorism.  That is simply not the case.<br\/><br\/>A British social attitudes report in 2007 found that the very mention of something being a counter-terrorism measure made people more willing to contemplate giving up their freedoms.  It continued, &quot;It is as though society is in the process of forgetting why past generations thought these freedoms to be so very important&quot;.  That is the process we have seen over the past decade and a half, namely, the erosion of democratic rights under the guise of protecting people from the threat of terrorism.  We are likely to see a new phase.<br\/><br\/>After the terrorist attacks on <i>Charlie Hebdo<\/i>and a kosher supermarket in Paris in January, the French Government moved quickly in the wake of the mass revulsion against the barbaric attacks to introduce what is being dubbed France's PATRIOT Act.  The Act proposes a fine of &euro;150,000 and ten years in prison for someone holding explosives who had visited the website of a terrorist organisation.  Shockingly, it also gives the state the right to block websites and issue travel bans without recourse to a court or normal justice, including the checks and balances when people have their day in court.  Similar laws are in place or are being put in place in Denmark and Luxembourg.<br\/><br\/>In the UK, the Conservative-Liberal Democrat Government has published the UK's seventh counter-terrorism Bill in 14 years.  It includes travel bans, internal exile, the ability to stop UK citizens entering the UK and restrictions on Internet freedom.  Shami Chakrabarti of Liberty correctly said that these laws are a chilling recipe for injustice.  They come on top of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005, which allows for arbitrary house arrest, electronic tagging and travel restrictions.  The right to one's day in court is being dispensed with more and more.  Human rights lawyer Gareth Peirce described these measures as &quot;[T}he ultimate demand of any totalitarian regime: the executive is the accuser; the moment of the accusation is also the moment of the imposition of the penalty&quot;.<br\/><br\/>There is a trend across Europe of attacks on democratic rights, which is taking place against the backdrop of massive opposition to the political establishment across the Continent.  That opposition and mobilisation is feared by the capitalist classes across Europe and their political representatives.  They fear people exercising the democratic right to protest and mobilise in opposition to austerity and other neoliberal measures.  It is, therefore, no accident that these draconian laws are coming at this time.  It is a conscious use of fear to try to keep people down.<br\/><br\/>The latest Europol Terrorism Situation and Trend Report makes reference to people engaged in anti-eviction campaigns in Italy.  Will the new reports make reference to people engaged in protests against water meters or charges in Ireland?  Many will say that those laws and definition of terrorism may extend to people who are engaged in protest and opposition movements that are anti-austerity and social in nature, but they would not be used on those movements.  The experience of the introduction of draconian laws does not indicate that will be the case.  In fact, writing about the Council framework definition of terrorism, a professor in Oslo University stated that this legislation may not be used in such a broad and generalised way at first, but that we know from long experience that discretionary measures in this area will be employed less carefully and more broadly as time passes when the time is ripe and the need is there.  That is precisely what history demonstrates.<br\/><br\/>It is not enough to simply plead for this Government to promise not to go too far in using this legislation against peaceful protestors.  We can consider previous legislation.  The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act was debated in the D&aacute;il in 1994 in the context of dealing with drunkenness and threatening behaviour.  It is now regularly used against protestors.  It is the main law cited against those who are stopping water meters from being installed in communities where they are not wanted, protestors in Rossport and people who picket workplaces.  It is used again and again against those who attempt to fight back.  Another example is the miners' strike in Britain, which saw a similar use of legislation used against a major social movement.<br\/><br\/>This takes place in the context of a culture in which there has been a rise in Islamophobia.  In the course of the debate in the Seanad, some incredibly paranoid scare stories came from establishment politicians.  One Fianna F&aacute;il Senator implied that jihadists would be training in the Wicklow mountains or on a remote island off the coast.  It plays into the idea that the majority or a significant minority of Muslims are terrorists and adds to the idea of a clash of civilisations.  The first victims of jihadists were Muslims.  The Europol report from 2014 shows that the majority of terrorist incidents and arrests in Europe are not related to any religious motives, but rather to separatists.  <br\/><br\/>There is a whipping up of fear and an atmosphere of Islamophobia and fear about the radicalisation of Muslim youth.  We have to understand the root causes of terrorism because, as I said, all of these things are illegal.  More repressive laws will not stop terrorism.  The things that have driven people into the arms of organisations in some cases are the poverty and precarious situation of young working-class people, the endemic and systematic racism and discrimination faced by young Muslims and other ethnic minorities and an anger against imperialism and what has happened in Iraq, Syria, Palestine, Somalia, Yemen, Libya, Mali and the Central African Republic, all of which have experienced interventions.  <br\/><br\/>We need instead to build a world with no poverty, precariousness, war or exploitation, and no repression of terror Acts will deliver that.  Rather, the mass force of people from below can achieve that, just as they achieved the revolutions in North Africa and the Middle East, the overthrow of Ben Ali in Tunisia and of Mubarak in Egypt, despite all of the complications and reversals and counter-revolutions that have happened since then.  Mass action by ordinary people holds the key.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700032#EE00300","speaker":"1197","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431006000,"counter":372,"content":"<p>I am pleased to be able to speak on this important legislation concerning terrorist offences as a member of the Oireachtas justice committee.  The Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) (Amendment) Bill is a significant piece of legislation with two primary objectives, namely, amending the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) (Amendment) Act 2005 in order to give effect to EU directives agreed under the Lisbon treaty and allowing Ireland to ratify the Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill creates three new offences in respect of terrorist activity which are covered by the amending framework decision and the Council of Europe convention to which Ireland is already a signatory.  These three new offences are the public provocation to commit a terrorist offence; recruitment for terrorism; and training for terrorism.  The Government is committed to combating terrorism, as this legislation demonstrates.  Ireland needs to legislate to be able to combat terrorism in all of its guises and that includes being able to confront, when required to do so, incitement to commit terrorist offences and recruitment and training in order to carry out terrorist activities.<\/p>  <p>  Our own history demonstrates why legislating for these offences is important and should enable Ireland to look abroad to our fellow European countries and focus on combating terrorism alongside them so that the citizens of the European Union can be safe and protected.  Those who would threaten the lives of ordinary people by engaging in acts of terrorism, whether on this island or elsewhere, must be brought to justice and must know that the international community will not tolerate their activity and will take all possible activity to prevent and punish it.  <\/p>  <p>  Although it is possible to criticise the comments I have just made, our own history must be considered when it comes to legislation such as this.  We should also look to recent events, for example, in Paris where we saw the shooting of a journalist and other people, the bombings in Madrid in 2004 when a large number of people on trains were killed and others suffered, and similar bombings targeting people on public transport in London in 2007.  Another event that comes to mind in all its horror, which is easily one of the most despicable acts of terrorism carried out in recent years, is the attack in 2011 against the people of Oslo and the Norwegian labour party.  This comes to mind because of two copycat attempts that occurred subsequently in the Czech Republic and in Poland.  This is directly relevant to the legislation that is before the House today.<\/p>  <p>  While the threat level to Ireland from international terrorism is considered to be low, we must remain vigilant, particularly where the possibility of lone wolf type actions witnessed elsewhere in Europe is concerned.  The random and unpredictable nature of such attacks makes them a particular matter for concern.  It is important, therefore, that we have the relevant tools at our disposal to deal with terrorist threats in all their forms and at all stages, including incitement and other preparatory activities.  By criminalising the terrorist linked activities of provocation, recruitment and training, the legislation further strengthens our hand in this regard.  I am pleased to commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700034#GG00100","speaker":"1021"},{"type":"speech","time":1431006000,"counter":373,"content":"<p>As there are no other speakers, I call on the Minister of State to reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700034#GG00200","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1431006000,"counter":374,"content":"<p>The Minister for Justice and Equality, who introduced the Bill in this House last evening, regrets that she is unable to be here today and I am pleased to stand in for her for the remainder of the debate.  On behalf of the Minister, I wish to thank the House for giving its time to this most important matter.  I thank Deputies for their contributions, comments and general if not unanimous support for this important legislation.  It is clear that there is a shared determination to combat terrorism, in all its forms and at all stages.  This Bill strengthens our hand in this regard by further developing and enhancing existing counter-terrorism legislation.  It focuses on the more subtle, indirect and insidious aspects of modern terrorism, namely, public provocation, recruitment and training.  The Bill makes it an offence to engage in any of these preparatory activities and provides strong penalties for those found guilty of them, including up to ten years imprisonment if the crime is sufficiently serious.<\/p><p>We continue to learn that events far from our shores may have an impact on us domestically.  Thankfully, Ireland has not experienced any of the horrendous attacks experienced in other European member states, yet we must never be complacent.  This legislation will add to Ireland's ability to deal with the threat from terrorism both domestically and internationally.<\/p><p>While we have not yet been directly affected, we must, as a long-standing member of the EU, show solidarity with our fellow member states.  In that regard, the House can be assured that Ireland will continue to contribute to initiatives in this area from a European perspective also.  A number of points of action have been identified as requiring particular priority from an EU perspective.  The Minister for Justice and Equality yesterday alluded to the EU passenger name records directive in some detail.  Member states also continue to examine other ways in which our security and policing agencies can enhance levels of co-operation and information exchange.  Europol has recently proposed the setting up of a counter-terrorism Internet referral unit where police agencies can exchange information on abuses of the Internet for terrorist purposes.  This is to be welcomed and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to co-operate with its international colleagues in this sphere.<\/p><p>More also needs to be learned about the individuals financing and supporting terrorism within Europe.  The many and circuitous routes foreign fighters take to travel to the combat areas must be identified and greater engagement with non-member states who have a shared interest in these matters must occur.  Initiatives in this area are ongoing and being developed.  This is a truly international problem.<\/p><p>The threat from international terrorism is also undoubtedly a complex one.  There was a time when we could point at a specific organisation or structure and take action to reduce its terror capabilities and dismantle its infrastructure.  The new nature of terrorism is much more random and the traditional formal organisational and hierarchical structures no longer apply in many cases.  The threat becomes more difficult to detect, anticipate and deal with.<\/p><p>Many of the attacks we have seen recently are carried out by individuals or small cells of individuals, self-motivated and radicalised.  Some have received training in the combat zones of the Middle East.  A number of the attacks in France bear this hallmark.  The attacks carried out by these<i><\/i>individuals clearly demonstrate the threat posed by the foreign fighter phenomenon.<\/p><p>As previously outlined, the Internet has proved a powerful tool for the forces of radicalisation.  The EU has identified curbing the use of the Internet for recruitment and radicalisation purposes as another key action requiring attention.  The challenge in this area is phenomenal.  For example, it is estimated that 300 hours of content are uploaded to YouTube every minute.  Twitter processes 500 million tweets per day.  For every site or tweet taken down, there are many more waiting to replace them.  Dealing with the abuse of these resources, which are enjoyed by many for legitimate reasons, requires more than simply attempting to remove the offending content or making its presence illegal.  It is apparent that the companies offering Internet based and social media services do not view the exploitation of their product by terrorists as desirable.  Indeed these companies are engaged in trying to develop ways of addressing the issue.  However, the ready availability of this content needs to be questioned.  We are not talking about curbing freedoms of expression or speech here.  We are simply asking whether this doctrine of hate and intolerance should go unchallenged.  Greater engagement with the technology companies and Internet service providers is required.  More research is also needed into what content has a genuinely radicalising effect and what does not.  Is it, for example, the preaching of radical clerics or, particularly where young people are concerned, simply peer group pressure?  Why is it that our modern progressive democracies based on free speech and expression seem so hateful to some of our own citizens?  Hard questions need to be asked.  Responses need to be developed.<\/p><p>Considerable resources have been invested by the EU Commission in the creation of its radicalisation awareness network to examine the issue of radicalisation in all of its facets.  These include initiatives in the areas of policing, community relations, prisons, mental health and the technology sectors.  Ireland contributes on a number of fronts to the workings of this network.<\/p><p>It is obviously very important to have international co-operation, strong security measures and empowering legislation to deal with the terrorist threat.  A purely law enforcement based approach will not, however, sufficiently address radicalisation and violent extremism.  It is also necessary to have policies and initiatives in place at national level that serve to discourage people from being drawn into extremist activity and to protect communities that may be at risk from radical sources.  The best prevention is to stop people from getting involved in anti-social, violent or terrorist activity in the first place and to convince them to turn away from such behaviour.  There is a need for meaningful engagement with communities who may be under threat from radical sources. <\/p><p> An important part of this process is avoiding any sense of profiling or stigmatising sectors of the population.  The protection of fundamental rights and the recognition that the majority of people want to live peaceably and play a productive part in society are enshrined in this engagement.  Integration of all of our citizens in our society - their society - has a very important role to play in this regard.  A good example of a proactive approach in engaging with our minority communities is the work of the Garda racial, intercultural and diversity office to which the Minister referred yesterday in her opening speech.<\/p> <p> On the subject of integration and inclusiveness, the office for the promotion of migrant integration in the Department of Justice and Equality is in the process of developing a new strategy on migrant integration.  This follows a lengthy consultation process with a wide range of groups representing migrants throughout society.  This process of engagement is very important not just in the context of seeking to prevent seditious activity, but in the general spirit of inclusiveness for all of our citizens in our democratic society.<\/p> <p> In his contribution on the Bill last evening, Deputy Collins inquired as to what action could be taken on Irish citizens engaging in foreign fighting.  The Passports Act 2008 contains provisions under which the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade can refuse or cancel a passport.  Should the Minister, following consultation with the Minister for Justice and Equality and-or the Minister for Defence, as appropriate, form the opinion that a person would be likely to engage in conduct that would prejudice national security or the security of another state, the Minister may cancel a passport already issued to an Irish citizen.  A cancelled passport must be surrendered to the Minister.  A person who uses or attempts to use a cancelled passport is guilty of an offence and is liable on conviction on indictment to a fine or imprisonment for a term of up to ten years.<\/p> <p> In addition, the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, provides for the revocation of citizenship of naturalised persons in certain circumstances.  In the event of any information being brought to the attention of the Minister for Justice and Equality which should have been disclosed by a naturalised citizen, the Minister can invoke the statutory process which exists for the consideration of revocation of citizenship.  I understand, however, that the revocation of citizenship is not an entirely straightforward matter.  Such cases would have to be handled on a case by case basis, in consultation with the State's legal services.  Certain factors would have to be taken into account, such as whether the person has dual citizenship and whether he or she has already re-entered the country.  Under the relevant legislation the subject has the right to appeal to a statutory committee which then considers the matter in full and reports its findings to the Minister for Justice and Equality, who will then decide on the matter.<\/p> <p> There is considerable concern throughout Europe and elsewhere at the phenomenon of individuals travelling to conflict areas in the Middle East and the consequential threat posed to national security.  While the number of Irish citizens who are believed to have travelled to the conflict zones is estimated at between 25 and 30, within this number are individuals who travelled to Libya and other Arab states to take part in the popular uprisings known as the Arab Spring which began in December 2010.  Some of these individuals are known to have returned and three died in the conflicts.  In Ireland, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na monitors the movements of those suspected of involvement in extremist behaviour, and in line with best practice internationally has engaged with returnees from the conflict areas.  For obvious reasons it is not possible to be any more specific than this.<\/p> <p> Dealing with, and discouraging, extremist and terrorist activity is obviously very different from discouraging or suppressing legitimate rights to freedom of speech or the expression of opinions and political ideologies.  It is vital in a democratic world that the right to express views and beliefs, sometimes outside the mainstream, is protected and that journalists, for instance, are free to voice their commentary.  Such fundamental human rights should not be compromised, as to do so would play into the hands of extremists who would seek to forcibly deprive us of these rights.<\/p> <p> I will turn to specific questions asked by Deputies.  Deputy Mac Lochlainn asked about the delay in the transposition of the amending Council framework decision on combating terrorism.  Transposition of EU legislation is, unfortunately, often delayed not due to any lack of commitment or willingness on Government's part, but due to the volume of legislation produced by the EU and to competing demands with domestic legislation.  It is a question of prioritisation and I expect that the Bill will be enacted very shortly.<\/p> <p> Deputies asked why the definition of \"terrorist activity\" and \"terrorist linked activity\" in the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005 are so broad.  The 2008 framework decision, to which this legislation gives effect, provides for the addition of three new offences to the definition of \"terrorist linked activity\" in the 2005 Act.  All member states agree these new offences should be included in any definition of terrorist linked activity at this time, thereby building on the existing offences contained in the 2005 Act.<\/p> <p> Existing offences covered by the definitions of \"terrorist activity\" and \"terrorist linked activity\" are set out in Schedule 2 of the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005.  The Schedule lists the offences which, with the requisite intent, would constitute terrorist offences.  These include common law offences such as murder and rape; offences under the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997; offences under the Criminal Damage Act 1991; offences under the Explosives Substances Act 1883; and offences under the Firearms Acts and Chemical Weapons Act, to name but a few.  In this way, only the most serious offences are covered in our legislation by the definitions of \"terrorist activity\" and \"terrorist linked activity\".<\/p> <p> In response to the points raised by Deputies Daly and Murphy, section 6(5) of the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005 provides that where persons engage in protest, advocacy or dissent it does not in and of itself constitute a terrorist offence.  The Government has repeatedly made it clear that extraordinary rendition is an illegal practice which Ireland does not accept, and there is no question of the State having been complicit in the practice of extraordinary rendition.  Any person with credible information that Irish airports are being used for any alleged unlawful purpose should report their concerns to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p> <p> Deputy Mitchell mentioned Ireland's ratification of the Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism.  One of the purposes of the Bill is to enable Ireland to ratify this convention.  Work will begin on this process following the enactment of this legislation.<\/p> <p> I note that an amendment on data protection and onward transfer will be tabled by Deputy Mac Lochlainn on Committee Stage and we will address this next week.<\/p> <p> The Bill will ensure there are no gaps in our laws that can be exploited by those who would seek to inflict terror and mayhem on innocent people at home and abroad.

It has been a concern of citizens in west Kildare, particularly in the Carbury area.  This stems from the fact that Garda numbers in Kildare have not increased in line with population.  In 2014, there were 305 full-time garda&iacute; in Kildare, while there were 306 in 2008.  There has been a 12% increase in population in the area but there has not been a corresponding increase in the number of garda&iacute;.  The lack of policing has had serious consequences for people in the area.  People must travel as far as 40 km to Leixlip for day to day issues like getting a simple passport form and they believe that they are sitting ducks for burglaries.  Community alert schemes have been told there is no point in contacting the Garda because of the length of time it will take garda&iacute; to arrive at the location.<\/p>  <p>  Apart from day to day policing issues, crime in the area has taken a nasty turn in recent times.  This is normally a very quiet rural area, but the absence of a full-time Garda station and inadequate policing in recent years have not gone unnoticed by some of the country's most serious criminal gangs, who view the area as an ideal base for their activities.  Ease of access to Dublin and lack of policing mean that this quiet area has become a magnet for a criminal drug gang, which is wreaking havoc.  The people involved are ruthless, heavy-handed thugs with no regard for people, who operate on fear and intimidation.  The escalation of violence was covered recently by the national media.  Incidents include a Garda station being shot at in the middle of the night, an attempt to set the station on fire and several cars being burnt out.  In addition, the GRA has recently confirmed that six garda&iacute; who work at the station had death threats made against them.  One was even followed home and their families were threatened.  People in this area are living in fear.  I recognise the fact that extra recruits have come out of Templemore in recent months and that several garda&iacute; have been stationed in this area.  The one thing we cannot have is people going about their ordinary lives in intimidation and fear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700037#KK00500","speaker":"1053"},{"type":"speech","time":1431007500,"counter":384,"content":"<p>I have raised on numerous occasions the activities of criminal gangs in this country and the extent to which they impact on the lives of law-abiding citizens.  The situation in north-west Kildare in particular has taken a bad turn in recent times.  Over the past ten years or so there has been a noticeable increase in criminal activity in that area.  It has grown gradually but has now grown to the extent that there is absolute contempt for garda&iacute; and their families.  As has been explained by my colleague, it has now resulted in garda&iacute; and private citizens being personally intimidated and family members of garda&iacute; families being intimidated and threatened.  That is totally unacceptable.  A strong response to that challenge is required.

She is grateful to the Deputies for raising this important matter in the House, one of importance not just for Kildare, but for the country and society as a whole.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister has asked me to assure the Deputies that she is, of course, aware of the threats made against members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in County Kildare.  I have no doubt that every Member of this House will share the Minister's view, and mine, that such actions are to be roundly condemned.  I know that we also all appreciate how important it is that we discuss this issue in a manner which does not heighten the distress for those impacted and their families.  It is, regrettably, also the case that the issue of intimidation of garda&iacute; going about their duty is not confined to the instances referred to by the Deputies.<\/p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na plays a key role in keeping citizens and communities safe and secure.  On our behalf, day in, day out, individual garda&iacute; carry out challenging, demanding and sometimes dangerous tasks in the course of their duty.  In doing that, garda&iacute; are deserving of the support they get from the communities they serve.  The Minister knows that individual garda&iacute;, in the best traditions of the force, will not be intimidated from carrying out their duties and will continue to do so without fear or favour.<\/p>  <p>  As the House will understand, it would neither be wise nor appropriate for the Minister to detail the operational measures the Garda authorities have taken or would take generally in these situations.  I can say on her behalf, however, that she has asked to be kept briefed by the Garda Commissioner in relation to the specific circumstances at issue.  She is aware that whatever protective and detection measures are deemed appropriate by the Garda authorities will certainly be taken.  The individual safety of garda&iacute; is a priority for the Garda authorities, as it is for all of us.  While the criminal law in this area is being kept under ongoing review, I should also say that there is a range of robust legislative provisions available to the Garda authorities in circumstances where threats or assaults are made against garda&iacute;.<\/p>  <p>  In so far as the question of resources for policing generally in Kildare is concerned, the Deputies will appreciate that the deployment of personnel across the State is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.  I can advise them that the number of garda&iacute; assigned to the division as of 31 March was 299 garda&iacute;, of which 73 were in the Leixlip district, which includes Carbury Garda station, where five garda&iacute; were assigned.  Two additional Garda personnel have been allocated to Carbury in recent times.  The allocation of overall Garda resources is kept under continuing review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure resources are put to the best possible use.<\/p>  <p>  For the Minister and the Government's part, however, the key point is that thanks to the resumption of recruitment, the Garda Commissioner now has the capacity to deploy new garda&iacute; for the first time since 2009.  In fact, on 8 May, five new probationer garda&iacute; are due to transfer to the Kildare Garda division.  Similarly, investments are being made in vehicles and IT, and in the recruitment of specialist professional staff.  Policing and community safety in Kildare will undoubtedly benefit from this injection of resources, as it will in all other Garda divisions.<\/p>  <p>  This investment demonstrates the commitment of the Minister and the Government to supporting the Garda in carrying out its duties, including in the ongoing fight against organised and serious crime.  We have not been under any illusion about the depths to which those involved in this type of criminality will sink.  The latest incidents reinforces that and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to confront, disrupt and bring to justice those involved, on behalf of all law-abiding citizens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700038#LL00200","speaker":"1018"},{"type":"speech","time":1431007800,"counter":387,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

Three Garda stations are located within 10 km of each other, one in Edenderry, one in Enfield and one in Derrinturn.  They are probably in three different districts.  Perhaps the Garda Commissioner might consider opening one of the three stations on a 24-hour basis to service the area.  It is important for people to have confidence that they can go about their daily lives without living in fear of intimidation or criminal activity by the gang in this area.

If such a response is not forthcoming, it may be seen as a weakness on the part of the authorities.

It naturally follows that their families should not live in fear and that other families in the area should not live in fear.  There is a need to respond in a way that is fairly dramatic, as has happened in other situations.  I say that in particular because the area in question is in the greater Dublin area and provides easy access from the point of view of criminal activity on a 24-7 basis.

Since the start of 2014 we have seen an almost continuous increase in waiting lists both for outpatient consultations and for scheduled day case and inpatient procedures.  The latest figures for April are remarkable because they show that for outpatients, there are now 412,422 on the waiting list.  Of those, 83,347 are waiting more than a year while more than 11,000 are waiting more than two years.  A total of 2,166 are waiting more than three years and a most unfortunate 778 people are on the outpatient waiting list for more than four years.<\/p>  <p>  A total of 3,879 children are waiting more than a year in the children's hospital group alone, that is, Crumlin and Temple Street hospitals.  That is a doubling of the number in the past year and obviously there are more children waiting to be seen in other hospitals across the country.  The number of outpatients waiting more than a year is up 16,725, or 25.1%, since the start of 2015 alone.  The year-on-year figures show a jump of 60,601, or 266.4%, for the numbers waiting more than a year.<\/p><p>For inpatient and day case procedures, there are now 67,165 on the list, with 27,260 waiting longer than the internationally accepted benchmark of six months.  A total of 9,433 are waiting more than a year and 361 of these are in the children's hospital group.<\/p> <p> The Government set a target for children of 20 weeks.  Yesterday's HSE performance report for February showed that the target was being reached in a miserable 56.2% of cases, compared to 84% in February 2014.  The following hospitals did not even get half way to the children's 20 week target in February - Beaumont Hospital at 48.1%, Cavan General Hospital at 34.1%, University Hospital Waterford at 48.9%, Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, at 41.1% , the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital at 47.2%, Letterkenny General Hospital at 47.2% and Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin, at 47.8%.  In fairness to the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, he said that things would get worse before they got better.  Obviously, they have got much worse.<\/p> <p> As a Kildare Deputy, I am relieved to see that Naas General Hospital's figures have not risen as much as many others, but many Kildare people go to Tallaght hospital and the figures for that hospital are truly appalling.  There are 30,713 people waiting for an outpatient appointment in Tallaght hospital.  It is not the worst in the country overall, but 9,825 of those people, almost one in three, are waiting more than a year.  That is an increase of 1,303 since January and an increase of 5,235 in a year.  It has more than doubled since April 2014.<\/p> <p> When will things get better?  All the Minister appears to have done is scrap his predecessor's target times.  Obviously more resources are required.  The Minister told us he had achieved a realistic budget last October but he has since required an additional &euro;74 million in funding to confront the realities of overcrowding in emergency departments.  Will the Minister be seeking a further Supplementary Estimate to his realistic budget, as he described it, to address these appalling waiting times and when can we expect it?<\/p> <p> The difficulty is that real human beings are enduring real hardship and suffering as a result of the bogus budgets the Department of Health has brought before this House in each of the past two years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700038#LL00700","speaker":"1054","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431008400,"counter":393,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l for raising this issue.  I am replying on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Varadkar, who sends his apologies for being unable to be in the House this afternoon.  He is otherwise engaged on Government business.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Future Health plan, significant structural changes are envisaged for the acute hospital sector, with the formation of hospital groups and the reconfiguration of services to improve both quality and access.  These major structural changes will take some time to implement and there remain significant operating pressures on acute hospitals, including waiting lists for inpatient and day case treatments and outpatient appointments.  Reducing these waiting lists is a key priority for Government.  Taking into account current pressures on acute hospital services, the Minister has put in place a target that by mid-year nobody will wait more than 18 months for treatment or an outpatient appointment; by year-end, that target will be revised to a wait time of no more than 15 months.  When these targets were announced in February, there were 4,996 patients to be treated by the end of June 2015.  As of 1 May, there are 3,508 patients requiring treatment by the end of June 2015 if the 18 month target is to be achieved, a reduction of almost 1,500.<\/p>  <p>  It is acknowledged that the volume of the outpatient waiting list is far greater, principally due to consultant shortages in particular specialties and resource pressures on a small number of hospitals.  The HSE has put in place specific measures to manage waiting lists more efficiently, including observation of the national waiting list protocol, adherence to relevant HSE national clinical programme guidelines, prioritising day-of-surgery admission where clinically appropriate and validation of inpatient waiting lists to establish and maintain a precise current position regarding the volume of people awaiting care.  The monthly publication of hospital and speciality level waiting list information on the National Treatment Purchase Fund website is a welcome development, as is the HSE service plan commitment to the publication of waiting lists at consultant and speciality level.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised that the acute hospitals division is meeting weekly with the hospital groups to review performance against agreed clearance plans for all treatment waiting lists.  A similar process is in place for outpatient appointments, with the assistance in particular of the national clinical programmes for orthopaedics, rheumatology and surgery.  New pathways of care to improve patient flow through hospitals, such as medical assessment units, local injury units and urgent care centres, as well as care provision in non-hospital settings, can and must be used to provide a spectrum of care which supports the efficient use of hospital resources.<\/p>  <p>  Waiting list performance will be assessed within the revised accountability framework for the HSE, which requires formal performance management for hospitals to include access, quality, outcomes and financial performance.  The work of the special delivery unit indicates that there is still significant potential to improve performance in hospitals.  The hospital redesign programme is working with the national clinical programmes to support local change and innovation and raise national standards through the use of internationally recognised redesign and improvement methodologies.<\/p>  <p>  Based on the emergency department task force's action plan and in view of experience to date, the Government is providing additional funds of &euro;74 million, in addition to the &euro;25 million provided in 2014, to address delayed discharges and support initiatives which improve timeliness for admissions from emergency departments and waiting lists.  The Department of Health will continue to work with the HSE to ensure that all issues relating to hospital waiting lists are resolved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700039#MM00200","speaker":"1098"},{"type":"speech","time":1431008400,"counter":394,"content":"<p>The Minister has my sympathy.

His response was to create a situation where it was addressed to some extent, although in Naas General Hospital, for example, over the past 12 months record numbers of people were treated on trolleys, which is absolutely unacceptable.  However, as a result of the initiative taken by the Minister to address the crisis in emergency departments, there has been an exponential and phenomenal increase in the waiting lists for services throughout the health sector.<\/p>  <p>  All of this comes back to one critical issue, the funding of the health services.  Over the past two budgets this House was presented with figures for the health budget that were inaccurate, not based on fact, bogus and which have been described on a number of occasions by Members on this side of the House as fraudulent.

We are pretty far down the league of countries cited in the report and it most certainly is not good news for those in the retail sector, the hospitality sector, hairdressing, and the security industry, where traditionally wages have been low.  We now have a situation in which many of the workforce are working for less than the minimum wage.<\/p>  <p>  Having said that, we can all appreciate that what is happening in those sectors is a replica of what happened during the 1980s, when the country had its most recent recession.  Many people were out of work and chasing limited job opportunities, which made them very vulnerable to unscrupulous employers.  On top of that, as at present, there was the difficulty of falling trade union membership which, unfortunately, meant that people who should have trade union representation in the retail or hospitality sector were without it.  For many people in low-paid employment, as someone said to me during the Dunnes Stores day of action on 2 April, if faced with the prospect of working below the minimum wage, or just on the minimum wage, or going on the dole, most people will opt to work for the minimum wage.  That is the reality and it is what happened in the 1980s.  It has adverse consequences, with many people struggling in the sector.  It is not that these industries are not making money; they most certainly are, and Dunnes Stores is a good example.  Rather, it is about the treatment of people, and the report highlights this.  It is important that, as a Government and as a Parliament, we make a stand on this.  I welcome the Irish Congress of Trade Unions charter for fair conditions at work, which rightly indicates that the living wage should be &euro;11.45, which I would support.  I hope that all parliamentarians in the House would support the work of Congress in achieving the living wage of &euro;11.45 into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700040#NN00500","speaker":"1038"},{"type":"speech","time":1431009000,"counter":404,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue.  I note that he referred to the recent OECD paper entitled \"Minimum wages after the crisis: Making them pay\".  This is a very interesting cross-OECD report which clearly illustrates that adjustments to the national minimum wage take place within the context of tax and social transfer policies as well as the broader earnings, employment and economic impacts of such adjustments.<\/p>  <p>  It should be borne in mind that the national minimum wage in Ireland is relatively high by international standards, and the House will recall that this Government restored the national minimum wage to &euro;8.65 per hour with effect from 1 July 2011.  The most recent figures published by EUROSTAT show that Ireland's rate is the fifth highest among the 22 member states that have a national minimum wage.  When the cost of living is taken into account, Ireland's rate is the sixth highest.<\/p>  <p>  Approximately 70,000 employees are on the national minimum wage.  I assure Deputy Maloney that if an employer is found to be in breach of the National Minimum Wage Act and is not paying at least &euro;8.65 per hour, that is an offence and will be investigated by the National Employment Rights Agency. <\/p>  <p>  In reviewing the paper, it is important to bear in mind that the conclusions are based on data from 2013.  As the House is aware, there have been significant positive developments in the performance of the economy overall and in tax and social policy protections for the most vulnerable in our society since then.  In this context, 410,000 low-paid workers have been removed from the USC charge over successive budgets, and the Government will continue this policy of tax reductions for such workers in the next budget and subsequent budgets if we are given a mandate to do so.  At the same time, the Government has introduced targeted welfare supports for people returning to work, and particularly for the low paid.  I know those are measures that the Deputy supports.  The Government will pay &euro;30 a week to mothers or fathers returning to work from long-term unemployment in respect of each child for the first year, and &euro;15 per week per child for the second year.  This is a very important back-to-work dividend for families to ensure that work always pays.  <\/p>  <p>  For those trapped on rent supplement who cannot go back to work because they will lose their housing support, a new housing assistance payment is being rolled out.  The assistance from the State will be based on how much one earns and not on one's employment status.  The Department of Social Protection also supports low-income families in work through the family income supplement.  These initiatives address issues identified in the paper, such as the fact that even at the bottom of the income ladder, taxes and social levies can strongly reduce take-home pay, and the size of the overall tax burden has implications for how well the national minimum wage supports low-wage workers and low-income families.  In this regard, it is worth noting that Ireland ranks very favourably against other OECD countries in terms of the level of employee taxes and social contributions for those on the minimum wage.  It also finds that when social benefits are included, the minimum wage in Ireland is particularly effective at moving minimum wage workers above the poverty line.<\/p>  <p>  In many ways, the report confirms the utility of the Government's twin-track approach in assisting those on low pay through reviews of the national minimum wage and pay restoration while also tackling the increased burden of taxation that resulted from managing ourselves out of the economic crisis.  It identifies a potential issue for Ireland with regard to the net benefit to Irish workers on the minimum wage of any increase in the minimum wage.  As I stated earlier, the data utilised are out of date, given the recent budgetary and social policy initiatives introduced by the Government.  None the less, I have no doubt that this issue will be considered and fully explored by the Low Pay Commission in the coming months.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputy Maloney will be aware, the commission has been operating on an interim administrative basis since last February, and the Government yesterday approved the Bill to give it statutory effect.  This will be published in the coming days.  I look forward to the debate in the coming weeks in the House on the Low Pay Commission Bill, which will give statutory effect to that body.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700040#NN00600","speaker":"1067"},{"type":"speech","time":1431009600,"counter":405,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State very much for such a comprehensive answer.  I think he would share my view that the message from this House is one of solidarity with those on the minimum wage and who have difficulties in their day to day lives.  I listened closely to what the Minister of State said and commend the speed with which he took action on the Low Pay Commission shortly after his appointment.  That is very important.  I think every Member of this House would oppose zero-hour contracts.<\/p>  <p>  I look forward to the legislation the Minister of State has had drafted on collective bargaining.  In solidarity with those on the minimum wage and those whose pay is below that, it is important to recognise that, as law-makers, Members of this House have a special responsibility to support the sort of initiatives the Minister of State has taken and the new legislation that will come before the House because it will protect the most vulnerable in the workplace.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700041#OO00100","speaker":"1038"},{"type":"speech","time":1431009600,"counter":406,"content":"<p>The Cabinet approved my draft Bill to place the Low Pay Commission on a statutory footing.  When I publish the Bill in the coming days, Deputy Maloney will be interested to see one of its key provisions is a legal requirement that the Low Pay Commission produce a report on, or before, 15 July each year.  There is a compelling reason for providing in primary legislation that the report be returned to the Minister of the day by a particular date.  That is designed to ensure it is provided well in advance of any budgetary, tax and social welfare changes the Departments of Finance and Social Protection might consider.  We want to ensure that any changes recommended by the Low Pay Commission and, subsequently, adopted by Government would be positive and that they would not be nullified by any tax or social welfare changes in budgets.<\/p>  <p>  The national minimum wage rate has not been fundamentally reviewed since 2007.  The rate was adjusted downwards by &euro;1 - shamefully so - by the previous Government.  We adjusted that and brought it up to &euro;8.65 on election in 2011.  It is better for society and the economy and makes good economic and business planning sense to ensure there are more frequent reviews of the national minimum wage.  That is what the Low Pay Commission will do.  It will also examine other issues related to low pay but its primary legislative function and exclusive focus over the past few months after it was set up on an interim basis was to examine the rate of the national minimum wage and whether that should be adjusted.  I look forward to receiving the report of the Low Pay Commission very shortly.  I have always supported frequent reviews of the minimum wage to try to take into account the changing economic circumstances annually to ensure that those whom we need to protect in this society, people on low pay and those in vulnerable situations, get the protection I and Deputy Maloney think they are entitled to.<\/p>  <p>  In the next couple of days, I will publish legislation, which was approved by Cabinet last night, on collective bargaining and the reintroduction of a registered employment agreement system.  I look forward to the debate on those Bills in the next few weeks.  I intend that legislation will be enacted by the end of this D&aacute;il session, by the middle or end of July.  If we have any role, it should be to ensure an economic recovery that ensures the jobs we create are decent and sustainable.  We want decent work and high standards in our society and economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700041#OO00200","speaker":"1067"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Message from Seanad","time":1431009600,"counter":407,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700041#OO00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1431009600,"counter":408,"content":"<p>Seanad &Eacute;ireann has passed the Sport Ireland Bill 2014, without amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700041#OO00400","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1431009600,"counter":409,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at at 3.55 p.m. until 10 a.m. on Friday, 8 May 2015.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
