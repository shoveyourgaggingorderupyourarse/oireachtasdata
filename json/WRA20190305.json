Therefore, equality budgeting is contained within the existing performance budgeting framework and utilises the processes already in place. <\/p>  <p>  The measures identified in the pilot related mainly to gender equality but as I outlined in my budget statement in October equality budgeting remains a priority for the coming year and I am therefore expanding the programme to further develop the gender budgeting elements, and to broaden its scope to other dimensions of equality including poverty, socioeconomic inequality and disability. This expansion is being supported by an Equality Budgeting Expert Advisory Group which brings expert knowledge on how best to progress this important work.

In addition to a number of high profile insolvencies tender, prices dropped by 30% as contractors competed to win the remaining work available.<\/p>  <p>  In 2014 the performance of the public works contracts was reviewed and, given the challenging tender environment preceding the review, the issue of price and its impact on the award and performance of the contract was identified.  The report published in 2014 set out a series of recommendations and specifically highlighted the need for much greater definition of a project&rsquo;s requirements so that those tendering can adequately price the project and the contracting authority can properly evaluate the prices returned in the tender.<\/p>  <p>  With the increase in activity in the construction sector in recent years, tender prices are recovering to a level that more realistically reflects current construction costs.  Indeed inflation in the sector is well ahead of that in the economy generally.  The challenge for Government in this context is to maintain a competitive tension in tenders to ensure that value for money is delivered for the taxpayer.  This challenge should not be underestimated given the increased investment in the sector both in terms of the NDP but also private investment.<\/p>  <p>  The measures that have already been introduced since 2016 to ensure contracting authorities have a better understanding of the price returned in a tender include:<\/p>  <p>  1. The standing of the bill of quantities was increased for the traditional contract type. This measure increases the focus of the design team in preparing more comprehensive design information that can be accurately measured for pricing purposes.  With a comprehensive price breakdown it is easier to establish where unsustainable rates may be applied.<\/p>  <p>  2. A mechanism to directly tender specialist works was also introduced so that these critical work elements are priced directly by the specialist market thus reducing the extent of the contract sum for which the main contractor has overall price responsibility.<\/p>  <p>  3. The greater use of the Most Economically Advantageous Tender (MEAT) was also a recommendation in the report and while this measure does go some way to addressing the issue of low pricing, where a public body is dealing with a strong field of competent contractors their scores for quality will not vary significantly unless a targeted approach is taken with respect to the quality criteria, otherwise price will end up being the determinant.<\/p>  <p>  These measures will be further enhanced by requirements for the adoption of Building Information Modelling once these are finalised by the Office of Government Procurement and implemented on a phased basis across the public capital programme.<\/p>  <p>  In order to avail of the long standing provisions that are set down in the EU procurement directives for dealing with abnormally low tenders it is vital that projects are adequately defined so that a proper analysis of the constituent elements of the project can be undertaken.  Ambiguity in the project requirements can easily result in a price that may adequately cover the tenderer's interpretation of the tender documents but that may not not necessarily align with the contracting authority's expectations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500063#WRA01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Pay","counter":24,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500063#WRA01750"},{"type":"question","counter":25,"qnumday":58,"qnumall":"[10640\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500063#WRA01800","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"his plans to review public service pay in view of the recently agreed deal with nurses; his further plans to open pay negotiations with trade unions and other social partners; if so, when; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1370","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":26,"qnumday":71,"qnumall":"[10638\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500063#WRA01900","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"his views on the likely gross and net cost of the recent pay agreement with nurses; his plans to examine and review likely pay implications for other public sector workers and the wider economy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":27,"qnumday":74,"qnumall":"[10483\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500063#WRA02000","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the estimated cost in 2019 and 2020 of resolving the nurses dispute; his plans to achieve pay equality in the health and education sectors in 2019 and 2020; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":28,"qnumday":165,"qnumall":"[9969\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500063#WRA02100","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"his plans to consult with public sector unions in respect of public pay negotiations; if the recent negotiations with nurses will have a knock-on implication for other employees in the Civil Service; if so, the likely implications; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1370","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":29,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 58, 71, 74 and 165 together.<\/p><p>The Labour Court decided to intervene in the nursing dispute due to the grave and extensive implications for our health services and patient safety.<\/p><p>In making its decision the Labour Court acknowledged that &quot;The Public Service employers made clear to the Court that any resolution of the within dispute must take place within the framework of the Public Service Stability Agreement (PSSA)&quot; and that &quot;the Trade Union has also made clear to the Court its acknowledgement that the resolution to the within dispute must be found within the framework of the PSSA&quot;.<\/p><p>As such the Court stressed that in making its recommendation it had only considered possible solutions &quot;in the context of the PSSA&quot;. <\/p><p>It is important to note that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions were involved in the negotiations at the Labour Court and supported the Agreement on this basis.

The cost of unitary payments for 2018 is in the region of &euro;260 million.<\/p>  <p>  Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) are partnerships between the public and private sectors for the purpose of delivering a project or service.  Some of the advantages associated with PPPs are that they allow the public sector to avail of private sector expertise and innovation and the private partner assumes responsibility for a considerable portion of the risk.  <\/p>  <p>  The contracts tend to be long-term arrangements, typically spanning 25 years or more, and can be Design-Build-Finance-Maintain (DBFM), Design-Build-Finance-Operate-Maintain (DBFOM) and Concession projects.  <\/p>  <p>  Design-Build-Finance-Maintain (DBFM): DBFM projects require the PPP Co to provide and maintain the asset\/infrastructure but not to operate it.  This is likely to be used to provide schools and similar infrastructure; in such cases the public sector will want use of the asset but will not require that the private partner provide the attendant service, i.e. in the case of a school, the public sector or the relevant patron would employ the teaching staff.<\/p>  <p>  Design-Build-Finance-Operate-Maintain (DBFOM): DBFOM PPPs effectively require the private sector to replace the public sector for the duration of the contract.  These PPPs require the private sector to both provide and operate the asset\/infrastructure.  In the case of a water treatment plant, for example, this would require the private sector to staff the plant to ensure service delivery on behalf of the public sector contractor.<\/p>  <p>  Concessions: Concessions differ from other PPPs in how they provide a financial return to the private sector.  Unlike other PPPs the private sector achieves its financial return by levying a user charge on the service.  In Ireland, concessions have been used to a large extent in the transport sector.<\/p>  <p>  The capital cost consists of all the costs (including VAT) associated with the construction or acquisition of the physical assets to the point of it becoming available for use.  The public sector provides annual unitary payments to the private sector for a contractually agreed period of time.  These unitary payments typically comprise one or more of the following elements &ndash; usage payments, availability payments and service performance payments.  <\/p>  <p>  Hence, unitary payments cover more than the construction cost of the asset.

Such awards are made on the recommendation of a Military Board appointed by the Chief of Staff for the purpose of examining and reporting on every recommendation for an award.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of the award of medals to the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, 35th Infantry Battalion was comprehensively addressed in 1965.  A properly constituted Medals Board considered the recommendation for the award of\u00a0medals and made a decision that no medals would be awarded.<\/p>  <p>  The Chief of Staff of the day\u00a0considered the\u00a0decision of the Board and was satisfied with the findings. Subsequently, at that time, the question was raised again in a letter to a newly appointed Chief of Staff.

The Board indicated that the issues raised had received due consideration and that they were not prepared to alter their findings.<\/p>  <p>  A review was conducted in 2004 by military officers for the purpose of a broader examination of the Jadotville case. This Board recommended that the events of Jadotville and the contribution of the 35th Battalion be given recognition.

The use of live fire and arbitrary detention cannot be justified.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland fully supports the 28 February 2019 statement by the EU High Representative expressing concern at the situation in Sudan.

The manner and practices around the detention and trial of Palestinian children in Israeli prisons and the Israeli military court system continue to be unacceptable. It is my view that Palestinians who are detained, especially children, should have the same protections and conditions that Israel affords its own citizens who are subject to detention. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland has recommended that Israel urgently end the admissibility of evidence in military courts of written confessions in Hebrew signed by Palestinian children, the use of solitary confinement and the denial of access to family members or to legal representation. <\/p>  <p>  As a contracting party, Israel is bound by the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). I am not satisfied that Israel is meeting its obligations under Articles 37 and 40 of the CRC and Articles 9 and 14 of the ICCPR. For example, Article 37 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child states that &ldquo;The arrest, detention or imprisonment of a child shall be in conformity with the law and shall be used only as a measure of last resort and for the shortest appropriate period of time.&rdquo;<\/p>  <p>  During my visits to Israel and Palestine, I have personally raised Ireland&rsquo;s concerns about the detention of minors directly with the Israeli authorities, including on the practices of night-time arrests and blindfolding. I have strongly urged the Israeli authorities to use detention only as a last resort, and for the shortest possible period of time, in the case of minors, as stipulated in the UN Convention. <\/p>  <p>  More generally, I am seriously concerned by the Israeli military court system which is used in relation to Palestinians in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including children. Palestinians do not enjoy the same legal protections as Israeli settlers in the same area. These military courts have a near-one hundred percent conviction rate, a statistic which raises serious questions about the system&rsquo;s compliance with international standards of due process. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland has repeatedly drawn attention to concerns regarding the treatment of Palestinian prisoners, and in particular, over recent years to issues related to the detention of minors. In the most recent UN Human Rights Council Universal Periodic Review of Israel in 2018, Ireland drew attention to concerns in this regard. Ireland also raised the issue of administrative detention and recommended that Israel ensure full respect for international human rights obligations, in particular those specified in article 9 of the ICCPR, towards all prisoners. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland has also raised these issues at EU level. In February 2019, the Foreign Affairs Council adopted Conclusions on EU Priorities in UN human rights fora, which reaffirmed the\u00a0EU&rsquo;s commitment to the full implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and its Protocols worldwide. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland also provides financial support to Israeli and Palestinian NGOs who are active in bringing the issues related to the detention of minors to light, and combatting abuses.<\/p>  <p>  My Department and I will continue to press on these issues in the relevant multilateral fora, and also, where appropriate, directly with Israel, both with the Israeli Embassy here and through our own Embassy in Tel Aviv.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500067#WRE01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Finance","counter":224,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500067#WRE01400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management Programme","counter":223,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500067#WRE01300"},{"type":"question","counter":224,"qnumday":132,"qnumall":"[10360\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500067#WRE01400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the steps he is taking to reduce the cost of flood insurance for areas which require flood relief works as prescribed by the Office of Public Works under the CFRAM scheme but which are not included in the first tranche of works; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1284","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":225,"content":"<p>I am conscious of the difficulties that the cost of flood insurance cover can cause to homeowners and businesses, and that is one of the reasons the Government has been prioritising investment in flood defences over the last number of years.<\/p>  <p>  However, you should be aware that the provision of insurance is a commercial matter for insurance companies, which has to be based on a proper assessment of the risks they are willing to accept. This assessment will in many cases include insurers own presumptions based on their private modelling and research. Consequently, neither the Government nor the Central Bank can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products or have the power to direct insurance companies to provide flood cover to specific individuals or businesses. This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from doing so.<\/p>  <p>  The above mentioned limitations means that addressing the cost and availability of flood insurance must be addressed from a different angle.\u00a0 In this regard the core strategy for addressing areas at potentially significant risk from flooding is the OPW Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (\"CFRAM\") Programme. The CFRAM Programme focussed on 300 Areas for Further Assessment (\"AFAs\") including 90 coastal areas, mainly in urban locations nationwide, identified as being at potentially significant risk of flooding. The proposed feasible measures, both structural and non-structural, identified for AFAs are outlined in Flood Risk Management Plans. The Plans set out the flood relief schemes that have already been constructed and those that are currently underway. The Plans also provide the outline of 118 proposed schemes that can protect a further 11,500 properties and the evidence to prioritise their delivery to where its benefit is greatest. OPW have informed my Department\u00a0 that they and Local Authorities will work closely together on\u00a0all of the projects to ensure that they are\u00a0 implemented in the lifetime of the Programme.\u00a0 The OPW has also advised\u00a0that they are working with Local Authorities to ensure these schemes are progressed within agreed timeframes.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Therefore, Government policy in relation to flooding is focused on the development of a sustainable, planned and risk-based approach to dealing with flooding problems. This in turn should lead to the increased availability of flood insurance. <\/p>  <p>  A key part of the overall strategy is ongoing communication between the OPW and the insurance industry, in order to reach a better understanding about the provision of flood cover in marginal areas. This is facilitated by a Memorandum of Understanding between the OPW and Insurance Ireland, which provides for the exchange of data in relation to completed flood defence schemes which should provide a basis for the increased provision of flood insurance in areas where works have been completed. In this regard, the Insurance Ireland\/OPW working group, which the Department of Finance attends, now meets on a quarterly basis to support the information flow and improve the understanding of issues between both parties.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, you should be aware that a consumer can make a complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman in relation to any dealings with a Financial Services or Insurance provider during which they feel they have been unfairly treated. In addition, individuals who are experiencing difficulty in obtaining flood insurance or believe that they are being treated unfairly may contact Insurance Ireland which operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to insurance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500067#WRE01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insurance Costs","counter":226,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500067#WRE01600"},{"type":"question","counter":227,"qnumday":133,"qnumall":"[10362\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500067#WRE01700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the recommendations of the cost of insurance working group will be implemented as a priority;

SEPA is the Single Euro Payments Area which enables payment transfers in euro between accounts in SEPA countries.

Tentative costings, based on\u00a0estimates of average childcare costs per pre-primary and primary school childcare place, were applied to Department of Employment Affairs and\u00a0Social Protection figures on the numbers of such children in receipt of Child Benefit. If a tax credit were provided in respect of even half of these children at the standard rate of 20%, it would involve a potential cost to the Exchequer\u00a0of between &euro;290 million and &euro;590 million per annum. The variation depends on the rate of take-up which is\u00a0difficult to estimate. It was assumed for the purposes of that costing that all paid childcare would be covered by the relief (i.e. not just centre-based care). <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500068#WRF00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Stamp Duty","counter":272,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500068#WRF00500"},{"type":"question","counter":273,"qnumday":148,"qnumall":"[10896\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500068#WRF00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the amount of stamp duty liable for a purchase of agricultural land to the value of &euro;150,000; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1354","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":274,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that, in the normal course of events, stamp duty is chargeable on the purchase of agricultural land at the rate of 6%.

Progress in each of these areas, but especially innovation, will better position Ireland to meet the challenges arising in the global environment to which the Deputy refers. <\/p>  <p>  Certain of the eighteen specific actions set out in Our Public Service 2020, such as accelerating digital delivery of services, driving efficiency and effectiveness and promoting a culture of innovation in the public service are particularly relevant in this regard. A Public Service Leadership Board comprising Secretary General and CEO level participants from across the civil and public service has been established to drive the new reform agenda and lead on its implementation. This approach will support and enable public servants and their organisations to perform at their best and to work together to deliver high-quality, value-for-money outcomes that will benefit the economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500069#WRG02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":346,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 175 and 176 answered with Question No. 169.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Capital Expenditure Programme","counter":347,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500069#WRG02600"},{"type":"question","counter":348,"qnumday":177,"qnumall":"[10948\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500069#WRG02700","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the extent to which his Department has received communication from other Departments, bodies and agencies under their aegis seeking expenditure on such issues as upgrade of motorways, new roadworks, investment in water and other items of infrastructural importance; if he expects to be in a position to respond favourably to such requests in the near future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":349,"content":"<p>The capital allocations made in\u00a0the Revised Estimates of Public Services\u00a0and the National Development Plan 2018-2027 were informed by the extensive evidence base collated and published on the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's website in 2017 as part of the mid-term review of the previous capital plan.\u00a0 This evidence base included a macroeconomic analysis, an assessment of progress to date on delivery of the 2015 Capital Plan, Departmental submissions, a public consultation process, an infrastructure capacity and demand analysis and an examination of the resourcing available for increased investment.

As part of the rollout of the new Framework for Junior Cycle, Geography was one of five new subject specifications that were introduced to schools in September 2018.<\/p>  <p>  The new Framework for Junior Cycle gives students the opportunity to develop a wider range of knowledge and skills &ndash; to equip them for further learning, for work, for responsible and active citizenship, and for healthy living.  It gives students better learning opportunities, and rewards and recognises non-academic performance and achievements, with a central focus on the student&rsquo;s quality of life, well-being and mental health. <\/p>  <p>  Prior to the introduction of the new Framework for Junior Cycle the status of Geography in junior cycle varied by school type.  Geography was only a core subject in voluntary secondary schools (52% of schools).<\/p>  <p>  The new Framework for Junior Cycle, currently being rolled out, focusses on active and collaborative learning.  It gives greater flexibility and autonomy to schools in terms of subject selection, and new short courses, to tailor a student&rsquo;s learning to achieve better outcomes for that student.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. <\/p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, almost 2,400 Garda recruits have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.<\/p><p>The Government has increased the budget for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to &euro;1.76 billion for 2019, which includes provision for the recruitment of up to 800 Garda&iacute; this year.  The Commissioner has now informed me that he plans to recruit a total of 600 trainee Garda&iacute; in 2019 and 600 Garda Civilian Staff.\u00a0 This Garda Staff recruitment will allow the Commissioner to redeploy a further 500 fully trained Garda&iacute; from administrative duties to frontline policing in 2019.<\/p><p>In so far as the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; is concerned, this is a matter for the Commissioner.\u00a0 I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources.  However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and class-room based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.\u00a0 To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.<b><\/b><\/p><p><b><\/b>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.\u00a0 We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to allow the deployment of increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division.<\/p><p>I believe that the injection of this large number of experienced officers into the field, along with the new recruits, will be really beneficial in terms of protecting communities.  This and on-going recruitment will provide the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; to deliver a visible effective and responsive policing service to communities across all Garda Divisions.  <b><\/b><\/p><p>The information requested by the Deputy as provided by the Garda Commissioner, is as set out in the attached table.

Assistance was also provided by a number of the youth projects and local Councillors in the area.

The project did not look at the generic services that people with dementia\u00a0and their families and carers may use, or the quality of the identified services. However, it offers a useful snapshot and baseline study into what, where and when services are being offered. The study has also been used to inform a service finder hosted on the National Dementia Office&rsquo;s website. This allows people to search for dementia-specific community services in their area.<\/p>  <p>  The report, entitled &lsquo;Dementia Specific Services in the Community: Mapping Public and Voluntary Services&rsquo;, found gaps in access to services and a large variance in what services are provided across the country. The National Dementia Office has met with senior HSE officials in each Community Healthcare Organisation region to highlight gaps in each area and to develop local action plans to improve service provision.<\/p>  <p>  The National Dementia Office has developed a needs analysis framework to support local dementia service planning and development. This framework is a mechanism to help the Office direct time, energy and resources into dementia care that most appropriately meets the needs of people with dementia. It will be used to make dementia service development more responsive and consistent across the country.<\/p>  <p>  The mapping exercise was conducted to complement the implementation of the National Dementia Strategy, which seeks to improve dementia care, deliver improved services and supports, and allow people with dementia to live well for as long as possible in their own homes and communities. While there continue to be gaps in the provision of services, the Strategy's implementation\u00a0has\u00a0improved supports and understanding of the challenges faced by people with dementia through the provision of dementia-specific intensive homecare packages, a programme that helps GPs and primary care teams diagnose and manage cases of dementia, and a nationwide public awareness campaign.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health also secured &euro;6.26 million through the 2016, 2017 and 2018 Dormant Accounts Fund Action Plans to develop a number of projects which are designed to expand public awareness of dementia and to improve care for people with dementia. Projects receiving funding include the delivery of post-diagnostic supports;\u00a0a dementia diagnostic service for people with intellectual disability; a national network of memory technology resource rooms; the development of a model for a national dementia registry; the national rollout of\u00a0a Dementia Training Programme for HSE homecare staff; the development of\u00a0Dementia Resource Centres; funding for a\u00a0dementia community activation coordinator;\u00a0an evaluation of services for people with early onset dementia; and\u00a0community support\u00a0projects\u00a0for people with dementia.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health and the HSE are committed to the full implementation of the National Dementia Strategy, and to\u00a0using available resources in the best way possible to support people with dementia, their carers and families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500074#WRM00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Provision","counter":629,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500074#WRM00800"},{"type":"question","counter":630,"qnumday":270,"qnumall":"[10317\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500074#WRM00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the case of an organisation (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1224","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":631,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500074#WRM01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HSE Legal Cases","counter":632,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500074#WRM01100"},{"type":"question","counter":633,"qnumday":271,"qnumall":"[10318\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500074#WRM01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the progress of the expert group established to consider alternative mechanisms to the court process for resolving clinical negligence claims; the position regarding the expected publication of the final report; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1313","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":634,"content":"<p>Government agreed in June this year to the establishment of an Expert Group to review the law of torts and the current systems for the management of clinical negligence claims.

Inequalities in health are reflected in the mortality and morbidity rates of the population.  Rates of chronic diseases are another indicator of health inequalities.  A social gradient is also apparent in mental health. <\/p>  <p>  The Department has undertaken significant measures across the health service to address the health needs of Travellers, including funding for the All Ireland Traveller Health Study.

The aim of the HTA is to establish the clinical and cost effectiveness of providing a PrEP programme in Ireland with a commitment to rolling out a PrEP programme in 2019. The current timeline available is that a final HTA will be sent for approval by the HIQA Board at its May meeting and that the Department of Health will shortly thereafter receive advice formally from HIQA.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE Health Protection Surveillance Centre advises that the weekly HIV notification reports for 2018 are provisional. I remain concerned about these provisional figures that show a rise in HIV infection.<\/p>  <p>  The HIV Annual Report for 2017 from the Centre was\u00a0published before Christmas. It\u00a0is the latest annual trend data for HIV in Ireland. The report referred to\u00a0492 new diagnoses of HIV in Ireland in 2017, a rate of 10.3 per 100,000 population, representing a slight (2%) decrease between 2016 and 2017. <\/p>  <p>  When those with a previous HIV diagnosis abroad were excluded, the number of new diagnoses decreased by 4% in 2017 compared to 2016.<\/p>  <p>  The HIV Annual Report for 2017\u00a0referred to 223,609 HIV tests carried out in 13 laboratories in Ireland, giving a testing rate of 47.0 per 1,000 population. This compares to 40.5 per 1,000 in 2016 with\u00a0data being\u00a0provided by an extra laboratory in 2017.<\/p>  <p>  HIV testing is available in Ireland through a variety of services, such as opt-out antenatal and sexual health services, emergency departments, NGO&rsquo;s, drug and homeless services and primary care. <\/p>  <p>  Over the past 2 years, community HIV testing is expanding, in order to reach those most at risk of HIV and identify those living with undiagnosed HIV. The KnowNow community HIV testing model has expanded since the pilot in 2016, and organisations in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway have been funded to provide community HIV testing to populations at higher risk for HIV, such as Men who have Sex with Men (MSM)\u00a0and migrants.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE Sexual Health and Crisis Pregnancy Programme have a multi-faceted communications approach in response to the rise in\u00a0HIV notifications.

For example, if a tree is located outside of a forest area and within an urban area (as defined by the Forestry Act 2014) then a tree felling licence is not required. Also, if the felling of a tree or trees is being carried out by a public authority in the course of their statutory functions, then a tree felling licence is not required.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  There are also exemptions from the requirement to obtain a tree felling licence in rural areas.

The institutions of the European Union are very well aware of the likelihood of a significant impact of a disorderly Brexit on Ireland&rsquo;s economy because this has been part of the discussion from the beginning, and indeed this is explicitly recognised in the Commission&rsquo;s own communication on contingency planning. <\/p>  <p>  Most recently, I held a bilateral meeting with Commissioner Hogan at the end of January to discuss the potential impact of a disorderly Brexit on the Irish agri-food and fisheries sectors. We discussed the unique exposure of these sectors to the threat of a disorderly Brexit, and the challenges that it could present. I stressed the need to be ready to deploy a range of measures to mitigate the potential impacts on farmers and processors, including through traditional market supports and exceptional aid under the CAP's Single Common Market Organisation regulation, as well as increased flexibility under State Aid regulations, which has already been the subject of discussions with the Commission. Commissioner Hogan reiterated the EU&rsquo;s readiness to respond and support Ireland, and we will remain in contact on these issues as the situation evolves. <\/p>  <p>  As regards state aid limits, my Department operates the State aid rules and regulations governing the agriculture sector, where the state aid limits under the agriculture de minimis regulation are currently set at &euro;15,000 per undertaking over a rolling three year period.  <\/p>  <p>  In 2017, the European Commission commenced a review of the agriculture de minimis regulation. This review took place following calls from Member States, including Ireland, for the Commission to consider increasing the agriculture de minimis threshold limits.<\/p>  <p>  As part of its review, the Commission launched an Inception Impact Assessment in 2017.  It highlighted the fact that European farmers had been experiencing market difficulties across the different agricultural product sectors for the previous 3 years, which led several Member States to use agriculture de minimis aid to help farmers overcome temporary liquidity gaps.  As a result, certain Member States were close to breaching their de minimis ceilings and requested an increase to those ceilings.  <\/p>  <p>  In 2018, the Commission consulted Member States and stakeholders to provide input by way of a Public Consultation on the revision of the de minimis rules. Those contributions were taken into account when the Commission was finalising the amendments to the Regulation.  Officials from my Department contributed to this Public Consultation and also attended meetings of the Commission&rsquo;s Advisory Committee on State Aid during 2018 where agreement on the new threshold limits was achieved.<\/p>  <p>   I have said that the State will not be found wanting when it comes to supporting the Irish agri-food sector and farmers to deal with the impact of Brexit.  The increase in the agriculture de minimis limits is a very important first step, and I very much welcome the recent announcement by the Commission that the threshold will increase from &euro;15,000 up to &euro;25,000 from 14 March 2019.  This will allow for greater flexibility and efficiency, notably in times of crisis and situations demanding a swift response by the public authorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500080#WRS02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agri-Environment Options Scheme Applications Data","counter":971,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500080#WRS02600"},{"type":"question","counter":972,"qnumday":397,"qnumall":"[10557\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500080#WRS02700","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the number of farmers that have completed the AEOS in 2018; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1283","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":973,"content":"<p>The number of farmers that completed their AEOS3 contracts in 2018 is 2,138.

I have requested a report on the options to be considered going forward in relation to the Bye Law.<\/p>  <p>  The Lakes in question have long been designated, as a matter of policy, for management primarily for the benefit of wild brown trout and that policy designation remains. I am advised by IFI that Stock Management Plans in respect of these lakes for 2019 have been approved by the Board of IFI. <\/p>  <p>  Salmon are afforded specific protection via established fisheries policy and annual conservation legislation. Ireland&rsquo;s protection of salmon is considered best in class internationally. Ireland closed its mixed stock fisheries at sea in 2007 to align fully with the EU Habitats Directive and the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation (NASCO) principles. Management is based on:<\/p>  <p>  - Annual scientific and management assessments of each distinct genetic salmon stock;<\/p>  <p>  - Ensuring harvest (by angling or commercial means) of salmon is only permitted from rivers with sustainable reproductive capacity;<\/p>  <p>  - Closing rivers to salmon which are below sustainable reproductive capacity;<\/p>  <p>  - Opening rivers to catch and release angling to ensure catch records contribute to annual assessments;<\/p>  <p>  - Licensing of salmon angling and commercial fishing and tagging of harvested salmon and recording\/reporting of catches (angling and commercial);<\/p>  <p>  - Annual legislation which defines the status of each river and what if any surplus is available;<\/p>  <p>  - Annual legislation to regulate salmon angling and separately to regulate commercial fisheries.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, Ireland is at the forefront within NASCO of ensuring that protection measures are in place by international agreement in distant feeding grounds to which salmon migrate. <\/p>  <p>  The salmon management regime also applies to sea-trout over 40cms in length and the potential to extend similar or other protections to other game species could be considered in the light of concerns as regards affording equal protection to such species.<\/p>  <p>  While management of salmon (and sea&ndash;trout over 40cms) involves multiple secondary legislation of national and local application, there is one Bye-law in relation to Pike which establishes a daily bag limit and one further Bye-law as regards coarse fish which was introduced principally to address biosecurity matters. Pike populations are managed by IFI under the long standing policy designation of certain waters. All management interventions must prudently take account of scientific assessments as is the case in salmon and sea-trout management. <\/p>  <p>  I am advised by Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) that the latest research, published in August 2018, reveals that pike appear to have changed their prey preference and now predominately eat roach. Researchers in Scotland and England have also found similar changes in pike diet. It is considered that the changes in diet are due to the invasion of roach in these waters.<\/p>  <p>  The research also found that pike and brown trout could live together within relatively large deep lakes with strong stream connectivity however in small, low-complex systems pike introductions could potentially impact on resident brown trout populations. The practice of pike removal and the impact it has on brown trout stocks was also examined. The findings suggest that pike removal may only be effective in protecting brown trout populations in systems where trout are the only available prey but may have little effect in systems where other prey, such as roach, is available.<\/p>  <p>  I am confident in IFI&rsquo;s capacity to deliver priority instream project works. IFI continues to deliver the more strategic, complex projects itself using, where necessary, appropriate external expertise. IFI takes on an enabling and supervisory role in less complex projects and this approach recognises the interest angling clubs have in habitat development. <\/p>  <p>  To that end, my Department has separately funded project officers for IFI to promote capacity building and a collaborative approach within the sector and to address shortfalls in expertise within voluntary organisations delivering projects. This addresses a key element of the National Strategy for Angling Development (NSAD) to build capability and improve governance across the sector and also addresses the issues and challenges raised by stakeholders at the NSAD roadshows held in 2017. <\/p>  <p>  The officers engage with these groups to progress projects through governance and into delivery phase. IFI has also established a pre-approved panel of experts that may be accessed by third parties who wish to engage in necessary habitat enhancement projects. <\/p>  <p>  During 2018 IFI and the Office of Public Works (OPW) signed an agreement to build on existing good practices and develop a framework to support high level collaboration. Both organisations have obligations to implement European and national legislation and policy. The agreement will deliver the Environmental River Enhancement Programme and focus on scientific investigations; impacts of arterial drainage maintenance on the biota and habitat with the river corridor; the potential for current strategies to provide environmental gain while securing adequate channel conveyance. All if this is to be undertaken in the context of the EU Water Framework Directive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500081#WRT02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prospecting Licences","counter":1025,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500081#WRT02200"},{"type":"question","counter":1026,"qnumday":416,"qnumall":"[10547\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500081#WRT02300","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the details of all town lands in which a prospecting licence for minerals exploration has been granted or renewed between 2011 and February 2019; and the details of all town lands in which a prospecting licence is to be granted or renewed.

I was\u00a0pleased to contribute to that Debate and also at the launch of the Committee's Report\u00a0on 14\u00a0November 2018. In addition, I\u00a0debated\u00a0with Members of the Joint Committee\u00a0and other Members of the Oireachtas,\u00a0on 07 February 2018 as part of the Committee's work in preparing its Report. On each of these occasions, I outlined my policy and provided updates\u00a0in relation to accessible public transport.<\/p><p>Accessibility features, such as wheelchair access, are built into all new public transport infrastructure projects and vehicles from the design stage. Looking to the future, investment in\u00a0public transport\u00a0will be accelerated under the national development plan, (NDP). In line with recommendations in the Committee's Report, and as with all new and recently developed\u00a0public transport\u00a0projects, all these new programmes and projects will be fully accessible as part of the normal design.\u00a0<\/p><p>As part of the Capital Plan Review announced in conjunction with Budget 2018, I secured an allocation of almost &euro;28 million for the Accessibility Retro-fit Programme for the four year period 2018 - 2021.\u00a0 This represented a trebling of the previous allocation. Of this amount &euro;7 million is allocated for 2019. The Accessibility Retro-fit programme funds an ongoing programme of accessibility improvements to older existing public transport infrastructure and facilities, and it is managed by the NTA. The increase in funding for the retro-fit programme will facilitate the continued roll-out of the programmes to install accessible bus stops, upgrade train stations to make them accessible to wheelchair users and provide grant support for the introduction of more wheelchair accessible vehicles into the taxi fleet.<\/p><p>Last year\u00a0I asked the NTA to provide information on (i) the accessibility status of existing public transport infrastructure, (ii) the cost of making public transport services wheelchair accessible and (iii) the accessibility improvements planned with the available funding for the 4 year 2018-2021 under the Retro-fit programme.  The information provided by the NTA, and other related information,\u00a0is available on my Department's website at . For the assistance of the Deputy, I have outlined in the table the cost figures provided by the NTA, of making public transport services wheelchair accessible.<table><tr><th>Bus Stations<\/th><th>Buses\/Coaches (PSO Services)<\/th><th>Bus Stops (PSO coach services)<\/th><th>Train Stations<\/th><th>Taxis\/Hackneys<\/th><th>Total<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Bus Stations<\/td><td>Buses\/Coaches (PSO    Services)<\/td><td>Bus Stops (PSO coach services)<\/td><td>Train Stations<\/td><td>Taxis\/Hackneys<\/td><td>Total<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;16.35 m<\/td><td>&euro;22.5 m<\/td><td>&euro;10 m<\/td><td>&euro;76 m<\/td><td>&euro;214 m<\/td><td>&euro;339 m<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>I would emphasise that the figures provided by the NTA are estimates, due for example to complexities in relation providing accessible bus stops in rural\/regional areas. In addition, the figures relate to Public Service Obligation (PSO) services only, and to Exchequer funding rather than industry costs in the case of Taxi\/Hackneys. <\/p><p>I also advised the House recently that one of my priorities is to complete a\u00a0review\u00a0of existing\u00a0public transport policy\u00a0as committed to under the Programme for a Partnership Government.

A significant proportion of this funding has been targeted at families who use community childcare services, thus assisting with the sustainability issues faced by some services. The Affordable Childcare Scheme will further increase investment in childcare and will reduce the top-up many parents have to pay for their childcare. This will have corresponding benefits especially for community providers. The Affordable Childcare Scheme is also expected to increase demand for services, thereby supporting community services to operate efficiently and at full capacity. <\/p>  <p>  \u00a0A core design feature of the Affordable Childcare Scheme is that &ldquo;money follows the child&rdquo;. Once a parent has been approved for a subsidy, they should be able to choose any registered childcare provider participating in the scheme, subject to availability, and the subsidy would then be paid directly to that provider. There could be concerns that this could reduce the sustainability of community services by increasing choice of provider. However, the underlying reasons for financial stability problems faced by some community providers does not rest with the nature of the funding model but with a wide range of other factors. Examples of these include the current inability of some parents to pay the level of fees asked of them, the broader range of family supports provided by some services in disadvantaged communities and the particular business models operated by certain services. By creating a clearer, more flexible and more user-friendly scheme, which explicitly links funding to parental income and to the costs of provision, it is intended that the Affordable Childcare Scheme will offer a vehicle for addressing some of these concerns.<\/p>  <p>  For services which are facing financial sustainability, my Department oversees an integrated Case Management system operated by Pobal. This Case Management service provides non-financial assistance or support in the first instance. Financial supports are also available for community services facing certain challenges which may also be accessed through Case Management following a financial assessment.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, my Department is currently undertaking a sustainability review which is examining the financial situation of a range of community childcare services in some of the most disadvantaged areas in Ireland. This review is also taking account of the future introduction of the Affordable Childcare Scheme. The review is expected to be completed in the second quarter of the year and will serve to inform any further sustainability measures or supports which may be required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500084#WRW04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child and Family Agency Services","counter":1219,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500084#WRW05000"},{"type":"question","counter":1220,"qnumday":486,"qnumall":"[10299\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500084#WRW05100","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"her views on a matter (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1318","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1221,"content":"<p>The Deputy\u00a0will be aware that it would be inappropriate for me to comment on individual cases. <\/p><p>I have referred the matter to Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, and asked for confirmation that the case is being dealt with appropriately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500084#WRW05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Children in Care","counter":1222,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500084#WRW05300"},{"type":"question","counter":1223,"qnumday":487,"qnumall":"[10348\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500084#WRW05400","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of children who have been removed from their parent or parents following the family falling into homelessness and in which the fact of the family&rsquo;s homelessness is the reason for the removal in each of the years 2011 to 2018; and her views on whether paying private companies up to &euro;58,000 per child to place homeless children in foster care is a better use of public money than assisting the family to find accommodation.","asker":"1259","askee":"1358"},{"type":"question","counter":1224,"qnumday":488,"qnumall":"[10349\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500084#WRW05500","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if a comparative analysis has been performed by Tusla of the rate at which children are removed from homeless families compared with the rate of removal from families that have not fallen into homelessness with a view to establishing whether the housing crisis is causing the break-up of otherwise functional families.","asker":"1259","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1225,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 487 and 488 together.<\/p>  <p>  Children who are homeless are entitled to have the same level of safeguarding as any other child.

There are currently 5,554 children in foster care in Ireland, of which 10% are placed with non-statutory foster care agencies. It should be noted that Tusla's local fostering committees are the approval body for all foster care placements, including those recruited by private foster care companies. Children placed with private foster care companies are allocated a Tusla social worker. <\/p>  <p>  Tusla utilises the services of private providers for different reasons. In some Tusla areas there may be a shortage of foster carers for demographic reasons, or there may be a need for specialist services to meet the needs of an individual child. These factors can result in the need to source foster placements from private fostering agencies. <\/p>  <p>  In my formal response to the Chair of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the publication of the report on foster care, I noted that Tusla is carrying out a procurement exercise to ensure that the private foster care services have been procured in accordance with procurement objectives, which incorporate value for money as well as service quality objectives.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In 2018 a procurement process was initiated to ensure that the commissioning of the service was in line with financial regulations and represented best value for money. The process, however, failed to deliver any providers. Tusla has initiated a new tendering process for private foster care overall, including provision of a link worker, supervision of staff etc.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  It is recognised by Tusla that best value will lie in the ability of the Agency to recruit foster carers in suitable locations with the appropriate capacity to care for the small number of children not currently fostered within the statutory provision. <\/p>  <p>  Recruitment of foster carers is an ongoing and prioritised activity within the Agency. This work is resourced by Tusla and includes funding fostering services in 17 Tusla areas, funding of recruitment material (such as leaflets, posters) and also media campaigns (radio, newspaper advertisements). In 2018, work was carried out to review this recruitment activity nationally, and to ensure that future recruitment is evidence informed about what works best in identifying potential foster carers. To further enhance this work, four additional posts are being funded, in addition to existing fostering resources, to support the recruitment of foster carers.\u00a0 A national working group has also been established to review all recruitment activity across the country, to ensure all efforts are being taken to recruit a diverse range of foster carers to meet the diverse range of needs for children requiring foster care.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500085#WRX01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Childcare Services","counter":1237,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500085#WRX01300"},{"type":"question","counter":1238,"qnumday":493,"qnumall":"[10356\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500085#WRX01400","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"her views on the crises facing community childcare services due to issues arising from recent Pobal compliance visits and audit issues; if her attention has been drawn to their concerns; if she will consider the proposals set out in the correspondence (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1222","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1239,"content":"<p>Assisting families to access high quality, affordable early learning and care and school age childcare is a priority for me as Minister and hence I take these matters very seriously. <\/p>  <p>  My Department funds a number of early learning and care and school age childcare programmes.\u00a0 Given the large amount of public money that is used in funding these programmes,\u00a0there needs to be an appropriate level of oversight and accountability.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs believes that our approach to compliance and\u00a0 supporting services \u00a0strikes a necessary and appropriate balance. Our approach involves setting out the rules for the receipt of State funding, supporting providers to deliver services, and at the same time, the approach offers assurances to the taxpayer that the funding assigned is being spent as it was intended.<\/p>  <p>  A high level of compliance with the rules of the various childcare schemes \u00a0is vital to maintaining existing investment as well as ensuring future investment.\u00a0It is\u00a0a requirement that services operating the early learning and care and school age childcare programmes funded by my Department must be compliant with the &lsquo;Rules for DCYA childcare funding programmes&rsquo; , the most recent of which was published on 9th   August 2018. Compliance with these Rules is overseen by Pobal on behalf of my Department. Because subsidies for the\u00a0early learning and care and school age childcare programmes are paid based on attendance (and not enrolment), this is\u00a0a vital governance component of\u00a0the funding for which my Department is responsible. <\/p>  <p>  I very much appreciate that community childcare settings, such as that referenced, provide a critical service to children and families across the country. I also appreciate their stated concerns regarding their sustainability. Hence, significant support is available to them to bring their service onto a more sustainable footing, whilst being necessarily compliant with scheme rules. <\/p>  <p>  My Department oversees an integrated Case Management system operated by Pobal through which a dedicated team assesses services facing challenges. This Case Management service provides non-financial assistance or support in the first instance. Financial supports are also available for services facing certain challenges which may also be accessed through Case Management following a financial assessment. <\/p>  <p>  \u00a0Results from Pobal compliance visits for the first part of the programme year 2018\/2019 show some issues in relation to non-compliance which needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency.\u00a0I am encouraged however that\u00a0most\u00a0services\u00a0have engaged constructively with the process so far.\u00a0I would recommend all other services to get in contact with Pobal or their local City \/ County Childcare Committee if they need support or\u00a0advice, or if they believe a sustainability issue arises.<\/p>  <p>  I should also emphasise that as an FRC, some activities may be eligible for funding from elsewhere, rather than from childcare programmes per se, for example after school work related to literacy and numeracy may be eligible for funding under the Schools Completion Programme.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The existing targeted childcare schemes will be replaced later this year with the Affordable Childcare Scheme. In the coming weeks my Department will begin to roll out a major national information campaign in relation to how this new scheme will operate. A significant amount of time will be invested in working with services to ensure that they are ready for it. The new scheme will not have a snapshot window. Its attendance rules will seek to reflect the reality of children and parents' lives and the need for services to operate as businesses. The attendance rules will reflect a certain degree of flexibility whilst honouring the requirement to ensure that Exchequer funding is used for the purposes it was intended. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that investment in childcare has increased by an unprecedented 117% over the last four budgets, now totalling\u00a0 &euro;575m per year. Community services access much of this growing investment. Turnover for many services has increased quite substantially (given that the number of servicers operating has increased only slightly) assisting services to review their business model to meet compliance requirements. The Affordable Childcare Scheme will mark another significant milestone for early learning and care and school age childcare in this country, creating an infrastructure from which Government can further increase investment in services over the next decade, This is in line with the commitment made in First 5, the Whole of Government Strategy for Babies , Young Children and their Families, I published last November. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500085#WRX01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Early Childhood Care and Education","counter":1240,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500085#WRX01600"},{"type":"question","counter":1241,"qnumday":494,"qnumall":"[10409\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500085#WRX01700","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the preschool options available to a family with a child that will be two years and seven months in September 2019, missing the ECCE first year by one month and that cannot afford to pay privately for the service; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1238","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1242,"content":"<p>From September 2018, all children meeting the minimum age requirement of 2 years and 8 months are eligible for a full two programme years on the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme.

The situation where there was more than one entry point created a perception of inequality to some parents when they considered the variance in the number of weeks of ECCE provision, dependant on their entry point.<\/p>  <p>  The minimum age was chosen based on national experience and a review of international practice. It also had regard to the regulatory environment for early learning and care in this country and issues such as child development readiness and adult-child ratios. The upper age limit for the ECCE programme remains the same (i.e. a child is not eligible if they will be 5 years and 6 months before the end of the programme year).<\/p>  <p>  It must be noted that age limits have been used to determine eligibility since the inception of the ECCE programme in 2010. <\/p>  <p>  Some children will not be able to commence their ECCE in September of the programme year as they will not have reached the age of 2 years and 8 months on or before 31st   August. However, they will be able to commence ECCE the following September and continue for a further year from September of the next programme year. Parents of children born around this time of the year may prefer for their children to start school at age 4 rather than 5 years and may therefore choose to avail of one year of ECCE only. However, it is important to note that this is a parental choice and that the overall policy change has ensured that two programme years are available to all children. <\/p>  <p>  My Department does its best to ensure, in so far as possible, the equitable treatment of all children and families who apply for childcare funding under the ECCE Programme.\u00a0 In order to ensure objectivity and fairness, it is essential that clear rules exist for the scheme and that they are applied evenly.

It is also designed to have a positive impact on gender equality in relation to labour market participation and employment opportunities.<\/p>  <p>  The Scheme will ultimately replace the existing targeted childcare schemes with a single, streamlined and user-friendly scheme, providing both universal and targeted childcare subsidies.\u00a0 To make the transition to the new scheme as smooth as possible, families can choose to make the switch to the new Scheme once it launches (targeted for October 2019) or can remain on their current childcare subsidy programme for one final year. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to income-based subsidies awarded under the Scheme, parents who are working, studying or who meet certain other conditions will qualify for an enhanced-hours subsidy (up to a maximum of 40 hours per week).\u00a0 The definitions of &lsquo;work&rsquo; and &lsquo;study&rsquo; will be set out in regulations made under the Childcare Support Act 2018 and will be comprehensive, covering differing types of work and study arrangements, such as part-time, week on\/ week off and zero hour contract arrangements.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Parents who do not qualify for an enhanced hours subsidy may still qualify for a standard-hours subsidy (up to a maximum of 15 hours per week).\u00a0 This approach reflects the evidence on the strong benefits of early childhood care and education for young children and, particularly, those from disadvantaged backgrounds but also, the evidence that these benefits are &ndash; in most cases &ndash; realised with part-time participation. The cap of 15 hours will provide for continuity between the Affordable Childcare Scheme and the ECCE scheme, whereby it will be possible for a child to commence subsidised sessional care before the age of 3 and to continue in such care without disruption or a change of hours as they transition into the ECCE scheme. <\/p>  <p>  Families with high levels of need, who require childcare for child welfare, child protection or family support reasons, may be referred for childcare support by a specified &ldquo;sponsor&rdquo; body. \u00a0Where such a referral is made, the family will automatically qualify for a subsidy for the number of hours considered appropriate by the sponsor without having to satisfy the scheme&rsquo;s eligibility, income or enhanced hours requirements. \u00a0There is no general minimum or maximum age limit for a child who is the subject of a referral by a sponsor.\u00a0 However, sponsor bodies will adhere to strict criteria for qualification for\u00a0referral as set out in Agreements made under section 14 of the Childcare Support Act 2018.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, my Department is currently undertaking a Sustainability Review of a range of community childcare providers in some of the most disadvantaged areas in Ireland.\u00a0 The impact of the standard hours subsidy limit of 15 hours is one of the items being considered as part of this review.\u00a0 The review is due to be completed in quarter 2 of this year and will inform any future policy developments in this area.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500085#WRX02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Early Childhood Care and Education","counter":1253,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500085#WRX03000"},{"type":"question","counter":1254,"qnumday":499,"qnumall":"[10709\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500085#WRX03100","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the reason Pobal is trying to recategorise childcare and early years settings as half day facilities due to the fact that children may be collected early; her views on whether this will have a detrimental effect on facilities in terms of funding and on children that will not be entitled to a meals if facilities are forced to become half day services; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1266","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1255,"content":"<p>Assisting families to access high quality, affordable early learning and care and school age childcare is a priority for me as Minister and hence I take these issues raised in your question very seriously. <\/p>  <p>  My Department funds a number of early learning and care and school age childcare programmes.\u00a0 Given the large amount of public money that is used in funding these programmes,\u00a0there needs to be an appropriate level of oversight and accountability.

The Department of Children and Youth Affairs believes that our approach to compliance and\u00a0 supporting services \u00a0strikes a necessary and appropriate balance. Our approach involves setting out the rules for the receipt of State funding, supporting providers to deliver services, and at the same time, the approach offers assurances to the taxpayer that the funding assigned is being spent as it was intended.<\/p>  <p>  A high level of compliance with the rules of the various childcare schemes \u00a0is vital to maintaining existing investment as well as ensuring future investment.\u00a0It is\u00a0a requirement that services operating the early learning and care and school age childcare programmes funded by my Department must be compliant with the &lsquo;Rules for DCYA childcare funding programmes&rsquo; , the most recent of which was published on 9th   August 2018. Compliance with these Rules is overseen by Pobal on behalf of my Department. Because subsidies for the\u00a0early learning and care and school age childcare programmes are paid based on attendance (not enrolment), this is\u00a0a vital governance component of\u00a0the funding for which my Department is responsible. <\/p>  <p>  I very much appreciate that community childcare settings, provide a valuable service to children and families across the country. I also appreciate their stated concerns regarding their sustainability. Hence, significant support is available to them to bring their service onto a more sustainable footing, whilst being necessarily compliant with scheme rules. <\/p>  <p>  My Department oversees an integrated Case Management system operated by Pobal through which a dedicated team assesses services facing challenges. This Case Management service provides non-financial assistance or support in the first instance. Financial supports are also available for services facing certain challenges which may also be accessed through Case Management following a financial assessment. <\/p>  <p>  Results from Pobal compliance visits for the first part of the programme year 2018\/2019 show some issues in relation to non-compliance which needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency.\u00a0I am encouraged however that\u00a0most\u00a0services\u00a0have engaged constructively with the process so far.\u00a0I would recommend all other services to get in contact with Pobal or their local City \/ County Childcare Committee if they need support or\u00a0advice, or if they believe a sustainability issue arises.<\/p>  <p>  The existing targeted childcare schemes will be replaced later this year with the Affordable Childcare Scheme. In the coming weeks my Department will begin to roll out a major national information campaign in relation to how this new scheme will operate. A significant amount of time will be invested in working with services to ensure that they are ready for it. The new scheme will not have a snapshot window. Its attendance rules will seek to reflect the reality of children and parents' lives and the need for services to operate as businesses. The attendance rules will reflect a certain degree of flexibility whilst honouring the requirement to ensure that Exchequer funding is used for the purposes it was intended. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that investment in childcare has increased by an unprecedented117% over the last four budgets, now totalling\u00a0 &euro;575m per year.

Such employees will be entitled to request to be placed in a band of hours that better reflects the hours they have worked over a 12 month reference period.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The Act provides that an employee may request in writing to be placed in the relevant band of hours.

If the Adjudication Officer finds in the employee's favour the redress will be that they are placed in the appropriate band of hours.  No other form of redress is available.  An appeal against an Adjudication Officer's decision will be to the Labour Court.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>The Banded Hours provision will not apply to an employer who has entered into a banded hours arrangement through an agreement by collective bargaining with their employees.  This is to recognise that in some sectors, the retail sector in particular, banded hours arrangements have been agreed between the employer and employees and have been working well.

Both of these schemes allow a person to work up to 3 days a week but they must be fully unemployed for 4 days in 7 consecutive days.  The 2019 Estimates for my Department provide for expenditure this year on the jobseeker&rsquo;s schemes of &euro;1.95 billion.<\/p>  <p>  Jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit (JB) is a contingency based social welfare payment typically for employees who have suffered a substantial loss of employment and have sufficient social insurance contributions to qualify.  The PRSI contribution classes that count towards qualifying for JB are PRSI Class A, H and P.  Individuals who are self-employed cannot typically access JB as PRSI Class S contributions do not qualify a person for JB.  The contribution conditionality for JB requires a jobseeker to have at least 104 weeks qualifying PRSI contributions paid since they first started work and 39 weeks qualifying PRSI contributions paid or credited in the relevant tax year or, 26 weeks qualifying PRSI paid in the relevant tax year and 26 weeks qualifying PRSI paid in the tax year immediately before the relevant tax year.\u00a0 The relevant tax year is the second last complete tax year before the year in which the JB claim is made.  So, for claims made in 2019, the relevant tax year is 2017. <\/p>  <p>  However, a self-employed person who has sufficient social insurance contributions as a PAYE employee could qualify for JB if they are engaged in self- employment for 3 days a week only, if they give up their self-employment or if their self-employment is considered to be subsidiary employment.\u00a0 To be considered as subsidiary employment the relevant employment should be in addition to the jobseeker&rsquo;s usual employment.\u00a0 Also, either the amount of earnings or profit from the occupation cannot exceed &euro;144 per week (&euro;7,500 over 12 months), or the jobseeker must have a minimum of 117 PRSI contributions, paid immediately preceding the date of the claim or in respect of the last 3 complete contribution years. \u00a0However, the individual must still satisfy all conditions of the JB scheme, including being available for and genuinely seeking full-time employment. <\/p>  <p>  If the jobseeker does not meet the qualifying contributions for JB they may be eligible for means tested JA or if engaged in farming they may qualify for means tested farm assist. <\/p>  <p>  The new scheme for the self-employed,\u00a0which I announced as part of the 2019 Budget measures, will extend a PRSI insurance based benefit to the self-employed who pay class S contributions and who lose employment.\u00a0 This measure\u00a0which will be\u00a0introduced later this year builds on other significant improvements for the self-employed in recent years such as access to invalidity pension and treatment benefits.\u00a0 This measure is part of the Government&rsquo;s stated aim of creating a supportive environment for entrepreneurship, including providing an income safety net to employees and the self-employed alike. <\/p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500088#WRAA04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pensions Data","counter":1450,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500088#WRAA04800"},{"type":"question","counter":1451,"qnumday":566,"qnumall":"[10795\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500088#WRAA04900","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the estimated value of unclaimed private pension funds in existence; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1452,"content":"<p>My Department does not collect data on the value of unclaimed private pension funds nor does it have any way of estimating the value of such funds. <\/p><p>Neither the Department nor the Pensions Authority have powers under legislation to require the disclosure of such information from pension providers.<\/p><p>I hope that this clarifies matters for the Deputy.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500088#WRAA05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pension Fund Data","counter":1453,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500088#WRAA05100"},{"type":"question","counter":1454,"qnumday":567,"qnumall":"[10796\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030500088#WRAA05200","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the estimated value of unclaimed life assurance funds in existence; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1455,"content":"<p>The issue raised by the Deputy is not relevant to my Department.

Agreements may be entered into for periods of between 10 to 25 years in duration; availability agreements under the CALF scheme can be up to 30 years in duration. There are no break clauses provided for in the lease and there are only limited circumstances in which the lease can be terminated by either party. These relate to the performance of the obligations set out in the lease clauses, e.g. a local authority can terminate a lease where the property is uninhabitable due to fire or flood damage; an owner can terminate a lease where the rent is not paid by the local authority.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>Under the long term leasing arrangement, the dwelling can be sold by the owner during the lease term, subject to the leasehold interest and the consent of the local authority or AHB.\u00a0As such, the owner of the property changes but the lease, and the tenant, are unaffected. There is no option to purchase the property under the long term lease or enhanced lease arrangements; however, an option to purchase may have been included in some long term leases by local authorities in the early stages of the leasing programme. It is a matter for each local authority if they wish to purchase the property at the end of the lease term, should it become available to buy.\u00a0<\/p><p>Local authorities may also enter into availability arrangements with private owners whereby an owner makes their property available to tenants of the local authority for a defined period. Under this type of arrangement, the owner of the property acts as the landlord to the tenant and performs all the landlord obligations. These agreements are for periods of between 1 to 10 years and termination of the agreement is governed by the provisions of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 (as amended).
