This matter relates to the proposed new facility for the National Maternity Hospital and the lack of progress in recent years on its governance and ownership.  I am asking for clarity regarding who will own the hospital or have influence and control over it.  There is a lack of clarity and transparency about that, a tactic used frequently by the religious organisation that owns the land on which the new facility is being built.  The National Maternity Hospital is being built by the State, so we will probably own the bricks.  The project will cost at least &euro;350 million and the facility will then be handed over to the Sisters of Charity order, which is a subsidiary of St. Vincent's Healthcare Group - a major shareholder in the project.  The assurances from the religious order that it is giving up ownership of its hospitals or removing itself from the boards, and that it will not dictate the parameters of healthcare  given two women in these hospitals, are not adequate.  It is our National Maternity Hospital, it is not the religious order's hospital.  We can go through the legacy of cruelty and torture by the religious orders, in collusion with this State, of women and children, and we will not take that any more.  We have an opportunity to provide what the Sl&aacute;intecare's report recommends, namely, universal healthcare without interference from private or vested interests or religious interests.<\/p><p>The ethos of the nuns disallows <i>in vitro<\/i>fertilisation, IVF, gender reassignment, abortion and other necessary procedures.  They took the Minister, who asked the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, to inquire into the death of a 34 year old patient from an ectopic pregnancy, to court and won.  HIQA is not allowed investigate that death.  Despite all the reassurances from the religious orders, women do not believe them.  We had the Uplift petition which yielded almost 120,000 signatures.  Dr. Peter Boylan, a former master of the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street, resigned saying he never thought this would happen again following the referendum.  The Master of the Coombe Hospital resigned in the same vein.  Fergus Finlay of Barnardos was aghast at what happened in this case.  Women need to believe that they will be cared for and not judged, like Savita Halappanavar, on the basis of the religious ethos in a hospital.  That needs to be gone from our healthcare system.  We have had enough of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018120500002#A00500","speaker":"1388"},{"type":"speech","time":1544005800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Devine.  I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Harris.<\/p> <p>I welcome the opportunity to address the House on this matter.  The National Maternity Hospital, NMH, was originally established at Holles Street in 1894.  The buildings have aged considerably over the years and, understandably, have accrued significant infrastructural problems which have impacted on the ability of the hospital to deliver clinical services.  It is clear that the current hospital needs to be redeveloped.<\/p> <p>The national maternity strategy reaffirms a commitment by Government to co-locate the remaining stand-alone maternity hospitals with adult acute services in order to provide mothers with access to a full range of medical and support services.  The availability of these services helps to ensure the delivery of an optimum, safe service, particularly for high risk mothers and babies.<\/p> <p>Against this background, the Government approved the NMH relocation project, which involves the development of a new maternity hospital on the campus of St Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital at Elm Park.  The new hospital will be funded by the State and is included in Project Ireland 2040.  This relocation project came to fruition following extensive mediation discussions led by Kieran Mulvey, which resulted in an agreement being reached between the St Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group and the NMH on the relocation of the facility to the Elm Park campus.  One of the guiding principles of the Mulvey agreement was the requirement for the protection of State investment and interests.  It is vitally important that the legal and governance arrangements associated with this very significant State investment are robust.<\/p> <p>Considerable work has been undertaken, therefore, to develop a legal framework to protect the State&rsquo;s significant investment.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Catherine Byrne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2186\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2186&amp;amp;pid=CatherineByrne&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This legal framework will underpin the operational and clinical independence of the new hospital, ensuring care in the new maternity hospital will be delivered without religious, ethnic or other distinction and any medical procedure which is in accordance with the laws of the land will be carried out there.

Government policy is therefore to co-locate all remaining maternity hospitals with adult acute services in order to provide optimal clinical outcomes.  In this context, it is proposed to relocate not only the National Maternity Hospital, but also University Maternity Hospital Limerick to University Hospital Limerick, Dooradoyle; the Rotunda Hospital to the Connolly Hospital campus in Blanchardstown; and the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital to St. James&rsquo;s Hospital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018120500002#A00600","speaker":"1307","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544005800,"counter":13,"content":"<p>Unfortunately that was not really an answer in respect of the governance and the concerns that have been expressed.

This legislation should have meant that same-sex parents could register as legal parents on the birth certificate of their child and that their families would be recognised and protected as such.  That is what people understood the national conversation around civil marriage equality to be about.  That is what we understood the knock-on effects would be.  I have been dealing with affected families for some time.  Many of us in these Houses would have received striking correspondence that painted a grim picture.  Over the last week and over the weekend Heather was in touch with me.  She says:<\/p><blockquote>[A]s the non-biological mother, one of the biggest emotions I feel right now is anxiety.  It is taking over what should be some of the happiest days of our lives.  This anxiety comes from knowing that despite being a mom to my baby, my name won&rsquo;t go on the birth certificate, and that I will have no legal rights to my own child, solely due to the fact that it is my wife who is the birth mother and not me.  Anxiety from being made a second class citizen, fighting to have our rights as parents recognised.  Anxiety (and a bit of humiliation) from having to email my employer&rsquo;s HR department and ask them to please ensure my parental benefits will be intact, even though legally I won&rsquo;t be a parent at all, despite being a mom.  Anxiety that comes lying awake at night from wondering what will happen to our child if something were to happen to my wife.<\/blockquote> <p>Since the Bill's passage in April 2015, the Government has stated deadlines for commencement six times.

The Minister, Deputy Harris, stated in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad that an amendment Bill would fix the errors.  He committed to a deadline of the end of October to commence all parts.  That has not happened and now further typographical errors have been identified by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  That is why I tabled this Commencement debate today.  We now have to go through another round of legislative process.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding that it has taken the Department three and a half years to realise that these errors were present, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection recently indicated that the errors will be fixed by an amendment to the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2017, a Bill that has languished on Committee Stage for more than a year.

The current position is that these sections need to be amended to correct technical errors and have yet to be commenced.

In this regard, the Children and Family Relationships (Amendment) Bill 2018 was enacted on 24 July 2018.  It was introduced to correct typographical and technical errors in the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015, which will facilitate the subsequent commencement of Parts 2 and 3 of the Act.  There are important administrative and operational arrangements to be put in place to facilitate the implementation of Parts 2 and 3, including the establishment of the national donor-conceived person register and the appointment of authorised persons under the Act.

In the circumstances of the anticipated early conclusion of that legislation, it is not considered necessary to introduce a stand-alone Bill.

It is important that we support people, not least those who are vulnerable, to remain in their homes, and any supports that feed in to securing and allowing people to stay in their homes and live there are vital.  The seniors alert scheme, also known as the personal emergency response scheme, offers fast and easy ways for both elderly and vulnerable people to access important health services and provides support during an emergency for those who live alone.

I take this opportunity to thank them because they found it difficult that there were so many changes while we were expected to be a functioning Department, which we were.  A fantastic Department is now up and running, and I thank the Senator for his comments and the staff for the great work they have done in difficult circumstances over the past 15 or 16 months.

The objective of the seniors alert scheme is to encourage community support for vulnerable older people in our communities through the provision of personal monitored alarms to enable persons over the age of 65 of limited means to continue to live securely in their homes with confidence, independence and peace of mind.<\/p> <p>A significant change in the new version of the scheme is that users no longer have to live alone or with another qualifying person to qualify for the scheme.  The criteria were widened to include elderly people who are not living on their own but may be alone for a substantial part of the day and elderly people who are primary carers for other people in their household.  The issue of isolation, whether in urban or rural areas, should concern us all and I am committed to continuing my Department&rsquo;s response to the issue through programmes such as the seniors alert scheme.  <\/p> <p>Funding is available under the scheme for the purchase of equipment, such as a personal alarm or a pendant, by a registered community or voluntary or not-for-profit organisation.  All users have a base unit installed in their home which is connected to a national seniors alert scheme helpline using landline or mobile telecommunications.  When the user activates the personalised alarm, it puts a call through to the national call centre, which is open 24-7, 365 days a year.  The call centre operator talks to the person in his at her home and decides whether to alert a local volunteer responder or, in potentially serious circumstances, the emergency services.  <\/p> <p>Funding for this scheme is made available by my Department.  The equipment is free for the end user although there is a small charge should the applicant require a SIM card for the mobile phone.  Under the new scheme, free monitoring is provided for the first year of use and recipients are required to pay a modest annual charge for the second and subsequent years.  At the end of 2017, just over 18,000 participants had been approved, while 601 community groups provided support.  By the end of the third quarter in 2018, in excess of 35,000 participants were approved with 660 community groups providing support.  This is strong evidence of the growth of this scheme, providing real support and peace of mind for elderly people in their communities. <\/p> <p>The seniors alert scheme is a demand-led programme.  My Department was allocated &euro;2.3 million in 2018 to administer the scheme.  As a result of the unprecedented increase in participants in the scheme, I was determined to secure additional funding from within the resources of the Department to ensure we continue to meet the surge in demand and that every single applicant was catered for.  The amount spent on the seniors alert scheme for 2018 stands at &euro;5.4 million, and I ensured we funded that money from our Department.

The report highlights a significant increase in the number of tenants being unfairly evicted and there has been an 18% rise in calls from renters who have been told their tenancies are coming to an end.  Some 32% of the calls to the charity last year were from tenants faced with losing their homes.  Last year, Threshold received 73,526 calls, a staggering figure.  It also outlined that in Dublin rents are up 10% this year, despite the rent pressure zone limit of 4%.  It is very clear that these rent pressure zones are not working.  At this launch Threshold called on the Government to admit that rent pressure zones are not working and to introduce a transparent rent register so that people can see rents from one tenancy to the next, what rent was being paid for the property they are going into and any increases being applied.<\/p> <p>The British Government has had to publish the full legal text it received on Brexit and we await that.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Gerry Horkan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2476\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2476&amp;amp;pid=GerryHorkan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Yesterday, a five-day debate on Brexit commenced at Westminster.  The British Prime Minister, Theresa May, told the House of Commons that another deal would not miraculously appear if this one does not go to plan.  Remainers have welcomed the opinion of the legal adviser to the European Court of Justice that the UK could abandon Article 50 unilaterally and does not need the agreement of the rest of the EU to do so.  The British can revoke Article 50 if they so choose and that is something that many of us hope they will consider.  We could then think of the past two years as a bad dream.  Either way, we must make sure that, from our perspective, Brexit is the least worst option.  We are all united on that for the sake of the peace process, the health of our economy and everything else.<\/p><p>I draw the attention of Members to the fact that the chairman of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, Mr. Seamus Coffey will address the Committee on Budgetary Oversight later today.  He has said that the forecasts for economic growth will move beyond potential for 2019 and that overheating will emerge in later years.  He is also warning that predicting the Irish economy's performance will be very difficult and that the long-term spending plans of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, \"lack credibility and look unrealistic\".  I call on the Deputy Leader to invite the Minister for Finance to the House to discuss and thoroughly examine the latest report from IFAC.  While I believe the Minister is doing a good job, it must be acknowledged that he has been lucky that interest rates have been so low in the context of repaying the national debt.  At the same time, somewhat miraculously, billions in corporation tax receipts have been appearing out of nowhere.  We will take in approximately &euro;9.4 billion in corporation tax this year, compared with only &euro;4 billion or &euro;5 billion five or six years ago.  While these additional funds are very welcome, they are unpredictable and I would like a debate on the long-term sustainability of our public finances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018120500002#G00500","speaker":"1412","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544005800,"counter":44,"content":"<p>I wish to raise two issues, the first of which relates to yesterday's charade in the House when we were dealing with statements on climate action and low-carbon development.

Increasing energy bills and higher prices for those on pay-as-you-go meters mean that many low income families will struggle to heat their homes.  Some will have to choose between feeding their families and heating their homes.  SSE Airtricity and Pinergy customers are facing 6% increases in energy costs over the coming months.

People now have to find enormous amounts of money to meet their energy bills, which is a matter of real concern.<\/p> <p>Sinn F&eacute;in believes this issue must be tackled head on and proposes a number of measures that can be taken immediately.  A cross-departmental report on the effectiveness of the fuel allowance scheme, taking account of increased energy costs, must be prepared.  The Government should also explore the option of introducing a cold weather payment, similar to the one in place in Northern Ireland in times of severe weather events.  There is also a need to provide additional resources to local authorities to enable them to increase the number and frequency of inspections of private rental properties.  Local authority houses should be setting the standard for the warmer home and conservation schemes.  We must see the continued roll-out of the energy efficiency retrofitting programme and the Government must ensure that phase 2 is made available to improve local authority housing across the State.  Sinn F&eacute;in also urges the Government to expand eligibility for the warmer homes scheme, which offers some energy retrofitting to certain low income households free of charge.  The qualifying criteria for that scheme must be relaxed.

They lined up in the seats beside the Public Gallery, ran up and spoke for five minutes and then shot out of the place.  There was supposed to be interaction and discussion on targets.  Ireland was supposed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 1 million tonnes last year but instead our emissions increased by 2 million tonnes.  It appears that we will breach our 2020 targets by 16 million tonnes.

The Government talks the talk but, in reality, it is comprised of climate change deniers.  They are not prepared to start to reduce our emissions, something I find disgraceful and despicable, and they ignore the legislation laid down in both Houses in 2015.<\/p><p>I would also like to raise an issue relating to Threshold's report which was launched earlier.  The Government talks about hitting supply targets and we have seen the press releases and the articles in the newspapers about what action it is going to take.  Unfortunately, these are not being followed up with legislation.  We have been promised a rent register and a reformed PRTB and we have been told constantly that this matter was going to Cabinet.  We were told earlier that proposals will go to Cabinet next week but this is not the first time.  It was announced that a land agency would have control over State lands and would make sure they were made available for housing but there has been no heads of a Bill or other legislation.  Measures have been promised to deal with short-term lets and a promise on this was made again earlier at the launch of the Threshold report.  We have been listening to this for more than a year and there was an announcement in September of action in the shape of legislation in both Houses by the end of the year, to be implemented by June 2019.  As of yet, nobody has seen heads of Bills or draft legislation nor has there been scrutiny at committee level.  There has been discussion about supply in our cities and we have been promised a height strategy for urban areas, but this is delaying planning applications being put in by developers who want to get on-site and are waiting to see what that strategy is.  The mantra is, \"Supply, Supply, Supply\", but four issues can be dealt with now.  We can move on later to deal with microbeads, single-use plastics and all the other issues the Government mentions in press releases but takes no action on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018120500002#H01900","speaker":"1417","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544005800,"counter":63,"content":"<p>I was at the launch of the Threshold report earlier and it was interesting.

I ask that we, as a Chamber, do a body of work on climate change.  There has been a seismic change in the public consciousness on this issue, particularly in the past six months to a year.  We are now at a stage where people want feedback from independent witnesses as to the precise impact.  To take a basic issue, that of dairying, we are encouraging farmers to increase the sizes of their herds while, at the same time, asking them to decrease their carbon footprint.  The question is how to do that in a sustainable way.  I would like to hear from expert witnesses.

The thing is that Britain will be seriously weakened for years to come in Europe, which is a pity.  I firmly believe there will be a second referendum, that Britain will stay in, and that will be it.  David Cameron, who is a complete nincompoop, should have said in the beginning that the Government took the people's advice, that it knew they were divided equally, and that the UK would stay in as the referendum was not legally binding, end of story.

In the past 48 hours, planning permission for a waste plastics factory in Skibbereen has been granted by the board.  The inspector's report opposed the project, but the board granted permission.  That seems to be the way in which An Bord Plean&aacute;la has been doing its business of late.  If one looks at other planning permissions regarding solar farms and an incinerator in Cork Harbour, one will see the same process.  The independent inspector goes through the project, examines it, probably holds an oral hearing, compiles a report and then makes a recommendation to the board, which is ignored before it grants permission.  It is an issue that needs to be examined.  A judicial review of decisions of An Bord Plean&aacute;la can be requested, but is an audit conducted of its decisions?  Is there an independent planning inspectorate that steps back and examines how the board deals with these issues?  There is an issue here, particularly in respect of environmental projects, which can involve jobs and employment on one side and environmental issues on the other.  The board seems to lean towards regarding the potential for jobs as more valuable than the environment.  We have seen that with an incinerator and with solar farms and now we are seeing it with the plastics factory in Skibbereen.  It is an issue at which we need to look.  I call for the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government to be brought to the House to discuss the planning affairs of the State to see what can be done to ensure that the decisions made are appropriate and, if not, to see what can be done to ensure applicants do not have to go through the expensive process of a judicial review.

They presented for 40 minutes on what life is like with SMA, the disease burden of SMA, and the perceived impact of treatment with Spinraza.  The patient group was happy with the committee, which comprised a good mix of independent experts, including treating consultants and experts on patients' concerns.  It was also evident, however, that the committee would not make a statement, as it needed to further consider proposed suitable treatment guidelines and access through a managed access programme.

This is quite shocking.  In March 2017, an oral hearing was conducted by the board.  From then until July 2018 it was asking questions of an environmental nature, citing concerns about alluvial woodland and freshwater pearl mussel, because this is a designated special area of conservation, SCA, never mind that there is a road there and a sizeable population.  We are not talking about a wilderness but an area where there is human activity.  That does not seem to be catered for.  More than &euro;4 million has been spent to date just to get to this point.  The planning process has not even concluded nor has a cent been paid to a farmer for land.  It is shocking that although the decision was to have been made on 30 November, it has been delayed once again.  This is the worst stretch of national primary road on the network.  Year after year, people have been trying to find a solution to overcome the environmental designation.  It is very frustrating.  There are serious questions to be asked.  There is either a significant problem within An Bord Plean&aacute;la or serious practical issues with the operation of the habitats and birds directives.  This is impeding much needed development of a road that is necessary for economic and social growth and all the good measures planned under Project Ireland 2040.  I ask for the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, to be invited to the House in order that we can get to the bottom of this.  The N26 Cloongullane bridge is not alone.  The west, including the western seaboard, where there is a significant volume of designated land, is being persecuted by this designation.

Yesterday I spoke about the desirability of this House sometimes expressing its views on these matters; we had a special committee on Brexit.  It has not been sufficiently emphasised in Ireland what a tragedy Brexit is for Ireland within the European Union.  Because the Government has naturally, as a matter of politeness, been driven to the position of accepting the outcome of the referendum in Britain and is saying it is a matter for the British people to proceed further, there has been a complete failure to emphasise in public discourse that Brexit is bad for Ireland.  It will be bad for North-South relations and east-west relations, and for Ireland's position in the EU.  I speak as a former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and former president of the European Union's council on justice and home affairs.  We will lose one of our great allies in the European political process.  People talk about ancient enmities between Ireland and Britain but it should be emphasised that in EU affairs, Britain and Ireland have been close as allies on so many issues.  Each has been generous towards the other's position on many issues.  We are losing a significant friend and ally at the Council table in Europe.<\/p> <p>Some may empathise with the dilemma in which Mrs. May now finds herself.  Our optimal outcome is that the Brexit decision be reversed.  If Mr. Dominic Grieve, MP, a sensible conservative, has managed to prize open the brickwork to enable a reconsideration of that issue, our Government should be on his side asking that the British people be given the opportunity to reconsider their position.  It has been stated that there is something undemocratic in asking the British people to reconsider their decision.  However, on the night of the Brexit referendum, the head of the Brexit movement, Mr. Nigel Farage, thinking he had lost the vote, said it was only the beginning and that he would not accept the outcome.  He said he would be back again and again to argue the point.  There is nothing undemocratic about allowing the people to change their minds.  Parliament can change its mind; why can the people not?  We should be unequivocal from now on in supporting those in Britain who want to reconsider the issue.

Some 25 years ago, Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il had church gate collections, which was wrong.  Charities need to consider a different way of targeting the public.  Standing outside a church gate or a supermarket is just hitting the same people at the same time.  Cashless donations should be considered because there is a generation Z now that needs to be addressed as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018120500002#L00500","speaker":"1424"},{"type":"speech","time":1544005800,"counter":113,"content":"<p>I concur 100% with Senator McDowell.

Yesterday, Teagasc launched its review of the year gone by and an outlook for the year ahead.  It makes very depressing reading, particularly for farmers.  Costs continue to increase, including foodstuffs, fuel or fertilisers, while prices continue to decline across all sectors but for suckler and sheep farmers in particular.  We all know the benefit of the farming sector to the Irish economy.  Thankfully our exports are booming.  That is great news and long may it continue, but we should not forget that these exports are achieved on the back of the farming community.  For the vast majority, their incomes are between &euro;12,500 and &euro;17,500 per annum and that does not include their own time and labour.  <\/p><p>If we are serious about ensuring that our exports continue, we cannot allow the farming community to fall by the wayside because we are killing the goose that lays the golden egg.  It is high time that we ask the Minister to come to the House to facilitate a debate about the future of farming.  The reality is that were subsidies to be removed, many farmers could not survive at all.  If we are to continue to see exports boom, something must be done to protect our farming community.  I ask that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine come to the House as soon as is practical in order that we can have a discussion on the future of farming.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018120500002#L00600","speaker":"1396","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544005800,"counter":115,"content":"<p>I congratulate Senator Feighan.

Dublin City Council gave permission for the demolition in 2009 and that permission was extended in 2014 even though, in the meantime, the buildings came within designation of an architectural protection area.  It is believed that No. 62 was built in the 17th century and No. 61 was built in 1687.  Both were purpose-built inns, one called the Blue Boar, the other the Golden Last.

Writing to <i>The Irish Times<\/i>Peter Keenahan noted that &quot;The development of an office block to be known as 'Sixtyone Thomas Street', trumpeted in the Commercial Property pages of this newspaper, drives a stake through the heart of the designated Architectural Conservation Area.&quot;<\/p><p>Colleagues will be aware that Dublin City Council has committed many heinous crimes against heritage over the years, the two most infamous being the concreting over of the Wood Quay site in the late 1970s, hiding Christchurch Cathedral from the quays in the process, and the terrible decision in the 1960s to demolish a large stretch of Georgian Dublin along Fitzwilliam Street.  That is a cause close to the heart of our colleague, Senator Norris, and work is being done to partially undo that damage.<\/p><p>Some of us wonder about Dublin City Council's priorities, currently being run by Sinn F&eacute;in, with support from the Labour Party and the hard left.  The council has bent over backwards to save buildings on Moore Street from demolition.  That is fair enough, but why are no councillors stepping up to save the buildings to which I refer which are over 250 years older and are of genuine historical and architectural merit?  I understand that while it is late in the day, the Minister has power to intervene in such matters.  I ask that this matter be raised with her and call on all parties here who are represented in Dublin City Council to intervene in this matter. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018120500002#M00400","speaker":"1401"},{"type":"speech","time":1544005800,"counter":118,"content":"<p>I call Senator Edward \"Bathtub\" O'Sullivan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018120500002#M00500","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1544005800,"counter":119,"content":"<p>That is an improvement on seagulls.<\/p> <p>I have no wish to lock horns with Senator Mullen, especially as we will have adequate opportunity to do that in coming days.

Local elections will be coming up next May.  This is a great exercise in democracy at local level, community involvement and so on.  I commend anyone from any party or persuasion, independent or otherwise, who puts forward his or her name to stand for the local council.<\/p> <p>My concern, and there is considerable anecdotal evidence that I am correct, is that there will be much fewer candidates in 2019 than was the case five years ago.  I have chaired party conventions and have spoken to members of other parties who did the same and a startling number of conventions are uncontested.  Some have had fewer candidates than there are places to fill.  I fought several council elections in my time, seven in all, and had to fight for my nomination each time although I was probably regarded as a good candidate.<\/p> <p>There is a reason for this.  First, there is the lack of an adequate recompense regime for local councillors because it is now a full-time job.  People are afraid to say that because of the media.  No more than Senator Craughwell, I am not afraid of the media.  I have been here for almost 12 years and my take-home pay is significantly less than when I was first elected.  The expense regime has also been reduced.  I am not complaining about myself but people at local level who want to give service to their community as councillors should be adequately recompensed.  <\/p> <p>The media thrive on headlines.  No doubt Senator Craughwell and possibly myself will get a good going over for this tomorrow.  I have seen some of the best politicians in this country highly blackguarded by the media for trivial, small things.

It provides an important service.  It cannot be said enough that where landlords intend to terminate a tenancy on the basis of intending to sell the property, they must do that in accordance with the law.  The sale must be within three months of the termination and the landlord must sign a statutory declaration to that effect.  If that is not being adhered to, we must find a way to ensure it is.  It is as simple as that.  Senator Humphreys has raised this matter many times and I feel his frustration.  I am told the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, will introduce the residential tenancies (amendment) Bill to Cabinet next week, but I can understand why the Senator might be sceptical because I feel like I have been told many times that it is happening.  Many of these issues will be addressed, however, and we might wish to have a discussion on that in January when the opportunity arises.<\/p><p>Three or four Senators raised the issue of Brexit and many of the points resonate, not least the points made by Senators McDowell's and Feighan about how the UK is our closest neighbour and has been a fantastic ally.  I do not agree that point has not been said enough because I have heard it said frequently in many debates and we all recognise it.  The Government has always wanted a good result for the UK but the best result for us and the UK would be another referendum, if people in the UK see sense.  There was so much misinformation communicated during the referendum that people should feel aggrieved about the national debate that took place.  It was hijacked by a few prominent Brexiteers who scurrilously pushed out fake news.  A deliberative democratic process, where there is proper discussion, is needed.  The people in the UK gained much insight into the matter over the course of the whole fiasco.  Senator Gallagher made the point that people can change their minds, but there seems to be some sort of feeling that people should never change their minds and that they should remain firmly fixed in a view.  That is not an intelligent way to approach life, however, and sometimes situations or circumstances change, as Senator Gallagher noted.  The democratic process should be allowed to take account of that and we all hope there will be another referendum in the UK.<\/p><p>Senator Horkan mentioned the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, and I do not see any reason why we would not have a debate on that in the new year.<\/p><p>Senator Boyhan raised the climate action discussion that took place yesterday.  We have spoken to the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, and he is available to appear before the House this evening from 7.30 p.m. until 9 p.m.  I suspect, however, that will not quite satisfy Senators and there will need to be a more meaningful discussion on climate change.  I have been promised we can have a lengthy debate on climate change in January with a proper question-and-answer session with the Minister.  If that pleases Senators, I will suggest it as a response.<\/p><p>Senator Boyhan also mentioned the electoral commission and deletions from the register.  That process happens most years but it should be raised as a Commencement matter if the Senator has major concerns in that area.<\/p><p>Senator Conway-Walsh raised the issue of autism.  We are all glad to see a proper strategy on autism for the first time and it would be good to have a debate on autism in the House.  She also raised the issue of fuel poverty, which is in particular focus at this time of the year.  It links with the climate change debate in many ways.  I was a proponent of carbon tax simply from an environmental point of view, but a carbon tax will have a seriously negative impact for people who already find it difficult to cope.  There needs to be an intricate conversation about the issue.  The Joint Committee on Climate Action sits regularly, and its plan it to produce a comprehensive report on particular actions the Government - not just the current Government but any Government - should take over a number of years.  As with other strategies that have been created for the health sector, there needs to be a long-term plan for action because it is too serious an issue for there not to be.  I am talking about climate change in response to the point about fuel poverty but fuel poverty is important-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018120500002#M01800","speaker":"1406","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544005800,"counter":133,"content":"<p>It is immediate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018120500002#N00200","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speech","time":1544005800,"counter":134,"content":"<p>Yes, it is an immediate issue that affects people.

I feel strongly about the fact that we have sprawled as a city and we should look to build in the city centre proper accommodation in which it is feasible to live in the long term.  It should not be a matter of just throwing up many two-bedroom apartments to accommodate people.  Families should be among those living in the city centre, and height strategy is intrinsically linked to that aim.

There are much easier ways to address the payment of these fees and broaden the potential for other stations to cash in, literally.  People do not necessarily watch many of these television programmes on their televisions nowadays but rather on hand-held devices.  An innovation could be that the fee could be collected through the Internet providers, but that is politically difficult because it could be seen as a broadband fee.

It may not be an appropriate time for a public consultation but it is certainly a good idea because the more we can do when it comes to climate change, the better.<\/p><p>Senator Norris also raised pay and conditions and Brexit, both of which I have covered.<\/p><p>Senator Lombard raised a particular issue in his area with regard to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  We need to be careful that the democracy that has always been a feature of our planning process remains.  The very idea that a plastics factory is opening somewhere in Ireland makes me see red.  I know plastic is still being used extensively throughout the world but we need to look to ban single-use plastic.  I do not know the type of plant this is but a discussion on An Bord Plean&aacute;la, with the Minister present, could be very useful to have in the new year.<\/p><p>Senator Swanick raised an issue I have taken an interest in.  There are people in Mayo who are affected by it who live near my parents.  The technical review is ongoing.  It is due on 11 December.  We would want families to have the decision soon because uncertainty is very stressful.  I hope the right decision will be made for them but a fundamental point is the need to examine the system whereby these drugs are procured.  I have not had much direct involvement in respect of many of these drugs that are purchased by the State but it seems to me that on many occasions the companies play the system for maximum gain.  That is what  pharmaceutical companies will do.  That is small comfort for families because they do not want to hear about money when they are talking about their child's muscular problems and their difficulty getting through the day when there is an existing drug.  It is very difficult for them if other countries provide that to patients and we do not.  My view is that we have to provide it but, apparently, the cost benefit is challenging.  I do not know anything about the current process but we could have a better system to deal with these drugs.  I agree with the Senator that a decision is needed and should be forthcoming on 11 December.<\/p><p>Senator Mulherin raised a particular issue but as the Cathaoirleach said, tabling a Commencement matter might be the best way to get a satisfactory and detailed answer.  One of the last points the Senator made was on the balance between wildlife and human beings.  The habitats and birds directives are very important, as is the environment, but a fair balance must be achieved in that respect.  I understand the habitats and birds directives are matters for the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Madigan,<b><\/b>but a debate on that issue would be useful.<\/p><p>I think I addressed the Brexit issue raised by Senator McDowell.  As he said, the UK is our closest neighbour.  The situation is very fractious and I suppose the less said by Irish politicians that could in any way make it more difficult for Mrs. May, the better.  I would hope it will play out in a way that we will see another referendum.<\/p><p>Senator Feighan backed up the comments on the UK being our closest neighbours.  The Senator has been very involved with the Brexit issue and I commend him on his work.<\/p><p>With regard to charities collecting online, one of the first issues I raised as a Senator was the chuggers who almost ambush people on the street.  I have an issue with those so it is great that one is able to contribute to charities online.  I often see a particular individual collecting after matches, in pubs and so on who is clearly not collecting for a particular charity.  When people have taken a few drinks they often throw money in a bucket without necessarily knowing where that money will end up.<\/p><p>I have already addressed the comments Senator Gallagher made on Brexit, which were insightful.  Prices for suckler cows is an issue the Senator knows more about than I do but if the Minister, Deputy Creed, agreed to come into the House in the new year, many Members would like to contribute in a debate on the future of farming.  Senator Kieran O'Donnell's suggestion of public consultation in this House is something we might choose to do in the medium term.  I refer to the area of farming, the way climate change interacts with farming, the pricing and all the other issues the Senator mentioned.<\/p><p>Senator Mullen has left the Chamber but the issue he raised is one I feel passionate about.  I am sick hearing comments about people who do not subscribe entirely to the teachings of the Catholic Church but who identify as Catholic all their life, like myself.  The Catholic Church has made itself an unwelcome place for anyone who does not subscribe fully to its teachings.  However, there are those of us who are just keen to do what we believe is the right thing in life for us.  That does not mean we are any less of a person.  We just want to do what we believe is right.<\/p><p>I do not want to go to a church to collect money, but it speaks to the wider issue.  I recall the incident Senator O'Sullivan raised, and it is just not on.  There are extreme individuals but as the Senator said, the fact that two thirds of the population voted means that a large percentage of Catholics voted that way.  It means also that we are a beautiful democratic people.  We look at the reality people are faced with in life and we make changes that will make their lives more safe.  It makes me very angry when I hear that type of comment.  It is as though we are lesser because our view does not fit with the Catholic Church, but the Catholic Church does not fit with many people nowadays.  It needs to look into its own heart in terms of how it would welcome people in and make those who are slightly alienated from its teachings feel like going to mass at Christmas time, for example.<\/p><p>Senator Mullen also raised the issue of the office block on Thomas Street.  It strikes me as an issue that may be suitable for a Commencement debate.<\/p><p>I agree with the Senator's comments about Georgian Dublin, in particular the area around Fitzwilliam Street.  What happened there was a travesty.  I will speak to the Minister about that particular issue.  I do not know much about it but it is certainly something that would be suitable for a Commencement debate.<\/p><p>As always, I support much of what Senator Ned O'Sullivan said on the issue he raised.<\/p><p>On the local elections, the Senator is right.  Even in this area of Dublin 2, very good Fine Gael councillors have decided not to run in the next local elections.  They are professional people.  Being a councillor is supposed to be a part-time job, but how does one define &quot;part-time&quot;?  It is an intense and very busy part-time job.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Catherine Noone:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2354\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2354&amp;amp;pid=CatherineNoone&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We need to look at whether we want it to continue as a part-time job or to make it a full-time job and pay people properly.

A report has been carried out and it makes for very interesting reading.  The report includes many of the arguments the Minister was making prior to its publication.  It states the value of the banks will drop.  While I accept that it might, the report also states that the estimate is &euro;420 million in reduced value across the three banks.  That number has fallen somewhat presumably as bank shares have dropped.  While I do not accept that we should necessarily be trying to sell the banks, I leave that aside for a moment to consider that the figure set out is equivalent to less than two and a half years of tax foregone at current levels of profitability.  It would make far more sense to collect the recurring tax returns than to hope for a future windfall which would only be used to reduce the debt rather than invest in the economy and infrastructure.  The report also singles out PTSB as suffering most under any change.  While that is interesting, it lets the cat out of the bag.  The Minister's defence of the tax break is not that it is fair but that the banks need it.  The huge tax break is part of the ongoing bailout we have spoken about before.  While the report refers to reduced competition, this is a double-edged sword.  Making these banks pay tax would level the playing field and allow new entrants to join the market, which is something that has failed to happen to any serious extent to date.  Under my proposal, the State would have collected &euro;175 million in tax this year from banks which have made over &euro;2.6 billion in the last year.  I am sure we will have passionate debates about measures to bring in far less.  This should be done.  Banks need to pay tax and this is a way to ensure they do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018120500002#Q00800","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speech","time":1544005800,"counter":197,"content":"<p>Before I start, I wish the Acting Chairman, Senator Feighan, and his good lady wife the very best of luck for the future following their nuptials of last weekend.  I thank Senator Conway-Walsh.  On Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il of the Finance Bill 2017, the Minister for Finance committed to providing to the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach a report on the possible consequences of changes to the treatment of corporate tax loss relief in respect of Irish banks.  The report was provided on 31 August 2018.  It discusses in some detail the implications of restricting the ability of banks to carry losses forward and of introducing a specific time limit or sunset clause on loss reliefs for banks or the corporate sector as a whole.  The report examines the possible effects of such restrictions on consumers, the valuation of the banks, the State's banking investment, capital levels in the banks, possible consequential regulatory impacts, state aid implications and the potential effects on competition in the banking sector in Ireland.  It sets out the potential negative effect that restricting bank losses could have on consumers due to the probability that the increased cost base of the banks would be passed on in the form of higher fees and interest rates on mortgages, business loans and personal loans and lower deposit interest rates.  It is critically important to understand that the State is getting value today from the tax losses involved through its share sales.  Despite the scale of the losses accumulated, Irish banks continue to pay Irish corporate tax as the relevant losses do not shelter the profits from all of their corporate entities in Ireland.  The banks are also contributing to the Exchequer through the financial institutions levy which generates revenue of &euro;150 million per year.<\/p> <p>As Senators know, loss relief is a standard feature of corporate tax regimes internationally.  Loss relief recognises the fact that business cycles run over longer periods than a single year and that it would be inequitable to tax profits in one year and not allow losses in the next.  There are differences in the way loss relief operates in differing jurisdictions.  While some countries impose a sunset clause or annual limit on the use of losses carried forward, many, like Ireland, do not.  Ireland has stricter limitations than many other jurisdictions on the sideways offsetting of losses carried forward against income and gains from other sources.  As a report of the type requested in the Senator's recommendation was provided to the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach three months ago, I cannot accept the proposal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018120500002#Q00900","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1544005800,"counter":198,"content":"<p>I cannot accept what the Minister of State says either.

The senior tax policy adviser in the then Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation said he did not think he was the type in that role to be clamping down on multinationals but he clearly saw this as dangerous and that was when the discussion was about 90%, not 100% which allows for a 0% tax rate.

At that point I said that any changes to relief granted under this provision could be changed by the Houses of the Oireachtas in response to the policy needs of the moment.  Similarly, much as I was trying to future proof the new tax reliefs being brought through in this Bill it represents the need to be able to look back and challenge the decisions of the past, be willing to review and adapt them, and operate with new knowledge.  That was the spirit of the last two recommendations put forward by Sinn F&eacute;in and that is why I will be supporting them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018120500002#T00200","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1544005800,"counter":205,"content":"<p>This matter was discussed extensively in the D&aacute;il and Seanad during last year's Finance Bill 2017.  As part of the reintroduction of the 80% cap for assets onshored on 11 October 2017 it has again been discussed extensively on Committee and Report Stages in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad in this year&rsquo;s Finance Bill.  It has been noted in those debates that, for the purposes of certainty, changes to tax law are generally made on a prospective basis such that they apply only from the date on which they have legal effect.  Therefore, the 80% cap introduced last year did not apply retrospectively &ndash; it applies to claims relating to capital expenditure incurred from budget night last year 11 October 2017.<\/p> <p>Capital allowances for intangible assets were introduced in the Finance Act 2009 to support the development of the knowledge economy and the provision of high-quality employment.  When the capital allowances were introduced, in order to ensure that a measure of tax remained in charge annually, an 80% cap was placed on the amount of relevant trading income that the allowances could be offset against in any year.  <\/p> <p>In the Finance Act 2014, the cap of 80% was increased to 100%, effective for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2015.  The rationale for increasing the cap was to bring the tax treatment of intangible assets into line with the tax treatment of similar assets in other jurisdictions and to make Ireland an attractive location for companies to develop intellectual property.  This was in recognition of the fact that investment and growth in OECD economies is increasingly driven by investment in intangible assets. <\/p> <p>Noting a significant increase in the use of the capital allowances in 2015, the Coffey review recommended that, to ensure some smoothing of corporation tax revenue over time, the 80% cap should be restored, and this recommendation was acted on in the Finance Act 2017.  It is important to note that the operation of the cap is simply a timing matter.  The measure has no effect on the overall quantum of capital allowances for intangible assets available to use against the relevant trading income.  Any amounts restricted in one accounting period as a result of a cap are available for carry forward and use in a subsequent accounting period, subject to the application of the cap in that period.  To present the cap as a long-term source of additional tax for the Exchequer would not be correct.  <\/p> <p>Furthermore, the allowances can be used only against qualifying trading income generated by those assets.  They cannot be offset against the company's income from other sources.  While I cannot accept this recommendation, I can assure the Senators that these allowances are kept under review by the Department of Finance on an ongoing basis, to ensure that they are delivering overall value for the economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018120500002#T00300","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1544005800,"counter":206,"content":"<p>I welcome the fact that they are under review but Sinn F&eacute;in estimates that we are losing out on &euro;750 million.

In essence, the change was designed to ensure that a company could no longer use an Irish label of incorporation without being tax resident here.  As the previous Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, clearly stated at the time, the double Irish was not part of the Irish tax offering.  It was just one example of the many international tax planning arrangements designed by tax and legal advisers to take advantage of mismatches between the tax rules in two or more countries.  In many cases these were designed to exploit gaps in US anti-avoidance rules.  Therefore, action was taken by Ireland in the Finance Act 2014 to amend our residency rules in the absence of US tax reform.<\/p> <p>Recent tax reforms see the US asserting its global taxing rights, and this should put an end to the type of arrangements some multinationals were previously able to use to avoid tax.  Those changes, combined with the widespread implementation of the BEPS recommendations, will have a major impact on the ability of multinationals to engage in aggressive tax planning.  We are already seeing evidence of US companies paying tax in the US in respect of historic profits as a result of US tax reforms.<\/p> <p>The amendment in the Finance Act 2014 was brought into effect for new companies incorporated after 1 January 2015.  To ensure that this change did not negatively impact on other related group companies which have real and substantive operations in Ireland, a transition period until end 2020 was provided to give these groups a reasonable timeframe to plan and reorganise their business model to take account of this change.  The ending of the double Irish has already been provided for in legislation and I consider the issue to be dealt with.  Furthermore, as I have stated, the continuing process of international tax reform is proving effective in ensuring that multinational companies are subject to tax on their global profits.  Therefore, I see no need to revisit the issue at this time, and I do not accept the Senator&rsquo;s recommendation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018120500002#V00600","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1544005800,"counter":217,"content":"<p>I will withdraw the recommendation and reserve the right to resubmit it on Report Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018120500002#V00700","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1544005800,"counter":218,"content":"<p>Recommendation, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1544005800,"counter":219,"content":"<p>Sections 29 to 31, inclusive, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1544005800,"counter":220,"content":"<p>SECTION 32<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1544005800,"counter":221,"content":"<p>Recommendation No. 9 has been ruled out of order as it has the potential to impose a charge on the people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018120500002#V01050","speaker":"1397"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1544005800,"counter":222,"content":"<p>Recommendation No. 9 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1544005800,"counter":223,"content":"<p>Section 32 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1544005800,"counter":224,"content":"<p>Sections 33 to 35, inclusive, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1544005800,"counter":225,"content":"<p>NEW SECTION<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1544005800,"counter":226,"content":"<p>I move recommendation No. 10:<\/p><blockquote>In page 125, between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following:<b>&ldquo;Report on independent bookmakers sector<\/b><br \/><br \/><b>36. <\/b>The Minister shall within three months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before the Oireachtas a report assessing the economic impact of the 2 per cent turnover tax on the independent bookmaker sector.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote> <p>We know there is currently a turnover tax of 1% applying to online and in-shop betting.  There is also a 15% tax on commission earned by betting intermediaries, which the Finance Bill is going to increase to 2%.  This is effectively a 100% increase.  The tax on commission is also to be increased to 25%.  We certainly recognise the need to tackle gambling addiction, which can be an absolute scourge on society.  The recommendation is directed at the turnover tax and its potential impact on individual, independent retail bookmakers.  I am sure the Minister of State has received representations on this as we all have, mainly from independent, smaller bookmakers.  Perhaps the Acting Chairman, Senator O'Reilly, has received them too.  The big betting companies with substantial online presence can absorb the increase but individual retail bookmakers, many of whom are in small towns and village, cannot.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Gerry Horkan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2476\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2476&amp;amp;pid=GerryHorkan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> I am asking the Government to consider a tax on the individual bet where the customer pays rather than to impose a tax on turnover.  A gross profit tax could also be explored.  These options would be a better way to protect independent bookmakers.  A great deal of analysis has been done by independent economists, including Professor Anthony Foley.  I cannot say whether it will happen, but it has been suggested that up to 400 retail bookmaking outlets will close on the basis of this tax and its effect on the marginal ability of smaller firms to absorb charges.  That threatens 3,168 direct and indirect jobs, or 2,400 direct jobs and 768 indirect jobs, respectively.  These jobs include those of shopfitters, computer services providers, printers and newsagents.  That would also remove 400 shop contributions to the gambling addiction services contribution scheme and to Horse Racing Ireland.  Income tax, PRSI and USC contributions would also be lost.  While I do not want towns to be filled with bookmakers' shops, they add a vibrancy to many small villages and towns.  There is a genuine concern that almost half of the 855 retail betting shops are suggested to be in trouble on the basis of the impact of an increase in tax from 1% to 2%.  What I am seeking here is that, within three months of the passing of the Act, the Minister should prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report assessing the economic impact of the increase.<\/p><p>One of the Minister of State's favourite phrases is \"unintended consequences\" and I certainly do not want a situation to develop where we simply move all betting online while people continue to behave as before.  There is an element of regulation in a shop environment which does not exist online and while I might prefer it if they were not all bookmakers, I do not want empty shops in towns either.

It is not a million years since betting duty of 10% was applied but it is crucial to note that this duty was imposed on the bet and borne by the punter.  I have seen the accounts of local bookies operating on slim profit margins and it is clear that doubling the turnover tax will hurt them immensely whereas Paddy Power and other larger chains will be able to absorb the cost.

We do not want to have a small number of very large bookmaker chains constituting the whole market and lose that independent presence in the smaller towns in particular.  There is a value here which is similar to the value of the on-trade versus the off-trade in alcohol.  A great deal more policing and supervision takes place in the on-trade than the off-trade.

While we all want to ensure that anyone who gambles does so responsibly, it is safer when it happens in a shop or retail environment than online.  I ask the Minister of State to take my concerns on board and reflect on whether there is a better way to secure more revenue which avoids the unintended consequences of large-scale shop closures and driving business online where it is subject to less supervision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018120500002#W00500","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speech","time":1544005800,"counter":232,"content":"<p>I welcome what the Minister of State has said.  We are all in agreement on the need to take more tax from the bookmaking sector.  We do not want a crude bludgeon but a fair system.  We are driving more and more people to online services and we need to review those to determine whether we can generate more income from the sector.  As most of us know, it is the small bookmakers nationally who are creating employment in small villages and towns.  While many of us are concerned about gambling addiction, there are also concerns about employment.  I encourage the Minister of State to permit an engagement between the Department and the bookmaking associations as soon as possible in the new year so that budget 2020 might reflect what is required to generate the same revenue in a less crude manner for the industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018120500002#W00600","speaker":"1438"},{"type":"speech","time":1544005800,"counter":233,"content":"<p>High-street bookmakers have approached Members in respect of the betting levy.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Kieran O'Donnell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2207\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2207&amp;amp;pid=KieranODonnell&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I very much welcome the fact that the Minister is committed to carrying out a review.

I have no difficulty with the bookmaking sector, and the gambling industry generally, contributing more taxes but this measure has the capacity to turn smaller shops into loss-making enterprises on account of the fact that the tax is not being applied to the consumer but to the shop itself.

In page 134, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following:<br \/><br \/><b>&ldquo;Report on impact of ending VAT rebate on VRT<\/b><br \/><br \/>42. The Minister shall within three months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before the Oireachtas a report assessing the economic impact of ending the VAT rebate on VRT in section 38 on the car rental sector.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote> <p>People who are not in the car rental sector may not be aware that the rebate was originally temporary.  It has been in place since 1993 and I do not know if the Minister had to read up on the legislation from 1993 when he addressed the issue.  There is an impact from the measure on the car rental sector, however, and most Members will have been alerted to it.  When it came in, it was a rebate for car rentals in the vehicle sector, and for training schools, with the VRT charge for new cars being given back by way of a VAT refund.<\/p><p>The car rental sector is seasonal in nature.  In the summer months, companies buy new cars but they sell them to dealers at the end of the summer, with the VRT refund mechanism helping that model.  As a result, the number of cars that could be made available to the tourist market was much greater.  The Finance Bill will end that refund.  This was done without any consultation and was not even mentioned on budget day or in the budget documents.  It may have been temporary in the beginning but 25 years is a long time for a temporary measure.  Senator O'Reilly will remember a temporary student centre in UCD, which was there for 40 years before a permanent one was built.  Temporary can mean different things to different people.<\/p><p>Abolishing the refund will bring in approximately &euro;20 million in additional revenue, depending on the no-behavioural change scenario, but it will mean negative changes for the tourism sector.  The constant car rental fleet will get older as companies will not want to buy the new cars because of the VRT.  More important, the cost of the seasonal fleet will increase substantially.  The cost to the tourist will be more than &euro;5 per day and up to &euro;23, depending on the car.  It will make the industry less competitive, particularly for North American tourists who may want to go to areas where they need a car.  These areas are probably the most vulnerable to a downturn in tourism.  The Wild Atlantic Way has been a great success but one could not travel along it on public transport.  A ten-day trip could cost &euro;230 extra, depending on the vehicle.  Companies could offer a smaller car model but overall it could damage tourism.<\/p><p>The industry has been in touch with me as I am sure it has been in touch with all Members.  We have had representations from both Dublin Airport and Shannon Airport.  The expertise these airports have in the tourism sector should not be ignored and Dublin Airport is a fantastic success, processing more than 31 million passengers this year.  I take on board what the Minister says about the measure contributing additional revenue but it may not do so if the sector contracts.  We might make more on car rental but if the tourists do not come because the product has become too expensive, we may be worse off overall.  Tourism is going well but the VAT rate will increase from 9% to 13.5%.  We need to be cognisant of the impact and this recommendation calls on the Minister to lay before the Houses an assessment of the economic impact of ending the rebate.  Tourism is the reason for most of the car rental sector in any event.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018120500002#X00800","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speech","time":1544005800,"counter":241,"content":"<p>I echo Senator Horkan's concerns.

If someone in the same activity as somebody else is put at a disadvantage in our tax system, it merits further examination and I ask the Minister of State to see what can be done as we go forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018120500002#X00900","speaker":"1425"},{"type":"speech","time":1544005800,"counter":242,"content":"<p>This recommendation seeks a report on the economic impact of section 38, which discontinues a provision in the 1992 Act whereby a partial repayment of vehicle registration tax is available to vehicle leasing businesses, hiring businesses or school of motoring businesses.
