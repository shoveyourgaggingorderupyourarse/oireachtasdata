This will have significant and lasting implications particularly for Irish businesses trading with the UK, excluding Northern Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Of particular interest to the Deputy is a 2018 study entitled \"Strategic Implications for Ireland arising from changing EU-UK trading relations\" a comprehensive and independent expert study that my Department commissioned from Copenhagen Economics. The study examined the implications of Brexit for the Irish economy and trade, quantifying the impact of possible new barriers to trade which might emerge as a result of Brexit. <\/p>  <p>  The study also provided analysis of the likely impact of Brexit on key sectors of the Irish economy. Five sectors were identified that account for 90% of the impact and these are: Agri-food, Pharma-chemicals, Electrical Machinery, Wholesale &amp;amp; Retail, and Air Transport. The rise of non-tariff barriers due to regulatory divergence is the main factor driving the results as opposed to the imposition of the tariff regimes of the EU and the UK on their respective imports\/goods.<\/p>  <p>  This analysis was undertaken on the basis of no policy action being taken although this of course is not the case given the extensive Brexit mitigation actions put in place across Government and across all sectors of the economy in the past few years.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  All of the scenarios examined in the 2018 study produce a result that is less favourable than a non-Brexit scenario. The scenarios considered reflected four of the possible outcomes from the future relationship between the EU and the UK &ndash; an EEA scenario, a Free Trade Agreement (FTA), a Customs Union, or a worst-case, no trade deal, WTO scenario. <\/p>  <p>  The WTO scenario was found to have the most negative impact on the Irish economy gradually reducing GDP growth by 7% by 2030; an EEA scenario would be least damaging gradually reducing GDP growth by 2.8% by 2030. The study found that regardless of the scenario modelled, the Irish economy was still expected to record strong, positive growth out to 2030. Brexit would have a dampening impact, however, resulting in a lower growth rate than would otherwise have occurred. <\/p>  <p>  Following the adoption of the Withdrawal Agreement and the Revised Political Declaration (RPD) on the Future Relationship between the EU and the UK last year, my Department undertook further Brexit analysis with Copenhagen Economics. Under this latest study, two additional scenarios for a Free Trade Agreement were examined to take account of the provisions of the RPD published in January 2020. This latest study is also available on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.dbei.gov.ie.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Overall, the findings from this study suggest that a Brexit outcome based on the RPD is likely to reduce Irish GDP by between 3.2% and 3.9% by 2030 compared with a baseline where the UK remains a member of the EU. This compares to a negative impact of 7%\u00a0in the no deal (WTO basis)\u00a0modelled in the previous Copenhagen Economics study.<\/p>  <p>  In response to the various Brexit analysis and studies undertaken across Government I have, over the course of the last three budgets put in place through the enterprise agencies, an extensive suite of enterprise supports to assist businesses to meet the challenges presented by Brexit. They range from liquidity support through short-term and long-term loans, to restructuring aid for businesses in severe operating difficulties. The majority of enterprise supports are open to all businesses, including SMEs, and not just those that are clients of the enterprise agencies. \u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2021 allocated unprecedented resources to confronting the twin challenges of COVID-19 and Brexit, with &euro;340 million to be spent on Brexit-related measures. Government has also provided for a recovery fund to assist businesses in the aftermath of COVID-19 and Brexit. A full list is available on my Department&rsquo;s website www.dbei.gov.ie and on www.Gov.ie\/Brexit. <\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the overall negative impact on the economy, IDA Ireland has been working hard to capture any possible increase in investment in Ireland as a result of Brexit.

From 1 January 2021, many aspects of our relationship with our nearest neighbour will change fundamentally as we will no longer share EU membership. While the Government remains committed to protecting and strengthening the Ireland-UK relationship following the end of the transition period, I can advise the Deputy that the net impact of Brexit on the policy areas within my remit is anticipated to be strongly negative. <\/p><p>Regarding the economic impact, joint Department of Finance and ESRI analysis of the macroeconomic implications of Brexit, published in March 2019, broadly captures the range of possible future relationships between the EU and the UK.<b><\/b>The analysis finds that in the long-run (i.e. 10 years), compared to a no Brexit baseline, the level of GDP in Ireland would be around 2.6 per cent lower in a deal scenario and 5.0 per cent lower in a no-deal scenario. The principal negative impact arises from the trade shock, mitigated somewhat by a positive FDI shock resulting from a redirection to Ireland of investment from firms looking to relocate within the single market. While there is uncertainty around the ultimate trade and FDI impacts, the analysis suggests that in each scenario, any positive impact on FDI would be far outweighed by the negative impact on trade.<\/p><p>Regarding Ireland&rsquo;s international financial services sector, the nature, scale and complexity of the sector will change in a number of ways as a result of firms relocating from the UK as a result of Brexit and those looking to set up operations in the EU for the first time. The industry in Ireland has become broader and more diverse with more firms carrying out a greater range of regulated activities than at any time. The Government and the state agencies, such as the IDA, continue to work to fully capture any opportunities for inward investment that emerge. <\/p><p>However, it should be noted that the Central Bank of Ireland has had to work closely with financial services firms and market participants to ensure that they have contingency plans in place for the end of the transition period on 31 December in order to mitigate a range of risks that would otherwise arise. My Department has also included measures in the 2020 Brexit Omnibus Bill in order to minimise disruption to financial services.<\/p><p>Finally, there is also a firmly negative impact on customs procedures and the impact of these requirements on business processes and costs due to the UK leaving the Single Market and Customs Union from 1 January. Any business, regardless of size, that moves goods from, to or through the UK will need to complete a range of customs formalities, as well as Sanitary and Phytosanitary and other regulatory requirements. This will result in additional costs and administrative procedures associated with customs formalities for all businesses that trade with the UK. It is expected that the majority of businesses will engage a customs clearance agent to act on their behalf. This will increase pressure on this sector in terms of increased client numbers and increased customs declarations as each consignment will require an individual customs declaration.<\/p><p>The Government has been planning for Brexit since before the UK referendum to ensure that Irish citizens and businesses are as ready as possible for all possible scenarios.\u00a0 On 9 September, the Government published its Brexit Readiness Action Plan, which details the actions Government will take and the actions that citizens and businesses should take to prepare for the end of the transition period. Citizens and businesses should now finalise their readiness work for the end of the transition period. This work will continue in the weeks ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111800069#WRC01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disabled Drivers and Passengers Scheme","counter":76,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111800069#WRC01400"},{"type":"question","counter":77,"qnumday":54,"qnumall":"[37201\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111800069#WRC01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the position regarding upgrades to vehicles for persons already in receipt of a primary medical certificate; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1499","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":78,"content":"<p>The Disabled Driver and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Scheme provides for relief on VAT and VRT, based on how much the car has been adapted and whether the beneficiary is a driver or passenger, up\u00a0to a maximum of\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  - Disabled drivers: &euro;10,000<\/p>  <p>  - Disabled passengers: &euro;16,000<\/p>  <p>  - Specifically adapted vehicles for drivers with severe disabilities: &euro;16,000 (Specifically adapted vehicles are vehicles that need significant adaptations)<\/p>  <p>  - Extensively adapted vehicles for drivers and passengers: &euro;22,000 (Extensively adapted vehicles are vehicles that need adaptations that cost more than the open market selling price of the vehicle being adapted)<\/p>  <p>  The scheme also provides for \u00a0an exemption from motor tax and an annual fuel grant.

In such circumstances, PMC assessments were discontinued until a revised basis for such assessments could be established. The medical officers who are responsible for conducting PMC assessments need to have assurance that the decisions they make are based on clear criteria set out in legislation. While Regulation 3 of Statutory Instrument No. 353 of 1994 was not deemed to be invalid, nevertheless it was found to be inconsistent with the mandate provided in Section 92 of the Finance Act 1989.<\/p>  <p>  In order to allow for the PMC assessments to recommence I am bringing forward an amendment to the Finance Bill to provide for the existing medical criteria in primary legislation.

best interests are protected; and<\/p>  <p>  - regulated firms that are fully compliant with their obligations and are treating their customers, existing and new, in a fair and transparent way.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank has also advised me that it cannot comment on suspected breaches that are not pursued by way of enforcement.<\/p>  <p>  Within its enforcement powers, the Central Bank has a broad range of tools, which it carefully deploys in appropriate circumstances, including the imposition of sanctions but up to and including the revocation of authorisations and the refusal and prohibition of individuals. The Central Bank has taken a number of actions in these areas since 2016 in furtherance of its consumer protection mandate.\u00a0Regarding case selection, the Central Bank carefully considers which cases will best achieve the Central Bank&rsquo;s strategic objectives, and through strong enforcement outcomes motivate compliant behaviour and promote a culture of fairness and high standards within the financial services industry. To this end, the Central Bank maintains effective processes for the selection of referrals to enforcement. As well as evidential matters, factors such as the seriousness or significance of the suspected contraventions and the harm or risk of harm to consumers are among the considerations relevant to the appropriateness of the use of enforcement tools.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The objective is to ensure that the Central Bank is strategically deploying its enforcement tools and efficiently using its resources to achieve effective and strong enforcement outcomes. The two largest monetary sanctions imposed to date by the Central Bank &ndash; Permanent TSB plc sanctioned &euro;21million in 2019 and KBC Bank Ireland plc sanctioned &euro;18.3million in 2020 - evidence the Central Bank&rsquo;s commitment to taking strong enforcement action with real deterrence value where serious and significant breaches of consumer protection requirements are committed.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank, as a systemic regulator, holds regulated firms and the people who run them accountable where there are serious or significant breaches of regulatory requirements and standards.<\/p>  <p>  Since 2006 the Central Bank has concluded 139 cases under the\u00a0Administrative Sanctions Procedure\u00a0 (ASP) framework with fines imposed of &euro;123.98m. Of the 139 outcomes, 22 were imposed against individuals. The Central Bank has also taken action to revoke 28 firms&rsquo; authorisations on an involuntary basis. A further 13 firms were refused authorisation to undertake regulated activities.<\/p>  <p>  While\u00a0the Central Banks\u00a0enforcement work spans the entirety of\u00a0its mandate and is wider than the Consumer Protection Code alone, since 1 July 2016\u00a0it has delivered a number of significant outcomes which were integral to the Consumer Protection Code, including:<\/p>  <p>  - against Axa Insurance Limited, which related to the operation of the Minimum Competency Code and Consumer Protection Code;<\/p>  <p>  - against the New Ireland Assurance Company plc which related to the provision of incomplete information to consumers under the Consumer Protection Code;<\/p>  <p>  - against Springboard Mortgages Limited in respect of tracker mortgage failings under the Consumer Protection Codes;<\/p>  <p>  - against Permanent TSB plc in respect of tracker mortgage failings under the Consumer Protection Codes; and<\/p>  <p>  - against KBC Bank Ireland plc in respect of tracker mortgage failings under the Consumer Protection Codes.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the above, the Central Bank uses a wide range of other tools to\u00a0support its consumer protection work. It has settled 36 cases under the ASP\u00a0framework, prohibited\/suspended or refused 12 individuals under the Fitness and Probity regime and\u00a0revoked 12 firm authorisations.\u00a0It has also issued 168 Warning Notices against unauthorised providers. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Ultimately for all cases, whether they are specifically based on a breach of the Consumer Protection Code, or another sector of legislation, it is important to note that while a case may not have been settled under the Consumer Protection Codes, protecting consumers is at the centre of all of these enforcement outcomes. For example, since July 2016 the Central Bank has:<\/p>  <p>  - delivered outcomes concerning (4 by ASP, \u00a07 by revocation) retail intermediaries for failing to have adequate professional indemnity insurance (PII) in place. The Central Bank views PII as a key prudential and consumer protection safeguard and compliance with PII obligations is therefore fundamental to the Central Bank&rsquo;s mandate of protecting consumers.<\/p>  <p>  - delivered an outcome against an individual in the insurance sector who under-reserved loss claim reserve estimates which resulted in the firm&rsquo;s financial position being artificially enhanced. This led to a significant risk to policy holders and consumers in the event the insurance firm did not hold sufficient assets to meets its liabilities. It is imperative that individuals working in regulated financial services and particularly those in senior roles, fully understand the risks and consequences that their decisions, actions and behaviours may have for an organisation, its employees, its customers and the wider market.<\/p>  <p>  - issued 7 prohibition notices against individuals whose actions may have or had the potential to result in consumer harm. The Central Bank may issue a Prohibition Notice prohibiting an individual from performing a controlled function for a specified period or indefinitely, if we form the opinion that an individual is not of appropriate fitness and probity.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank intervenes, within the scope of its regulatory mandate (which extends beyond the Consumer Protection Code), to ensure the interests of consumers are protected by focusing on the issues, which pose the greatest potential or actual risk of consumer harm. Its targeted interventions are aimed at addressing widespread issues that affect many customers.<\/p>  <p>  A credible threat of enforcement underscores its powers to protect. It takes robust enforcement action aimed at promoting principled and ethical behaviour by and within regulated entities. Transparent and strong action where entities or individuals fall short of required standards helps to deter poor practices, achieve compliance and encourage the behaviour it expects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111800069#WRC03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":98,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111800069#WRC04000"},{"type":"question","counter":99,"qnumday":64,"qnumall":"[37371\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111800069#WRC04100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if tax-paying pensioners on pensions alone have no entitlement to either earned income credits despite the Revenue Commissioners classification of pensions as earned income; his views on whether this amount to discrimination against the earned income of tax paying pensioners; his plans to address the matter; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1599","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":100,"content":"<p>I would like to assure the Deputy that, in addition to the basic personal tax credit, pensioners are entitled to claim the Employee or PAYE Tax Credit in respect of their pension income because it is taxable under Schedule E.\u00a0 The maximum Employee Tax Credit available for 2020 is &euro;1,650.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Earned Income Tax Credit is available to an individual whose income in a tax year includes, or is made up of, qualifying earned income, which means earned income which does not qualify for relief under the Employee Tax Credit.

In this regard, it will remain at 66 years pending the report of the Pensions Commission and I will introduce legislation shortly to give effect to this.  <\/p><p>The Commission's Terms of Reference includes the examination of sustainability and eligibility issues with the State Pension and the Social Insurance Fund.  More broadly, it will also consider the issue of retirement ages in employment contracts and consider how the pension system can further accommodate carers, who are predominantly women.  <\/p><p>The membership of the Commission, approved by Government, reflects the need to have subject matter experts to deal with the complex social and public policy issues arising in pensions, as well as stakeholder representation which will keep the work of the Commission grounded.  This includes representation of workers, employers, civil society, academics and those with technical and policy expertise.  In this regard, the membership also includes those with involvement in organisations supporting older people.  <\/p><p>The Government was keen to ensure that the Commission had strong female membership in its membership, and five of the nine members of the Commission appointed directly by the Government are women.  It will be chaired by Ms. Josephine Feehily.  I am satisfied that the Commission, with its gender-balanced membership and extensive experience of social and public policy, will be keenly aware of the gender dimension of pensions policy and delivery and will bring this perspective to bear in its work.  <\/p><p>The Commission will also engage with a range of key stakeholders to ensure that it has a genuine understanding of not only the fiscal sustainability challenges involved, but also the associated social sustainability challenges of implementing potential policy reforms.  The exact mechanisms for this engagement will be shaped by the Chair and by Commission members.<\/p><p>It should be noted that while this Government is acutely conscious of the need to consider the sustainability of the State's finances, this is not the only consideration when thinking of the State pension age.  The State Pension is the bedrock of the pension system in Ireland.  It is extremely effective at ensuring that our pensioners do not experience poverty.  The Government is committed to ensuring that this remains the case. <\/p><p>In line with the Programme for Government, the Commission will report to Government by 30 June of next year and the Government will take action having regard to the recommendations of the Commission within 6 months.<\/p><p>Further details of the Commission's membership and terms of reference are available on the Departmental website at: <i> <\/i><\/p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111800072#WRF01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":241,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111800072#WRF02200"},{"type":"question","counter":242,"qnumday":116,"qnumall":"[37166\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111800072#WRF02300","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if consideration will be given to awarding the enterprise support grant to a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1619","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":243,"content":"<p>The COVID-19 Enterprise Support Grant is designed to assist self-employed people who had been in receipt of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment or a Jobseeker's Payment and who closed their claim to resume their self-employment since 18 May. <\/p>  <p>  This grant seeks to support micro self-employed enterprises, not currently eligible for similar grant funding through other departments.

This is because of a long-standing arrangement known as the Common Travel Area (CTA).  The CTA pre-dates Irish and UK membership of the EU and is not dependent on it.  Both the Government of Ireland and the Government of the United Kingdom are committed to maintaining the CTA in all circumstances and a Memorandum of Understanding to that effect was signed on the 8 May 2019.<\/p>  <p>As part of that commitment to the CTA, the Government also entered into a Convention on Social Security with the Government of the United Kingdom, signed on the 1st   February 2019. Under the terms of the agreement, Irish and British citizens living in either country will maintain the right to benefit from social insurance contributions made when working in either country and to access social insurance payments, such as state pension (contributory), in either country just as before.   The agreement passed through the Parliamentary ratification procedures in both jurisdictions during March 2019, and now stands ready to be given legal effect on the 31 December 2020. <\/p>  <p>  From January 2021, many aspects of our relationship with our nearest neighbour will change fundamentally as we will no longer share EU membership.  However, the Government remains committed to protecting and strengthening the Ireland-UK relationship following the end of the transition period.  Strong and vibrant connections are vital with our closest neighbour and trading partner.  Both Ireland and the UK remain co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement and are, as outlined, committed to the ongoing maintenance of the Common Travel Area and its associated rights and privileges. <\/p>  <p>  While we will work with our UK colleagues on strengthening this relationship, it is also clear that Brexit, in any form, will have significant impacts in Ireland.  The Department of Finance has projected over the medium-term the level of GDP would be around 2% &ndash; 3.25 % lower relative to a hypothetical status quo scenario, with most of the impact in the first year or so.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has been planning for Brexit since before the UK referendum to ensure that Irish citizens and businesses are as ready as possible for all possible scenarios.  On 9 September, the Government published its Brexit Readiness Action Plan, which details the actions Government will take and the actions citizens and businesses should take to prepare for the end of the transition period.  This work will continue in the weeks ahead.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111800072#WRF02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Personal Public Service Numbers","counter":248,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111800072#WRF02900"},{"type":"question","counter":249,"qnumday":119,"qnumall":"[37222\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111800072#WRF03000","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"when a person (details supplied) will receive a PPS number.","asker":"1514","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":250,"content":"<p>I can confirm that\u00a0the individual referred to by the Deputy\u00a0has been contacted\u00a0regarding his\u00a0application for a\u00a0Personal Public Service Number (PPSN)\u00a0by officials of my Department\u00a0so that they may proceed to progress his application.<\/p><p>Upon receipt\u00a0of outstanding information, this application will\u00a0be processed without delay. \u00a0<\/p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111800072#WRF03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Residency Permits","counter":251,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111800072#WRF03200"},{"type":"question","counter":252,"qnumday":120,"qnumall":"[37227\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111800072#WRF03300","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the information her Department has been given from the Department of Justice regarding the requests for up-to-date residence permit cards from migrants in view of the ongoing renewal backlog in Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service;

The HSE has procured 1.35 million doses of the Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine (QIV) for the forthcoming winter. This vaccine is being made available to all persons in an at-risk group and aged from 6 months up. In addition, the HSE has also purchased 600,000 doses of the Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV), which is delivered via nasal drops rather than by injection and is being made available to all children aged from 2 to 12 years old inclusive.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Deliveries of this vaccine from the manufacturer were not as quick as we would have liked, due to the very challenging international market for flu vaccines.\u00a0 It is also true that demand for vaccination this year is unprecedented.\u00a0 This is the case across Europe and beyond, and in this context it is unlikely that additional supply will become available.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  While I cannot comment on individual providers, I can confirm that 1.3 million of the 1.35 million doses of flu vaccine available this winter have been distributed to GPs, pharmacists and other vaccination sites since early October.\u00a0 Distribution of the remaining 50,000 doses will commence before the end of this month.\u00a0 In addition, 420,000 doses of the LAIV for administration to children aged from 2 to 12 have been distributed. <\/p>  <p>  Demand for vaccination remains strong at this point and may exceed available supply. It is likely that the full amount procured, 1.35 million doses, will be distributed and administered. As a consequence, from the fourth round of deliveries which started on 23 October, GPs and pharmacists have been asked that of remaining patients in at-risk groups, priority should be given to the over-65s and healthcare workers with direct patient contact, in line with WHO advice. <\/p>  <p>  The significant increase in uptake among those in the at-risk groups, combined with the addition of vaccination for children aged from 2 to 12, will help reduce the impact of influenza on the community and the health system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111800075#WRK00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":380,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111800075#WRK00500"},{"type":"question","counter":381,"qnumday":191,"qnumall":"[37282\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111800075#WRK00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a facility (details supplied) will receive sufficient rain shelter;

The HSE Board is now in place and we must now bring forward detailed proposals on the six new regional health areas to deliver services for patients locally that are safe, high quality and fairly distributed.&rdquo;<\/p>  <p>  As agreed, when the new Regional Health Areas geographies were announced last summer, a business plan for the establishment of these health areas was expected to be brought to Government for its approval in 2020.

Work was underway in the Department of Health and the HSE to develop these detailed proposals, in consultation with stakeholders. Understandably, this work was paused as a result of COVID-19.
