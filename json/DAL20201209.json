I am doing so on my own behalf and on behalf of my very good colleagues in the Regional Independent Group.<\/p><p>As we have all lived through 2020, we can probably all appreciate that there is no more deserving, no more fitting and no more worthy topic of discussion than that of mental health resourcing in the State.  Mental health is a vast area that requires absolute focus and absolute commitment to solve the issues we have.<\/p><p>From the get-go, I thank Deputy Denis Naughten and our group parliamentary assistant, C&aacute;it Nic Amhlaoibh, who did a huge amount of research into this topic, and who also drafted the wording of the motion.  I also commend the Opposition and the Government who have provided a lot of support for the motion over the past week.  It is very heartening and encouraging to see that this is the case, and why would it not be the case, because mental health issues affect every party in the House, and indeed every house in the State?<\/p><p>I will raise three points with the Minister of State.  I will first focus on the situation in hospital emergency departments from a mental health perspective.  There is huge under-resourcing of infrastructure in emergency departments.  We need a dedicated pathway or channel, similar to the paediatric channel.  When a paediatric patient shows up at an emergency department, he or she is routed through a particular pathway.  We need the same model for patients who present in psychiatric distress or with a psychiatric illness, with a separate waiting room.  The current practice whereby acute psychotic patients are interacting with general medical patients is completely unacceptable and we really need to improve that set-up.<\/p><p>From a crisis team perspective it is not good enough to just have one clinical nurse specialist on a crisis team.  We need to resource this properly so the teams can deal with multiple presentations simultaneously, and so they are not completely stressed out themselves.<\/p><p>I am very happy with the commitment in the programme for Government to appoint a national director for mental health, with a direct line to the director general of the HSE, currently Mr. Paul Reid.  This is very important.  Perhaps in her reply, the Minister of State could clarify where we are with that process and indicate if there is a likely date for the appointment of a national director.<\/p><p>My second focus is on mental health resourcing in the community, and especially from the point of view of the NGO sector.  It is an issue nationwide.  I will use as an example an excellent NGO agency in my constituency in Newbridge called HOPE(D), which has approximately 1,000 service users on its books.  HOPE(D) gets no funding whatsoever from central government or through the HSE.  The service relies on the charity of Kildare County Council to provide 20% of its funding and the other 80% is made up through fundraising or donations.  I am sure we can all appreciate that relying on a GoFundMe page is not a sound basis on which to provide a very important service to the community.  In such a case the agency is always distracted from providing that service because staff are focused on trying to keep the lights on and the doors open.<\/p><p>The third issue I wish to focus on is an area in which the Minister of State has a particular interest.  It is assistance and the mental health of the elderly population.  From my own medical practice, I am aware there has been a shift over the past 12 months in the demographics of people who present with mental illness.  The shift is towards the elderly population and people who have had no history of mental illness in the past but who are now presenting.  This is as a result of cocooning, isolation, bereavement and just loneliness.  Again, I am very happy to see a commitment in the programme for Government that there will be a commission for care of the older person.  Will the Minister of State, in her response, indicate the status of that process?  When are we likely to see that commission in place?  This would be hugely appreciated.<\/p><p>In summary, I believe that everyone in the Chamber can appreciate how precious and fragile our mental health is.  It is incumbent on us all to ensure there is adequate resourcing nationwide, from a HSE perspective and from an NGO perspective, for the betterment of the public.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900003#A00200","speaker":"1587"},{"type":"speech","time":1607508000,"counter":7,"content":"<p>I wish the Minister of State well in her role in this very important sector within the health service.  I am delighted to see her in the role because I worked with her over the past four years in the previous Government and I know how dedicated she is to whatever she does.  I have great confidence that together we will make life and mental health services better in the State.  Her decision in government to support our motion is an indication of this all-of-government approach to an issue that is above politics.<\/p>  <p>  Certain issues come to mind.  Some people always call for more money and more resources.  At times, however, it might be a case of looking at where the gaps are and trying to find out why the gaps exist.  One of the issues I come across in my constituency is parents or families of young people trying to access the services.  They need to know where to go.  They seem to be completely in the dark as to how to initiate help for their child who may be showing signs of a mental health issue.  More than 2,000 people are waiting for a child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, appointment.  This needs to be addressed urgently.  This should not be like that and we must address it.<\/p> <p>With the situation during and post Covid, we now have to look at and plan not only for the economic stimulus and recovery but also the health stimulus that is needed to make sure that young people are not left behind or forgotten.<br\/><br\/>I have a great admiration for Pieta House, which has a centre in my town of Tuam.  The centre was purchased and developed by local people because they saw the need for it.  Local business people and others gave of their time and skills to make sure that the facility was put in place but earlier this year it was under serious threat of closure.  I would like to see organisations such as Pieta House, Jigsaw and Youth Work Ireland being put on a solid footing so that they do not have to hold their breath at the end of each year, not knowing what resources they will have for the following year.  We must put in place a five-year plan to ensure that they have enough resources to be able to plan into the future.  Those organisations get referrals from the HSE but the HSE might not back them up with financial support.  That is putting pressure on a service which relies on fundraising.  I would like the organisations not to have to be totally reliant on fundraising because we then end up with a service that operates on the basis of an <i>ad hoc<\/i>arrangement.  It is important that something be done in that regard.<br\/><br\/>The other matter I wish to raise relates to early intervention psychosis teams.  We have five teams nationally in this country, with none in Galway.  These teams are a vital cog in the overall service.  I urge the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Butler, to look at the issue, talk to the HSE and make sure these teams are in place, as otherwise we are battling without the full armoury of resources in place.<br\/><br\/>On the proposed mental health day hospital for Tuam, the tender for the project will go out to the contractors this week.  The enabling works are currently in hand and the facility is to be based at the old Grove Hospital site in Tuam.  I urge the Minister of State to ensure that the necessary funding is available within the capital plan.  The funding was in the previous plan and I hope she will make sure that it is still available.  The services were provided in Toghermore House and the new project is now being developed within the town centre.  The old Grove Hospital site is an existing HSE building.  It is important that this project is brought to fruition as quickly as possible.  It is important not only for Tuam but also for the region.  It would give the message that the mental health day services are active, alive and accessible to everybody who needs them and that people know where to go and what to do.  I also urge the Minister of State to look at the lack of out-of-hours services, which seems to leave many in distress.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900003#A00300","speaker":"1482","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607508600,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak.  As a member of the Regional Group, I am delighted that we have brought this Private Members&rsquo; motion to the D&aacute;il today.  We call on the Government to publish all data on mental health and the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.  We want the Government to give a commitment to the effect that mental health will be central to the plan to combat Covid-19.  We also want the Government to recognise that mental heath services are an essential part of its response to Covid-19.  Domestic violence and acute impoverishment have increased mental health issues during Covid-19.  Emergency mental health supports must always be available.  The Government must support activities that help the elderly and the isolated so that they can stay connected to their communities.  We must put the resources in place to ensure that mental health services continue to function during any future pandemic or similar situation.  The Government must put in place a strategy for vulnerable groups in society, as outlined by the World Health Organization and the UN.<\/p>  <p>  We need a commitment that investment will be made in mental health interventions that can be delivered remotely, for example, telecounselling for front-line healthcare workers and people at home with depression and anxiety.  We must provide access to information about positive coping methods for dealing with depression.  We must prioritise the availability of psychosocial support, especially for those dealing with grief and loss.  The Government must commit to the re-establishment of a dedicated lead for mental health within the HSE.  It must provide real support to help people recover from Covid-19 by building mental health services for the future to ensure that all affected communities will receive quality mental health services to support their recovery.  The Government must develop and support financially the implementation of national services and the re-organisation strategies that shift care away from institutions to community services.  It is important to involve people with lived experience of mental health issues and challenges in the design, implementation and monitoring of mental health services.  The pandemic has clearly shown that, as a society, we do not have the proper structures and services in place to deal with the current mental health challenges.  We need to change that.  The motion clearly outlines what needs to be done by the Government.<\/p>  <p>  I have spoken on many occasions about the challenges faced by the younger generation.  I am a great believer that exercise plays a vital part in good mental health.  However, during the pandemic I have seen another group that needs our support, that is, the older generation.  These people have given a lifetime commitment not only to their families but also to society and when they needed help most, unfortunately, they did not receive it.  I spoke in recent weeks about the fact that public masses should have been treated as essential services.  I spoke to many people, particularly members of the older generation, and one of the biggest challenges they face is the fact that they have not been able to attend daily or weekly mass services.  In these circumstances, we need a more compassionate approach.<\/p>  <p>  That is true in all areas of mental health.  We need to take a more human approach and to view the issues in a more compassionate manner.  It is not only about allocating money to a problem.  It is about allocating the right resources.  By that, I mean people who are properly trained to deal with mental health issues.  On too many occasions in my constituency of Louth I have seen how mental health services have failed my constituents.  Many times I have seen people suffering from mental health issues try to access resources, but they are turned away.  On occasion, unfortunately, that has resulted in tragedy.  That must not be allowed to continue.  A person does not need to be a drug addict, an alcoholic or homeless in order to suffer from mental health challenges.  On too many occasions I have seen situations where people did not have any outward symptoms and, as a result, they did not receive the proper treatment.  Again, unfortunately, that has resulted in tragedy in a number of instances.  We must not allow that to continue.  We must stop now, evaluate the service we currently provide and put a plan in place to provide proper mental health services.  We are facing a crisis and we must act now.  The work must start in schools.  We must ensure that children are properly equipped to deal with the challenges they may face in life.  That must continue through their school and college life.  We must also provide support to parents so they can provide the necessary help and guidance to their children as they go through their formative years.  It is most important that we support the older generation.  They have suffered more than any other section of society during this pandemic.  I call on the Government to support this Private Members' motion, not only in words but with actions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900004#B00200","speaker":"1600"},{"type":"speech","time":1607508600,"counter":10,"content":"<p>This pandemic has touched the lives of everyone.  Life as we knew it was snatched away and replaced by a new normal, one that nobody wanted.  Even the strongest among us struggled to cope.  Even the hardiest did not escape unscathed.  The advice of health experts focused primarily on protecting ourselves and others from becoming infected.  This emphasis is to be expected during a pandemic.  Guidance on staying physically well is vital at this time.  While there is an ever-increasing awareness of the mental health damage being caused by the pandemic, it does appear to have taken a back seat as we journey through Covid-19.  In times of life-threatening crisis, both physical and mental health should and must be treated equally.  Mental health must form a central part of the overall response to Covid-19.  This pandemic has shone a light on the deficiencies in the mental health service.  The cumulative results of years of underfunding mean that services are not readily available to the growing number of people who desperately need them.  It is alarming to note that 76% of respondents said they had to withdraw the mental health services they usually provide because of the pandemic.  Not only is the reduction in services alarming, it is frightening.  Part of the reason is an inability to facilitate face-to-face consultations.  Telephone or virtual consultations are available, but they do not suit everyone.<\/p> <p>At a time when research shows that one in three adults in this country reports suffering anxiety or post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD, as a direct result of the ongoing situation, their cry for help must be heard and they must be accommodated.  When the need for help reaches this level, mental health services must be adequately funded and upgraded to allow them to meet this demand.  This is what happened in the provision of physical care.  This clearly indicated the need for a dedicated mental health task force.<\/p> <p> As the vaccine comes on-stream, many people will need support when they emerge from this pandemic.  This will be a challenging and overwhelming time for some.  It also underscores the urgent need to re-establish a dedicated lead for mental health within the HSE, not just for now, but for future mental health needs.<\/p> <p> Many of those reaching out for help are elderly, living at home or in nursing homes.  Emphasis has been placed on protecting our older generation from this virus.  We have isolated them to keep them safe.  We have cocooned them to keep them well.  We have kept their families, including their grandchildren, away from them.  We have kept them apart from everyone.  This was all done with the best of intentions.  No one disputes its necessity.  We diligently protected them physically, but the mental health of our elderly suffered immensely.<\/p> <p> The majority of older adults are acutely aware of the greater risk to them from the pandemic.  This awareness comes with worry and anxiety.  They also have concerns about access to medical care.  They fear hospitalisation due to the risks.  Every day they read and hear of others succumbing to Covid-19.  They worry about their families when they cannot see them.  They hearts are breaking because they will not share this Christmas with their loved ones from overseas.  Despair fills their minds.<\/p> <p> They are shouldering a far greater burden of stress than generations before them and yet the mental health support they receive is limited at best and non-existent at worst.  It should be a central part of their care.  We have zoned in so completely on protecting their physical health that their needs as human beings have been cast aside.  Today's motion tabled by the Regional Independent Group seeks to support community actions that strengthen social cohesion and reduce loneliness.  This includes supporting activities that help isolated lonely adults to stay connected.<\/p> <p> At the other end of the age spectrum, 2020 has been a horrible year for young people.  Not alone have their normal social activities been prohibited, but they have been singled out and targeted as virus spreaders.  Many young people now consciously isolate themselves from their families.  As we try hard to put old heads on young shoulders, we turned a blind eye to the sacrifices we are asking young people to make.  The result is that youth mental health services, such as Jigsaw, have reported a 50% increase in demand.  Loneliness, boredom, isolation, concerns for parents and grandparents and an increased dependence on interaction only on social media have all played a part in that.  For young people emphasis should be placed on providing and promoting care in the community.  This is of particular importance to this age group.  They will be more reluctant to seek help if it might involve treatment in an adult institution.  In a dedicated community setting, young people will be much more inclined to seek it out.<\/p> <p> Our motion calls for a strengthening of communication strategy to support a national campaign to highlight the mental supports available.  Overall, good health is a key objective for us all.  Physical and mental health are interdependent.  Without one, we cannot fully enjoy the other.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900004#B00500","speaker":"1609","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607509200,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies from the Regional Independent Group for tabling this motion.  Supporting positive mental health and well-being is a priority for me and the Government and is particularly important during the current pandemic.  Covid has presented significant challenges for people&rsquo;s mental health, including increased stress, anxiety and fear.  This has been exacerbated by experiences of isolation, bereavement and loss of income and work among many others.  We have responded rapidly by reconfiguring existing services and putting additional services and supports in place.<\/p>  <p>  I say at the outset that the Government does not oppose this motion, as it is broadly in line with the Government&rsquo;s policy objectives for mental health.  It also highlights a number of actions the Government has already significantly progressed.  However, I am not convinced that the motion accurately reflects the Government's progress to date in improving mental health services and its commitment to continue to enhance services.<\/p>  <p>  Accordingly, I welcome the opportunity to emphasise the priority given by the Government to mental health and our commitment to the continued development of all aspects of mental health services across a broad continuum from mental health promotion and early intervention to acute and specialist services.  I also draw attention to the significant measures put in place to address the particular mental health challenges posed by Covid-19.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, I reaffirm our commitment to the implementation of Sharing the Vision, the national mental health policy, in line with the programme for Government and Sl&aacute;intecare and to Connecting for Life, the national suicide-reduction strategy through its extension for another four years until 2024.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has invested significantly in the enhancement of mental health services.  Budget 2021 allocation for mental health, of &euro;1.076 billion, is an increase of &euro;50 million over 2020.  Of the additional &euro;50 million for 2021, &euro;23 million will be used to commence implementation of many of the short-term recommendations set out in Sharing the Vision.  This will fund an additional 153 staff to enhance community mental health teams, including CAMHS; clinical care programmes, including in the area of dual diagnosis; bereavement counselling; and crisis resolution.  There is also &euro;15 million for Covid measures, including the provision of extra mental health beds, as required.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Canney asked about CAMHS.  I am very concerned that 2,200 people are on the CAMHS waiting list.  These are all vulnerable children under 18.  Those figures are similar to last year's.  Owing to my concern, of the new posts for 2021, 29 whole-time equivalents will be specifically for CAMHS.<\/p>  <p>  Many local mental health services are also implementing innovative practices such as the introduction of a community assessment hub in Cork which provides direct access to mental health assessment and support seven days a week, reducing the need for people to present to emergency departments.  This is a really innovative practice that has been put in place in Cork and is keeping many people out of emergency departments.  Appropriate clinical people in the hub can point people in the right direction.<\/p>  <p>  We do not yet fully understand the impact of Covid-19 on mental health and the subsequent demand on services.  However, the HSE already has a range of proactive responses for any increase in service need, including online and other telehealth psychosocial supports.  The Department and HSE continue to plan for any surge in demand as it arises.<\/p>  <p>  This is the case, for example, with MyMind, which is a HSE partner NGO providing online counselling sessions.  Additional funding of &euro;2.2 million has been provided for 2020 to ensure that we can meet this increased demand through MyMind and a number of other providers.  This funding will help to strengthen and expand psychosocial and telehealth services, such as the national crisis text line, to augment existing services and to support a transition to online and telephone support where face-to-face services cannot be provided safely.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, as part of the HSE&rsquo;s psychosocial response to Covid, counselling supports are available to staff impacted by the pandemic.  Local support structures are also in place in each community healthcare organisation, CHO.  These supports are also available to section 38 and 39 workers.<\/p>  <p>  Awareness-raising campaigns which promote existing mental health services have been launched, including through national and local radio campaigns, to assist people in finding appropriate supports where needed.<\/p>  <p>  This is a significant investment by any standard and the programme for Government gives a clear commitment to continue investment in mental health services as resources allow.  More specifically, mental health remains a core aspect of the Government&rsquo;s response to Covid-19.  It is important to note that specialist mental health services have continued to operate at 85% to 90% of pre-Covid levels, although there has inevitably been some impact on referrals to specialist services which are being monitored.<\/p>  <p>  In recent years, we have witnessed a major shift in our society&rsquo;s willingness to discuss and address mental health issues.  It is now recognised that there is no health without mental health.  Furthermore, the many determinants of mental health must be appropriately addressed if we are to improve the mental health outcomes of Ireland&rsquo;s population and build strong, healthy and resilient communities.<\/p>  <p>  This change is reflected in Sharing the Vision and Connecting for Life.  Both advocate a cross-departmental, whole-of-Government approach to delivering these policies.  Sharing the Vision, published earlier this year, sets out a progressive shift in mental health service delivery from volume of supports provided to outcomes achieved for people using the services.  In line with Sl&aacute;intecare, it promotes enhanced access to services; person-centred care, taking account of the needs of particular groups; and flexible and community-based service provision, reducing the need for hospital admission while still providing inpatient care, where required.<\/p> <p>I recently established a national implementation and monitoring committee, NIMC, to oversee the implementation of the Sharing the Vision policy over its ten-year life cycle.  The NIMC structure will involve a broad base of state bodies, NGO service providers and service user representatives to ensure that a whole-of-government and indeed, a whole-of-society, approach is adopted in its implementation.  The steering committee will hold its inaugural meeting on Friday morning of this week.  The committee will be supported by specialist groups that will provide expertise to progress recommendations relating to areas such as Travellers&rsquo; mental health and the transition from CAMHS to adult services.  Implementation will also be progressed through planned additional investment under annual budgets and agreed HSE service plans.  The new programme for Government recommends that we examine the reinstatement of a national director in mental health to ensure the new policy is driven in the HSE.  I am keen to explore this issue with the HSE in the coming months.  I will also seek an undertaking from the executive that mental health staff will only be redeployed for Covid work in extreme circumstances.<\/p> <p> While mental health care should be provided at the lowest level, not all mental health issues can be dealt with in the community.  Inpatient and residential care has, and will continue to have, an important role.  The new 170-bed hospital complex in Portrane will replace the Central Mental Hospital, Dundrum with a modernised national forensic mental health service.  The new facility includes a 130-bed forensic hospital, due to open in early 2021, a ten-bed forensic child and adolescent unit and a 30-bed intensive care rehabilitation unit.  This represents a major step forward in the care and treatment of people who require such care.  I am moving legislation in the D&aacute;il tomorrow to allow for the opening of the new service and I hope that everyone in the House will support this action.  The Department of Health is also nearing completion of an extensive overhaul of the Mental Health Act 2001.  The revised legislation will improve protection for the rights of mental health service users, including provision for consent to treatment for 16 and 17-year-olds.  The draft heads of this legislation are expected to be finalised in early 2021.<\/p> <p> The Government and mental health services have been particularly active in response to the pressures placed on people&rsquo;s mental health due to Covid-19.  At an early stage of the pandemic, HSE community mental health services moved rapidly, in compliance with public health guidelines, to provide in-person specialist services where it was safe and possible to do so for both staff and service users, and to augment this, with expanded telehealth services, to continue to provide mental health supports.  To ensure oversight of the performance of mental health services in responding to Covid-19, the Department of Health worked with the Mental Health Commission and the HSE - which is important to note - to develop a risk management framework for residential facilities, identify and address structural and operational issues and track and contain infections within residential and acute units.  The framework reports regularly, and infection rates in our facilities have remained low overall.  The establishment of a tripartite group, with the Department, HSE and the commission, will help to monitor our service-wide response to the pandemic and to identify any potential issues as early as possible.<\/p> <p> I ask that we maintain sight of our common goal of ensuring that the mental health needs of the nation are served in the most effective manner.  I am, with the Government and the Minister for Health, fully committed to the continued development of high-quality, person-centred and human rights-based mental health services for all children, young people and adults.  I welcome open and positive discussion on this important area, and I look forward to suggestions and constructive comments from the floor.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900005#C00200","speaker":"1614","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607509800,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I am pleased to have an opportunity to contribute on such an important motion.  It is undeniable that Covid-19 has had an impact on the mental health of many people, and this has taken many different forms, including loneliness, social isolation, stress, financial pressures, anxiety.  These are just some examples.  My colleagues and I, in the Regional Group, are very pleased that the Government agrees that we need to ensure that mental health is an essential part of its response to the Covid-19 pandemic.  The response should ensure that measures protect not only the population's physical health, but its mental health on an equal basis.  Covid-19 is a public health issue, and I believe that all of us in this House recognise that, but we have differing opinions on how best to deal with it.  We must not allow our response to Covid to cause more knock-on problems than it solves.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, we have a mental health system that is not adequately prepared to cope with the significant increase in demand that has been experienced over the past few months.  Underfunding of mental health services prior to the pandemic shows clearly that the budget for mental health is struggling to meet the population's needs.  The pandemic should not be used as an excuse to deny, delay or curtail access to mental healthcare and services.  In my local CAMHS unit in Wexford, where the staff there are Trojan-esque in their commitment to patients, no child psychologist or dietician has yet been appointed, and this situation has been ongoing for over two years.  I have seen, first hand, the devastation caused when early intervention is not achieved with these children and they move straight into adult services.  Funding is in an investment in these children's futures, and we must not take that away from them.  Long before Covid-19 was ever heard of, there was a mental health epidemic and it is obvious that the pandemic has served to magnify this fact.  <\/p>  <p>  On the specifics of the motion, we are calling on the Government to publish all available data on mental health during the pandemic.  We want to ensure that mental health is a central part of its response to the Covid-19 pandemic.  This means taking more than just the potential spread of the virus into account when deciding on what activities to ban people from doing.  For example, banning someone from visiting a neighbour who lives on their own may help reduce the chances of the virus spreading, but it increases loneliness and social isolation.  Human beings are social beings, and thrive in the company of others, heartened by their love and support.  Christmas is one of the loneliest times for older people.  Likewise, how much stress, anxiety and depression has been caused by ordering businesses to close?  How many people have been plunged into a state of financial despair as a result of Covid restrictions?  <\/p>  <p>  We call on the Government in the motion to design all communications to be sensitive of their potential impact on people's mental health, for example, by communicating empathy for their distress and including advice for their emotion well-being.  With this in mind, a special mental health task force  must be set up without delay to ensure the safe, efficient roll-out of the vaccine programme, and to ensure that all services are provided and the needs of patients are met.  \"Scaremongering\" is a word that has been used many times to describe the matter in which Covid-19 information has been communicated to the people.  We constantly hear bad and worrying news, and the worst-case scenarios are forecast.  However, do we hear a fair share of positive news?  It is five months since we received an update on the number of recoveries from Covid-19.  That was on 20 July.  Why have we not received such an update in five months?  I recognise that the bad news is being used in a way to try to get people to take all of the restrictions seriously, but I also recognise that the constant drip feed of misery and doomsday scenario information takes its toll on people.  I ask the Government to ensure that clear data is provided, not just on recoveries, but also on asymptomatic cases, and rather than reporting deaths related to the virus, report deaths from the virus to allow people to understand more.  <\/p>  <p>  These are just some of the reasons we are calling for mental health to be a central consideration of Government when deciding on any further Covid-19 measures.  I do not have time to comment on each line of the motion now, but I am very pleased that members of all parties and none recognise the benefits of supporting the motion to help protect the mental health of our people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900006#D00200","speaker":"1622"},{"type":"speech","time":1607509800,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I thank Mental Health Reform and Dr. Philip Hyland of Maynooth University for their assistance in drafting the motion.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle will want to join me in thanking the mental health staff who are working in hugely trying circumstances in our services across the country, and particularly in our acute services.  I know this issue is close to the heart of Leas-Cheann Comhairle, as it is to mine.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to raise two specific issues, the first of which concerns young adults.  This group has been disproportionately impacted by the Covid-19 restrictions that have been put in place.<\/p> <p>This is the case from a mental health perspective in particular.  There has been much focus on older people and isolation and there are challenges in urban and rural areas arising from isolation.  However, young people's lives have been turned upside down.  These are people who this time last year would have been going out while at college and involved with clubs and societies, as well as sporting organisations.  All that is gone and they are not even attending lectures now.  They do not have the basic human interaction that is so normal for young adults.  I am really frustrated we are brushing this matter under the carpet.<\/p> <p> The Minister of State knows that on a number of occasions I have said directly to the Taoiseach that we must look forensically at the restrictions that have been put in place, taking into account the risks and balancing them with benefits.  That is not happening because we are ignoring the vast volume of data that is there to help us make decisions.  It may be that we might say to young people that they can meet people in a coffee shop or go back to lectures but if they do so, they must isolate before they visit granny or grandad, or they should keep away from older people.<\/p> <p> The risks with younger people are far smaller once they remain within their own bubble or population cohort.  The concern is that they could bring the virus to family settings and, as a result, spread the infection to older people in particular.  We must be far more forensic in how we deal with this.  If we believe it is vital that children have access to education at primary and post-primary level, surely the same logic applies with third level students.<\/p> <p> Speaking about children, there is a very serious backlog in addressing mental health and behavioural concerns in the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, across this country, with 2,229 children on a waiting list for assessment, never mind getting the treatment they require.<\/p> <p> I also raise the mental health services across Roscommon, Galway and Mayo.  I am astounded to find that as part of the winter initiative this year and dealing with the consequences of Covid-19, not one additional cent has been provided to our mental health services.  We have been told that mental health services should, under Sl&aacute;intecare, receive 10% of the total health budget but last year mental health services received 6% of the total health budget.  This year, that proportion has been cut to 5% of the total health budget.<\/p> <p> The reality is more pressure is being put on mental health services, particularly with respect to the acute mental health services in the west of Ireland.  In our acute units in the west of Ireland, we are looking at a 100% occupancy rate.  Taking into account Covid-19 concerns, we should at the maximum operate at 80% capacity but people are being turned away.  Not only are they being turned away but there is not an alternative service available to them.  The mental health support networks and services that should be in place have been wound down because of social distancing, which is compounding problems associated with isolation, particularly for people in an acute phase of mental health issues.  I am afraid this will have long and far-reaching consequences unless the concerns are addressed immediately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900006#D00300","speaker":"1603","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607510400,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank the Regional Group for tabling the motion and keeping mental health on the agenda, and Sinn F&eacute;in will speak in favour of it today.<\/p><p>The tragedy of suicide has touched nearly all communities and sectors in Ireland.  The Government relies on non-governmental organisations to plug gaps in mental health services but we must become proactive rather than reactive and put in place support services and policies to help prevent suicide from occurring.  Access to counselling may often be a barrier to people obtaining appropriate mental health supports and we must start to move towards parity of esteem in mental health provision.<\/p><p>One of the major gaps in services commonly experienced by those in distress is a lack of care outside the 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. window.  Currently, there is no State-wide provision of 24-7 mental health crisis services at a community level.  People should have access to mental health treatment where and when they need it.  Mental health concerns do not just become apparent between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., they do not take the weekend off and they do not take a break during a pandemic.<\/p><p>In response to a parliamentary question asked this week on the number of people who have died by suicide this year, I was told that:<\/p> <blockquote> \tAll unnatural deaths, which includes deaths from intentional self-harm must be referred to the Coroner's Office.  However, the Coroner's Court did not hold public hearings as a consequence of the restrictions imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and this would impact on the number of deaths registered and subsequently assigned an Underlying Cause of Death of intentional self-harm. <\/blockquote>  <p>In layman's terms, this means that deaths by suicide are not being counted in real time.<\/p><p>However, on 17 September, the T&aacute;naiste stated in this Chamber that the most recent figures he had seen indicated a &quot;decrease in suicide in Ireland and a decrease in people self-harming&quot;.  He also said &quot;That is very welcome but we have a long way to go.&quot;.  Where did the T&aacute;naiste get these figures and could we have access to them?  Could they be shared as we need transparency?  I want the Government's assurance that data will be collected retrospectively.<\/p><p>It is quite worrying that I, as an Opposition spokesperson on mental health issues, cannot get access to the number of people who died by suicide this year but the T&aacute;naiste apparently can.  Data are really important as they inform policy and allow public representatives like me to suggest solutions.  Without this information, we are hampered in making those suggestions that could help reduce death by suicide.  Why is that?  Does the Minister of State have those statistics?  If not, I suggest there be a conversation with the T&aacute;naiste and ask him for the information in order that it can be shared with all of us.<\/p><p>I am a member of the Oireachtas Joint Sub-Committee on Mental Health and last week we received representations from general practitioners.  I asked plainly what one action would help them to help people suffering from poor mental health and they asked for ease of access to counselling.  In Sinn F&eacute;in's alternative budget, we said we would deliver exactly that, were we in government.  We would introduce universal and free counselling on GP referral, and this could be easily rolled out in order to make a major difference in people getting the help they need where and when they need it.<\/p><p>It was also stated at the meeting that GPs would have capacity in their buildings to host a counsellor in practice.  Imagine having a one-stop shop where a person's physical and mental health needs could be met at the same time.  Failure to appropriately resource mental healthcare in general practitioners has led to an over-reliance on drug therapy.  Any move from a policy of &quot;every ill has a pill&quot; is welcome and access to talk therapies like counselling is central to such a change.  Sometimes the best ideas are the simplest but they just need political will to have them implemented.<\/p><p>I again thank the Regional Group for keeping mental health on the agenda today.

I have spoken in this House on a number of occasions about the need to balance mental and physical health as we deal with this pandemic.  I recently spoke in the debate of a Bill tabled by my colleague, Teachta Ward, regarding parity of esteem for mental health.  It called for mental ill health to be given equal status to physical ill health.  If we are serious about this, we must also give both types of ill health equal consideration from a preventative aspect.  Aristotle is reported to have said \"Before you heal the body you must first heal the mind\", and he was far ahead of his time.<\/p>  <p>  The winter plan was launched in September with no mention of mental health issues, which is a damning indictment of the Government's commitment to the area.  We cannot allow mental health to be left in the cold.<\/p> <p>It is a matter of life or death for some people.  My heart goes out to those who have lost loved ones during the pandemic.  Losing a person close to you is difficult at any time, but with the restrictions on visiting the sick or dying and attending funerals, it has been especially difficult.  I know that many of the bereaved have been comforted by the fact that some people come out of their homes or workplaces when a funeral is going by to acknowledge in a small way the person's passing.  We need to ensure that those who have been bereaved get the support they need.<\/p> <p> I commend the work of groups such as Grow Ireland, Shine and Jigsaw, as well as HOPE(D) in Newbridge, which help people to cope with the stress of life, particularly the various stresses brought on by the pandemic.  I have spoken at length previously in the Chamber about HOPE(D) in Newbridge.  I have spoken to Terri, who works there.  The complications around this issue are severe.  HOPE(D) gets no funding but the HSE sends clients to it.  That needs to change.  It has adapted admirably to help those who are struggling to cope.  It is to be hoped that, with the recent breakthrough on vaccines, there will be light at the end of the tunnel.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900007#E00300","speaker":"1588","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607511000,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I thank the Regional Independent Group for tabling the motion.  I will cut straight to the chase with some headlines published in the media between June and four days ago.  The headlines are: \"Children with mental health issues forced to wait up to 18 months for help\"; \"Mental health budget allocation falls by 1% - PNA\"; \"More than 2,000 children waiting to access mental health services\"; \"Tele-psychiatry delivery to plug regional staffing gaps\"; \"Concerns raised over plan to move HSE child mental health staff\"; \"HSE report details staff shortages in child mental health teams\"; \"Inpatient psychiatric care for under-18s exposes health system flaws\"; \"Psychiatric stays for drug disorders on a par with alcohol admissions\"; \"Almost half of youth mental health service teams have unfilled posts\"; and \"Fallen through the cracks and there is no help in sight for them\".  That is a synopsis of media headlines in that period.<\/p>  <p>  I do not have much time, so I will cut straight to the chase.  The Minister of State stated that the motion is broadly in line with the proposals of the Government on mental health.  In my experience, nothing has happened on this issue.  She said the motion is broadly in line with Government proposals, but then she started criticising what the Regional Group has done and many solutions that have been put in place.  I have seen what was done by the previous Government and is being done by this Government.  It is about time that the Government took mental health seriously.  Deputies come into the Chamber again and again to discuss this issue.  It is a talking shop.  The people affected by this issue are brothers, sisters, mothers, fathers, uncles or aunts.  This problem knows no colour, class, creed or religion, and it does hurt.  I appeal to the Minister of State to take things seriously.  I have been a Member of the D&aacute;il for I do not know how many years.  We are speaking about real people.  Let us start coming up with a real plan because all we get from the Government is excuse after excuse every time.<\/p>  <p>  In 2018, the first legislation I published was the suicide prevention and training Bill.  It was a very simple Bill to require all those working in a public body or the public domain to complete a suicide prevention training course, similar to the requirement for some workers to complete the Safe Pass programme.  It was about education.  It did not even come before the House because it did not get past the Ceann Comhairle.  This Government and the previous one have not taken this issue seriously.  I again appeal to the Minister of State to please take this issue seriously because, let us be honest, there is a tsunami of suicides coming down the road.  I spoke to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who found the body of a young fella last week near here.  He died from suicide.<\/p>  <p>  The figures are another problem.  The figures we get are two years old.  One must wait for two years to get the figures from the Central Statistics Office and even then we do not know whether they are factual.  I echo the call of Deputy Ward for the Government to give us the figures.  It does not matter that we are members of the Opposition.  We are all here together and we are agreeing on mental health issues.  The Government should give all Members the figures and the data to allow us to work together and get things right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900008#F00200","speaker":"1452"},{"type":"speech","time":1607511000,"counter":21,"content":"<p>During the recent debate on the Mental Health Parity of Esteem Bill brought forward by Deputy Ward, Sinn F&eacute;in drew the attention of the Government to how mental health services tend to be an afterthought in overall health policy and service provision.  That was apparent pre Covid-19, but it has become more pronounced now that, as a society, we are facing the challenges brought on by the fear of contracting Covid-19, as well as by the measures we must take to stop its spread.<\/p>  <p>  One word that describes the situation that affected many people before Covid and which has became more of a topic of national discussion with the onset of the virus is \"isolation\".  The poor provision of mental health services had already left many communities almost isolated.  Through the years in County Tipperary there has been a very active and widespread campaign to get proper mental health services for the county, but what is in place still falls far short of being a comprehensive network of mental services that are available to all, no matter one's age or geographic location.  The consequences of the pandemic have brought this into sharp focus.  We have found ourselves in a situation in which people have been confined to their homes for months on end.  They have also been unable to engage in social pursuits which all Members know benefit one's mental and physical well-being.  Some people are now afraid to leave their homes because they are worried about contracting the virus.<\/p>  <p>  What must be taken into account is that so many families who have lost loved ones during this crisis have been unable to grieve in the healthy way they would have previously, when communities would gather around the bereaved.  The consequences of this issue are mounting with the increasing isolation.  The pandemic has limited people's ability to avail of the mental health services they need.  All kinds of outreach services for communities in rural areas have been restricted, including services for victims of domestic violence.  This comes at a time many people have been confined to unhappy homes.  In short, the ability of people to avail of the services they need has been reduced.<\/p>  <p>  Many people will postpone or have postponed seeking help and support.  We have heard of that being the case with regard to many physical illnesses, but we have not heard as much about how people are postponing appointments for or are unable to get the mental health supports and counselling they need.  We must ask why that is the case.  Again, it comes down to parity of esteem.  This is why attention must be paid to the motion.<\/p>  <p>  We must no longer allow a person's geographical location to determine who can avail of services.  Work must be done to bring these supports to the people who need them but cannot get them.  The health service must link with community service organisations to ensure nobody is forgotten as a result of their isolation.  Covid has changed the way we are able to go about our business and the health services and social services must adapt quickly to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900008#F00300","speaker":"1613"},{"type":"speech","time":1607511000,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I have just finished a telephone call with the principal of a post-primary school.  One of the many things we discussed was the pressure and stress her students facing and, in particular, the anxiety and mental health pressures they are under.  She has never seen anything like it.  It is an absolutely enormous issue.  There is no doubt that many of these  issues have been exacerbated by Covid.  Social outlets have been closed off and the world has seemed very disturbed, disrupted, frightening and worrying.  That has caused significant issues.  When it is added to the fact that mental health services for children and young adults was totally inadequate in the first place, particularly in the part of the world from which I come, it is a recipe for disaster.<\/p>  <p>  There are 2,200 people on waiting lists for CAMHS in the Cork and Kerry region, with 160 or more of them waiting for more than a year and some for as long as 18 months.  There is no excuse for that in the context of Covid or in any other context.  It is putting families under incredible pressure.  It is not the case that someone makes an appointment and waits for it and hopes things are okay.  The family has to deal with the consequences of the pressure and strain all the time.  Doing so against the background of the pandemic is extremely difficult.  I once again urge the Minister of State to try to tackle that issue.  There are similar problems in universities, where demand for mental health supports has doubled since the pandemic began.<\/p>  <p>  A report by the Mental Health Commission found that 15% of those over the age of 60 suffer from a mental illness.  In a very different but very real way, older people have been put in an extremely difficult position, particularly those in care settings such as nursing homes, as a result of social isolation.  Even those who live in their own homes do not have the social interaction they once had, as social outlets have been closed off to them too.  It is an issue that we need to talk about more.  We need to factor it into our solutions.  We really need to focus on it in terms of resources as we emerge from Covid restrictions.  <\/p>  <p>  I agree with the point made by Deputy Ward regarding statistics.  We are not getting the full picture we need.<\/p>  <p>  I have previously made the point that we need to ensure that those graduating from universities with a psychology degree have the opportunity to continue in that career.

Mental health in Ireland has always been treated like a headache, the flu or something a chemist might fix but it is a much bigger issue than that and the signs have been apparent for years.  Between 2009 and 2019, we had 5,426 people, 4,370 males and 1,066 females, die as a result of suicide.  In fact, one person dies every 21 hours in Ireland as a result of suicide.<\/p>  <p>  Stigma is a significant problem for people who experience mental health conditions and it has been identified as one of the most difficult aspects of living with a mental condition for the person involved and for his or her family.  Stigma is recognised as a barrier to the recovery process.  People do not seek help because they fear being labelled as mentally ill.  The consequences of stigma are shame and humiliation and can lead people to delay or avoid seeking help.  We need people with mental health conditions to know that help and resources will be put in place, that recovery is possible and, with the right treatments and support, that they can go on to lead rewarding and fulfilling lives.  Mental health conditions are very common.  Research indicates that one in four people will experience a mental health difficulty in their lifetime.  Out of 36 European countries, Ireland rates third highest in the context of mental health problems.  Breaking down the stigma associated with mental health needs all our voices to create a society in which people with mental health conditions are treated with dignity, respect and equality.  A mental health condition can feel just as bad if not worse than a physical condition and needs treatment and support.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of suicide is a significant healthcare and societal problem and the rates among young people give rise to particular concerns.  The statistics only tell one part of the story.  Behind each of those statistics are families and communities devastated by these tragedies.  While I welcome the additional funding in the budget for mental health services, this is an enormous issue that needs to be properly resourced.  We need to develop mental health services and facilitate campaigns that focus greater attention on the issue of suicide.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900009#G00100","speaker":"1506"},{"type":"speech","time":1607511600,"counter":24,"content":"<p>Today's motion from the Regional Group has been brought forward against a severe backdrop for the people of Ireland.  Covid-19 has had an unprecedented impact on our nation's physical and mental well-being.  At a time when demand has increased, service delivery has slowed and, in some cases, stopped, meaning that the pandemic has had a double hit on our nation's mental well-being.  With higher levels of depression and anxiety recorded across many nations, the UN has warned that the pandemic risks sparking a major global mental health crisis.  We know this to be the case in Ireland as well.  Research carried out in this country has shown that, at a minimum, one third of people in Ireland have experienced serious mental health difficulties during the pandemic.  In young people the situation is worse, with that figure rising to over one half.<\/p>  <p>  Isolation and depression are on the rise as a result of the pandemic and referrals for mental health services have increased significantly.  Services which were already chronically under-resourced have been left completely overwhelmed and people who are in serious need of urgent care have been left waiting.  At the start of 2020, there were almost 2,000 on the waiting list for CAMHS.  That was prior to Covid.  It illustrates how strained mental health provision was before the additional impact of the pandemic.  Since then, we have seen a 25% increase in the number of children and young people on the waiting list for CAMHS.  In primary case, more than 10,000 people across all ages are on waiting lists to see a psychologist.  We have seen this replicated across the sector.  Some 92% of Mental Health Reform members have said they require additional resources to deal with the impact of Covid.  How can the Minister of State accept this scandal?  There is no other way to describe it but to state that it is a scandal.  Mental health needs to be front and centre in the context of the response to Covid-19.  The evidence clearly shows this will have a massive impact on our population well beyond the timeline of Covid-19.  Many people will be faced with a permanent mental impact from this very dark year and this must be taken into account as well.<\/p>  <p>  Last week, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na confirmed that domestic violence and abuse have continued to increase as the pandemic has worn on.  It stated that violence moved indoors during the pandemic, with domestic violence up almost 17% since last year.  The victims of domestic violence have been left to feel literally trapped in abusive homes as a result of the restrictions.  No doubt they will feel the impact of this year well into the future and this Government and those that will succeed it need to be in a position to offer increased support.<\/p>  <p>  The people to whom I refer are not the only ones who will suffer from the pandemic in the long term.  The Institute of Fiscal Studies has stated that the economic downturn resulting from the pandemic will have significant consequences for people's mental health outcomes in the short and longer term.  We already know that severe socioeconomic inequalities can give rise to mental health difficulties.  The full fiscal impact of the pandemic still remains to be seen but I urge the Government to take heed of how those who have lost employment as a result of the pandemic may be affected well into the future.  Most importantly, the Government must ensure that mental health services are targeted towards the areas of greatest need, especially the most disadvantaged areas.<\/p>  <p>  The motion makes reference to investing in mental health services.  I want to touch on the amount of investment in the services so far this year.  First, it was disappointing that the winter plan contained no additional provision for mental health at a time when it is so desperately needed.  The only saving grace was the &euro;50 million investment in budget 2021.  That is made up of &euro;38 million for new services and &euro;10 million for existing services.  Although &euro;50 million is a significant sum, it must be said it falls short of the &euro;80 million which Mental Health Reform predicted will be needed this year.  It is crucial any gap in funding for existing services, which is likely given that funding falls below predicted costs, is not met using the funds for new service development.  People in Ireland depend on mental health services for their well-being and consistent, chronic underfunding has led, as we know, to extremely long waiting lists.  New services are absolutely essential and if their funding is slashed to make up for other shortfalls, we will be waiting a very long time to see any significant improvements.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I must mention Sharing the Vision because it is a really important document.  It is a pity that there is no mention of it in today's motion.  The policy has a detailed action plan to create a more integrated whole system continuum of care.  That goes to one of the central pillars of Sl&aacute;intecare, which aims to bring healthcare closer to home by strengthening primary and community care.  As most people in this Chamber know, the Government has been sluggish in implementing and funding Sl&aacute;intecare.  Sharing the Vision lays out a very clear pathway to improving our mental health services but, without the overarching health framework funded and implemented through Sl&aacute;intecare, it is difficult to know what real follow-through the Government will have in respect of these initiatives.  If we are to have any hope of meeting mental health needs, Sharing the Vision and Sl&aacute;intecare must be top of the Government's list of priorities.<\/p> <p> The Social Democrats strongly supports this motion and the call to make mental health a priority in Covid-19 planning.  With the promise of a vaccine quickly becoming a reality, it is to be hoped that the immediate threat of Covid-19 will lessen over the course of next year.  For many people in Ireland, however, whose mental health suffered as a consequence of the pandemic, Covid's impact will be felt for many years to come.  It is up to this Government and future ones to ensure the right supports are in place for all those people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900009#G00200","speaker":"1567","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607512200,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak about the crisis of mental health that exists in our society.  The Covid crisis has shown the strengths and weaknesses of our society in many ways.  We have seen huge solidarity from ordinary people assisting one another in big and small actions to work through the pandemic.  We have seen the amazing work of our health professionals on the front line and other front-line workers in fighting this virus and enabling society to continue.<\/p>  <p>  The crisis has also exposed gross weaknesses, in particular the underfunding of public services over an extended period and the resulting crisis.  Our mental health services have been some of the most chronically starved of funding over years and the result is that they are struggling to cope with the pressure they are under.  That pressure existed before Covid but it has undoubtedly been exacerbated by the conditions of Covid, which have resulted in isolation and alienation for a significant number of people.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to mention the abuse of the issue of mental health by some Government Deputies and political parties of the right.  These parties and politicians have not in the past expressed much concern about mental health and certainly have not indicated much concern about mental health through their actions, such as the cuts carried out by the previous Government.  However, they have a new-found concern for mental health in the context of Covid, where mental health has been used as a byword for undermining the public health advice.  Sometimes when people refer to mental health in this Chamber what they mean is pubs.  One would sometimes get the impression that pubs are mental well-being centres, as opposed to places that profit from selling depressants.  I do not mean to undermine the importance of socialising, of which for many people, including me, going to the pub can be a part, but I oppose the cynical abuse of this issue of mental health to push a particular agenda.  I suspect that some of the Deputies in some of those parties will forget about their new-found concern about mental health as soon as the restrictions are gone.  I hope they do not because there was already a plague of mental health in our society before the onset of Covid.  It has undoubtedly been exacerbated but it previously existed.<\/p>  <p>  The late socialist author Mark Fisher wrote, \"Capitalist realism insists on treating mental health as if it were a natural fact, like weather\".  We need to ask how has it become acceptable that so many people, especially so many young people, are ill.  There has been an explosion of mental health problems, not just in Ireland but right across the world.  That explosion relates to the levels of alienation and oppression that exist within our society.  The WHO has estimated that by 2020, depression would be the largest contributor to disease burden in our societies.  In our country, a quarter of people have a mental health problem in the course of their lives and the figures are much worse for young people.  Incredibly, by the age of 13, one in three young people will have experienced a mental health problem.  By the age of 24 that will have increased to one in two.  It is horrific that Ireland has the highest rate of child suicide of girls in all of Europe, and ten people die by suicide every week.<\/p>  <p>  It is worth asking why that massive rise is happening.  It can partly be attributed to the reduction in stigma surrounding mental health.  That means an increased percentage of mental health problems are being reported, which is a positive.  It is hard to avoid the conclusion that, even in pre-Covid-19 times, we faced an epidemic of mental health problems.  There are multiple contributing factors to that but there is increasing widespread recognition of the role of social and environmental factors.  To be blunt, neoliberal capitalism has created a society with deepened and dramatic inequality.  It has driven the atomisation of people and the breakdown of communities.  That created the conditions, now added to by Covid-19, in which mental health problems thrive.  The Royal College of Psychiatrists in the UK has stated that inequality is a major determinant of mental illness.  The greater the levels of inequality, the worse the health outcomes are.  Children from households from the lower income deciles have a threefold greater risk of mental health issues than children from higher income households.  That risk grows even higher for those facing homelessness, where the impact is massive.  The risk and incidence is massively increased again for those facing oppression such as young LGBTQ people, who are four times more likely to have mental health problems, or Traveller communities, whose suicide rates are six times those of settled communities.<\/p>  <p>  We have to take the stigma out of mental health but we also need proper funding and staffing of our mental health services right now.  While we need universal access to counsellors in primary care, 24-7 direct access and mental health clinics supported by telephone support around the clock, we do not have that.  It is also time we introduced mental health and mindfulness classes in secondary schools.  We need to make professional counselling and psychotherapy services available in schools for those who need them, free of charge.  A UNICEF report highlights that six out of every 100,000 Irish adolescents between the ages of 15 and 19 die by suicide.  As it stands right now, there are over 8,000 children and teenagers waiting for treatment from a psychologist and more than 3,000 of those have been waiting for over 12 months.  It is absolutely scandalous that in this day and age anyone, let alone teenagers and children, should have to wait more than 12 months just to see a psychologist for what should be basic healthcare.<\/p>  <p>  We need to invest now in proper mental health services for young people.  We also have to tackle the general inequality in our society, including the crises of homelessness, poverty wages and job insecurity.  We must tackle those environmental and economic situations that add to the stress, struggles and suffering of those fighting mental illness.  For example, part of tackling the mental health crisis would be the reintroduction of the full eviction ban.  It is tough to put into words the emotional strain and stress of being threatened with being made homeless or actually being made homeless during a pandemic.  A full ban could at least remove this one fear from people's minds and it would not cost the Government a penny.  We need to fight for a better society with a right to housing, healthcare, a living wage for all.  We must provide the stability and support people need to overcome the alienation, to fight mental illness and allow them to flourish in full lives. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900010#H00200","speaker":"1628"},{"type":"speech","time":1607512200,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I thank the Regional Group for bringing this motion and putting the spotlight on mental health, particularly in time of Covid.  It was forgotten about, certainly at the beginning of the pandemic.  I will focus on the Mental Health Commission, which I noticed that the Minister of State did not mention.  I acknowledge that she cannot mention everything but she gave a very long speech.  I welcome that she is going to bring legislation before the D&aacute;il to reform the 2001 Act.  I welcome the fact that we are getting nearer to the implementation body and I will come back to that if I have time.  I am a little concerned about its independence.  That is subject to the Minister of State telling me it is totally independent and who the members are because it is an essential feature in the mental health area.<\/p> <p>The Mental Health Commission's annual report for 2019 stated that now was the time for real reform.  It noted:<\/p><blockquote>\tThe current Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted in stark terms the need for a modern, well-staffed, holistic community-based mental health service.  This can only occur when mental health is appropriately prioritised. <\/blockquote> <p>Clearly it has not been.  This and previous commissions have been continuously forced to highlight that the system is <i>ad hoc<\/i>, sporadic, lacks integration and much of the mental health interventions are still linked to institutional care in the community.<br\/><br\/>In the 1980s, the Planning for the Future policy was to de-institutionalise care.  That has happened in name but not in reality.  Then there was A Vision For Change, which was a wonderful document but was not implemented.  The current policy is Sharing the Vision and its implementation will totally depend on whether there is an independent monitoring committee because as the record shows, no Government can be trusted on mental health.  <br\/><br\/>To return to its report, the Mental Health Commission found that compliance with regulation, that is, with obligatory measures, remained similar to 2018 at 78%.  It said it was disappointing that the modest improvements since 2016 did not continue.  There was also a thematic report on physical health from the inspector, which pointed out that physical health is not a top priority when it comes to those who also suffer from mental illness or a psychological problem.  This is stark.  It remains a fact that in the 21st century, people with a mental illness will die 15 to 20 years earlier than their peers in the general communities, in many cases due to preventative physical illness.  The historic separation of physical and mental healthcare within the organisation has led to a situation where specialist mental health training and the associated practices have not been put to the fore.  <br\/><br\/>I will conclude with some statistics.  There were 208 instances of over-capacity in 2019.  The report noted &quot;It is clear that a significant amount of premises are no longer suitable and need to be replaced.&quot;Some 23 centres, 49%, were non-compliant due to poor structural or decorative condition.  There were 54 child admissions to 15 adult units.  While the trend is down, that is still totally unacceptable.  The report remarked on the poor quality in monitoring the physical health of residents and the impact of staffing shortages, and the final thing I will mention is the delayed discharges in Galway.  The Mental Health Commission spoke of patients being there for more than six months.  I would like a breakdown of that figure because some have been there for years.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900010#H00300","speaker":"1577","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607512800,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I was very happy to co-sign this motion on mental health and am delighted to speak on it this morning.  For me, when we talk about mental health and access to timely and affordable support, we are talking about everyone.  Mental health should be like climate action; there should be a cross-party, all-Government committee and it should be taken into consideration for every aspect of policy making.  I heard the Minister of State speak of legislation.  I hope that does not end up like the climate action legislation, which waters down everything which had been proposed.  It concerns me because while we are very good at passing legislation, we are very bad at implementing it.  If we only implemented the legislation that exists at present, we could have a process that works very well for everyone.<\/p><p>What better way to address mental health supports than to actually listen to people?  A great deal of talk therapy is just having someone to listen, and depending on whether it is cognitive behavioural therapy or other forms, it is about a person having a safe space to talk through their feelings.  Someone with &euro;60 or &euro;70 per week spare can access private counselling sessions.  If someone cannot pay privately, he or she effectively is finished and will be obliged to wait and wait.  Covid means that many will only have access to therapy online but what of those who do not have a computer, smart phone or safe space to talk to their counsellor?  Undoubtedly, Covid has had a huge impact on people's mental health but our services were already diabolical before its onset.  Although we are saying that we want to get back to that, we should set the bar much higher in terms of seeking to move beyond that.  <\/p><p>What of those in emergency accommodation, a cramped hostel or in direct provision?  What of those in distress but who also use drugs?  Pieta House and other services will not provide emergency support to people who smoke cannabis.  The suicide rate for members of the Traveller community is unacceptably high, as activists and advocates told the first meeting of the Joint Committee on Key Issues affecting the Traveller Community in September 2019.<\/p><p>If vulnerable, marginalised or targeted groups say &quot;nothing about us, without us&quot;, we should listen.  We should allow them space to tell us what they need and then we should do everything we can to take action.  That will make a difference to people&rsquo;s mental health, together with the resources for timely and affordable access to supports.  I commend the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>on giving a platform to trans activists, Noah Halpin, Aoife Martin and Fionn Collins at the weekend.  I also wish to comment on two podcasts, &quot;The Tortoise Shack&quot; and &quot;The Week at Work&quot; with Dave Gibney and Clare O&rsquo;Connor, which invited trans activist Lillith Carroll on to have her voice heard.  It was a particularly tough week for trans people last week and I offer my full support, as always, but it is important that their own voices are heard. <\/p><p>We all need to create the space for people to feel comfortable talking about their mental health.  Help must be available when someone reaches out.  I ask that the Government accept this motion, fully resource the &quot;Sharing the Vision&quot; strategy, and not get caught up in thinking there is a need for new legislation, rather than implementing what we have. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900011#J00200","speaker":"1547"},{"type":"speech","time":1607512800,"counter":30,"content":"<p>This is a very important issue.  As others have said, services were strained before Covid ever arrived on our shores, but the onset of Covid has had an enormous impact.  We have no way of assessing its damage because people are cocooned or unable to access medical centres, which have great pressure on them.  Tipperary is particularly challenged, as the Minister of State will be aware.  I thank her for coming to visit us.  There is a dearth of mental health beds there.  The implementation of A Vision for Change destroyed our services.  It took away our acute day hospital.  We were promised a Rolls-Royce community service but, sadly, that never materialised.  It is the same up and down the country and applied to many services but mental health services are acutely affected.  In north Tipperary, people must travel to Ennis and in south Tipperary, which is a huge area, they must travel to Kilkenny.  They do not want us in Kilkenny; it is nothing personal about matches or games, they are full from the south-eastern region itself, and have no space.  The Minister of State also paid a visit there.  She told us at a meeting that there was a lot of capacity in Kilkenny but that is not our experience.  People cannot access it and it is costing a fortune in transport services and the delayed time of consultants driving to Kilkenny is farcical.  The previous Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, acknowledged in the House and at meetings with the HSE and the Department of Health that Tipperary had a deficit of 15 beds which we were working to close.  I wish the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, well - we are good friends and represent neighbouring constituencies and work on issues together - but I am devastated to hear that the HSE has moved away from that position.  I note she was successful in having beds put into Waterford recently.  They were badly needed there and there have been different reports on this point in the past but we need beds in Tipperary, full stop.  We need access to interventions in order that when people have acute episodes, they do not have to go to emergency departments, which are packed and unsuitable.  It is the same in any part of the country.  There have to be dedicated areas for people to go when they are unwell, not something like a crowded ward.  I will keep the pressure on.  The beds and staff must be delivered, together with proper community services, to Tipperary, including south Tipperary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900011#J00300","speaker":"1612"},{"type":"speech","time":1607512800,"counter":31,"content":"<p>Mental health is a huge issue in my constituency and throughout the country.  I often say that we concentrated so much on Covid-19 that we took our eye off the ball for people with cancer or mental health stress.  Some say there has been a huge increase in suicide.  A proper register of people with mental health and death by suicide might show that those deaths might be at about the same level as Covid.  Services have almost ground to a halt.  People have been trying to get appointments for their young people who are in mental health distress but have been unable to do so, unfortunately.  West Cork had a fabulous service in Cara Lodge in Enniskeane, which closed about two months ago.<\/p> <p>It is incredible to think that a service like that, which was dealing with young people with stress and mental health issues and which was open for many years, was closed at such a vital time.  Young people with issues relating to drugs misuse also availed of the services provided at Cara Lodge.  It was stated that the opportunity was being taken to look at a different service.  Cara Lodge could certainly have provided by a far different and better service than it was allowed to provide.  The excellent staff of Cara Lodge are now fighting for redundancy packages.  I have received so many emails from young people who had been there and who had emerged the better for it.  Obviously, however, I am talking about a facility in west Cork, an area that does not come on the Government's radar.  I mentioned the matter to the Taoiseach - I should have telephoned Boris Johnson because I would have got a better response - but he did nothing and sat idly by.<\/p> <p> People are dealing with high levels of stress.  During the pandemic, people in rural areas have not been able to go down to their local pub to have a little drink or whatever.  This does cause stress.  There is no reason as to why the rural pubs had to be closed.   Rural pubs could have remained open.  God knows that publicans are the most professional people in the world when it comes to dealing with individuals with mental health issues.  If these pubs had remained open, people would have had a chance to get out and have a break and a chat.  However, they were prevented from doing so.  I have been receiving quite a number of calls from people who are supposed to be getting married and who cannot even have a little music - not dance but music - at their weddings.  That is very sad, particularly in these times.  People have said to me that live music is a great source of relief.<\/p> <p> We then have people who tell me every day of the week that they cannot sleep because of mortgage distress, because they are trying to work with the banks and because they are losing their homes.  Many publicans have informed me that they are trying to work with the banks because their premises are closed.  The banks are just ignoring their pleas and are literally just taking their businesses off them.  These people are at the edge and the State is standing idly by and allowing this to happen.  We closed these people's businesses but we do not assist them in any way other than throwing crumbs to them during these times.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900011#J00400","speaker":"1461","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607513400,"counter":33,"content":"<p>Covid has shown us that mental health issues can arise as a result of people being lonely.

People need to meet.  In that context, they can take personal responsibility and safeguard themselves and the people around them.  The Government should empower people so that they can go out and meet each other in small groups and at small gatherings in, as Deputy Michael Collins just stated, settings like rural pubs.  A publican in a rural area contacted me during the week and stated that his pub is not about drinking, it is about meeting friends, it is a home and it a way in which people can communicate.  This is because that pub is the only thing left open for them.<\/p>  <p>  I am asking the Government, in the context of Christmas, to have a small bit of common sense.  This message is also for Dr. Tony Holohan.  People in rural Ireland and in rural Limerick have common sense and they can take personal responsibility.

I asked what mental health data was being considered and I was told that it would be published.  Since then, I have ascertained that there are essentially two bodies collecting mental health data.  The first of these is National Self-Harm Registry Ireland.  We know that its work ceased during the first lockdown and that it recommenced collecting and collating data at the end of August, both prospectively and retrospectively.  As of now, we know that we only have that data in respect of 45% of hospitals, or 12 of the 36 emergency departments in the country.  I say to the Minister of State that this is simply not good enough.<\/p>  <p>  I have been informed that public health doctors consider mental health data.  Let us not worry that National Self-Harm Registry Ireland is not functioning because there is a HSE national clinical programme for collecting data on patients presenting to emergency departments following self-harm.  That programme is run by the HSE and the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland.  In a parliamentary question I tabled, I specifically asked for the information collected by this programme and I got nothing back.  I presume that public money is being used to facilitate the collection of this data.  I am assuming that there is no data because if there was, I know it would have been provided.  Does the HSE consider it good enough that there is a programme for collecting data which does not collect this data?  As already stated, the programme is jointly run by the HSE and the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland.  We are told, and I believe, that psychiatry is data-led and that it is an empirical science.  Does the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland think it is good enough to proceed without data?  I am of the view that it is simply not good enough.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I want to flag the lack of information on suicide in Ireland.  The reason that we do not have centralised or up-to-date data is because there are 37 coroners' districts but no centralised database.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has to investigate causes of death if a deceased person has not been very recently attended to by a doctor.  In 2000, a review carried out by the then Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform recommended that there be a centralised database for all coroners in Ireland.  That report was produced 20 years ago this month.  I call on the Minister of State to act in respect of the three matters to which I refer, namely, the provision of a centralised database, the position regarding National Self-Harm Registry Ireland and, above all, the national clinical programme which the HSE is running - by means of moneys provided by the taxpayer - in conjunction with the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland and which is not providing any data to anybody.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900012#K00400","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speech","time":1607513400,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies from across the various parties for moving this very important Private Members' motion on mental health and Covid-19.  I echo what my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, said in her opening remarks about this issue being raised during what has been a difficult and distressing period for most people.<\/p>  <p>  As stated at the outset, the Government is not opposing the motion.  In fact, we welcome the opportunity to discuss the very important topic of mental health.  I assure the House that people&rsquo;s physical and mental well-being have been priority considerations for the Government at all times during the pandemic.  This has been reflected in the policies introduced to safeguard the well-being of the entire population, including targeted initiatives for priority groups.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, highlighted many of the initiatives that have been introduced or accelerated as part of the Government&rsquo;s response to Covid-19.  In addition, we have introduced specific, targeted initiatives aimed at dealing with issues affecting vulnerable groups.  For example, the programme for Government contains a commitment to retaining specific actions for improved access to addiction services during Covid-19.  To this end, &euro;480,000 in once-off funding has been provided to support the restoration of drug and alcohol services during Covid-19.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2021 also provides an allocation of &euro;175,000 for initiatives relating to the victims of domestic violence and the LGBTI community.  From this allocation, &euro;50,000 will be provided for online training programmes for health care professionals responding to victims of domestic violence.<\/p>  <p>  The worldwide outbreak of Covid-19 is a source of significant stress, anxiety, worry and fear for many people.  This arises from the disease itself, as well as from impacts such as increased social isolation, disruption to daily life and uncertainty about employment and financial security.<\/p> <p>A number of studies have been conducted in an attempt to measure the impact of Covid-19 on our mental health and well-being.  These include the Healthy Ireland survey, an annual interviewer-administered face-to-face survey commissioned by the Department of Health.  It monitors the health and well-being of people living in Ireland.  It was paused at the commencement of the Covid-19 restrictions because collecting data face to face is not compatible with those restrictions.  The survey fieldwork has started with a new phone questionnaire, with an emphasis on living with Covid-19.  It includes a module on mental health and suicide, and the results will be available next year.  The CSO has published four rounds of its survey on the social impacts of Covid-19 in Ireland.  The results provide data on people's lifestyles and well-being at various stages of the pandemic and levels of restriction.  Results of the surveys can be found on the CSO's website.<br\/><br\/>Additionally, research and a number of studies have been conducted by third-party organisations, including the National Suicide Research Foundation, Mental Health Reform and an international Covid-19 psychological research consortium.  The studies examined the impact of Covid-19 on mental health and well-being, and results of these studies can be accessed by contacting the relevant organisation.  The Government and mental health services have been particularly active in response to the pressures placed on people's mental health due to Covid-19.  In this regard, we recognise the importance of dealing with any non-specialist mental health issues, such as anxiety, before they become more severe.  With this in mind, a cross-party Government well-being campaign, In This Together, promotes resources and initiatives from across government to support health and well-being under Covid-19 restrictions.  In addition, a well-being and resilience campaign was recently launched, under the theme, Keep Well, to promote resilience, physical health and well-being, and positive health.  A sum of &euro;7 million is being invested in this campaign to support initiatives with a range of partners.  Included is a component entitled Keeping in Contact, which includes the Community Call programme.  It is aimed at people who might be experiencing isolation, and it offers befriending services.<br\/><br\/>Simple things like keeping active, staying connected, switching off, being creative, eating well, minding one's mood and socialising, while adhering to social distancing and hygiene guidelines, all help to maintain our mental health.  However, if someone is feeling low, depressed or vulnerable, the Department, in conjunction with the HSE, has developed many telehealth supports.  These may be accessed by contacting the mental health information telephone line 1800 111 888.  Alternatively, they may be accessed online at .  In addition, the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, has circulated a mental health information leaflet to 4,000 schools throughout the country to promote awareness of existing mental health services and supports for children, young people and their families.  It contains many contacts from many of our NGO partners, including Jigsaw, MyMind, BeLonG To and Pieta House.  As mentioned by the Minister of State, it is recognised that vulnerable groups have been disproportionately affected by Covid-19.  In response, the Department of the Taoiseach has established a cross-government group for higher-risk groups to achieve this.<br\/><br\/>Covid-19 has highlighted the vulnerability of people in homelessness and with an addiction.  They comprise a group with complex health needs.  The HSE has established the Covid-19 Dublin homeless response team and has appointed a HSE clinical lead for the Dublin Covid-19 homeless response.  The team co-ordinates the response for the homeless population across the Dublin Region Homeless Executive area.  It must be acknowledged, however, that the impact of Covid-19 on socially excluded groups was greatly minimised by the intensive and collaborate approach of the Government, the HSE and society.  Socially excluded groups in congregated settings are subject to priority action in detection, case management and contact tracing.  A fast-tracked, flexible approach was used for complex cases in these communities.  This enabled rapid action and minimised further spread.<br\/><br\/>The HSE has provided Covid-19 guidance for homeless and vulnerable groups.  The guidance document gives general advice on preventing the spread of Covid-19 in homeless settings and other vulnerable group settings, including direct provision.  In Dublin, more than 1,000 additional beds were provided, and 400 additional beds were put in place in other local authority areas nationally.  The actions being taken in this area are supported by funding provided to the local authorities by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  Furthermore, &euro;5.5 million is being provided to enhance health services for people who are homeless and with an addiction as part of the HSE's winter plan.  This will ensure that the protective public health measures developed during the pandemic will continue for the medically vulnerable homeless population.<br\/><br\/>The interdependence of physical health and mental health is was recognised.  The need for a whole-person approach to achieving the highest possible standards of physical and mental health and well-being has been recognised in formulating our mental health policy, as has the need to support the wider psychological aspects of physical health.  Key to the Government's response to Covid-19 has been enhanced co-operation between the Departments, agencies and NGOs.  I thank all who have assisted in the mitigation of Covid-19 in all settings, particularly where vulnerable members of society live.<br\/><br\/>Next year, the HSE's service plan will reflect prioritised new developments across the health sector.  These will include initiatives to improve the mental health of the nation through well-being programmes.  In addition, the implementation of Sharing the Vision will have an increased impact on all age groups by focusing on mental health promotion, early intervention, acute care, forensic inpatient care and postvention supports in the community.  Greater attention will also paid to improving the integration of mental health and other services, including primary disability services and the judicial sector.  Sharing the Vision recommends the continued implementation of the national strategy and policy for the provision of neuro-rehabilitation services.  I anticipate that this will act as an important enabler in the realisation of Sl&aacute;intecare.<br\/><br\/>Let me address two issues that were raised.  We are carrying out an audit of all mental health beds and capacity throughout the country.  Twenty-nine new staff were secured in budget 2021 to tackle the CAMHS waiting list.  These will be targeted directly at the waiting list.<br\/><br\/>I thank all Members for the opportunity to discuss the important issue of mental health.  I thank them for their input, which will assist us in improving the service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900012#K00600","speaker":"1608","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607514000,"counter":38,"content":"<p>The Government's response to Covid-19 to date has been nothing short of seismic as Ireland borrows billions of euro to protect against the worst outcomes of the pandemic.  Recent positive news regarding the development of a vaccine is pointing the way to an exit from the coronavirus but the lessons of lockdown and its resulting effects will last for a very long time.<\/p>  <p>  Our social fabric has suffered intense change and damage, which can be seen in current and future challenges to business, health access, livelihoods and mental stability.  We have long known about the stigma associated with mental health issues but I doubt if anyone could have predicted the scale or range of the problem, or how isolation, financial hardship, addiction, loneliness, antisocial behaviour, unemployment uncertainty and damage to personal esteem could result in mental health challenges that are so varied and intense for so many.<\/p>  <p>  In truth, our mental health services have always been challenged in trying to look after the chronically unwell.  This has been exacerbated by significant underfunding in services and in capital allocations for many years.  We may not be able to quantify fully the number of people suffering from mental duress but we are aware of many of the situations involved, the cases where mental breakdown, depression or suicidal ideation is occurring.<\/p> <p>We think of the bachelor farmer who can go weeks without interacting with a single human being, the semi-skilled worker realising his well-paid job will never return and the business start-up that has failed and left the promoters with significant personal debt.  We think also of the under-30s who find themselves unable to provide bankable employment such that they can get onto any step of the property ladder and the couples who wish to undertake IVF to begin their families but have no realistic chance of saving the money, thus being denied the gift of parenthood.  We think mostly of the socially vulnerable who have started with a poor hand of cards, many of whom are targeted for drug addiction and migrate into homelessness and endless social exclusion.  Not all of these situations have been created exclusively by Covid-19 but are being exacerbated by it.<\/p> <p> The State's response to these challenges must be as full as the strategy plan devised to combat the coronavirus.  Point 1 of that plan recognised the importance of individual life, regardless of age, and sought to protect it by deploying vast revenues to meet the challenge.  The epidemic of mental illness in this country must also be prioritised and similarly targeted.  A two-track approach to dealing with the mental fallout of Covid-19 should be considered.  For many, this can be achieved through integration with primary care, the GP community and social care concerns, with help from non-governmental organisations, NGOs, as well as social security supports.<\/p> <p> For those suffering more severe mental illness, ongoing institutional supports are needed and capital assets must be expended to meet this need.  In my city of Waterford, our regional mental health acute services consist of a single facility of 44 beds with no access for children beyond emergency overnight admission.  That is a region of 600,000 people and one of the nine model 4 category hospitals in the country.  Underfunding has been a constant refrain for decades in south-east hospital services.  We have had years of promises of capital asset upgrades to our adult mental health services and to provide continuing child psychiatry access.  To date, these promises remain hollow and unfulfilled.<\/p> <p> The Regional Independent Group motion calls for the Government to protect our population's mental health.  It makes many calls on the Government to prioritise, build, implement and deliver.  It also calls on the Government to build our human resource capacity to deliver on mental health and social care.  It asks for mental health to be prioritised as a central part of the Government's continuing response to Covid-19.  It asserts the need for the Government to re-establish a dedicated lead for mental health within the HSE executive function and to ensure that mental health is part of the universal health coverage by including care for mental health, neurological and substance-use disorders.  Most of all, the motion calls on the Government to act based on the core understanding that we cannot value that we which we do not respect, or respect that which we do not value.  It is time for the Government to value the work of our mental health services fully and to show due respect to those who require them.  We cannot solve the national problems of mental health until we understand and adopt the position that we have taken to combatting Covid-19, that is, understanding that we are all in this together.  We need a new, dynamic, co-ordinated response and I would argue that the basis of such a response is contained in this motion, which I commend to the House for approval.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900013#L00200","speaker":"1616","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607514600,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I welcome this important motion and praise the Regional Independent Group for bringing it before the D&aacute;il.  I would like to give a special mention to C&aacute;it Nic Amhlaoibh, who did massive work in the development of this particular motion.  This is a strong motion and, if implemented, would make a radical change to hundreds of thousands of lives around the country.  I also welcome the fact that the Regional Independent Group has done good work in trying to get cross-party support for this motion.  I ask that the Government does not just give a nod to this motion if a vote is required but takes the bull by its horns and implements it.  We would be wrong to think that all of the words that have been articulated in the D&aacute;il with regard to mental health over the years have made a difference in people's lives.  The truth is that we need to put actions where goodwill has been articulated in this Chamber.<\/p><p>I would like to take the lens back a little bit, if I can.  The society that we are building throughout Ireland at the moment is having an increasingly negative impact on mental health.  Families are pressured by work and commuting.  Children have to deal with social media and bullying.  Alcoholism and drug addiction etc. also impact families.  We can add to that the pressures that are now coming from Covid restrictions.  An economic wasteland is developing among many sectors of society that will have an enormous impact on people's lives.  The debt that has been accrued to this society, knowing the Government's track record, will likely lead to austerity over the next number of years which, in itself, will have a shockingly negative aspect on people's lives.  Human interaction and relationships are some of the best ways to deal with mental health issues and they have been taken away from many people in Irish society.<\/p><p>Another aspect of all of this is the fact that the Government is no longer measuring the key indicators in this area.  I have asked a number of key questions of the Minister for Health around suicide rates etc. and he has not been able to answer them.  If one cannot measure, one cannot manage.  I have spoken to NGOs that have told me that there are increasing mental health pressures on families around the country.  I put in a parliamentary question to the Minister on the matter.  He has admitted to me that he has received letters from NGOs which show an increase in mental health pressures and suicide rates during the pandemic.  His response indicates that he has been contacted and that concerns have been expressed about the increase in suicides.  However, the Minister, unfortunately, has not elaborated.  I would like the Ministers of State, Deputies Feighan, also to look into that matter.<\/p><p>The increased restrictions have had an enormous effect on community-based mental health services.  They have had to change radically the way in which they operate by shifting to remote consultations, telephone calls etc.  Many therapies for drug and alcohol addiction have become one step removed from human interactions.  That has significantly reduced their impact.<\/p><p>In the short time I have left, I want to talk about one important element.  Consultants have spoken to me in depth about the fact that there is a shortage of psychiatric beds in Ireland at the moment.  The situation is actually getting worse because Government policy has been to reduce the number of psychiatric beds despite the fact that we already have one of the lowest proportions of beds <i>per capita<\/i>in the developed world.  My county of Meath is a microcosm of that.  Four or five years ago, we had a 24-hour mental health unit in our local hospital.  That was closed by the Fine Gael Government and now the 200,000 people living in the county have to go to County Louth to access services.  We were told that we would be left with a day hospital for mental health services in County Meath but the trend has continued in exactly the same way and that day hospital has been closed in recent times.  People from right across the county have to exit Meath to get to mental health services.  That is a county with probably the fifth highest population in the country.  In real terms, by closing beds, we are sending people into either homelessness or prison.  We are sending them into difficult situations.<\/p><p>I call special attention to older people in our society who have been the most exposed by the Government during this pandemic.  We have lost an enormous number of older people in the past year.  Well over 1,000 older people have died in nursing homes because of the pandemic.  They are under increasing stress and strain and now have to deal with isolation and the lack of human interaction with their families because they do not get the level of visits that they normally would.  They also now have the question of the vaccine coming in front of them.  I ask the Ministers of State, Deputies Feighan and Butler, to do their best to make sure that we get supports to older people so that they can deal with the stresses, strains and threats that they are experiencing within nursing homes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900014#M00200","speaker":"1504"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1607514600,"counter":41,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna \u00f3 Cheannair\u00ed - Leaders' Questions","time":1607515200,"counter":42,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900015#N00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1607515200,"counter":43,"content":"<p>Yesterday I raised with the Taoiseach the refusal of his Government to pay student nurses and midwives who have been working on the front line during this awful pandemic.  I told the Taoiseach of the real anger and frustration felt by these students over the outrageous claim that they do not get paid because they do not do real work.  I conveyed to the Taoiseach, in their own words, the very real work that student nurses and midwives do.  The testimonies I read yesterday show that not only do student nurses and midwives do real work, they do the hardest work.  They treat the sick and injured, often in the most difficult circumstances in understaffed and overcrowded hospitals.  They are often on their feet for 13-hour days, rushing around performing their tasks with professionalism and compassion.<\/p>  <p>  Over the last eight months, student nurses and midwives have worked incredibly hard in the battle against Covid-19 and the Taoiseach should remember that these students have stepped into the breach and it was the Government that asked them to do so.  They have put their health and safety at risk, given up paid work which would pay their bills due to the risk of cross-infection.  They have literally held the hands of dying Covid patients as they took their last breath, when their own family members could not be with them.  Not alone is this real work and hard work, this is heroic work.  Student nurses and midwives have plugged the gaps created by decades of bad health policy from Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  They have been the glue that has held our already strained health service together during the greatest public health emergency in a century.  Their dedication and work have saved lives that might have been lost.  The public knows this and doctors and nurses working with these students know it; the only people who do not seem to get it is the Government.<\/p>  <p>  I put their personal testimonies to the Taoiseach yesterday in the hope he would finally acknowledge their work and, more importantly, commit to paying them and paying them properly.  The Taoiseach refused to do that and gave me some bogus rationale as to why it could not be done.  The truth is that these students are on the roster, they are working and they should be paid.  Surely the Taoiseach can accept that.  As he was refusing to pay these student nurses and midwives, we hear he has delivered pay increases for already well-paid super junior Ministers and judges, along with pension increases for very well-paid former taoisigh.  There is no complexity and no review on that front.  It seems it is always very straightforward to cough up when it comes to those at the top.  Big money for Ministers, judges and the people who once did the Taoiseach's job, but nothing for student nurses and midwives who have given their blood, sweat and tears for the health and safety of our people.  This is shameful and it demonstrates once again whose side Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael are on.  However, the people know who was there for them when it counted and I do not believe they will stand for this awful treatment of student nurses and midwives.  The Taoiseach has a decision to make now.  Will he finally tell these student nurses and midwives that they will be paid?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900015#N00200","speaker":"1466"},{"type":"speech","time":1607515200,"counter":44,"content":"<p>First, we need the truth here.  The Deputy and her party campaigned for the reversal of financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, for years, from 2013 onwards.  FEMPI involved payments to the people the Deputy just outlined.  She knows that, of course, but it suits her to twist and distort the truth about the reversal of FEMPI cuts.  Legally, in terms of those cuts, one cannot discriminate between one group and another.  However, one can delay as far as legally possible, which is what the Government has done.  In 2017, legislation passed by this House, which the Deputy participated in, meant that by the end of December, the remaining FEMPI cuts had to be reversed in respect of the small group left.  At the time, if it had been done in 2016, it would have meant the same thing that is happening today would have happened four or five years earlier.  It was delayed deliberately because they were on the higher end of the scale.<\/p>  <p>  On student nurses, I never said they are not doing real work.  I never used that phrase yet the Deputy comes in here and says I did.  In terms of the testimonies the Deputy and other Deputies have brought forward, they should be forwarded to me and the HSE because, in some instances, they represent an abuse and exploitation of student nurses.  What I said yesterday in the D&aacute;il was not bogus.  The Deputy has deliberately avoided the question of whether we want a degree programme or an apprentice model.  Her line seems to be it is okay to go back to the era when nurses did menial tasks and were on the bottom rung of the ladder in our hospitals and in the medical hierarchy, deferring to consultants and so on.  The idea of the introduction of a degree programme was to end that era, professionalise nursing and give opportunities in nurse education so nurses could take their rightful place in the overall structures within our health services.  That was the objective and the idea behind that was that first year students would have clinical placements of six weeks at a time.  They were never meant to be working during those six weeks.  If nurses are rostered for a 13- or ten-hour shift, they should be paid.  Nursing directors in hospitals are disputing that and the Minister for Health is investigating that.<\/p>  <p>  There is a core question here.  In my view, nurse education is vital for the progression and advancement of the profession so that nurses can take their rightful place in the overall framework within our hospitals.  The cases referenced yesterday should be sent in and there should be an investigation because no first year student should be treating a Covid patient, which I have said repeatedly.  If the Deputy has evidence that they are treating dying Covid patients, in my view, that is wrong.  That is an abuse.  No hospital and no director of nursing should enable that to take place, particularly in the second wave of Covid, which did not have the same impact as the first wave on hospitalisations or ICU occupancy.<\/p>  <p>  We are not refusing to pay anybody.  We have initiated a review of the allowances, which will be finished by the end of this month and will result in higher allowances for student nurses.  We have applied the pandemic unemployment payment to student nurses who cannot work part time in other workplaces because of the fear of cross-contamination.  We have also provided other financial supports to meet additional costs as a result of working in a Covid environment.  That is our commitment but we also want to ring-fence student nurses from having to work in the first place.  Does the Deputy accept that principle in relation to the nursing degree programme?  I would like a clear statement from her in relation to that principle and its implementation with regard to the degree programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900015#N00300","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1607515200,"counter":45,"content":"<p>Here are the truths.

The only abuse at play here is the abuse of not paying these student nurses and midwives for their honest effort and work.  The Taoiseach says he is not refusing to pay them.  The only logical conclusion, then, is that he will pay them but to pay them he must recognise their work and effort.

She knows that, but she chooses not to say it.  She also has refused and ignored my central point.  She says that we cannot have an alibi, but it is not an alibi.  She has to make up her mind about how we can create a learning environment for nursing in the modern era.  I do not believe it is right that nursing degree students should have to do menial tasks left, right and centre outside their clinical placements and I do not believe the health service has to depend on a six-week clinical placement for first year students or second year students to support the service.  Personnel nurse managers are employed and specifically paid to ring-fence students from having to work and ensure that they are learning while in the hospitals.  Fourth year nursing students get paid.  That is also being reviewed in terms of looking at an upward increase.

This time last year, we were facing into a general election where we knew that health and housing would be significant issues, and they were.  Health has been front and centre all year and there is greater public understanding of the need for a functioning health service, a proper number of ICU beds, proper bed capacity, etc.  However, the housing crisis has not received the same attention this year.  One of the most important things for society is citizens having secure roofs over their heads.  While a substantial housing budget has been approved for 2021, how it will be spent is critical.<\/p>  <p>  I am increasingly seeing new builds being long leased.  Instead of the State acquiring housing under Part V agreements, it is in some cases accepting 25-year leases on a 90% of market rent, four-year review basis.  At the end of the 25 years, the properties revert to their developers.  This appears to be the most expensive way of delivering social housing with no asset at the end.  Essentially, the State is paying the mortgage on a new house for the mortgage's duration after which ownership will revert to the developer.  What happens then?<\/p>  <p>  This is not only happening in respect of Part V housing.  New estates are being long leased.  In some parts of the country, they are being acquired by housing associations and local authorities.  According to information I received in response to a recent parliamentary question, there were 2,600 leases last year and the average cost was &euro;13,000 per annum.  Assuming that cost remains the same over 25 years, it equates to &euro;845 million, which is not too far short of &euro;1 billion, with no assets at the end.<\/p>  <p>  A spending review published by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform last month showed that it could be up to 30% more cost efficient for a local authority to build its own housing instead of buying ready-built turnkey units.  When the housing assistance payment, HAP, was introduced more than six years ago, some of us warned that if it was not accompanied by a large public housing building programme, it would become unsustainable.  HAP was introduced as a short-term measure, but there is no timeline for phasing it out.  Realistically, that will only happen when there is sufficient housing stock.<\/p>  <p>  Large sums are being spent on homelessness.  For years, many functioning families and individuals have experienced homelessness, with significant evidence of developmental delays for children and high stress levels for all involved.  Dublin City Council's spending on homelessness has grown as the problem has grown, but the issue is not confined to Dublin.  This spending represents approximately 20% of the council's budget for next year.<\/p>  <p>  Will the spending review by the Department help to change the policy on direct builds?  Will the Government undertake a review of the 25-year lease policy as a matter of urgency?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900016#O01000","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speech","time":1607515800,"counter":56,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising the issue.  The lack of housing supply across the board remains a major crisis in our society.  As a result of that, I have chaired a number of housing Cabinet subcommittees, all designed to try to break up the bottlenecks and move things on as fast as we possibly can both legislatively and in terms of various projects.  From the July stimulus onwards, for example, we have moved very quickly to get up to 2,500 voids back into a habitable condition prior to the end of this year.  That has gone very well.<\/p>  <p>  Overall, as the Deputy knows, budget 2021 provided for an unprecedented level of funding to housing problems next year, with approximately &euro;3.3 billion available for housing delivery in 2021.  That will deliver 12,750 new social homes next year.  Of that, a record 9,500 will be new build homes.  A total of 2,450 homes will be delivered through a range of lease schemes, including repair and lease, mortgage-to-rent and enhanced leasing while a further 15,800 households will be supported through HAP and the rental accommodation scheme, RAS.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the specific leasing scheme that the Deputy has identified, I will check that out.  We have asked the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, and I have asked the Minister - he is doing this - to look at every available option in the short term to acquire housing but, predominantly, to build.  This is being done to get homelessness down first of all.  In the context of Covid, with properties becoming available in different ways, there is an opportunity to, for example, acquire properties in the short term for single people who are homeless.  That will help us to eat into the waiting list for homeless people.  The Minister has gone all out with the various agencies and his Department's unit to do that.  There is also social housing.<\/p>  <p>  Then there is affordable housing.  Significant funding has been allocated for affordable housing measures, including the shared equity scheme, the cost-rental equity loan facility, the serviced sites initiative and so forth.<\/p>  <p>  One of the biggest challenges we have is capacity to deliver.  That goes right through planning, right through development.  I must honestly say that there will be many different schemes and many different approaches.  It will not be one-size-fits-all.  There is no silver bullet in terms of one particular model that will solve all of our housing problems.  In my view, what is required is a multifaceted approach and different models of providing housing.  I was at a Co-operative Housing Ireland estate on Monday, a fantastic scheme of 60 plus houses that it developed - they are social housing - in Carrigaline.

The Taoiseach has since insulted them by suggesting that they are not doing real work and that he is protecting their education, when we have repeatedly given him dozens of testimonies from those student nurses and midwives about the extent of their work, about how they are being exploited in terms of working with Covid-19 patients, getting Covid-19 themselves, working with the sick, the dying and mothers giving birth and about the number of hours they work.  The Taoiseach has also insulted them by suggesting that they are getting allowances when huge numbers of them are not getting allowances at all.  Even if they do get them, those allowances would not cover their accommodation or travel costs.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has added the final insult by refusing to pay the student nurses and midwives who protected us on the front line of the Covid-19 pandemic and signing off on an unbelievable restoration of pensions and of increases of up to &euro;15,000 for former taoisigh and civil servants who are in already in receipt of payments in excess of &euro;100,000.  That is simply shocking beyond belief.  In doing this, the has further insulted those to whom I refer by betraying the promise in the section of the programme for Government relating to healthcare workers in which it is stated that the Government would reward our healthcare workers for the work they have done on the front line of Covid-19 and for their dedication and professionalism.  He has betrayed what he said directly to me in this House on 20 October to the effect that he would return them to the healthcare assistant, HCA, rate of pay which had been agreed during the period of Covid-19 earlier in the year.  In fact, the first thing the Government did after penning the words in the programme for Government was to take that HCA rate off them.  The Taoiseach should stop with the spin, stop believing the fantasy he is being told by the HSE and listen to the voices of the student nurses and midwives.<\/p>  <p>  Will the Taoiseach reinstate the HCA rate that was given to the student nurses and midwives earlier in the year and that he took back from them as one of his first actions in office?  Will he dispense with the nonsense that there is a choice between getting paid and getting a degree?  Even in Britain, nurses pursuing degree courses get significant bursaries and do not have to pay excessive fees.

I do not go about trying to insult people.  The Deputy referred to the cases raised by him, Deputy Paul Murphy and others yesterday.  I told him he should send details of those cases to the HSE in the form of complaints that require investigation.  It was stated here yesterday that a student nurse had to console a mother at the bedside of her dead baby.  If that happened, it demands an investigation because that is an abuse of a student nurse clinical placement.  It should not have happened.  That is not spin.  I have spoken to nurse educators across the country.  I have been making a fundamental point in this regard.  I made it yesterday and I make it again today.  I believe in what I am saying because I brought in the programme in the first instance.  If we want to change the programme and go back to the apprenticeship model, well and good; let us say that.  I am genuinely of the view, however, that this would be a retrograde step for nursing.<\/p><p>Of course, Deputy Boyd Barrett juxtaposes this matter, as only he can, with the final of the reversal of the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI.  That reversal was something he wanted to happen in 2016.  He put a motion to the D&aacute;il at that time to the effect that the FEMPI Act be repealed in its entirety.  Does the Deputy know the implications of that?  It would have paid the higher earners and higher pensioners back in 2016.  If he had his way, they would have had their pension cuts reversed back in 2016 and not 2021, which is now the case.  The only reason the Minister of Public Expenditure and Reform brought that in was because he had no legal alternative but to do so on foot of the Act that was passed in 2017.  The latter states that the longest this reversal could be put off was to December 2020 and then a date would have to be named for the final reversal of FEMPI.<\/p><p>Maybe a bit of honesty in the debate would not go amiss from Deputy Boyd Barrett's perspective.  He loves playing the divisive card and pitting one group against another.  He wanted FEMPI ended in its entirety back in 2016 and stated that it was one of the hallmarks of repressive regimes, even dictatorships.  He wanted it all gone in 2016, irrespective of high earners or low learners within the public service.  The fact is that the reversal for highest earners have been delayed the longest period possible.  I have the quotes from the Deputy.  I went through his quotes at the time in the D&aacute;il and in <i>The Irish times<\/i>.  That was his position.<\/p><p>Coming back to the student nurses, the same applies to medical students, who have far more clinical placement hours.  The same applies to pharmacology students, radiography students, physiotherapy students and occupational students.  This goes to the heart of the model of education we want for healthcare personnel and professionals at all levels and in different disciplines.  It is not as simple as the Deputy was trying to make out.<\/p><p>In the first wave, the HCA rate was paid because student nurses were formally brought on to fill rosters and to work.  We have been told by nursing directors and the HSE that did not occur in the second wave of the pandemic and that the nurse education aspects of the clinical placements must be protected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900017#P00400","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1607516400,"counter":62,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900017#P00500","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1607516400,"counter":63,"content":"<p>Surely, the Deputy would agree that first, second or third year students should not have to do the kind of work mentioned by the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900017#P00600","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1607516400,"counter":64,"content":"<p>Taoiseach, we are over time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900017#P00700","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1607516400,"counter":65,"content":"<p>He keeps ignoring that point I made to him.

As the national broadband plan is being rolled out, there are problems with regard to tree-cutting, the polers and even the guys putting up the wires, although hopefully those problems can be overcome.  It is unusual to hear contractors say that as bad as Eir was when they were working for that company, this crowd does not seem to be organised at all.  That is despite &euro;7 million having been spent, according to an article in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>yesterday, on oversight to do this properly.  Hopefully, over the coming months it will be got right.<\/p><p>In 2017, we were all invited to Ballinasloe, where Enet and SSE were rolling out broadband.

That was great, and people from different backgrounds jumped up and down.  I have seen so many quotations welcoming this great announcement by the spin doctoring of the previous Government.<\/p><p>Garbally College, a fine college in Ballinasloe, is located beside Scoil U&iacute; Cheithearnaigh, an Irish-speaking school that has 204 youngsters.

It gets 2 Mbps.  The Department, in fairness to it, has sent the school laptops and all the gear that is required.  It is like sending somebody the shell of a car without the engine; that is what has happened.<\/p><p>To put it simply, because I know a bit about this, broadband can be brought along a duct within 50 yd from three different sides.

We have been working with the Department involved with a view to seeing whether we can do something additional to ensure that schools in particular are connected properly and that they have access to the highest level of connectivity.  I do not have the specifics on the case the Deputy identified but what he outlined is not good and needs to be dealt with.  He referred to an event in 2017, which was three years ago, when he was told that Ballinasloe would have the fasted broadband anywhere in the world.  Clearly, that has not yet happened.  The national broadband contract was signed in November 2019, two years after that event.<\/p>  <p>  The intervention area covers 1.1 million people, 540,000 premises and 100,000 businesses and farms, along with 695 schools.  I do not know whether National Broadband Ireland, NBI, is the other crowd he referred to, in respect of there being one service provider versus another.  The design work, we are told, is complete or ongoing in target townlands in every county, with 137,000 premises surveyed as of 3 December.  The first fibre-to-home connections are expected shortly in Carrigaline and will be subject to technical testing and validation prior to a wider release in the area.  I am told that to ensure swift network roll-out, NBI is taking on more subcontractors and negotiating revised timelines where possible with all third parties involved in the build.  Broadband connection points are a key element of the NBP, providing high-speed broadband.<\/p>  <p>  As of 3 December, some 217 broadband connection points had been installed by NBI and 59 of these are now connected with high-speed broadband through a service provider contract with Vodafone, which is managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development.  Each local authority is also playing a critical part in the selection and enablement of these broadband connection points, with a broadband officer appointed in each county to help communities.  In addition, school broadband connection points are being provided with high-speed broadband for educational use only, through a service provider contract managed by the Department of Education.  To date, 25 schools have been connected with high-speed broadband for educational access.  The budget allocated &euro;210 million to the roll-out of the national broadband plan.<\/p>  <p>  As I said earlier, I am interested in accelerating the schools programme and perhaps carrying out a discrete school-based initiative to ensure that we can advance and accelerate the programme in respect of schools.

Issues relevant to the transport sector can arise, as required, at a number of Cabinet committees, including the Cabinet committee on economic recovery and investment.<\/p><p>The Government continues to invest in our national infrastructure.  This is evidenced by the commitment of capital allocation of more than &euro;10 billion in budget 2021, making public investment in Ireland one of the highest <i>per capita<\/i>in the EU.  Specifically, the budget 2021 allocation for the Department of Transport is &euro;3.5 billion, which includes &euro;1.8 billion funding announced for sustainable transport, cycling, walking and greenways, and &euro;1.3 billion for national, regional and local roads.  This will ensure that our transport network continues to grow sustainably into the future, providing viable and affordable transport options, while also working to meet our climate and environmental objectives.  Issues relating to the economy and to transport are, of course, regularly discussed at full Cabinet meetings, where all formal decisions are made.<\/p><p>With regard to the forthcoming national economic plan, significant initiatives will be taken in terms of continuing the unprecedented supports the Government has provided for businesses and through income supports across the economy.  It is also looking at new areas for economic opportunity in terms of digital transformation, for example, particularly in the public services and our health service, given we need to transform the health service electronically and from a digital perspective.<\/p> <p> It is also about investment in the green economy, where there are opportunities to create jobs in retrofitting, for example, in enhanced investment in sewage treatment plants, in enhancing our environment and in alternative and innovative farming in respect of the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and in providing funding opportunities for farming with regard to forestry, native species and so on.

As he did not have an opportunity to respond as time ran out, I would be grateful if he could clarify the Government position today.<\/p>  <p>  Covid-19 has created new challenges for the workforce and exacerbated existing inequities.  Remote working has created significant advantages.  However, there is a flip side that needs to be recognised and addressed.  Research shows that remote workers are at greater risk of being overlooked for training and promotional opportunities.  The new EU directive on work-life balance gives workers a right to be flexible and remote working for carers and parents.  The concern is that by limiting the right to this cohort of workers, the take-up will come primarily from women.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions has recommended that the right to flexible work, when transposed into domestic law, be extended to all workers to avoid unintentional but very real negative consequences.  Will the Government give consideration to that?<\/p>  <p>  A call for a new deal for retail and distribution workers has also been launched.  Women working in these sectors can earn up to 19% less than their male counterparts.  As the Taoiseach knows, Ireland has the third highest rate of low pay in the European Union, with a median wage of just &euro;313 a week for staff in the accommodation and food sectors.  Retail and distribution workers account for 19% of all workers in receipt of the housing assistance payment, HAP.  Ireland is ranked second worst among OECD countries for housing affordability and equally high costs associated with childcare compound excessive living costs for those on very modest incomes.  Furthermore, the absence of collective bargaining rights further restricts the ability of workers and their trade unions to secure fair pay.  Economic strategies must incorporate enhanced rights for these workers including the right to a living wage, protections to ensure decent work and, finally, providing for the right to collective bargaining.  <\/p>  <p>  There have been fundamental shifts in the world of work and a renewed societal premium attached to front-line services.  This needs to be reflected in enhanced terms and conditions, as well as legislative and workplace rights.  I ask that the Taoiseach and his Ministers actively and constructively engage on these matters in the time ahead because we need integrated economic strategies that mainstream workers' rights.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900024#W00400","speaker":"1466"},{"type":"speech","time":1607520600,"counter":191,"content":"<p>I ask the Taoiseach whether the Cabinet has had a discussion on the newly revamped Irish Aviation Authority and the appointment of its new CEO.

The national economic plan will deal with that when we publish it next week because it is about economic recovery, and also about understanding the changes that are occurring, particularly with technology and remote working.  There may also be opportunities for job creation and economic renewal from the green economy and digital transitions.  Those twin areas have been accelerated because of the pandemic.  As the Deputy said, they will bring profound changes to the workplace, our economy and our way of life.  We need to reorientate our approach and policies on that.  The transition to a low-carbon economy, for example, will see all sectors of the economy and wider society undergo radical change, and will require significant investment, research and innovation, new ways of producing goods and consuming, and changes in the way we work, use transport and live together.  We will have to bring in protections for workers who are working remotely, particularly making sure that their promotional opportunities are not undermined as a result of that.<\/p>  <p>  Technology is profoundly changing our society and economy.

The Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, and Department of Health have provided a great deal of data through the Covid-19 data hub.  In addition, economic and other data are relevant to understanding the impact of restrictions, whether supports are needed and if they are effective.  My Department, working with the HSE and its contractors, Ernst &amp;amp; Young, the CSO and a number of other Departments, has drawn together existing data outputs to maximise the insights that can be gained.<\/p> <p>This builds on the existing strong work across Government Departments to better inform the cross-Government Covid-19 response.  The objective is to integrate data and insights across a variety of internal and external sources.  In addition to the epidemiological update and advice from NPHET some findings include that there is a direct correlation between the number of contacts that people have had and the rate of the transmission of the disease.  Differences between wave 1 and wave 2, including the shift in recorded outbreaks from being led by nursing homes in wave 1 to being led by private households in wave 2, contributes to a reduction of 15 years in the median age of identified cases from wave 1 to wave 2.<br\/><br\/>Excess mortality between March and September is estimated to be between 876 and 1,192.  The 65+ age group account for 13% of the population but 92% of Covid-19 deaths.  The 80+ age group account for circa 3% of the population but 64% of Covid-19 deaths.  Social gatherings of citizens, congregations and specific local events all appear to have contributed to wave 2 outbreaks.  The introduction of level 3 nationally did not reduce the 14-day incidence rate per 100,000 people for the majority of counties.  Following the introduction of further household restrictions, which we will call level 3 max, from mid-October saw a reduction across most counties.  Wet pubs opened in all counties except Dublin in late September.  This also coincided with universities opening together with specific sporting events.  The 14-day disease incidence rate per 100,000 people started to increase ten days later in every county.  This increase was not seen to the same extent in Dublin.  The local electoral area, LEAs, in which both University College Cork and the National University of Ireland Galway are located both saw higher increases than the rest of their county when the universities opened.  This difference was reduced when the universities went online.  Wet pubs also opened in both cities on the same week that the universities opened.<br\/><br\/>My Department does not have a unit or any assigned officials with exclusive responsibility for collating and analysing data with regard to Covid-19.  The senior officials group and the Covid-19 oversight group have worked to provide insights to the Cabinet committee and to Government to understand and assess the impacts of the pandemic and the impacts of the restrictions imposed to manage it.  This work has been going on throughout the pandemic with inputs from across Government.  Data insights from NPHET, the Central Statistics Office, the Department of Finance and Ernst &amp;amp; Young, EY, which informed the Cabinet&rsquo;s recent meetings were published on<i>gov.ie<\/i>.  They complement the ongoing public health, economic and social impact assessments which have been undertaken on an ongoing basis over the period, all of which have been published on <i>gov.ie<\/i>.  My Department has not engaged any consultancy firms to advise on Covid-19-related matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900025#X03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607521800,"counter":233,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach and call Deputy Paul Murphy now to speak.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900026#Y00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1607521800,"counter":234,"content":"<p>Briefly, to respond to a question asked me by the Taoiseach in the last set of questions, where he suggested that it was not clear to him whether I was in favour of a university model for nurses or not, to be clear I am absolutely in favour and am opposed to the big exploitation of student nurses which is currently going on.  We would not be talking about that or the Taoiseach would not be talking about investigating it were it not for the organisation of the student nurses and Solidarity-People Before Profit bringing forward our motion.<\/p>  <p>  I will also re-ask a direct question to the Taoiseach, given that he accepts that fourth year students do work.  Does he think that they should be paid more than they currently are?  Does he accept that they are currently paid less than the minimum wage and should be paid at least the living wage?<\/p>  <p>  How much money was spent on EY&rsquo;s analysis and how much did it cost the State?  Why did this Government feel it necessary to pay for an outside group of private consultants when we have public health experts?  Surely, we have public health experts who are capable of analysing these figures and if not surely we should be investing in building that public health capacity as opposed to outsourcing it in the future.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, after the Government paid for that advice, why did it not take EY&rsquo;s advice on restaurants, in particular?  If one looks at slide No. 27, it has a section which draws on US research from Stanford University and talks about places of interest, POI, categories ranked in decreasing order of associated additional infections.  The number one worst category for Covid-19 infections was full-service restaurants.

The Government tells us we have to do the research when presenting the Taoiseach with the evidence around the exploitation of student nurses and midwives.  It is beyond bizarre.  For the record, and the Taoiseach&rsquo;s consultants or press people could do some research on this, in Britain student nurses used to get paid &pound;15,000 with no fees, as a bursary while they were students.  The Tories cut that and in the years following a massive crisis of recruitment and retention ensued which is still persisting in the NHS.  Even the right-wing Tory, Boris Johnson, has reintroduced significant cash payment bursaries and the waiving of fees for student nurses and midwives in degree programmes.  If the Taoiseach wants the answer to the question that he asked, we want degrees with payments for placements and no extortionate fees if one wants to recruit and retain the nurses that we need in the health service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900026#Y00500","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1607521800,"counter":236,"content":"<p>I call Deputy McDonald.

The review will be finished by the end of this month and will determine that students in fourth year are paid for the 36-week internship during which they are in hospitals.  I reiterate that model has worked and in respect of the point made by Deputy Boyd Barrett, the actual numbers applying for the degree programme is very healthy and is oversubscribed every year.<\/p>  <p>  On the data analytics, the HSE has retained EY which has worked with our Department on this, along with separate work by the Central Statistics Office, NPHET and by different Departments in respect of the economy, including the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform.  The data analytics was additional to this and was helpful and informative.  The Government is committed to this.  I do not have the costs here with me on EY&rsquo;s contract with the HSE but these can be ascertained.<\/p>  <p>  On investment in public health, the Government has committed to substantial investment in that area and to a doubling the number of people working in public health.  The funding for this has been provided in the budget and the Government is also committed to creating public health consultant posts.  That is going through a particular process right now.<\/p>  <p>  On Deputy Murphy&rsquo;s point in respect of restaurants, not all of the international experience is applicable to the Irish context.  That said, we have always said there is a balance to be arrived at in respect of the decisions that we make in lifting restrictions.  NPHET&rsquo;s advice was perhaps to allow an additional household to visit and not to open restaurants.  We took the view that we would retain the restriction on the visits to households until 18 December and to open restaurants.  We believe that there are a number of dimensions here.  People need to get out of their homes in some shape or form.  We have had people under very severe restrictions for six weeks.  It is not possible to keep people under restrictions for too long a period.<\/p> <p>With regard to economic activity, it is important that people have an opportunity to go back to work, particularly for a key period of the year when they and the businesses concerned have an opportunity to earn and keep the enterprises viable, thereby securing employment in the sector into the future.  Otherwise, there would be continued wholesale unemployment.  Many in the restaurant sector would be out of work as a result of the continued closure.<\/p> <p> On Deputy Boyd Barrett's point, we are revising the allowances and also the bursaries.

I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  I have no problem taking a representation on behalf of the person in SOS from the Deputy and talking to her about it.  I thank her for raising this important issue and giving me the opportunity to outline the position in regard to the resumption of adult day services and transport in community health organisation, CHO, 5, encompassing south Tipperary, Carlow, Kilkenny, Waterford and Wexford.  Adult day services reopened throughout August and early September at approximately 39% capacity and, as the Deputy will be well aware, I have secured the funding to increase day services by an average of one day a week for more than 14,000 adult day service users.<\/p>  <p>  Some service providers are now working so that the services operate safely and in line with public health guidelines.  This has led to a reduced capacity in day services due to the need for social distancing, the physical limitations of buildings and a lack of mainstream community activities currently available.  The public health guidelines, which were developed to underpin the safe reopening of adult day services, have also had an impact on the transport to day services.  Although the HSE has no statutory obligation to provide transport services, some transport supports are provided by the HSE or funded through agencies on a discretionary basis.  This can include services themselves providing transport and local transport such as Local Link.  In general, disability service users are in receipt of a disability allowance and are automatically entitled to a free pass.  Now that day services have reopened, the availability of safe transport is essential.<\/p> <p>However, reduced capacity on vehicles means more journeys are needed to and from service locations for those that need it.  As the service has resumed, transport providers have had to demonstrate that their services can be provided as safely as possible and with strict adherence to social distancing guidelines.<\/p> <p> The Deputy raised the issue of Cumas in New Ross, which I visited in recent months.  During my visit, I met with the providers in the company of Deputy Browne and Senator Byrne.  They raised, no more than the good Deputy has done today, the issue of transport.  I am glad to confirm that Cumas was allocated &euro;147,652 at the end of November to address the transport issues that have been raised with me since September.  This will be allocated in the December payment to the provider.  This is once-off additional funding for transport from within the current budget for disabilities services and additional moneys I secured in September to support the resumption of services.<\/p> <p> I understand the issue with that individual case and I have no problem working with the Deputy on it.  The Deputy asked if I would meet with the families and of course I will.  I will be more than happy to take part in a Zoom call in the company of other Oireachtas colleagues who would like to be on it.  This is also an important opportunity for the Deputy and other Oireachtas Members in the area to meet with the CHO 5 to understand the funding allocation, the roll-out and the support they will give to service providers going into the new year in order that we can have a sustainable resumption of services and the proper link, which is the transport piece, to assure the families that the connectivity they require is in place, particularly in light of the fact that there is &euro;145,000 set aside for transport.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900028#FF00600","speaker":"1484","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607523300,"counter":256,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

They have been continuously campaigning on the matters the Deputy has raised in the context of transport, the vastness of the area and the need for it.  In that context, I have also met with the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and his officials on this issue.  I made that meeting on the basis of what the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, presented to me concerning a very well-run LocalLink service in the area.  As part of Connecting Ireland, we are looking at one of the first models we will roll out will be in that area because of the good services that are there already in relation to LocalLink.  It is still being put through its paces to see where it will sit and how it will run but when one starts, one starts with one of the better models, which is in the Carlow area.  We would hope to expand it into other areas and to include disabilities services.<\/p>  <p>  We have, right across the country, a very good LocalLink service.  LocalLink is 85% suitable for persons with disabilities to use and we now need to ensure that a person with a disability can get on the LocalLink vehicle.

As the Acting Chair said, NESC, which is a social partnership body, has underlined how the LDA will be a game-changer in tackling our housing crisis.  As outlined by the Acting Chair and as many in the House will know, it can act as a State developer and will confront much of the dysfunctional, private developer-led development that has scarred some of this country.  It will do that by assembling lands in strategic areas, purchasing lands strategically and using State lands.  It will master plan compact sustainable urban development in these areas, break the hold of hoarders who have held much of the land and kept the land price too high, blend public and private finance so we get efficiency of cost delivery at scale and consult affordability head on.<\/p>  <p>  These are important benefits that it can unleash.  However, its potential will be killed at source if we continue to see the ideological, hard-left policy position that was exposed recently in the refusal of Dublin City Council to allow a development at Oscar Traynor Road to go ahead.  That would comprise 853 badly needed homes for the community in that area.  The reason they insist on turning that away is they do not want integrated development on public lands.  I profoundly disagree.  We need integrated development.  Where we have had single-type development, even in our own area, it has not been successful.  Look at the Ballymun flats, which had to be pulled down, or Darndale, which had to be radically transformed within 20 years of its construction.  They also refuse to recognise that the State must seek to support everyone who needs homes: those who want to acquire affordable homes and buy a home for themselves, those who want cost rental, those who want private homes and those who want social housing.<\/p>  <p>  The Oscar Traynor Road project was exemplary in the approach taken.  It was a master plan developed in the four years since 2016.  It would have ensured the provision of well-deserved facilities, including childcare facilities, public parks, retail opportunities and so on.  The Oscar Traynor Road site adjoins a school.  The plan involved a balanced mix, with 30% social housing, 20% affordable housing for purchase, 25% cost rental and 25% private housing.<\/p>  <p>  In a transparent attempt almost two days after the decision was made, Sinn F&eacute;in sought to justify what happened by putting forward a misrepresentation of the comparative cost of direct build by Dublin City Council and the approach taken in respect of Oscar Traynor Road.  The reality is that developing by means of direct build would have been &euro;80,000 more expensive if done by the city council than under the programme developed in the master plan.  That was available to all the councillors at the time but there was an attempt to muddy the waters.<\/p>  <p>  We need to see the process relating to the LDA being accelerated.  The LDA can be transformative but it must cater to all needs and break the problem of affordable purchase for many people.  I ask the Minister to sit down with the NESC and discuss how the LDA can achieve its potential.  It is a balanced social partnership and it recognises that some of the approach advocated by left-wing parties will undermine its value.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900029#GG00500","speaker":"1549"},{"type":"speech","time":1607523900,"counter":260,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and giving me the opportunity to update the House on the LDA and its role in the use of State lands.  The programme for Government commits to the State playing a greater role in providing affordable and social homes, with a focus on low and middle-income earners and developing sustainable mixed-tenure communities.  These principles guide housing policy as well as the agency's work in assembling strategic sites in urban areas and ensuring the sustainable development of social and affordable homes for rent and purchase.  This will include ensuring that the public housing rental stock on public lands is under the control of local authorities, approved housing bodies or similar bodies.  The programme for Government provides that any State land being offered for sale would automatically be offered first to the LDA.  This would mean that, if such lands could be acquired by the agency, it would ensure that they remained in the State's ownership and were used to provide appropriate housing in line with the agency's mandate.<\/p>  <p>  The agency was established on an interim basis in September 2018 by way of an establishment order.  A revised general scheme of the Land Development Agency Bill to establish the agency as a commercial State agency was approved by Government order in October for priority drafting.  It is intended that the legislation will be published shortly.  My Department is working closely with the Office of the Attorney General on this draft legislation to ensure that the agency is given all the necessary powers to carry out its functions in line with those envisaged in the recently published NESC report.<\/p>  <p>  The Land Development Agency has an immediate focus on managing the State's lands to develop new homes and regenerate underutilised sites in the long term.  It will assemble strategic land banks from a mix of public and private lands, making these available for housing in a controlled manner that brings essential long-term stability to the housing market.  Along with its initial eight sites, the agency is working in partnership with local authorities to develop a master plan at a range of strategic sites, for example, the Shanganagh Castle site.  The agency, in partnership with D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, has been granted planning permission for the development of 597 homes on that site.  It is intended that approximately 34% of the units in the development will be for social housing, 51% will be for cost rental and 15% will be for affordable purchase.<\/p>  <p>  The tenure mix of sites will be considered on a site-by-site basis, taking into account the need to counteract undue segregation in the housing of persons from different social backgrounds.  In addition, mixed tenures can help foster the organic growth of sustainable mixed communities.<\/p>  <p>  As part of its remit, the LDA is working to develop an inventory of all relevant public lands to allow for the better management of, and strategic planning in respect of, these assets and the unlocking of their urban regeneration potential.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge the role played by the former Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, in outlining the vision for the agency and devising it as a key tool for delivering social and affordable homes in mixed tenures on behalf of the State.  This will provide high-quality homes for our citizens.  The NESC report shines a light on how we can develop this process and the powers that the agency needs to be given to make a substantial impact on the housing market.  I would have no issue with the Department and the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, meeting the NESC, given that the council is an important actor in this process.

That legacy is most acutely felt by the families of the 3,700 people killed in that violence in Northern Ireland.  It is apparent that their killing continues to have a significant impact on the politics of Northern Ireland and this country.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that we recognise that the dead of Northern Ireland are frequently referred to for the purpose of making a political point.  That is perfectly legitimate.  When unionists or loyalists refer to those who were killed by the Provisional IRA, they need to be listened to respectfully and carefully.  Similarly, when republicans and nationalists refer to people who were killed by loyalist paramilitaries or the British state, they need to be listened to carefully and respectfully.<\/p>  <p>  However, we need to recognise that there is an objective and purpose in trying to ensure that we can commemorate all 3,700 people who were killed during the Troubles in a way that is free from a political narrative.  In many instances, the dead are being invoked for a particular political purpose.  There is nothing wrong with that, but legacy issues have become part of the territory upon which political division in Northern Ireland now operates.<\/p>  <p>  When we consider the 3,700 people who were killed during the Troubles, we can all recognise and accept that each of them deserves to be remembered.<\/p> <p>When we go further and state why they need to be remembered, we can get into difficulty.  Were we to say that each one of them died needlessly, that becomes an issue of political dispute.  I believe, therefore, we can all agree that each one of the 3,700 people deserves to be remembered respectfully.  We can also agree that collective memory will assist in reconciliation.  We can see in Northern Ireland that, unfortunately, reconciliation has not been achieved to the level we would wish.<br\/><br\/>I tabled this Topical Issue matter because there is a monument to the 3,700 people who were killed in Northern Ireland, namely, a book called <i>Lost Lives: The Stories of the Men, Women and Children who Died as a Result of the Northern Ireland Troubles<\/i>, which was published for the first time in 1999 as a result of considerable work by five  journalists, led by Mr. David McKittrick.<br\/><br\/>I read an article by Mr. Fintan O'Toole in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>at the weekend and it is apparent now that this book may be going out of print.  The suggestion put forward by Mr. O'Toole in his article, and it is a suggestion I agree with, is that this State, perhaps together with the Northern Ireland Executive, should seek to purchase the rights to that book.  If we managed to purchase the rights to the book, we could make the information in that valuable tome available online to the public.  That book is written without judgment, political objectivity or a narrative; it simply records the stories of the men, women and children who were killed during the Troubles in Northern Ireland.<br\/><br\/>Were the State in a position to purchase the rights to that book, I believe it would achieve something in trying to ensure we have some monument, that the voices of those who died would be recognised and that people could simply look to see who were these men, women and children who died during the violence in Northern Ireland.  If, however, we let this pass and this book goes out of print, it is clear that it will be contentious and difficult for us to get any collective agreement between communities in Northern Ireland as to how we can put together one complete memorial for all the people who died.  It will become too contentious.  That is why I ask the Government to consider purchasing the rights to <i>Lost Lives<\/i>.

Although those lives were tragically cut short, they will always be remembered.<\/p><p>The violence of the Troubles cuts across all sections of society regardless of background, age, gender or religion, inflicting an appalling 30-year toll.  While at times deeply sad and unsettling, <i>Lost Lives<\/i>serves as a powerful reminder of the dark events of our recent history and demonstrates how crucial it is to ensure the successful and sustained operation of all the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p><p>The book has also been given a new audience in a renewed lease of life with the production of the documentary by film-makers Mr. Michael Hewitt and Mr. Dermot Lavery.  Last year, former Senator Ian Marshall organised a screening of the &quot;Lost Lives&quot; documentary in Leinster House.  It is encouraging to note that Members from across all sides of both Houses the Oireachtas were present on that occasion, reflecting the cross-party co-operation approach to the peace process founded on the Good Friday Agreement, which is so important.<\/p><p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs has met families who have lost loved ones in the most appalling of circumstances, bombings and shootings that are dark stains on our history such as the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, the Kingsmill massacre, the Ballymurphy killings, the Birmingham bombings and others.

The peace we realised with the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 must be protected and sustained, come what may.  The importance of acknowledging, respecting and effectively dealing with the tragic legacy of the past cannot be underestimated.  So many families lost loved ones during the Troubles and are entitled to support in finding truth and justice as part of the healing of the wounds of that conflict, and as part of building reconciliation.<\/p><p>The Government also facilitates the remembrance of lives lost during the Troubles through a range of projects and initiatives supported by the reconciliation fund.  These include, among many others, the annual day of reflection promoted by the Healing Through Remembering group to facilitate quiet remembrance of the impact of conflict on lives across these islands, and the important work of the conflict archive on the Internet, CAIN, at Ulster University, which provides a comprehensive chronology of the Troubles and a permanent reminder of the tragic events which saw so many lose their lives.<\/p><p>The unforgettable message of <i>Lost Lives<\/i>and the terrible record of violence, loss and suffering it portrays so movingly is &quot;Never again&quot;.  The peace we have found through the Good Friday Agreement is the only fitting legacy for each of the lost lives that are documented in this book.  It is important that this book, such a vital resource in that process of remembering, is protected and made accessible.  While I understand the original publisher is no longer in operation, the Government would be happy to explore how we can be helpful, perhaps through a collaborative effort, in ensuring this hugely valuable work remains available for the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900031#JJ00200","speaker":"1573"},{"type":"speech","time":1607524500,"counter":267,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his considered and measured response.  I also welcome the fact the Government is prepared to explore trying to purchase the rights of this book.  This would be a beneficial step for this State to take.  It is also important that we recognise it is asking much of the two communities in Northern Ireland to organise mutual reconciliation themselves.  That is something any community would find extremely difficult to do.  That is why it is so important that the Irish Government and, indeed, the British Government and Northern Ireland Executive play a part in this.  Sometimes, when people can stand back from an issue a bit, it can be easier to try to look at it objectively to ensure we can try to achieve some fairness.<\/p>  <p>  It is fair to say the book is not contentious.  Most issues in Northern Ireland are contentious, particularly, when it comes to remembrance or in terms of legacy issues.  This book sets out the detail of all those people who were killed during the Troubles.  I agree with the Minister of State when he says the message that comes out of the violence in Northern Ireland can be summed up in two words: \"Never again\".  We never need to ensure that because there is a division between Irish people, we must resort to violence.  It is, however, imperative that we remember and recall it.  That is why this book achieved so much, and bizarrely, when the book was started I do not believe the authors - the five journalists - had in mind this was going to be some great tome that would assume such reconciliatory significance.  They simply wanted to record the people who died for the purpose of journalistic research.  To date, however, in my opinion, it is the most effective way and method that exists of commemorating the people who died during the violence in a non-contentious way.  I believe all the 3,700 people who died, and their families, deserve justice.  We also need to recognise, however, that sometimes justice may not be attainable.  What they certainly require, however, is truth.  That is why I believe the stories of the lives of each of them who died should be recorded by this State and made available to the public at large.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900031#JJ00300","speaker":"1553"},{"type":"speech","time":1607524500,"counter":268,"content":"<p>Again, I thank the Deputy for his comments in response.It is important to acknowledge the key point that it is not a controversial book.  <i>Lost Lives<\/i>serves as a powerful reminder that we must continue to work towards deeper reconciliation and that all we do is to heal the wounds we can.

They ask why staff members' redundancy agreements are not being protected even after the Debenhams workers being on strike for such a long period.  We know what the issues are because this happened previously with Clerys.

It is a real worry for the workers in all of these stores, who are in danger of losing their jobs.  I fully appreciate, as do the Government and the Department, how difficult this is for those involved and their families, not least at this time of year and given the difficult year it has been with Covid-19.  This is not the news they wanted.  We all know about the pressure on the retail sector, along with other sectors, but we remain hopeful that we can minimise the number of job losses in that sector as a whole in the months ahead.  That will be the aim of the Government, without a doubt.<\/p><p>While these are worrying times and this is worrying news, it is hoped to procure the sale of the Irish operations as part of an overall sale of the Arcadia group and that the Irish stores will continue to trade through Christmas in order to maximise the value of the stock.  I accept that this will be very difficult for the employees, who are turning up every day to work long, hard hours without knowing the long-term status of their jobs.  There is a hope, shared by everybody, that a buyer will be found for these shops and businesses to keep these jobs alive.  The Government hopes a suitable and sustainable buyer can be found and that any potential job losses can be avoided.  Beyond this, it is difficult to comment on specifics just yet, given that the matter is before the courts and, as such, is <i>sub judice<\/i>.  The process is still at a fairly early stage.<\/p><p>The Protection of Employment Act 1977 imposes obligations on employers that propose collective redundancies, including obligations to engage in an information and consultation process with employees&rsquo; representatives and to provide certain information relating to the proposed redundancies.  Where an employee believes the employer to be in breach of those obligations, he or she may pursue a complaint with the Workplace Relations Commission.  There is also an obligation on employers proposing a collective redundancy to notify the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  I am advised that, up to yesterday evening, no notification had been received.<\/p><p>It is the responsibility of the employer in the first instance to pay statutory redundancy and other wage-related entitlements to employees.  However, the Social Insurance Fund provides a safety net for employees to ensure they receive statutory entitlements in circumstances where the employer cannot pay due to insolvency.  This issue was raised in the House in the context of other companies as well.  The State steps in to cover all statutory entitlements, whether redundancy, due wages, holiday pay and so on.  Where the compensation goes beyond that in regard to further arrangements with employees in respect of collective agreements and greater entitlements, it is generally a private arrangement with the company.  The State does not guarantee such agreements and is not in a position to do so.  Entitlements covered under the insolvency payments scheme include arrears of wages, holiday pay and sick pay.  In all the previous cases that were mentioned, the State paid out and always does, because that is what a State guarantee is about and that is what the Social Insurance Fund is there to do.  One hopes that will not be needed in this case and that the fund will not be drawn on.  To reiterate, there has as yet been no formal application.<\/p><p>High-street retailers have been under pressure for some time and Covid-19 has challenged the sector further.  The Government is working in a co-ordinated way and has committed unprecedented levels of financial supports to help businesses through these difficult times.  We will of course work with the company in question and all companies to protect jobs and the sector.  We know the importance of the retail sector and of the workers in that space.  It employs more than 300,0000 people and many of them are highly skilled, with long careers in the sector.  We want to develop that and to recognise those skills in a more formal way, but also to develop people's skills to deal with the challenges of the future.  Retail is a challenging sector but there is a great deal of opportunity to sustain and create jobs in the sector if we make the right investments.  The retail forum is held weekly to work with the sector to try to secure its future long term because it is a massive employer.<\/p><p>Reference was made to Mayo.  The regional spread of jobs in the retail sector is well recognised and of utmost importance to the Government.  We will do everything we can to protect jobs in this space.  The expectation is that a buyer will be found in this case.  We also hope that a purchaser will also be found in the UK to protect the jobs in the parent company.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900032#KK00400","speaker":"1505"},{"type":"speech","time":1607525100,"counter":275,"content":"<p>That reply was very disappointing.  The Minister of State said the Government would do all it can to protect the jobs, but is it going to do anything, however small, to protect the workers' collective agreement?  Of course, we all hope that it will not come to it and that the jobs can be saved.  We all recognise, as the Minister of State pointed out, that high-street retail is under pressure.  That is nothing compared with the pressure these workers will be under working through the busiest time of year in a crowded setting, during a pandemic, when at the end of the season, they will not even know whether their collective agreement will be honoured.

We cannot keep shrugging our shoulders and saying we hope there is not another Clerys, TalkTalk, La Senza or Debenhams.  Successive Governments cannot keep letting down workers like this.

It is mean-spirited to cut them off from the PUP payment, particularly on a day former politicians received an extra &euro;16,000 pay increase on top of their &euro;130,000 per year pension entitlement.

However, we also have to prepare for the possibility that they may not be bought.  Unfortunately, from what I have heard so far, because I asked the Taoiseach these same questions last week when I raised the same issue, is that the workers were given the same answer, which is, as a representative of Deloitte had said to them, they will only get the statutory redundancy if the company closes.

The PUP entitlements is not an issue I was aware of.  It is certainly something I can check out, if Deputy Conway-Walsh wants to give me the details.  I will certainly discuss that with my ministerial colleague behind me, Deputy Humphreys.  We can certainly look at that, if there is any issue with PUP entitlements and unfairness.  In fairness, that Department has responded strongly throughout Covid regarding PUP entitlements.  I note the Deputy is nodding in agreement.  If there is any issue there, we can work on that.  There has been a strong response from that Department and from the Government as a whole when it comes to those payments right throughout the system and we recognise the various sectors as well.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that all of us in this House are honest with people in this situation and tell them the truth.  The truth is a collective agreement is a third-party private agreement made between employees and companies.  It is not a State agreement.  It is not something the State has given statutory backing to and, therefore, I cannot say that the State will pay out on that.  The State, through the Social Insurance Fund, which is a fund put together by taxpayers and by workers, pays out on statutory entitlements, which is two weeks' redundancy, holiday pay, wages due, etc.  That is what it is.  It is wrong, and slightly dishonest, to say the State can or should pay out on a third-party agreement.  It does not do that, and it has not in the case of Debenhams and in this case as well.<\/p>  <p>  We are not at the redundancy stage here yet.  There has been no notification of it yet.  We all hope to avoid that.  Without doubt I hope, for all those employees' sakes, we can avoid that.<\/p>  <p>  I can confirm that the State, of course, will step in and make sure statutory entitlements are paid.  That is what the State does for everybody, and rightly so, but the company has the first responsibility to pay out on that.  If this ends up in a full liquidation process through the courts - it is not at that stage yet - the various assets of the company will have to be looked at by the liquidators in view of the courts to deal with who gets paid what after that.  The State steps in for statutory entitlements and will not be found wanting - I can confirm that to the employees - for their statutory entitlements.<\/p>  <p>  The Debenhams case was mentioned.  The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, has processed at this stage more than 1,600 applications to two funds to recognise the workers' statutory entitlements in Debenhams as well.<\/p>  <p>  I reiterate that there is a connection being made here with this company and Debenhams' company and other companies as well.  Every situation is a little different but it suits some Members to constantly try and draw a connection to Clerys.  I say again that I have not seen the evidence to say that the Debenhams or Arcade Group cases are the same as Clerys, yet Members keep bringing that up here on a regular basis.  Connecting the two adds to the dishonest conversation for all these employees who are in a vulnerable and difficult situation.  If there is evidence to say they are the same, I ask Members to bring it forward because I have not seen it.  There are laws and protections there.<\/p>  <p>  I met the Debenhams workers and I gave a strong commitment that I would work with them and others, specifically, with Gerry Light of Mandate, to strengthen the legislation.  The Minister of State, Deputy Troy, and myself, on behalf of the T&aacute;naiste and the Department, met and said to Debenhams that we will strengthen the workers there and that if we can identify areas of weakness in the law in respect of insolvency and redundancy, we will strengthen that.  There are working groups doing that work.  It is an ongoing process.  They are linked back there.  If we can find in that process - the committee is doing the same - areas where we can strengthen that, we will do that.  That is different from trying to draw a link with Debenhams or Arcadia Group to Clerys.  If the Deputies believe that, I ask them to show me the evidence and bring it in.  It would certainly help me do my job and it would certainly help other Departments do their job as well.  However, to constantly draw that link and make the connection is unfair to the workers of those different companies.<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister of State with responsibility for this area, I will go to great lengths to strengthen legislation when I can prove it will be effective and worthwhile.  There have been reports of that in the past.  Where we can make changes, we will do that.  That commitment was given to the Debenhams workers.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Conway-Walsh is correct that they had two asks in their campaign.  The first was that the company would pay out on the collective agreement they had made.  That is what they want and they are out protesting to get that entitlement.  They are entitled to chase that up, demand that and look for that.  The second part of their campaign was that we as a Government would change legislation to strengthen it to prevent such cases in the future.  Their ask is probably related to an assumption that Debenhams is the same as Clerys.  I said that regardless of what the connections are with any companies, we will examine the legislation to make it stronger and better, if we can, to protect their entitlements going forward.  However, I have to also be honest.  There is a difference between statutory entitlements and private agreements through collective bargaining.  We are looking at that area as well.  The programme for Government does that.  The Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste said it as well.  We recognise that too.  However, they are two separate issues and they are not always recognised as separate in this House.  For employees, of course, they want to pursue all their entitlements as much as they can, and rightly so.  They should do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900033#LL00300","speaker":"1505"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Social Welfare Bill 2020: Second Stage","time":1607525700,"counter":280,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900033#LL00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1607525700,"counter":281,"content":"<p>I move: \"That the Bill be now read a Second Time.\"<\/p>  <p>  As Deputies will be aware, the purpose of the Bill is to give legislative effect to the changes announced on budget day.  The Estimates for the Department of Social Protection in 2021 is &euro;25.1 billion.  This is more than &euro;4 billion larger than the Department's budget day allocation for 2020.  Much of that additional spending will be required to meet the ongoing costs of the PUP and other jobseeker payments and supports.  I am pleased, even in these difficult times, to have also been able to secure almost &euro;300 million for a series of targeted measures to support some of the most vulnerable groups in our society.  In addition, the Bill provides for maintaining the State pension age at 66, as committed in the programme for Government.  This measure will cost more tha &euro;220 million in 2021 and in excess of &euro;450 million in a full year.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to point out that some of the social protection measures announced on budget day do not require primary legislation and, therefore, are not reflected in this Bill.<\/p> <p>These measures include the Christmas bonus, which I am pleased to say is being paid this week to a record 1.6 million recipients, with payments totalling &euro;390 million.  I take this opportunity to encourage people again to spend their Christmas bonus locally this year and support small businesses as they reopen their doors.<\/p> <p> There are other budget day measures that are not included in the Bill.  One of these is the increase of &euro;20 in the earnings disregard for disability allowance, taking it from &euro;120 to &euro;140.  This will, like the Christmas bonus, be done by regulation.  In addition, as a non-statutory scheme, the increase of &euro;3.50 per week in the fuel allowance payment does not require amending legislation, nor does the extension of the hot school meals programme.<\/p> <p> I will now go through the sections of the Bill.  Section 1 provides for the definitions used in the Bill.  Moving to section 2, employer PRSI is currently charged at a rate of 8.8% on employees' weekly earnings between &euro;38 and &euro;395.  Section 2 increases the reckonable earnings threshold for employees by &euro;3 to &euro;398, whereby employer PRSI contributions can continue to be paid at the lower rate of 8.8%.  This provision is designed to take account of the increase in the minimum wage from &euro;10.10 to &euro;10.20 per hour from 1 January 2021.  Employers with employees benefiting from the increase in the minimum wage will continue to attract the lower rate of employer PRSI.  It is intended that this section will come into operation on 1 January 2020.<\/p> <p> Section 3 provides that for the purpose of the Covid-19 employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, the Revenue Commissioners and the Minister for Social Protection may share information relevant to the effective operation of the scheme.  A similar provision was included in legislation establishing its predecessor, the temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS.  The employer PRSI contribution for the TWSS was 0.5%.  Section 4 provides that an identical employer contribution will be made for the EWSS.<\/p> <p> Illness benefit is, at present, paid after an initial waiting period of six days.  Section 5 reduces the number of waiting days from six to three.  This will ease the financial strain on employees, especially those who do not have occupational sick pay arrangements as part of their contract of employment.  As Deputies will be aware, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is currently conducting a public consultation on the introduction of a statutory right to paid sick leave for all employees.  I encourage all interested parties to engage with this consultation and make their views known on the matter.<\/p> <p> Section 6 provides that self-employed pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, recipients can engage in limited self-employment and earn up to &euro;480 over a rolling four-week period and continue to maintain entitlement to PUP.  Section 7 provides for a regulation-making power to allow the Minister to prescribe, by statutory instrument, the income and expenses that can be included to reach the &euro;480 limit.  These are important provisions that allow self-employed people to carry out some work and still retain the PUP.  The measure, which took effect from budget day, has been warmly welcomed by taxi drivers, musicians, electricians, plumbers and other self-employed workers throughout the country.  There is no application process, it being done instead by self-declaration.  A self-employed person simply needs to inform my Department if he or she earns more than &euro;480 over a four-week period.<\/p> <p> I am aware that an amendment has been tabled on Committee Stage to change the limit to &euro;960 over an eight-week period.  I am happy to accept the amendment.  Having spoken to musicians and members of the entertainment industry directly, they have explained that this would make life easier for them when it comes to one-off gigs.  Whether it is &euro;480 over four weeks or &euro;960 over eight weeks, the point is that we do not want people turning down work for fear that it might impact their PUP.  I am happy to make that change.  I acknowledge the constructive engagement on the issue by Jackie Conboy and the Music and Entertainment Association of Ireland.  We all hope that with the vaccine coming on stream we will get back to some level of normality in 2021.  We want to see our musicians and artists back performing as much as possible.  In the meantime, this provision will provide them with greater flexibility to take up occasional gigs while knowing that the safety net of the PUP is still there for them.  That is important because musicians may have a gig one week and nothing for the next four weeks.  I hope the limit of &euro;960 will help them in that respect.<\/p> <p> Injury benefit is a payment made to employee contributors who are unable to work due to an injury or occupational disease sustained in the course of their employment and who satisfy certain PRSI contribution conditions.  Section 8 reduces the waiting period for this payment from six to three days.  As with illness benefit, the reduction in waiting days is intended to take effect in March 2021.<\/p> <p> Section 9 provides for an increase in the widowed or surviving civil partner grant by &euro;2,000, from &euro;6,000 to &euro;8,000.  This is the first time the grant has been increased since 2008.  Where people find themselves in the tragic situation that a loved one has passed away and they are looking after dependent children, this increased payment is intended to provide a small bit of extra help.  The measure will take effect from 1 January.\u00a0<\/p> <p> Section 10 removes the earnings limit on the one-parent family payment.  Currently, when a lone parent's earnings exceed &euro;425 per week, he or she loses entitlement to the payment.  The intention behind this provision is to tackle in-work poverty and remove a potential poverty trap by allowing single parents who are in employment to earn over the current earnings limit and retain the one-parent family payment.  This section will come into operation on 8 April 2021.<\/p> <p> Section 11 provides for an increase of &euro;150 in the carer's support grant, raising the payment to &euro;1,850, the highest level at which it has ever been set.  The carer's support grant is an annual payment for carers who look after people in need of full-time care and attention.  The grant is paid annually in a single lump sum, usually on the first Thursday in June.  The grant is not means tested and is not taxable.  This increase goes some way towards acknowledging the role family carers play in our society.<\/p> <p> The working family payment, formerly known as family income supplement, is a weekly tax-free supplement available to employees with children.  It gives extra financial support to people on low pay.  Section 12 provides for a &euro;10 increase in the weekly income threshold for the working family payment for families with up to three children.  This allows parents to earn more and still retain the payment.  This section will come into operation on 7 January 2021.<\/p> <p> Section 13 amends section 248 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 to provide that the Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment may continue for a period of six weeks after death in certain circumstances.  This will bring the PUP in line with other social protection payments for the unemployed, including jobseeker's allowance and jobseeker's benefit.<\/p> <p> Sections 14 and 16 provide for increases in the qualified child payment.  The weekly rate for a qualified child will increase for children under 12 by &euro;2, from &euro;36 to &euro;38.  It will increase for children aged 12 and over by &euro;5, from &euro;40 to &euro;45.<\/p>  <p>This will result in increases to the qualifying child payment in respect of 419,000 children.  Sections 14 and 16 also provide for an increase of &euro;5 in the living alone allowance, which will benefit over 221,700 pensioners and people with disabilities.<\/p> <p> Section 15 provides for an increase in the weekly payment of the island allowance by &euro;7.30, bringing the rate to &euro;20 per week.  For people living on an offshore island, it is an increase to the weekly value of certain social welfare payments.  The intention of this is to compensate for the additional costs of living on these islands when compared to people resident on the mainland.  As Minister with responsibility for the islands, I am pleased to have been able to provide for this measure which is the first time the island allowance has been increased since it was introduced over two decades ago.<\/p> <p> Section 17 repeals the increase in the State pension age.  The programme for Government commits that the planned increase in the State pension age next year will be deferred and it will remain at 66, pending the report of the Commission on Pensions.  The commission has been established and will report by June 2021.  In the meantime, the Bill provides that the State pension age will remain at 66 years and not increase to 67 years on 1 January 2021 or 68 in 2028.  This will also allow the Commission on Pensions to consider State pensions policy issues fully and make recommendations for the future, unfettered.<\/p> <p> Section 18 provides for the Short Title, its construction and collective citation with the Social Welfare Acts.<\/p> <p> In the context of a budget which had to be constrained due to dealing with the public health crisis caused by Covid-19, as well as the potential consequences of Brexit, we have focused on the vulnerable in society who are at most risk.  Given the environment we are in and the significant economic challenges we are facing, it was simply not possible to do everything we wanted in budget 2021.  We have, instead, sought to target resources to support our most vulnerable, namely, those who live alone, our carers, people with disabilities and low-income families.<\/p> <p> I commend the Bill to the House and I look forward to hearing contributions of Deputies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900033#LL00500","speaker":"1450","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607526900,"counter":284,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Social Welfare Bill 2020.  Typically, the Social Welfare Bill comes before the House in October and November each year.  It is a shame that this Bill has come so late this year, particularly in view of the importance of the section which will repeal the pension age increases to 67 in January 2021 and to 68 in 2028, a move I welcome.This will provide the certainty needed to those approaching retirement.<\/p><p>I was just outside the convention centre with the Stop 67 campaign group.  It comprises several organisations that came together in order to put this campaign to the fore back in February, during the general election campaign.  The campaign will continue while the Commission on Pensions does its work looking at what the future pension age increase will be.  I also met a number of workers outside who will turn 66 in January.  Up until recently, they did not know whether they would get their pensions in January.  This measure is a welcome certainty for them.<\/p><p>The issue not addressed in this Bill is the ongoing practice of 65-year-olds having to sign on the dole at retirement, in many cases after a lifetime of work.  I received an email last week from a colleague's office in Dublin about a 65-year-old man who has retired after many years at work.  The man in question was refused jobseeker's allowance because he has not committed to seek work.  In fairness, I had not come across that before.  I understood that the Department was allowing leniency where a 65-year-old person on retirement would be put on jobseeker's allowance but that there would not be an onus on that individual to actually seek work.  That is regrettable, and we must ensure that we end the practice.  It must stop.<\/p><p>We all acknowledge that it has been an extremely difficult year for workers.  Thousands of workers have lost their jobs while thousands more are on reduced incomes.  The cuts planned for the pandemic unemployment payment - I appreciate they remain under review - cannot even be contemplated in January.  A commitment in respect of the pandemic unemployment payment should be made that those cuts will not happen in the new year.  Workers and families need certainty in this regard.  When we look at the higher rate of the pandemic unemployment payment, namely, the &euro;350 paid to those who were earning &euro;400 before the onset of the pandemic, we have to acknowledge that it is only covering, on average, 65% of prior net earnings.  This means many workers are on a substantially reduced income.  They are typically people with mortgages.  While rent supplement is available to renters in some circumstances, that same support is not there for people who have mortgages.  It is really regrettable that the mortgage interest supplement was abolished in 2014.  Perhaps there is room to look at it going forward.  Those are the people who are really struggling.  This is compounded by the decision of the banks not to reintroduce the mortgage break.  That is a regrettable decision by the banks when people needed that little bit of help at this time in the midst of a global pandemic.<\/p><p>I welcome that the Minister has agreed to accept an amendment from myself and Deputy Joan Collins.  I also welcome that she engaged with the Music and Entertainment Association of Ireland and with musicians on the ground.  These are the people we have to listen to when we look at new schemes like the pandemic unemployment payment and how it works.<\/p><p>With regard to the household debt on the backs of all the thousands of people who have lost their jobs this year, we need to look at mechanisms in dealing with it and how we support families.  Thousands of people have lost their jobs or are on reduced income, yet the same payment obligations and bills remain.  I did a survey on household debt and the real-life experiences of the over 300 people who took it are heart breaking.  As we approach Christmas, we must acknowledge that household debt is an issue.  We need to put supports in place to help families.  There is an onus on the Government to do that.<\/p><p>I launched proposals this week on what we can do to deal with household debt.  Will the Minister take those proposals on board, one of which is to cap the extortionate interest rates, sometimes up to 288%, being charged by moneylenders?  I raised this with the Taoiseach during the week but he told me that there are options available to people other than going to moneylenders.  However, approximately 300,000 people use moneylenders.  It is not good enough to say there are other options.  We need to ensure the regulation concerning interest is put in place and that we protect families in some small way when it comes to moneylenders.<\/p><p>In fairness to the Taoiseach, his party was quite happy to pass and support the Sinn F&eacute;in Bill on this issue in 2018.  When that Bill progresses to Committee Stage in January, Fianna F&aacute;il and the rest need to get behind it because families are struggling.  They are extremely vulnerable.  Moneylenders are taking advantage in some cases, particularly with interest rates of up 288%.  We need to take action on this.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul, along with lone parent organisations Single Parents Acting for Rights of Kids and One Family Ireland have all been calling for supports to deal with household debt.  They are at the coalface dealing with families in these situations.  We need to see measures from the Government on this.<\/p><p>I welcome the &euro;3.50 increase in the fuel allowance.  Any increase in the fuel allowance is to be welcomed.  We have to remember, however, it still is not back to the 32 weeks that it once was, remaining at 28 weeks.  That cut has not been restored.  The &euro;3.50 increase is good and well but it has to be matched with a carbon tax increase of &euro;7.50.  I welcome the publication of the Department's report on the impact that current and projected increases in the carbon tax will have on low-income families.  That report concluded:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIt shows, from various researches conducted, that carbon tax increases will impact (disproportionately) on low income households.  Consequently, in order to protect low income  families  from  the  impact  of such  tax increases,  mitigating  measures, in the form of various welfare and\/or taxation supports, are needed. <\/blockquote> <p>Of course we all knew this but it is telling that the Department now has a report that tells the Minister and the Government that these increases need to be matched with supports.  I acknowledge these supports cannot always mean an increase in the fuel allowance over and over again.  We need further measures and I accept this.  At present, given the energy increases and the fact people are facing increased energy bills, we need to look at tackling energy poverty.  It is a serious issue.<\/p> <p> I note an amendment I tabled that came from Family Carers Ireland on paying the carer's support grant in two parts next year has been ruled out of order and I expected such.  It is an amendment the Minister could at least consider in recognition of the really difficult year that carers have had.  Family Carers Ireland has asked that the carer's support grant be split in two so that in January there would be a payment of &euro;925 and in June, when the annual payment is paid, another payment of &euro;925 would be made.  This would be really beneficial to carers and it is something the Minister should look at.<\/p> <p> When we speak about things that are worthwhile and worth the cost, I always turn to JobPath and the continuous line from the Government that it is value for money.  We know that to date, JobPath has cost the taxpayer almost &euro;250 million.  It was due to finish taking referrals in 2019.  It was given a 12-month extension into 2020 and the Minister has announced it will be given another 12-month extension into 2021.  There are several issues with this.  There is the issue of the amount of money being paid to these private companies, which is &euro;311 for each of the more than 280,000 people who have been referred, just for being referred.  Last week, I asked about the more than 33,000 people who have been referred more than once as to whether the companies get the same referral fee for the same person twice.  I do not think this is value for money.  There has been a 7% job success rate to date.  I have also asked, given that the contract is being allowed to continue for another 12 months, whether there is a clause whereby some of the fees can be reduced.  I have also asked the Minister to look at the impact that JobPath is having on existing schemes, such as the community employment scheme, which cannot fill their places.  We need to look at the impact JobPath is having on these schemes.<\/p> <p> I want to make reference to the child maintenance review group which has been established.  It is very welcome.  I do not think we needed a review group to tell us it is wrong to put lone parents in front of judges in courts to get child maintenance.  It is regrettable the Department pursues the other parent for recouping costs for the one-parent family payment but not when it comes to maintenance.  I hope the group will report back very quickly.<\/p> <p> Poverty is a huge issue in the State.  Hundreds of thousands of people live in poverty.  I ask the Minister to look at the Social Welfare Commission Bill I have brought forward.  We need to bring our social welfare payments above the poverty line.  It is the most basic level that any social protection system should aim to achieve and we are not achieving it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900035#NN00200","speaker":"1604","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607527500,"counter":286,"content":"<p>In many respects, the Bill before the House is a vindication for those people who went to the bother of casting their votes in February.  Many people were despondent at the refusal of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael to recognise the huge mandate for change.  One of the dominant issues of that election campaign, as we know now, was the stated, much vaunted and defended intention of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael to increase the State pension age to 68.  People rightly were angered by such a notion and they spoke with their feet and their votes.  Those people who at the age of 65 were forced to retire but were then sent to their local social welfare offices recounted their tales on the national airwaves.  Workers of all ages said this was not the future they wanted.  They want to be able to retire with dignity, if it is their choice, at the age of 65.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill is a vindication of all those people who let their voices be heard, primarily by voting for Sinn F&eacute;in candidates.  The Government has accepted that Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael got this drastically wrong.  Bringing forward legislation that will suspend the proposed age increase to 67 on 1 January and a further increase to 68 is to be welcomed.  Let us not play further games.  The commission is a fudge.  Let us forget about the fudges.  People are sick to death of fudges in Irish politics.  People want assurance.  People who are approaching the pension age do not know, and have no certainty whatsoever, as to what circumstances they will be in when they hit 65, 66, 67 and 68 in the years to come.  The Minister and Government should give them this assurance and tell them if they wish to retire at the age of 65, they will be entitled to the State pension.  This is the least they deserve.  For those people who break their backs working to build our economy, sustain our public services and ensure our communities remain vibrant places for us all to live and work, it is the least they deserve.  We need to get back to the principle of fairness that goes to the heart of the State pension regime.  I ask Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael representatives to stop being tone deaf.  People do not want a commission.  They want certainty.  I do not think it is too much to ask.<\/p>  <p>  I commend my party colleague, Deputy Kerrane, on the amendments she has tabled.  It is clear there are issues with the pandemic unemployment payment, the temporary wage subsidy scheme and the more recent wage subsidy scheme and Sinn F&eacute;in has pointed them out.  Some of these have been ironed out.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the Minister's assertion that the Government will support the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment to adjust the income threshold to &euro;960 over an eight-week period rather than the original four-week period for those people who are in particularly vulnerable sectors, such as the music and events industry.<\/p>  <p>  I support Deputy Kerrane's assertions on the JobPath scheme.  It is an absolute scandal.  We had this before the Committee of Public Accounts recently.  We heard that &euro;11,000 per job was the net output for a private company to provide JobPath.  This is not good value for money.  It is driven by an ideological agenda that is about privatising basic services and privatising roles that should be undertaken within the Department where there is proper accountability and where there should also be transparency.<\/p>  <p>  If we are going to have a commission or a review on anything, let us look at how we have wasted hundreds of millions of euro of the Irish people's money on JobPath.  This would warrant a commission, rather than a commission on an issue on which the Irish people have spoken so definitively in respect of the pension age.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900036#OO00200","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speech","time":1607527500,"counter":287,"content":"<p>Sinn F&eacute;in and the Minister's party, including its Government partners, have different views on the type of country we want and this is okay.  It is, in fact, healthy for a democracy that voters have a clear choice when they go to the polls.  Sinn F&eacute;in will always prioritise State investment in public services and providing income supports, housing, education and jobs where needed.  We promote a bottom-up and public collective approach.  The approach of the Minister and Fine Gael is different.  They support a top-down wealth creation model.  That is okay too in a democracy.  Of course, we know this model excludes people.  It does not afford equal opportunity.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in will never support or promote such an approach.<\/p>  <p>  I will not stand here this evening and criticise the measures the Minister is proposing to legislate for in the Bill.  In fact, we welcome them.  They represent social progress as they provide more means to those who have least.  I welcome the measures and so does my party.  I particularly support the pension measure.  The increase in the pension age to 67 became a huge issue in the 2020 general election and rightly so.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in advocated and supported a return to the State retirement age, with the choice of individuals, to the age of 65.  We welcome the move to 66, albeit that it was done kicking and screaming, but we hope the Minister will go further with further public pressure and bring it back to 65.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to speak specifically on the social protection measures available to the Irish fishing community.<\/p> <p>I believe we need to do something radically different when it comes to social protection and fishers.  I encourage the Minister to commission a piece of work on how we treat fishers with regard to income supports.  While the Department administers payments universally, and this is generally the right approach, we have to recognise the uniqueness of the work of Irish fishers and their vital importance to the Irish economy and food chain.<\/p> <p> Covid has exposed the deficiencies.  Overnight, the Irish fishing industry was turned upside down.  The export market was wiped out, there was no domestic market to replace it and fishers were left scrambling to find income.  While the PUP was eventually opened up to the fishing community, and this was welcomed, it did not recognise the uniqueness of the nature of fishing, which is dependent on weather conditions and the time of year in regard to fish stocks.  The lifting of restrictions is a matter for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment but it is also relevant in this regard.  Fishers could not access temporary wage subsidy supports because most are on self-employed contracts, they could not access working capital loans as there was existing debt with financial institutions and they were locked out of restart grants from local authorities because they do not pay rates.  The tie-up scheme from Europe to cover weather events was totally inadequate, too late and ill-thought-out.<\/p> <p> With Brexit, and the ever-increasing threat of a no-deal Brexit, I am appealing to the Minister to do something different.  The Irish fishing community is on its knees and needs support.  We need new thinking.  I appeal to the Minister to engage with the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to put together a task force involving fishing representatives, and to look at introducing targeted, specific measures that the fishing community can access when crisis hits.  As I said at the outset, the fishing community needs support.  If it is going to survive into the future, and as a people we need it to do so, then radical action must be taken.  I implore the Minister to do so and I am happy to work with her to develop supporting measures.  In particular, I am thinking of the inshore fleet, which is reliant on lobster and crab fishing and the like and is very limited in its access to traditional fisheries like herring.  It is very important that the Minister engages with the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, to look at some novel approach, working with the fishing representative organisations, to give supports to keep our fishermen delivering this resource to coastal communities and, of course, this food resource to the Irish people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900036#OO00300","speaker":"1463","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607528100,"counter":289,"content":"<p>The Labour Party will be supporting the Bill.  We welcome the Bill, if only because it repeals the section in regard to the pension age.  It is something we discussed in the last week on foot of the Sinn F&eacute;in motion and we welcome it wholeheartedly.  Again, I wish to pay tribute to the Stop67 campaign, without which this issue would not have reached the level of political importance that it has reached in the past year or so.  I want to pay tribute again to the National Women's Council, Age Action, Active Retirement Ireland and SIPTU.<\/p><p>In repealing that section, which was so injurious to all of those people, when does the Minister propose to give effect to that measure?  Last week, the Minister stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn addition to repealing the increase in the pension age, I will also shortly be introducing regulations which will formally remove the current requirements for people aged 65 and over to sign on, participate in activation programmes or give an undertaking that they are genuinely seeking work.  The idea, therefore, that any 65-year-old will have to stand in a dole queue is absolute nonsense.  I am formalising an administrative practice which has already been in place for some time.  While the payment rate of &euro;203 for 65-year-olds is less than the full contributory pension rate, it is worth bearing in mind that a 65-year-old receiving &euro;203 per week here is still better off than any pensioner in Northern Ireland. <\/blockquote>  <p>Notwithstanding the commentary in respect of Northern Ireland, it would be very useful to hear from the Minister when she proposes to introduce the statutory regulations, if she has not already signed them.  That will give a lot of comfort to people who are welcoming the repeal of that section in the legislation, but who do not want, to use the Minister's words, to have to stand in a dole queue.  That is one issue on which I seek clarification.<\/p><p>Again, I want to pay tribute to the National Women's Council, Age Action, Active Retirement Ireland and SIPTU for their wonderful work in going out and campaigning, developing a strong consciousness around this issue and co-ordinating a strong campaign that has borne fruit.  It is great to welcome this because they have been vindicated in their position.<\/p><p>I want to raise the issue of fraud with the Minister, particularly in respect of the PUP.  We know there are matters which are before the courts today and yesterday, so I am very conscious of any public commentary in respect of the issue of fraud or alleged fraud with regard to the PUP.  I merely wish to ask the Minister if her Department has made any projections in respect of amounts that may have been fraudulently obtained as a result of applications made for PUP.  We absolutely welcome the initiatives whereby the Department of Social Protection is working hand in hand with the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau because it could be said, by any objective analysis, that this is bearing fruit.  It is important work and I hope it would continue to be resourced because it is vitally necessary that the integrity of our social protection system is maintained, and that everybody has confidence in that system.  The more resources that can be applied to that effort, the more confidence people will have in the system.  It is important, if the integrity of the system is to be maintained for people who have entitlements, that where fraud exists, it is weeded out and eradicated, people are subject to the law and the law is applied rigorously where incidents occur.  I would like to hear from the Minister in respect of anti-fraud measures.  That is my second point.<\/p><p>Given the season we are in, I want to refer to seasonal employment.  We are hearing on the ground that for many people who would have worked in the hospitality sector on a seasonal basis, particularly leading into the Christmas period but also during the summer period, there is a reluctance on the part of some to give up their PUP and to go back to that seasonal employment because they have a genuine fear that, if they do so, their PUP will be lost and gone forever.  I seek an assurance from the Minister that where people do take up employment, albeit on a seasonal basis, there is no fear of them losing their PUP when they finish that employment.<\/p> <p>If the Minister could speak to that issue to reiterate assurances she has given previously on that it would also send a very positive signal.<\/p> <p> She stated in her contribution that if someone has to reapply in January, he or she will be able to do that up to an including 31 March.  We take her at her word on that but it is important for that message to go out because I know from talking to employers that they are finding it difficult to bring people back into the workplace again.  That is an issue I hope will be addressed.<\/p> <p> There has been much news made of the fact that there will be a commitment to nine weeks paid parental leave.  I put it to the Minister that the commitment by the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, is welcome but that the nine weeks paid parental leave is a minimum requirement of an EU directive which the Government is legally compelled to introduce anyway.  The payment is funded from social insurance contributions and not by the State.  It is, therefore, funded by people's own contributions.  It would be useful to have the perspective of the Minister and the Department of Social Protection on the nine weeks and whether there will be extensions beyond those nine weeks in the foreseeable future so as to make parental leave, as a policy, as family-friendly as possible.<\/p> <p> Council Directive 2010\/18\/EU establishes a minimum of four months of parental leave.  At least one out of the four months is non-transferable from a parent to another and there is no minimum compensation during parental leave at EU level.  As of 2 August 2022, Council Directive 2019\/1158 establishes a minimum of four months of parental leave.  At least two out of the four months are non-transferable from a parent to another.  At least the two non-transferable months have to be adequately compensated at a level to be decided in each EU country as of 2 August 2024 for the past two weeks and parents have the right to request taking the leave in a flexible - meaning part-time - and piecemeal way.  It would be very useful to have the perspective of the Minister in respect of parental leave.  While, technically, it is not her line Department, the issue of social insurance contributions very much dovetails with her Department and I am sure she has a perspective on that.  What we want in any progressive society is to ensure that we do not operate to the minimum or to the directive but that we seek to find mechanisms to ensure greater flexibility such that working mothers in particular can avail of as much leave as possible, and working fathers as well.  <\/p> <p> If there is one thing the first lockdown has taught me as a public representative, it is that when there was an absence of childcare, it had a massive impact on working mothers in particular.  I believe we have not fully analysed the impact it has had on working mothers in respect of their career prospects and as we are trying to move towards a more equal society and as the research becomes more embedded, and I know the ESRI has done some research on that, we need to ensure that we can create pathways for women, and working mothers in particular, such that no impediments are put in their way and that the parental leave arrangements put in place by the State are done in a progressive way and not just to a minimum EU requirement.  I know the Minister will also have a view on that.<\/p> <p> We welcome the Bill.  We welcome also that the work of the Stop 67 campaign is very much inculcated and embedded within this legislation.  I pay tribute to those involved in that.  We believe this Bill is worthy of support.<\/p> <p> I want to raise a final issue in the time available to me.  The Minister has spoken to this issue previously and other Deputies have raised it with her.  It is in respect of the requests for PPS numbers.  Many employers and perspective employers have applied for PPS numbers for prospective employees.  In the time since the Minister last spoke on that publicly and in this House, have further improvements been made such that when people make an application for a PPS number that application is expedited in as timely a manner as possible?  I recognise that because of the PUP resources and people had to be allocated into that section.  That is fully acknowledged by everybody here but if PPS numbers are being allocated it means that people are at work.  If people are at work, they are contributing.  I ask the Minister for an update on progress in respect of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900037#PP00200","speaker":"1514","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607528700,"counter":291,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Paul McAuliffe.

Having been a Member of this House only since February, I am aware that a vast amount of the time in this Chamber is spent on the Opposition misleading many people that this Government does not protect the most vulnerable in our society.  From the first days during which the programme for Government was being put together, that has been a core objective of this Government of Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party.<\/p>  <p>  The passage of this Bill gives us an opportunity to reflect on those facts, not the social media spin.  There has been a 41% increase in the planned spend on social welfare in 2020.  That is not 4% or 14% but 41%.  The Bill the Minister has brought before the House is the largest amount in terms of expenditure ever in the history of the State.  It contains many measures which I could spend time welcoming but I particularly want to welcome the decision not to increase the pension age.  I, too, would like to credit those involved in the Stop 67 campaign but I am also one of the Government Deputies who voted for it as opposed to those in opposition who will vote against this Bill.  It is a core commitment of my party to ensure that older people are protected.  After a lifetime of hard work it is what they deserve and I have great pleasure in voting for that in this Chamber.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill also includes an increase in the living alone allowance.  People who receive the allowance are mainly pensioners and those with a disability.  They will receive an increase of &euro;5, bringing the payment up to &euro;19 per week.  That is 221,000 vulnerable people who will benefit from an increase.  It does not apply to every pensioner because we have had to prioritise and we have prioritised those who are the most vulnerable - those living alone.  It is a progressive and practical decision.<\/p>  <p>  I also welcome the increase of &euro;150 in the carer's support grant, raising the payment to &euro;1,850.  A total of 130,000 carers will benefit from the increase next year, another progressive and practical decision.<\/p> <p>Included in this Bill is a reduction in waiting days from six to three, with the effect that claimants can be paid illness or injury benefit from the fourth day of illness or injury.  This measure will be an improvement in the insurance coverage of ordinary workers by reducing the financial burden of being absent from work due to illness experienced by many this year.  I believe that we need to go further with this measure and I welcome the Taoiseach's commitment to do so.<\/p> <p> Despite battling a pandemic, as of yesterday, the Department of Social Protection and the Minister are paying &euro;390 million in a December bonus to 1.6 million people who are receiving long-term weekly welfare payments.  This is about protecting the vulnerable in our society and I believe it is another progressive and practical decision.  I welcome that people who have been in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment for 17 weeks this year will also receive this bonus.<\/p> <p> The Bill does not include many of the other supports which we have provided this year, including the employment wage subsidy scheme and the Covid restrictions support scheme, which are progressive and practical decisions which will protect people's jobs.  The Government has been committed in the grip of the pandemic to finalise pay restoration for workers.  It is not just addressing the FEMPI cuts or providing for judges or politicians only, as some in this Chamber would have one believe, but every public servant in the country, starting with the lowest paid.  It is a progressive and practical decision.  It has not been said enough that this Government is supporting the most vulnerable, while at the same time establishing itself as an outlier in Europe.  It is not an outlier in unfairness, as some would have people believe, but an outlier regarding how we have managed the Covid virus.  Ireland now has one of the lowest rates of the virus in the European Union, which this Government can be proud of.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900038#QQ00500","speaker":"1568","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607529300,"counter":296,"content":"<p>I am delighted to have an opportunity to contribute to this Bill and to congratulate the Minister for bringing in the largest social welfare budget in the history of the State.

It includes wage subsidy schemes, Covid schemes and the pandemic unemployment scheme, all of which have been integral to maintaining not just people's incomes, but the social solidarity that is so important to us.  Listening to some of these debates, one would wonder how our society became so unequal and difficult but of course we have these conversations against the backdrop of knowing that our society has one of the lowest income inequality rates across the OECD and not only have we had rising incomes, but we have had rising equality of incomes.  That is because of our progressive tax base, our commitment to social transfers for people who need it, and an overwhelming commitment to employment, which is the single most important contributor to income equality and family supports.  It is important that we put on the record of the House the work of Seamus Coffey, an economist at UCC and former chair of the Fiscal Advisory Council, on income inequality.  At the end of his most recent report, he stated, regarding management of social transfers:<\/p> <blockquote> \tEveryone can have their own opinion on the best way forward, but they cannot have their own facts.

It is a real and growing issue, especially with the financial hardship caused by Covid-19.  Fuel poverty is real poverty and it is causing suffering for real people in the run-up to Christmas.  Fuel poverty sees them dreading the new year.  All of us here will be able to go home tonight and put the heating on.  We will not have to go to bed early because it is cold.  We will not have to watch our children shivering as they try to do their homework with a duvet around their shoulders.  We will not have to keep our coats on until a certain hour of the day because we cannot afford to keep the heating on.  We will not have the experience or indignity of not being able to keep our children warm in the 21st century.  Lack of heating leads to damp, damp leads to mould and mould leads to illnesses such as asthma, bronchitis, acute and chronic respiratory illness and sinus infections.  Tonight there will be parents taking out the inhalers and switching on nebulisers for their children because, thanks to fuel poverty, they do not have enough heat in their homes.  It is a damning indictment of this Republic in the 21st century.  It is Dickens meets Davos.<\/p>  <p>  This year is especially tricky for fuel poverty because Covid is bringing swathes of new people into the cold because of loss of income.  Given what I hear from my constituents in Kildare North, who are up early every morning, with some lucky to get to bed at all because they are carers, I am anxious that we should change the rule whereby people must have been on a jobseeker's payment for 15 months to claim fuel allowance.  We must and can do better by people.  It is a matter of political choice and political priorities.  Let people heat their homes for what are modest sums, as Sinn F&eacute;in wants to do.  It is value for money.  Billions in public money are set on fire with State overruns, broadband that we will never own, bad accounting, lazy oversight and poor deals, as Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the seasonal political greenery want to do.  All the time, they think it is fine not to pay student nurses despite the then Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, giving staged public assurances that they would be paid a fair wage.

People need to heat their homes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900039#RR00300","speaker":"1585"},{"type":"speech","time":1607529300,"counter":298,"content":"<p>Before I speak to the Bill, I want to counter a couple of points that have been made by the Minister and Government representatives about inequality.  It has been pointed out that inequality has been falling in Ireland over the past couple of years, which is true, but I want to speak to those trends so that it is not further misconstrued.  The at risk of poverty rate, also known as the relative income poverty rate, has been falling gradually since peaking in 2012 at 16.7%.  In 2019, it was 12.8%.  The deprivation rate peaked in 2013 at 30.5% and fell fairly quickly to 15.1% in 2018.  It increased to 17.8% in 2019, so while we can talk about lowering inequality rates, the deprivation rate increased last year according to the most recent figures that we have.<\/p><p>Despite these falling rates, the number of people in Ireland experiencing genuine poverty, as reflected in the indicators, has remained very steady over the past decade, and has not reduced due to a combination of rising population and a lack of genuine interest in addressing it.  Some 637,000 people in Ireland were living in poverty and 193,600 were children.  Some 98,100 people were living in poverty while in employment and they are the working poor about whom I will speak more shortly.  Some 886,000 people were experiencing deprivation of whom 293,200 were children.  These numbers are unacceptable in a developed country.  Deprivation increased by nearly three percentage points in 2019, and that is despite the strong performance of the economy.  When we talk about lowering inequality rates, whether it is a Government Minister or articles in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>articles published during the week, we should not neglect the deprivation rate and the lived experience of those experiencing poverty, who are not counted in these statistics.<\/p><p>There is much merit in the Bill and with some caveats, the Social Democrats intend to support the Bill as it progresses through its various Stages.  It is our ardent belief that the essence of what it is to live in a republic can be found in how a state values its systems of social welfare and the pride that it should take in the knowledge that when it is needed by its citizens, there is a societal safety net which can provide comfort, assurance and, above all else, dignity to its citizens.  I believe that decisions taken in March this year to provide a pandemic unemployment payment of &euro;350 to almost 600,000 people at its height were essential to the spirit of societal togetherness that embodied the early stages of the pandemic.  It is often said that crises enable us to focus on what is truly important.<\/p> <p>Although it is not long ago, it seems like an entirely different world when Ministers of the political centre-right would stand on ceremony and herald an Ireland of almost full employment without in any way acknowledging the precarious nature of the work or the cruelty of a low-pay economy which left so many of that workforce living in poverty and without basic protections or provisions, such as access to a home, childcare, or even healthcare when necessary.<\/p> <p> Most importantly, it has shown us what it means to be a society.  A society is much greater than that which can be measured in economic growth alone.  It  has shown us that it is not full employment alone that we should crave but in an ever-changing world, our focus should be on the nature of our work, which must be secure, paid appropriately and which recognises that we are all part of a collective that is vulnerable to the various ebbs and flows of all that is outside of our control.  When that work is threatened, the State must be prepared to step in and provide appropriately for our citizens.<\/p> <p> Those involved in the making of the figure of &euro;350 per week, from the then Minister, Regina Doherty, to the Department officials and to the various Deputies across the Chamber and the political divide, who found common ground back in March of this year in that figure being a suitable amount of money in which to pay a person in order that they might live a life of dignity, should be commended.  That was a pivotal moment for our democracy in that it was the first time that the full apparatus of our State recognised that social welfare rates in this country were simply too low.  That realisation came as no surprise to those of us who have read report after report from organisations such as the Society of St Vincent de Paul, Single Parents Acting for the Rights of our Kids, SPARK, and from other one-parent family organisations, from Social Justice Ireland, or for anyone who has met the nearly 637,000 people who, according to the Central Statistics Office, CSO, figures of 2019, were living in or at risk of poverty.<\/p> <p> It was very telling that during the time of total crisis, when people throughout the country from all backgrounds and demographics were forced, through no fault of their own, to seek social welfare support from the State, it was immediately acknowledged that the basic rate of &euro;203 per week was deemed an unsuitable amount on which a person could live a life of dignity.  In light of the Bill we are discussing at present, it is particularly important that we reflect upon that learning, which is that our basic rates of welfare payments are simply too low.  If that statement was not true then there would be no distinction in payments, regardless of whether one had lost one&rsquo;s job through the pandemic or in any of the many other uncontrollable factors which so often leave a person unable to re-enter the workplace and condemned to a life below the poverty line.  This is a central failure of this Bill and of the budgetary measures that were announced in October.  It seems ludicrous to say this, given that we will spend &euro;25 billion in 2021 through our systems of social welfare spending but there will be little contained within that which will prevent an escalation in poverty or a growth in deprivation.  As long as our State continues to view such occurrences as individual failures rather than what they really are, namely, a constant recurrence of structural indifference, if not structural violence, which has failed generation after generation in this country since the foundation of our State.  <\/p> <p> We all fully appreciate the extent to which the realities of the pandemic have necessitated the State to deal with the short-term demands made on the Exchequer to maintain jobs, businesses and to support individual incomes to the extent that we have.  Surely we can be more ambitious for ourselves as a republic and view the eradication of poverty in its cruellest form as a goal worth pursuing.  Nothing in this Bill would present that impression.<\/p> <p> There are, of course, some worthy aspects to the Bill but there is nothing contained within it that recognises that household income inadequacy - the type that renders too many children to poverty in this country while their parents skip a meal to offset the very worst of it for a child - can only be fully addressed when the minimum needs of the entire household are considered and provided for.  In that regard we fully welcome the increases in the targeted supports for children, the fuel and the living alone allowances, and, of course, the maintaining of pension ages at 66.  We commend the Stop67 campaign and all of the organisations who campaigned so valiantly to ensure that that was on the political agenda.  <\/p> <p>  This is the second year in a row that there will be no increase in the minimum rate of social welfare payments.  Rates are already set below the poverty line and well below what is required to meet even a basic standard of living.  In this regard we should not forget the indicators of how such a measurement is quantified.  It is a mother who does not have access to a warm coat or a child without a second pair of shoes or a household in 2020 unable to pay their electricity bill in a modern and relatively wealthy country.  Surely, that must be viewed as being entirely unacceptable and worthy of a greater collective effort on all of our parts in this Chamber.  Alas, once more, that does not seem to be the case.<\/p> <p> We do not for a moment underestimate the cost of such an endeavour and once again we acknowledge the fact that the Government has allocated &euro;25 billion to the social protection budget as a reflection of genuinely good intent in this regard.  This week alone, the State will distribute &euro;390 million in Christmas bonus payments to some 1.6 million citizens.  For that, we commend the Minister and the Department officials, and say what a fantastic boost that that will be, both to the recipients of the payments and for the local economies through every town, village and city in Ireland that will benefit from the State&rsquo;s investment in our citizens.  <\/p> <p> Social welfare spending is inherently expensive but so often what is lost in this debate is just how beneficial this investment is to the State and to the economy.  None of that &euro;390 million that will be paid out this week in Christmas bonuses and very little of the combined &euro;25 billion budget for next year will sit in anyone&rsquo;s bank account.  It will swirl around the economy and come back to the State coffers in VAT, taxes, and through the jobs of those whose livelihoods will be sustained by it.  That level of State investment should be a source of pride and is it is only the question as to whether it is enough and will go far enough that should be a source of any debate.  There is of course an old conservative trope that the problem with socialism is that eventually one runs out of other people&rsquo;s money.  To those who would respond to my previous statements in that manner I would reply with two short points.  First, what has been proven throughout this crisis is that it is in fact the private sector that cannot survive without the State.  Second, as a Social Democrat, we have never shied away from the difficult conversations about how we should fund our public services and provide a stronger system of social protection.  <\/p> <p> Equally it should be acknowledged that the politics of &ldquo;same old, same old&rdquo; has a cost.  A low tax base has a cost and the type of perennial auction politics that undermines our tax systems to the public, as practised by our two medium-sized parties and by Fianna F&aacute;il in February&rsquo;s general election, should be consigned to the past if we are to ever have a mature conversation about how we adequately fund our social infrastructure.  Poverty in and of itself has a cost.  That is felt not only in the corrosive effect it has on the person experiencing it but a very real and stark economic cost accrues to the State.  <\/p> <p> Earlier this year a comprehensive report carried out on behalf of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul estimated that the cost to the State in dealing with the consequences of poverty came in at an annual figure of &euro;4.5 billion.  While there is always a strong moral argument for confronting poverty, this study placed in very stark economic terms the hidden financial burdens to the State of its continual failure and ignoring of this issue.  It is also clear that poverty impacts disproportionately across gender lines and is especially cruel to those with a disability or a caring role for another person.  <\/p> <p> The Deputies and the Minister will be aware that the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly was told by Professor Mary Murphy from Maynooth University that there will be up to 100,000 invisible women in the social welfare system.  The assembly was told, and it is incumbent upon us to listen and respond to it in a legislative manner when possible, that the set-up of Ireland's tax and social welfare systems around the concept of a male breadwinner was more likely to leave women in poverty when they become pensioners.  The chair of the assembly, Dr. Catherine Day, in reference to our systems of social protection said that some laws and policies still bear the stamp of yesterday&rsquo;s Ireland when it came to the role of women.  In the vast majority of cases, the man was the breadwinner and had a stay-at-home wife who had no independent income and whose years of family care were never valued economically.  Women were left in poverty later in life in some cases, where they had left school early, taken multiple career breaks or predominantly worked part-time due to care and responsibility.  I argue that it is high time that the State placed a value on care and responsibilities and that it be reflected throughout our social protection systems.<\/p> <p> There are other groups who have been missed and could have been accounted for in this Bill and who have not been.  In the context of people with a disability, while the rhetoric was that the budget protected the most vulnerable, this is not borne out by any analysis undertaken by the many anti-poverty groups.  A number of disability rights groups have expressed a worry to me that the needs of the broader population, mainly around Covid-19 and Brexit, will lead to the supports for the people with disabilities being further de-prioritised.  Services and supports have yet to fully recover since the last economic recession and the poverty rates for people out of work due to illness or disability have more than doubled from a rate of 19.8% in 2010 to one of 47. 7% in 2018, which is an incredibly alarming figure.  People with disability constantly face the highest poverty rates of any group analysed by the CSO, which is often more than three times the rate of the general population.  What is missing both from this Bill and from the 2021 budget is an acknowledgement of the additional costs borne by people with disabilities.<\/p> <p>Many groups have been calling for a &euro;20 cost-of-disability payment as an interim measure to start to address the many extra costs of disability.  Once again, this has not been included.  Indecon is due to submit its report on the costs of disability to the end of 2020.  I sincerely hope it will make recommendations on how to deal with the costs because the number of people with a disability living in poverty is, quite simply, shocking and an affront to a modern democracy.  For the second year in a row, there was no increase to the disability allowance.  In a year in which the Government has, in practice, acknowledged that &euro;203 is not an adequate amount on which to live, this is disappointing given that people with disabilities usually face higher living costs than most others.<\/p> <p> Provisions on employment are welcome, especially the income disregard, but this is hitting low-hanging fruit and those already in employment with a disability comprise a small percentage of those with a disability overall.<\/p> <p> The increase for carers is insufficient.  According to most carers who have contacted my office and, I am sure, all our offices to date, a &euro;150 increase to the annual carer's support grant will not be sufficient to cover additional costs as a result of the pandemic.  We should remember that many services have been shut for most of the year, leaving carers to deal with extra costs, from the cost of additional heating to the costs of personal protective equipment and sanitation.<\/p> <p> Carers have often been totally disregarded when it comes to mitigation against the negative impacts of carbon tax increases.  The increase to the living alone allowance is of little use to carers who live with the person they care for.  The carer's allowance is not a qualifying payment for the fuel allowance.  This leaves me wondering yet again where the Government has heard of the concept of a just transition.  Most disproportionate of all, for the 13th year in a row, there has been no increase to the income disregard for the carer's allowance.<\/p> <p> I look forward to taking part in the rest of the debate on this Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900039#RR00400","speaker":"1560","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607530500,"counter":301,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy Brendan Smith.  I would love to discuss many of the points made by the previous speaker but unfortunately my time is limited to three and a half minutes.  Despite all the guff and fake indignation we have heard on the floor of the House about the Government being allocated extra time, the longest I have ever been allowed to speak here since the Government took office is four minutes.<\/p>  <p>  There has been a huge increase in the social welfare budget, necessitated by the Covid-19 pandemic.  Naturally, I welcome that.  There are a number of innovative measures in this Bill and there is an attempt at targeting, which I welcome and for which I commend the Minister.<\/p>  <p>  Owing to the short time available to me, I must confine myself to speaking on one point.  I must confess to being bitterly disappointed that two years have now gone by without any increase in basic social welfare rates.  I have emphasised time and again that inflation for those on social welfare, who can purchase only the bare necessities of life, and equally for those on very low incomes, is far in excess of headline inflation.  That is because there are items included in the headline inflation figures, such as yachts and top-of-the-range cars, which the poor will never be purchasing.  Studies by a number of organisations, including the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice, have shown that, in effect, inflation in relation to the basic purchases of those on social welfare has increased by 5% to 6% over the past two years.  The programme for Government makes a commitment, in page 85, to protect social welfare rates.  Allowing the purchasing power of social welfare payments to fall does not constitute protection of social welfare rates.  It appears to make a mockery of the commitment made by the Government on the levels of payments to social welfare recipients.  These levels have been outlined and identified by the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice and others as being barely capable of making ends meet.<\/p>  <p>  Experience has shown that the weakest in society get left behind unless welfare increases keep up with increases elsewhere in the economy.  Since 2016, average weekly earnings have increased by 16%, which is exactly double the rate by which social welfare has increased.  The inevitable consequence has been that we have failed to make significant progress in reducing levels of poverty, despite the country enjoying growth rates that are among the highest in the world.<\/p>  <p>  The most vulnerable have been allowed to fall further and further behind.  In Ireland, almost 700,000 people are living on an income below the poverty line and child poverty rates are among the highest in the OECD.  We cannot afford to create a permanent and expanding underclass in this country because if we do, we will have within our society a growing army of people who will remain shackled to poverty indefinitely.  The long-term consequences of this for Irish society and politics would be profound and would not be for the good.<\/p>  <p>  A question I had intended to put to the Minister was whether she intends to reform the system whereby increases to the fuel allowance are the only compensation for increases in carbon tax.  A huge cohort of social welfare recipients do not receive the fuel allowance at all.  A huge cohort on very low incomes, who rely on what used to be the family income supplement for their weekly survival, do not get the fuel allowance at all.  Are those people expected just to suck up an increase that is being introduced because some people believe it will change people's behaviour, whatever about the evidence?<\/p>  <p>  I will defer to my colleague Deputy Smith.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900041#TT00200","speaker":"1492"},{"type":"speech","time":1607530500,"counter":302,"content":"<p>I compliment the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, on some of the measures introduced in this important Bill.  As we all know, it gives effect to the social protection measures announced in budget 2021.  As Deputy O'Dea said, it is the largest budget in the history of the Department and the country.  Unfortunately, a substantial amount of the expenditure is caused by the pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  I took the opportunity previously in the Chamber to compliment the officials at local level on their great response since mid-March to ensure nobody was left without support when they lost their jobs so unexpectedly because of the pandemic.  Great credit is due to officials at local level.  I interacted with them not only from Monday to Friday but also over the weekends.  They tried to ensure every claim was processed and dealt with as quickly as possible.  We should all be conscious of that.  The staff were under undue pressure as well as others.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge the pandemic unemployment payment is flexible.  It is important that flexibility has been built into the scheme because, unfortunately, it may be necessary again to move the country to a higher level of restriction, which will affect business, commerce and places of employment.  I hope it will not be.<\/p>  <p>  Importantly, this Bill defers the proposed increase to the pension age next January.  I firmly believe that the pension age should not be increased.  We should bear in mind when setting the pension age the significant demands often placed on people in employment, be they in trades, on farms or in other kinds of physical work.  At times, such work is very demanding on an individual.  It is not acceptable that a person in his or her late 60s must still go to work.  There is no justification for an increase to the pension age in the future.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the fact that there was an increase to the living alone allowance.  That is important because a person living alone who depends entirely on the State pension, be it contributory or non-contributory, is under pressure all the time to make ends meet.  It is important that the living alone allowance be given status.  I hope it can be increased over the years to come.<\/p>  <p>  This legislation provides for the bringing forward of regulations so that 65-year-olds who are required or choose to retire early can receive an early retirement allowance or pension at the same rate as the jobseeker's benefit without being required to sign on, partake in any activation measures or be available for and genuinely seeking work.  All public representatives know of people who worked all their lives and who had to go to a social welfare office when they had to give up their employment at 65 years.  Never before in their lives had they been to a social welfare office.  It was absolutely wrong that those people had to sign up for the jobseeker's benefit.  They had to leave their place of employment through no choice on their own.  I am very glad the regulation is being introduced to put an end to this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900041#TT00300","speaker":"1556"},{"type":"speech","time":1607530500,"counter":303,"content":"<p>I want to make a couple of comments on what I have heard in the debate so far.  I welcome the contribution by Deputy O&rsquo;Dea.  In the short period during which I was a member of a committee with him in the term of the previous D&aacute;il, I learned a lot from him and found him to be very progressive on these issues, but his remarks stand in stark contrast to those of Deputy Carroll MacNeill.  What she said was quite startling.<\/p> <p>The issue of inequality may look good from the vantage point that she has but the reality is very different for those outside the upper middle class enclaves that she represents.  The aphorism \"a rising tide lifts all boats\" was changed in recent years.  The new phrase has become commonly used to describe social inequality across the world.  It was changed by a black American writer to \"a rising tide lifts all yachts\".  That adjustment is correct in the modern world.<\/p> <p> I welcome the fact that the threat over the heads of many workers who were due to retire next year at the age of 66 has been lifted and that, for now at least, they will get the pensions to which they are entitled.  I am concerned, to say the least, about the commission that is being set up and its remit.  We have seen, over the years, that when Governments and Ministers want to push an unpopular policy, they hire an outside expert or commission to conduct a review, scoping exercise or investigation.  That provides the thin veneer that they need to implement the policy that they wanted in the first place.  I have no doubt that such a commission will come back with a plethora of excuses and a veneer to cover the Government in some kind of excuse.<\/p> <p> We know that raising the retirement age in the case of access to the State's contributory and non-contributory pension is a policy which Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, the Labour Party and the Green Party have supported.  They supported it before the most recent election.  When it became a hot potato, they changed their policies only because of the campaign by ordinary people and the outrage from the workers affected.  That campaign will have to stay active on the streets and the trade union movement will have to continue to push the demand that the pension age is not raised because, when one reads the commentary on this issue, it is clear that the great and the good in economic circles are all agreed that we must raise the pension age.  We do not agree with that.  The arguments marshalled time and again to ram this policy down our throats are not matters of fact, but matters of politics.  People are living longer but workers today are far more productive during their working lives than previous generations.  The Social Insurance Fund has only a fixed amount of money in it, but that can be changed, not least by increasing the rate and amount that employers pay in PRSI contributions.  We still have one of the lowest rates of employer contribution in Europe and our higher life expectancy is one of the reasons why workers' rights and entitlements to benefits to the social wage are weak relative to other European states.  We still have a growing number of over-65s who will live longer in the decades ahead, but the lack of pensions in the private sector and the poor returns to many ordinary private pensioners are not inevitable things like the weather but a function of the general crisis in capitalism and the decline in returns for equities and bonds, investments through financial means and so on.  The fact that the rate of those returns on investments made by many large pension funds has declined, and that employers have waged a war on defined contributions, are not natural phenomena that cannot be dealt with other than by cutting pensions or by raising the age to which people have to work.  This should not be a problem to modern society.  The fact that people are living longer should be something we celebrate and reward.  Pensions, after all, are deferred wages.<\/p> <p> On a related issue connected to the Social Insurance Fund and the insolvency fund, I want to comment on the extension on 30 November of the provisions in the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act relating to workers' ability to access redundancy payments.  That extension suspended the rights of workers on short-time or lay-off arrangements to activate statutory severance after four weeks or six weeks in a 13-week period.  That was last week extended for the fourth time.  It had originally been suspended at the outset of the Covid-19 crisis on 13 March until 31 May.  It was later extended to 10 August and 17 September, and was extended again on 30 November.  The general secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, Ms Patricia King, has said that since the Redundancy Payments Act provides that laid-off service is not reckonable for redundancy payment, the consequence for workers who are currently laid off due to no fault of their own and may be redundant in the future is that they will forgo this period of time as reckonable service.  For those continuously laid off since the start of the pandemic, the period of service is now over eight months and may well end up being a full year or more.  ICTU has made it clear to Government that the continued extension to the freeze on the operation of section 12 of the Redundancy Act is unfair to workers.  ICTU has requested that this matter be rectified and the Government has failed to respond.  I support ICTU's call.  We did not object at the time to this measure being introduced as it was temporary, an emergency measure etc.  We cannot continue to support a measure that is now, effectively, punishing workers and denying them the right to claim payments while allowing employers to continue to make workers redundant.  The argument put forward for extending the measure, that is, that it may save jobs, is now fairly threadbare.  It is at least as much about stopping claims falling on the State.  The people who are going to lose out are, as always, the workers.  We are told that the aim of the measure is to ensure that businesses in financial trouble due to the Covid restrictions are not pushed over the edge financially by laid-off employees activating their severance rights.  The suspension of the rights of workers on short-time or lay-off to activate statutory severance after four weeks or six weeks in a 13-week period was extended for the fourth time and this has to be dealt with.  Otherwise, it is a complete injustice to workers who have suffered under the pandemic.<\/p> <p> I broadly welcome the measures on the employee wage subsidy scheme in the Bill.  Although I know they are slightly technical and that the administration of the scheme is in the hands of a different Department, I have submitted an amendment asking for a report in part to highlight the extraordinary fact that Ireland is unique in Europe, as far as I can see, in the way it has operated the wage subsidy scheme and supports for companies hit by the crisis.  Of course we wanted workers, their incomes and take home pay supported, but there has been a complete lack of oversight or regulation of the wage subsidy scheme and the current employer wage subsidy scheme.  The Minister for Finance has made it clear that the profit levels of any company availing of supports are not an issue.  This is a State which engages in the most minute and detailed examination of individual workers and, for example, lone parents who apply for State support.  Consider a profitable company such as Boston Scientific which has numerous profitable chains of nursing homes, various aviation companies, airlines and meat plants.  It and other global, multinational corporations have remained profitable.  Many of them are using tax structures in this country that mean they do not publish their accounts here.  Many have continued to award enormous bonuses to their CEOs during the pandemic, while availing of these schemes.  Most insulting of all, many of those corporations have not even been topping up their workers' wages by much.  They have been doing so to a minimal amount.<\/p> <p> I raise the continued discrimination faced by young people living at home, who are unemployed and on jobseeker's allowance.  Eighteen to 24-year-olds get just &euro;112 a week unless they live independently.  How any young person is expected to live independently in the current housing crisis is a separate issue, but it is important to recall that this was an austerity measure.  One of the most obvious and brutal messages during the austerity years sent a clear signal to our youth that they had to leave the country or get used to living in poverty within State supports when they are out of work.  When we introduced the JobPath schemes, we sent another message that told people to stay here and we would help them to take up low paid, precarious employment by forcing them, with the threat of sanction on their social welfare entitlements, to take up such work regardless of how suitable it is.<\/p> <p> The continued lower rate of jobseeker's payments for the under 24-year-old living at home is a legacy of the policy of an era that should be called out for what it was, namely, a punishment for being unemployed.  This becomes important again in light of the recession and the Covid-19 crisis because we know that young people have been disproportionately hit by lay-offs.  We were told in June that half of the people under 24 were unemployed.  New figures released by the Central Statistics Office, CSO, suggest that the country's unemployment rate, including those in receipt of Covid-19 payments, was at 26.1% in May.<\/p> <p>Breaking down those results, the monthly unemployment rate for those aged between 15 and 24 was 13.5%, while it was 4.5% for those aged between 25 and 74.  The figures may have changed since the summer but I believe that broadly the impact on young workers in this State remains the sharpest.  For all our talk in the House recently about mental health issues, the impact of this sort of treatment of young people is punishing on their mental health, self-respect and self-esteem.  It needs to be examined.  We will call for a report within three months on the impact of this measure on young people.<\/p> <p> I refer to fuel poverty.  I worked on the climate action council for a year and a half, drafting a report that was based on the Citizens' Assembly recommendations.  That report included serious recommendations, which are feeding into how we draft the current work on the climate Bill.  There was serious argument about it but we got a serious priority recommendation that the Government of the day and subsequent Governments would conduct a report and study into fuel poverty across Ireland.  That was to happen before any consideration was given to raising the existing carbon taxes.  Guess what?  It never happened.<\/p> <p> Fuel poverty is currently measured on the receipt of fuel allowance but it does not cut it.  It is not just about poor people, who are entitled to fuel allowance, because many working people on low pay suffer from fuel poverty.  We all know the stories.  Whether it is about trying to heat one&rsquo;s home, run a car or cover transport costs to and from work, it impacts on many more people than the current system acknowledges.  Deputy O'Dea was correct that we need to examine what we mean by fuel poverty, how many people it is impacting and the impact the raised carbon taxes are having on those who live without public transport or in poor quality housing.  I have come across, as I am sure many Deputies have, couples who live together and who are not entitled to fuel allowance because they are a few euro above the threshold.  That cuts them out not just of fuel allowance but of being able to access grants from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, to retrofit homes and claim other supports.  In reality, many people are making a choice between how they eat and what they eat and how they heat their homes.  This is just not fair.<\/p> <p> A &euro;100 subsistence payment was given at the start of the pandemic to those who rely on prepaid energy in their homes.  That is being reclaimed from them at the rate of 60% and many reports have come in to many of us of people putting their meter card in for &euro;10 and getting &euro;4 of energy back.  That is happening now, as we speak, in this cold climate.  I have written to the energy regulator and raised it with the Minister and it continues to happen.  People are freezing tonight because of this penalty and it is not being dealt with.<\/p> <p> I agree it is a shame that we are not raising the benefits to our pensioners in this budget and have not done so.  As was pointed out by an earlier speaker, inflation on ordinary items - not on yachts - has risen substantially over the past few years.  We may say this has to be done because of the Covid crisis and the subsidies that were paid out, but we missed an opportunity,  Maybe we could still address it by going back to the very wealthy and those who benefit from the crisis, that is, high-tech companies, the pharmaceutical industry and other industries whose profits rose during the crisis, and require them to pay a Covid solidarity tax.  That could be how we retrieve the income, rather than hitting the poorest section of society again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900041#TT00400","speaker":"1486","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607531700,"counter":306,"content":"<p>I thank my colleague, Deputy Kerrane, for tabling five important amendments to this Bill.  Sinn F&eacute;in's amendments will help carers, those at risk of fuel poverty, jobseekers and workers, such as musicians and  I hope the Government supports them.<\/p>  <p>  I will raise a number of issues with the Minister.  Workers in the aviation sector have faced a particularly significant challenge this year, with many on substantially reduced wages or having been let go altogether.  I and other Sinn F&eacute;in representatives have repeatedly raised the case of Aer Lingus workers, who were being obstructed by their employer and the Minister's Department from accessing social welfare entitlements.  This issue was eventually resolved for the EWSS but it has not been resolved for the TWSS.  We are told by the Department that workers will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis but the truth is, on a case-by-case basis, these workers are crying foul.  They are seeing a cut-and-paste response from the Department.  For days in April, May and June when they were explicitly told by their employer they were on reduced days, their UP80 form is coming back all Os and no Xs.  Unpaid leave is turning into something else.  I call on the Minister in the strongest terms to intervene personally in this matter.<\/p>  <p>  I turn to the matter of fuel and energy poverty.  I welcome the increase of &euro;3.50 per week in the fuel allowance.  However, this is the Government giving with one hand and taking far more back with the other.  The 14% increase in the fuel allowance is totally eclipsed by the 30% increase announced in the carbon tax and the 130% hike in the electricity public service obligation, PSO, levy.  The punitive carbon tax will increase the price of a bag of coal or tank of oil for people as they try to heat their homes over winter.  The enormous increase in the PSO levy will leave households with higher bills over the next 12 months.<\/p>  <p>  Under section 25 of the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act 2019, the Minister was required to commission an impact assessment on the current and projected future increases in carbon tax on low-income families.  It found from various researches conducted that carbon tax increases will impact disproportionately on low-income households.  That needs to be addressed and I encourage the Minister to do it in this Bill.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900043#VV00200","speaker":"1507"},{"type":"speech","time":1607531700,"counter":307,"content":"<p>Teachta&iacute; Crowe and O'Connor are sharing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900043#VV00300","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1607531700,"counter":308,"content":"<p>I will address some points made by Deputies Br&iacute;d Smith and Gary Gannon.

She specifically targeted the pharmaceutical companies we are so reliant on now, not just for vaccines, but for our entire economic structure as we face down a pandemic and the economic ravages it has brought.

Most crucial for my party, Fianna F&aacute;il, is that one of the issues we pushed strongly on in the election campaign was the pension age.  It was planned to raise this on 1 January 2021 but this has been deferred and it will remain at 66 years.  The planned increase from 67 to 68 years, which was scheduled to happen on 1 January 2028, is also being repealed in this legislation.  It means the commission on pensions can sit down to properly investigate the situation and come up with proper solutions.  I hope the pension age will remain for the considerable future at the age we have set it at now.  I am glad regulations have been brought forward so that 65-year-olds who choose to retire early will receive an early retirement allowance or pension.  This Bill targets people who are living on their own and who have probably felt the effects of Covid more than anyone.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge the huge expenditure in this budget.  In particular, while the core rates of social welfare have not changed, the fact remains that the expenditure in the Minister's Department is 41% up this year.  That is evidence of the job losses and temporary lay-offs that have been brought on by Covid, but also of the positive reaction by Government to step in and ensure things do not go to the wall.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900043#VV00400","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speech","time":1607532300,"counter":309,"content":"<p>I wish to use my time to discuss the deferral of the planned increase in the State pension age, which will remain at 66 years pending the report of the commission on pensions.  I wholeheartedly welcome this.  Fianna F&aacute;il's manifesto during this year's general election promised to establish a commission to examine the State pension age and defer further age increases pending that examination's completion.  The increase was controversial and a dominant issue during the general election, and rightly so.  It is right that people who have paid for State services throughout their lives enjoy their later years and are not forced to continue working or actively seek social welfare payments.<\/p>  <p>  It was subsequently agreed in the programme for Government with Fine Gael and the Green Party to establish a commission on pensions to examine suitability and eligibility issues with State pensions and the Social Insurance Fund.  The commission will outline the options for the Government to address issues such as qualifying age, contribution rates, total contributions and eligibility requirements.<\/p>  <p>  It is critical that there be gender-equal representation and older people on the newly established commission.  While the commission's members are eminently qualified across a range of specialties, I welcome the Bill's repeal of the planned increase from 67 years to 68 years that was scheduled to happen on 1 January 2028.  This means that the commission can consider matters relating to the State pension age unconstrained by prospective changes.  However, we must ensure that a wide range of stakeholders are involved in the consultation process.  The failure to acknowledge the role of organisations that advocate for women and older people will skew the conversation and might adversely affect the outcome of the commission's work.  I suggest that, as one of our leading females in the Cabinet, this is a matter to which the Minister could give some consideration.<\/p>  <p>  The pandemic has had a major impact on social welfare expenditure in 2020, with &euro;27.3 billion being spent by the end of November.  That was almost &euro;8 billion, or 41%, ahead of the 2020 Estimates.  Such a large expenditure needs to be accounted for wisely.  The deferral of the increase in the State pension age will cost &euro;221 million in 2021.  The 2022 full-year extra cost of retaining the State pension age at 66 years is expected to be approximately &euro;453 million.  The estimate of the net extra cost takes into consideration PRSI receipts forgone, movements from other social welfare schemes and secondary benefit entitlements, including fuel allowance, household benefit payments and the telephone allowance.  Such decisions are not being taken lightly by the Government.  From Fianna F&aacute;il's point of view, we want to get this situation resolved and are willing to put the necessary resources in place to do so correctly.<\/p>  <p>  All of this hammers home the message that, as parties in government, we must recognise that this is an important issue for many people across the country who have worked hard their entire lives and want to look forward to happy retirements.  We should handle this matter delicately and give it the attention and care it deserves.  I am confident that the Minister will do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900044#WW00100","speaker":"1516"},{"type":"speech","time":1607532300,"counter":310,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute on the annual Social Welfare Bill, which gives effect to proposals announced in budget 2021.

We in Sinn F&eacute;in would like to see an increase in the amount that can be earned to &euro;960 over a rolling eight-week period.  This amendment is supported by the Music and Entertainment Association of Ireland and would allow greater flexibility for entertainers to earn during busy periods while carrying them through quiet times.<\/p>  <p>  We need to listen to the people who are affected by our decisions.  I welcome the Government's U-turn on increasing the pension age to 67 years from January, but 66 is still too high.  It is wrong that our older people, who have given so much, are being forced onto the dole when they should be looking forward to a well-earned rest.  The Government can dress the payment up however it feels it should, but these people still view it as going to the social welfare office to collect the dole.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the increase in the carer's support grant to &euro;1,850 and its annual payment in June.

We have seen unprecedented demand on the Department.  It is important that we think about its staff, the Minister and the people running the Department.  They have done Trojan work under severe pressure in a short time to ensure that most people affected by Covid-19 have been dealt with.<\/p>  <p>  When the Covid restrictions were introduced by the previous Government, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and I discussed some of the anomalies in the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, and how they had arisen.  We accept that there will be anomalies when an scheme is introduced in an emergency, but I call on the Minister for Social Protection to think of over-66s who are in receipt of pensions and, for example, own pubs that are closed.  There are still costs associated with their pubs.  Whereas others who were not at pension age got &euro;350 per week, over-66s were still only on their pensions of &euro;234 or &euro;235.  The difference between &euro;350 and the standard pension rate would have been of considerable help to them.  They are suffering because of that.  Will the Minister examine this anomaly?  It does not affect too many people and it is important that we examine it.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to cite two further issues.  The issue of families looking for carer's allowance is regularly raised at my office in Tuam and when I meet constituents around Galway East.  The time it takes to process an application for carer's allowance is in the region of 15 weeks.  There is often a refusal, at which point the application must go to a review and then an appeal.  Some people have given up work to care for someone at home and could be without an income for up to 30 weeks.  While I accept that if they are granted the carer's allowance, it will be backdated, but will the Minister examine the structure of the application process?  Will she set in place a reasonable timeframe of, for example, four weeks for decisions to be made?  If we are to keep people being cared for at home, it is important that we provide their carers with the support they need.<\/p>  <p>  A long-running issue that I have encountered a great deal in recent years is that of the community employment, CE, scheme supervisors' claim for recognition and pension rights.  The Minister is working to find a solution.  Every community has benefited from the work of CE schemes.  It is important that we take on board the community dividends of the work that has been carried out by these schemes for many years, work that no other government stakeholder can do.<\/p> <p>Our towns and villages have benefited enormously from this but what we need to do is, once and for all, provide some sort of recognition for the supervisors who manage all that.  It is important because a number of supervisors have worked all their lives on these schemes.  They are part of the society in which they live and they are now going to retire.  Whatever proposition the Minister comes up with, it is important that all supervisors are included retrospectively.<\/p> <p> Lastly, on the whole idea of social welfare and what is being paid out, it is important we make sure the weakest in our society are taken care of.  People on CE schemes or rural social schemes who are over 55 and who have little chance of getting work again should be allowed to remain on the CE schemes.  We should concentrate our efforts on the younger cohort of people who are involved in JobPath or who are on jobseeker's allowance.  It is important that we look at this in a fresh light because many people on these schemes will not find jobs.  It is important that we make the T&uacute;s workers available to the companies that are managing the T&uacute;s operations.  They are finding it difficult to get the names from the Department of Social Protection.

At the outset, I wish to ask the Minister and her Department what they have got against the fourth child in working families.  I put this point to the Minister's officials when I spoke to them earlier in the week.  Is it the case that when the Minister was in the schoolyard years ago, a fourth child pulled her pigtail or something?<\/p>  <p>  It seems there is an agenda at present because every child under the social welfare system where the parent is in receipt of a social welfare payment is getting increased financial support in budget 2021 except for families with four or more children that are in receipt of the working family payment.  I find it bizarre that this small number of families across the country are the only ones who are receiving a payment from the Department of Social Protection and are being excluded from an increase in the rate of payment in this year's budget.  Therefore, an unemployed family with four children, two of whom are under the age of 12, will receive &euro;728 more next year in the child dependent allowance.  A one-, two- or three-child family in receipt of the working family payment will be &euro;936 better off next year.  The working poor with four children or more are the only ones being ignored in budget 2021.<\/p>  <p>  Many of the increases in these payments are to offset the increased costs of living due to the hikes in carbon tax but the working poor who happen, unfortunately, to live outside our cities can forget about it.  Those people would be better off staying in bed.  By the time 2030 comes along and we have a carbon tax of &euro;100 per tonne, half of the households in Dublin will be paying less than &euro;9.11 per week in additional transport costs when the Dublin Bus subsidy is taken into account, and yet, their rural neighbours who are commuting will be paying &euro;39.50 per week more.  That is four times more than those who have a bus passing outside their door every five minutes.<\/p>  <p>  The message, therefore, being sent out by this Social Welfare Bill to working families on low incomes with more than four children is to not do it; it is not worth it.  They are better off staying at home or living in separate homes claiming the one-parent family allowance.  It is all to save the princely sum of &euro;2.6 million out of a &euro;25 billion budget.  That is 0.0000000001 of the Minister's budget.  That is ten decimal points below 1%.  Next year, the Minister's Department will spend &euro;47,500 every minute.  I am seeking for the Minister to reallocate &euro;5 of that &euro;47,500 to those working families with four or more children who are on a low income and in receipt of the working family payment.<\/p>  <p>  In fairness, it is not just in this budget.  The Minister's predecessor, the then Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Senator Doherty, did the same thing on two occasions.  In this budget, however, every other child has received some additional payment because the child dependent allowance has been increased.  These small numbers of families and children, however, are the ones being blatantly discriminated against by this legislation.  That is wrong and I hope the Minister will review it before the passage and enactment of this legislation.<\/p>  <p>  I will turn to another issue.  It is an aspect I am surprised is not included in the Bill.  As the Minister will be aware, the Government has taken the decision to provide for medical indemnity for the six Covid-19 vaccines it has signed up to and pre-purchased.  I believe the Government has pre-purchased 8.5 million doses of vaccine.  There are more to come in terms of vaccine doses and we will probably have four or five more vaccines.  <\/p>  <p>  As part of the vaccination programme discussed by the Minister at Cabinet on Tuesday, recipients will have to receive two vaccine doses, which will have to be administered two weeks apart.  We are talking about two vaccine doses taken two weeks apart and six different vaccines floating around.  That is a recipe for absolute and utter chaos and we are asking the Health Service Executive to manage it.  This is the same organisation that lost 600,000 flu vaccines a few weeks ago and did not know where they were because it has not got the data systems to manage a handful of them.  How in God's name will it manage 8.5 million vaccine doses and more?<\/p>  <p>  We do not have a unique health identifier, which we legislated for here probably six years ago at this stage.  In the short term, while it is not ideal, the only solution is to use the personal public service number, PPSN.  It is the best short-term option to be able to monitor and manage the vaccination programme across this country.  To do that, however, we need an amendment to the existing legislation covering the operation of the PPSN.  It is not in this legislation.  Without having some type of tracking mechanism, which in the short term is only the PPSN, then managing indemnity by the State Claims Agency in terms of these vaccines will be next to impossible.  We need detailed and accurate records.  They are vital to flag up adverse reactions to specific vaccines.<\/p> <p>It is imperative that we have as a matter of urgency a full debate in the House on all those related issues.<\/p> <p> I welcome the move the Minister is making on the pension age threshold.  People should be able to work beyond their 66th birthday if they wish to do so, and to continue to make PRSI contributions into the Social Insurance Fund, but they should not be forced to do that.  I have come across what I believe is an anomaly in the calculation of the total contributions pension, the new pension that has come in.  A constituent contacted me about the matter and the Minister might clarify in her response how it works.  Under the existing social welfare law, the PRSI record is based from the first day that a person pays his or her first stamp in insurable employment until the final full tax year before his or her 66th birthday.  That did not cause many difficulties when the number of stamps were averaged out over, say, a 40-year period, but with the total contributions approach, if someone's birthday is in December, he or she will lose out on 11 or 11 and a half months of stamps.  That could be the difference between the person getting a significantly higher rate of contribution and over the lifetime of the person's pension, it could have a dramatic impact on the rates he or she is paid.  The total contributions system should be calculated until the very last stamp is paid when a person reaches his or her 66th birthday or if he or she wants to continue paying pension contributions.<\/p> <p> As the Minister will be aware, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands sent her a submission yesterday evening on our deliberation regarding the pandemic unemployment payment.  I again ask her to consider the issue of self-employed people over the age of 66 who are not eligible for a State pension.  They should be deemed eligible for the pandemic unemployment payment.  We need to send out a message that it is okay to work beyond one's 66th birthday.  In this case, however, we are penalising those people who work beyond their 66th birthday and who have been forced to shut because of Covid-19.  On the one hand, we want people to work later in life and to contribute to the economy and the Social Insurance Fund.  On the other hand, those people who are leading in terms of those measures at the moment are the very ones being penalised by the pandemic unemployment payment.<\/p> <p> The Minister will also be aware that in that submission, we made quite a number of recommendations in respect of the music and entertainment industry and included a detailed submission from that industry in our final document.  I hope she will examine the submission received from the music industry.  It has recommended that the existing earnings cap of &euro;480 be doubled and I hope that can be considered.  Furthermore, the committee and I believe that the current structure in the calculation of that cap is too inflexible to meet the needs of the entertainment industry, and that we should also consider averaging that over the term of the pandemic unemployment payment.  We should remember that the objective is to get people within the music and entertainment industry back into full-time work.  That will not happen overnight - we all accept that - but any opportunity they have to get gainful employment needs to be facilitated in every way possible.  I acknowledge that the Minister intends to come forward with a statutory instrument, which she will present to the committee over the coming weeks, concerning how the Department, when calculating these figures, will take into account the costs of gigs borne by entertainers, and I hope a fair approach will be taken to that.  Nevertheless, we need flexibility.  That &euro;480 threshold really needs to be reconsidered, as does the period over which it is calculated.<\/p> <p> We need immediately to review the interaction of the pandemic unemployment payment with the wage subsidy schemes.  I fundamentally believe that every person possible should be kept on a wage subsidy scheme rather than being forced down the road of the pandemic unemployment payment.  It is imperative to keep that connection between employers and employees.  It is better from an employer's point of view in getting people back on an incremental basis to full-time work and it is better for the employee in trying to maintain his or her current level of income, rather than taking a drop to the level of the pandemic unemployment payment and having to sign on for that.<\/p> <p> Finally, I compliment the Minister, her predecessor and her team of officials in the Department, and in particular the officials in the regional offices in Roscommon, Longford, Sligo, Letterkenny and other places throughout the country on the tremendous work that was done in processing a phenomenal number of pandemic unemployment payment applications over a short period.  I commend them on their efforts in responding, often late at night and sometimes at weekends, to queries we raised with them.  I say \"Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agaibh\" to them for that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900045#XX00200","speaker":"1603","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607533500,"counter":315,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy Murnane O'Connor.  I welcome the opportunity to speak to the Bill.  There are a number of issues, one of which relates to the commitment in respect of the pension that is outlined in the programme for Government.  It is very important that it be tied down in legislation and that there be no ambiguity about it.  We must ensure that the pension is given at the correct age because, as people reach their 60s, they will have been working for more than 40 years in some instances, and changing the goalposts towards the end is completely unacceptable.<\/p>  <p>  Another important issue relates to carers and the carer's allowance and benefit.  In the course of the previous D&aacute;il, we raised the issue of the length of time it was taking - 14 to 16 weeks - to get a carer's allowance processed.  Thankfully, that is not the case at the moment and the applications are being processed faster, but an awful lot of work, preparation and documentation is required for an application to be successful.  One issue that has come to my attention over many years concerns cases where a person has to give up work to care for some family member, whether an elderly relative, a sibling or a child who needs full-time care and assistance.  If one of the partners is working, that partner's income is taken into account and it may put the carer over the limit for the allowance.<\/p>  <p>  If we are to talk about a fully inclusive society, and if we want to make things as right as possible for people who care for people with disabilities or who are infirm or ill, the application should be care assessed rather than means tested.  The process should examine the level of care that is needed for the person who requires full-time care and assistance.  If somebody is coming off work and has worked and contributed to PRSI and taxes over many years, irrespective of the person's age he or she should be considered in terms of a needs assessment.  The Minister might take that back to the Department to ensure that a needs assessment be considered rather than a means test.  A mechanism in respect of the carer's benefit was brought in almost 20 years ago by the then Minister of State with responsibility for labour, Tom Kitt.<\/p> <p> There is room to look at the carer's benefit and, if possible, to expand it, look at the contributions that people have made over a number of years - maybe five, six, ten years or something like that - and consider what they have paid in PRSI.  If they have met a certain criteria for PRSI paid, they could be paid carer's benefit for the time that the care need is deemed to be necessary.  That would allow people who are providing full-time care and assistance for a family relative of any age the dignity to have their own money while they are doing an immensely important job on behalf of the State.  This is vitally important.  We should recognise carers in all aspects of our society.  During the pandemic, many of them have been providing care and assistance at every level.  It is important that we look at it in the context of the challenge that is there now and as we move forward.  There is scope in this regard and legislation should be drafted within the Department.  Having looked at the existing legislation, for somebody who is coming off of work and has been paying taxes and making PRSI contributions, there should be a mechanism to extend the carer's benefit for longer than two years provided the care need is necessary and that an assessment of need has been carried out.  I ask the Minister to look at that.<\/p> <p> I welcome the contributions.  I could discuss a raft of issues relating to social welfare.  I compliment the Minister and all the officials in the Department of Social Protection who work so hard to provide a service as best they can and, in particular, for doing so in recent in most challenging circumstances.  There are anomalies with many systems and we try to bring them to the attention of the D&aacute;il as best we can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900046#YY00200","speaker":"1456","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607534100,"counter":317,"content":"<p>I take this opportunity to welcome the news that the Christmas bonus is being issued this week.  Preserving the State pension qualifying age at age 66 was so important.  All of us had fought for that.  I welcome the &euro;5 increase in the weekly living alone allowance.  More than 600,000 people are to benefit from the Christmas bonus - the double payment.  Together with the fuel allowance increase, these are all good supports.<\/p>  <p>  Where I have a problem, and I will highlight it again, is in terms of the lack of support for carers.  Following the budget announcement of a &euro;150 increase to the carer's support grant, I was dismayed to learn that the measures will not take effect until June 2021.  I ask the Minister to change that.  The increase is so important.  Carers play a huge part in society.<\/p>  <p>  I recently asked why persons 66 years of age are not considered for the Covid-19 crisis payment.  These people had been working up to the onset of Covid and I was told that they could quality either for the contributory State pension or the non-contributory State pension.  These are people are hale and hearty and they deserve to be able to get the Covid payment.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the decision to return to weekly collection of social welfare payments.  As a result of this change, people will be able to go to their local post offices once a week.  It was needed because the previous change had a negative impact.  We need to keep our post offices open.  It is important that we make sure all of us are working together because the post offices play a huge part in this.  It is so important that people, even in collecting their benefits, go to the post office.<\/p>  <p>  There is only one issue I want to ask the Minister about and that is the supplementary welfare form.  The local authorities used do a lot work on heating repairs, where, for example, a shower was broken or something in general was really needed.  They do not do that anymore.  We now have the so-called social welfare form.  I am asking the Minister to increase the funding relating to that.  A number of the people are coming to my clinics seeking to get work done, whether to a shower, a heating system, a roof or whatever.  I am asking the Minister if she could put more funding into that because it helps those who are most in need.  We need to provide greater funding in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900047#ZZ00200","speaker":"1511"},{"type":"speech","time":1607534100,"counter":318,"content":"<p>It must be said that this has been an extremely challenging year for workers and businesses, but also for the Department of Social Protection.  I refer to the landscape that exists now .  I acknowledge the work done by the Minister and her predecessor in this regard.  I particularly thank the staff of the Department of Social Protection.  During the first period of crisis, it was a time of immense pressure and the response times were good in ever-changing schemes.  I acknowledge that and comment those involved.<\/p>  <p>  This legislation before us illustrates to a large extent the role that Sinn F&eacute;in has played as an Opposition party.  When I look at some of the issues that are being dealt with here, I see some of those that we have prioritised.  These are: the pension age and stopping the increase to 67 years; the PUP, which was previously cut, and we campaigned to bring back and increase, and it was - it should never have been cut in the first place; and flexibility for the self-employed in the context of the PUP and for them to this payment.<\/p>  <p>  On the pension age, when I went canvassing during the election campaign, I met people who, at 63 or 64, were coming up the pension age and looking at what lay ahead.  Some of them had worked from the age of 16, 15 or even 14.  These were people who had given five decades of work and who might have been working all, or the vast majority of, that time.  To be saying to them that they need to go on further, they were grievously offended.  Their families were grievously offended.  It is profoundly wrong.  It is crazy that those who are least likely to be able to keep working to 67 are often those who will most likely have to keep working to 67.  It is profoundly wrong to say to masons, floor-layers and people who are working in physically extremely demanding jobs that they have to keep going to 67.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the fact that the Minister has accepted the amendments in respect of the entertainment industry.  I am glad she listened to the arguments made by Deputy Kerrane.  It is a vitally important point on the flexibility that exists there.  I believe that also applies to taxi drivers.  We need to look again at the situation they face.  Theirs is a very particular category.  It is rate based and it is either a feast or a famine for them.  The hours that can be worked and the money that one get from driving a taxi do not always necessarily correspond fairly in the context of the PUP or the market that is out there.  They could have a few busy weeks but it could get quiet after that.  It will not be as busy as it once was because of the situation in which we find ourselves.<\/p>  <p>  The final point I want to make relates to people who get illness benefit and what happens after they get it.  They get illness benefit because of their stamps but they are put through the ringer after that.  The demands made of them - they might not get any money while they are waiting for approval for a disability payment or the invalidity pension - are arduous.  People are left in hardship.  We need to look at that.  People can go from a certain level of security for the period directly after they leave work if they are not fit to return to being under serious pressure.  We need to address that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900047#ZZ00300","speaker":"1460"},{"type":"speech","time":1607534100,"counter":319,"content":"<p>I, too, welcome the measures in the budget that were helpful.  It has been a very challenging year, as we know, for everyone from the cradle to the grave but especially for older people, those of pension age and, in light of the work they do, family carers.  Indeed, research carried out a year ago found that there are hundreds of children - children who should be at school or out playing and enjoying themselves - who are obliged to care for a sick relative, for example, a parent.  That is a very unfortunate situation.<\/p>  <p>  I want to start by complimenting the Minister on the Christmas bonus being paid today.  Goodness knows, we need a bit of Christmas cheer.  I certainly welcome that because it is necessary.  Our old people - we are all heading that way - made great sacrifices and worked very hard and they need to be treated fairly and with a bit of respect.  The increase, albeit small, in the fuel allowance has us going in the right direction.  It is certainly a help.  I say that in the context of the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill provides that a self-employed PUP recipient can engage in limited work and earn up to &euro;480 over a rolling period of four weeks while continuing to receive the PUP.<\/p> <p>That is vital because many of those people are loyal to their customers and their customers are loyal to them.  There is a great bond and relationship between them.  They were afraid to go out to do work in case they would lose their PUP.  For a plumber, it might have been a boiler that needed to be serviced or a burst pipe to be fixed.  Carpenters, kitchen makers and cabinet makers would be called to do some work in a customer's house.  It could be outdoors work, such as on a farm, where a milking machine repair man would have to call out.  The loyalty is there and thank God for it.  There should be more done for those people but what is there is a start.  T&uacute;s maith, leath na hoibre.  As I said, the bond is there between the self-employed person and the customer.  Most self-employed people have a loyal customer base.  Electricians, for example, will provide a service even when they are called out on Christmas Day.  That can happen.<\/p> <p> I want to thank the social welfare officers for the work they do.  I am thinking of Leo Coffey and his team in Cahir and the teams in Clonmel and Tipperary.  We deal with them all over the country, in Waterford and in the regions.  This year especially, they have pulled out all the stops and they have been marvellous.  I want to say that because they have a difficult job but they have been very helpful to my office and to me.  The interest of the customer is always put first and they do their best for people.<\/p> <p> Section 5 reduces the number of waiting days for illness benefit, which I welcome.  People used to have to wait six days but it is being halved to three.  That is very welcome.  It is not often I would praise the Minister but I am praising her in this case.  I do sometimes give praise.  I praise the bridges I go over, as the Minister knows.  It was kind of ironic that during the two-hour Private Members' debate we had a while ago, the speaker before me - I think it was a Deputy from Deputy Naughten's group - thanked the Minister for staying for the whole debate, which does not happen normally.  Lo and behold, I got onto my feet agus rith s&iacute; amach as an Chamber.  Chuaigh s&iacute; suas an staighre and she was gone, like snow off a ditch.  She told me the day after that she had to take a phone call, but I was fierce disappointed that when I got up, she left.  I was complaining that I would report her to my in-laws.  I have a lot of them in Cavan-Monaghan, but I did not do so after all.  It is very important that the Ministers listen to all groups.  We all have something relevant to say, I hope, with the Ceann Comhairle's permission.<\/p> <p> There are some good provisions in the Bill.  As I said, the arrangements for a number of payments is welcome.  However, the provision for carers is very disappointing.  Section 11 provides for an increase of &euro;150 in the carer's support grant, raising the payment to &euro;1,850, which is the highest level it has ever been at.  I certainly welcome that increase.  However, the grant often does not even go towards a holiday, break or anything like it.  There might be some work that has to be done in the house or a bill that has to be paid and it will go towards that.  I welcome the increase, which is very important in these tough times.  The carer's support grant is an annual payment for carers who look after people, giving them full-time care and attention.  There are many of them and the grant is paid annually in a single lump sum.  That is welcome.<\/p> <p> The situation regarding carers in general, however, is that they are the poor relation.  I always wear the carer's badge.  Chaill m&eacute; an ceann a bh&iacute; agam.  I do not have it at the moment because I need to get a new one.  It is very important that we support carers in the work they do.  No money would pay for it really.  They want to do that work and they are willing, ready and able to do it, but their contribution must be recognised.  I congratulate and thank Councillor Richie Molloy, a colleague of mine and manager of a carers group in south Tipperary.  He and the staff in his office do tremendous work.  Catherine Cox, the regional officer for Family Carers Ireland, also does great work.  They ask all the time that a carers charter be introduced and put on a firm foundation in law.  That has not been done.  We have nice talk and pious platitudes but we do not look after carers as we should.  The hospitals would be completely overrun if we did not have carers.  There is a danger as well of people becoming ill themselves.  They work hard 24-7 and goodness knows they need a break.<\/p> <p> There is also a huge problem at the moment in trying to get people to provide home help hours.  Even if people get approval for home help hours from the HSE, the personnel are not available.  Many of them have been forced into private employment.  I salute all the home helps, public and private, who go into people's homes.  They bring joy and hope as well as bringing messages.  They go above and beyond the caring work they provide.  It is unfair at times the limited amount of time they have in people's homes.  They would barely be in the door before they have to go again.  The home help service is a marvellous connection with the outside world for people who are confined to the house for many different reasons.<\/p> <p> Carers need to be supported but they are not.  During the Minister's term in office, I hope she will meet and engage with them when she can.  I hope she will try to embrace what they do because they do it so well and so willingly.  She must try to eradicate the need for child carers, that is, the young people forced to care for sick parents or other relatives.  They must be supported.  They should be in school, out kicking ball, going to dances or whatever they like best.  They should be able to enjoy their life and live it to the full, not be under the burden of being a family carer.  It is important that I raise the situation of carers during this debate.<\/p> <p> Regarding the PRSI arrangements for self-employed people, I am delighted that there is a slight change in this vital provision.  It was badly needed because it was very unfair that they could not get any illness benefit.  Efforts have been made there because they are the people we will depend on to recover our economy, set up businesses, pay their taxes and generate employment for others.<\/p> <p> Finally, I want to raise the whole situation regarding the PUP and the blackguarding, as I call it, of pensioners.  There are many people aged over 66, some of them publicans, who did not get a shilling from the PUP scheme.  All they wanted, and all I and many other Deputies and support groups have called for, is to give them the balance or difference between the pension and the Covid payment.  I know many pensioners who are pub owners.  Their pubs have to be heated and the utility bills and all the different bills that come in the door all the time must be paid.  They are entitled to support.  Many of them are self-employed bus or truck drivers or musicians.  They could not get any supports because they are getting the old age pension.  Publicans are in a desperate state.  Some of them have told me that only for the small savings they have in the bank - this was months ago - they would have gone under.  The restrictions have continued and they are still closed and the customers are still locked out.<\/p> <p> Their situation must be examined with a view to giving them some payment.  We need to support them and be fair to them.  When the &euro;350 payment was introduced, I advised against giving it to people who were only working seven, eight or ten hours a week.  I wanted payment to be assessed on the previous month's PRSI returns and people paid for the relevant number of hours.  All of the money used for that will have to be paid back.  That is in contrast with the over-66s, who did not get anything.  They feel very aggrieved and that they have been neglected and abandoned, which should not be the case.  They are entitled to a fair crack of the whip and to be respected.  As I said, even when the doors are closed, it costs money to keep a pub, with insurance costs and all the other bills.  Those costs did not come down.  The owners will not have any VAT returns now but they had year-end returns to pay and the heating and lighting.  Their utility bills are massive.  It is unbelievable.  If one has Sky, broadband and all the other things, they all have to be maintained.  It is very hard to do that on an old age pension and without any customers, especially when those customers were denied the right to go to the pub.  Publicans did not put out their customers.  The Government decided to close the doors of the pubs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900047#ZZ00400","speaker":"1612","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607534700,"counter":321,"content":"<p>I very much welcome this Bill, particularly as we progress towards the end of what has, by all accounts, been an extraordinarily challenging year for people.  When budget 2021 was published in October, I specifically addressed the social protection measures therein.  They represent very progressive levels of support that have been made available for people who have not only had a very difficult 2020 but may continue to face hardship well into 2021.  They will support people living alone, low-income families, one-parent families and carers in receipt of grant support.  There is a clear and targeted effort in the Bill to address the everyday inequality affecting people throughout Ireland.<\/p> <p>For example, a single parent with two children on an income of &euro;23,500 can expect to take home an extra &euro;4 per week or a total of &euro;314 per annum.  A retired single person in receipt of a State pension, considering the total changes in this Bill, will see an increase of &euro;358 per year.  A single person earning the minimum wage can expect to take home &euro;116 more in 2021.  These sums of money may seem small.  As a former primary school teacher, I have seen at first hand the children and families who live on the very brink of poverty.  For these families, that little extra at the end of the week can mean an awful lot.<\/p> <p> I am acutely aware that there are some criticisms of the social protection measures in budget 2021, including the view that they do not go far enough to address some of the fundamental challenges our country faces.  I accept and understand these viewpoints.  As much as this budget achieves - we must acknowledge that it is the largest in the history of the State - we would all like to do more.  Financial support is just one part of the picture.  We need to acknowledge that every effort is needed to address the deeper and more systemic problems across Ireland, including child poverty, for example, homelessness and the steps we are taking in ensuring a living wage for all.  This effort should be realised through forward-looking and coherent policies that are collectively designed and owned both by ourselves, as public representatives, but also by the public.  In this regard, I very much welcome the setting up of the Commission on Taxation and Welfare.  I also welcome the implied recognition that taxation and welfare are two sides of the same coin.  We cannot have a useful debate about improving our services unless we also consider how we are going to fund them.<\/p> <p> Future budgets should be about identifying how financial support can better contribute to people's overall quality of life.  Last month, the Green Party launched its position paper on well-being indicators.  I understand that there is much work happening at Government level on that matter as well.  In doing so, we are formulating a new way of evaluating how our society is performing from a much broader perspective, incorporating key priorities that contribute to a better quality of life.  The well-being indicators also seek to align both the design and implementation of budgetary spending with key social and environmental indicators.  I very much hope that, within the lifetime of the Government, we will see not just regular budgets but also well-being budgets introduced as we have seen elsewhere in the world.  This pandemic has taught us many things.  One key learning we will have to take away from it is that quality of life and the well-being of our country goes well beyond just measures that we see within GDP.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900048#AAA00200","speaker":"1617","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607535300,"counter":323,"content":"<p>One thing that constantly disappoints me in the D&aacute;il is how little time we give to deep debate about the Bills, for example, Finance Bills and Social Welfare Bills, which affect people day to day.  Unfortunately, this Bill has come in late.  It did not go to committee for debate.  It is not that the Bill is controversial but we need to have a debate on social welfare.  We can appoint all the commissions and experts we want.  I would love, however, if we set up a commission of all the people in receipt of social welfare who, in many cases, probably know the system a lot better than anybody else.  They would know its ups and downs, crinkles and pitfalls, anomalies and contradictions.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister knows I have strong views on what many people who do not have to actually deal with the system would consider rational policies.  I welcome the fulfilment of the commitment to maintain the pension age at 66.  We have two choices going forward and I will say this before the commission even reports.  We put up the age or we increase the funding that we all make towards our pensions.  We do not, by any means, have the highest social security contributions in Europe.  The great thing about social security contributions is that they are actually a leveller.  One pays according to one's means and one receives according to one's entitlements.  These contributions are an income distributor.<\/p>  <p>  What has been left out of this debate is that if one is in a certain type of job, such as our job, one can keep going, almost indefinitely, as long as one's health is good.  One is working mainly indoors and doing office work.  We see people in these types of job making the choice to continue after 66 and are quite capable of doing it.  On the other hand, in the case of those who do physical and manual work, such as block layers and plasterers, by the time they get to 60, they are technically fit for work by the Department's standards but they are not fit for the work that they are trained and capable of doing.  When people get to 60, they should be entitled to keep jobseeker's benefit indefinitely.  If a person has a chance to get a job, nobody is going to swap &euro;203 for a sum of between &euro;500 and &euro;800.  These are people who find it difficult to get jobs.  I would not call it jobseeker's benefit, I would call it pre-retirement allowance, as used to be the case.  People could claim such an allowance and would not have to be actively seeking work or signing on.<\/p>  <p>  We need significant reform.

A large number of people who would never have thought they would be obliged to do so have had to avail of social protection.  Many people look on the supports required from the State in a different way.  We have seen what we need, along with the weaknesses in the health service.  Whereas before some people may have believed in the broken health service we have, the idea of a proper national health service has been sold to many of them.<\/p>  <p>  It is only right to thank the officials in the Department of Social Protection with whom many Members work.

It is a sensible amendment and will make things easier.  We have all come across a large number of people who have fallen between various stools when it comes to social protections.  There are still people in need of social protection from other Departments.  For example, travel agents got supports under level 5 but they do not necessarily get them under level 3.  A huge amount of work still needs to be done.<\/p>  <p>  If the amendment on the carer's support grant is not acceptable, will the Minister look at paying some of that upfront to people who find themselves in difficult situations?

I welcome the fact the pension age will remain at 66 but we need to improve upon this again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900049#BBB00400","speaker":"1498","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607535900,"counter":327,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the fact this is probably the biggest social protection expenditure in the history of the State.  However, it is the biggest pandemic we have faced in the history of our State.  It was the responsibility of the Government to respond to the pandemic.  It was not because people lost their jobs or left their jobs, it was because public health guidance forced people to stay at home and not mingle.  This was the important thing.  It is good there has been cross-party support and recognition that &euro;203 was not a livable income and the &euro;350 payment was introduced initially.  This was a recognition that people cannot live on &euro;203.  A line has been drawn in the sand for the future with regard to payments for jobseekers and others.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the reversal of the increase in the pension age to 67 and then to 68 in 2028.  When this was first introduced by a Labour Party Minister in the Government of 2011, many people did not realise the impact it would have.  The first layer of people who were affected when the pension age was increased to 66 was a small cohort.  It was not recognised in society what was going on.  It was not out there with regard to how it would impact people.  I applaud the Stop67 campaign for insisting it was part of the debate during the election.  I also have to applaud the thousands of people who put pressure on the incoming Government to reverse the decision.  It was the people who really made the difference.  While welcoming it, it is very late to bring in the changes because many people who are retiring next year have been very anxious as they waited to see whether they would face the cut-off point at 67.  I welcome it but I feel it could have been introduced earlier to allay the concerns of many people.<\/p>  <p>  We are speaking of a difference of approximately &euro;2,300 a year between the pension and the jobseeker's payment.  It is no small amount.  Over two years, it would have been approximately &euro;4,500.  It is better in the pockets of people who can spend in the economy and that those workers can have an expectation of retiring at a certain age.  It always amazes me that when we challenge the massive plush pensions that politicians get, and they can receive three or four pensions if they have been Ministers as well as Deputies, we are told the expectation of these people is that they will keep their pension but for workers who, when they joined the workforce at 17 or 18, expected to get the pension at 65 all of a sudden it went out the door.<\/p>  <p>  It is good that the commission has been set up but, as has been said, such commissions are set up to play a role in covering the Government with regard to the decisions it wants to make.  I tabled a parliamentary question on the fact Stop67 was not invited onto the commission and I received a response.  We should go by the mantra \"nothing about us without us\", and the pensioners should be on the commission, as has been said by my colleague in Fianna F&aacute;il.  The commission should include people who will be affected by the outcome of the decisions made.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the pandemic unemployment payment and the Christmas bonus for retail workers, there is a letter to the committee and I have tabled a question on this.  The Minister replied that the move to ease restrictions from 1 December, including a phased move to level 3, was agreed and announced by the Government on 27 November and that as the pandemic unemployment payment week runs from Friday to Thursday, any person in receipt of it for one day of the period from 27 November to 3 December would receive the Christmas bonus payment, provided they also met the 17-week requirement.  This is welcome.  A number of workers probably returned on 26 November.  Will they receive the Christmas bonus?  The Minister made the point there were 352,000 people in receipt of the payment last week and compared it to this week's numbers for the Christmas bonus.  How will it impact on those few on the borderline who were asked return to do work on the Thursday?  Perhaps the Minister will reply on this.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the music industry, taxi drivers and the self-employed, I noticed the efficiency of payments being made when people applied for them, particularly when the changes were made to the pandemic unemployment payment in July and September.  At least 30 people who contacted me said they had sent in the form and were entitled to the &euro;350 or the &euro;250, whichever it was, but they were still being put on the &euro;203 payment.  When I put the exact same information to the pandemic unemployment payment re-rate team, those people were automatically re-rated to the &euro;250 or &euro;350 payment.  This happened in almost 99.9% of the cases in which I sent in queries.  This is quite a high rate.  I know many Deputies have said they applaud the workers in the Department of Social Protection, and so do I.  This is a snapshot of people who contacted me and I am sure many Deputies had the same number of queries from people on the payment.  It is a strange situation.  Were the people in the pandemic unemployment payment section told to put it to &euro;203 and if the people come back and make a representation through a Deputy, they would be re-rated to the proper rate?  It is very unusual that 99% of the representations we make are re-rated.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the fact the Minister has accepted the amendment.  Deputy Kerrane and I tabled the amendment whereby income would be &euro;960 over an eight-week period.  The Minister had listened to the music industry and had made the decision that it was possible.  In saying this, it is welcome that the Minister has accepted it.<\/p>  <p>  Another issue for the music industry and taxi industry concerns access to education while on the pandemic unemployment payment.  I would like the Minister to refer to this in her closing speech.  Are people able to go back to education from those industries and from self-employment and maintain the pandemic unemployment payment?  This will be important.  With regard to the taxation of the pandemic unemployment payment, a tax-free amount of up to &euro;203 would be a welcome benefit to the industry and to other self-employed people.  Will the Minister refer to this?<\/p>  <p>  The joint committee on social protection has made recommendations.  We raised the issue that the Government did not place enough emphasis on letting people know about the rent supplement.  Two or three people contacted me about the rent supplement and they had to jump through hurdles to try to get it, even though they had been on it for at least two or three years.  People were refused it.  I dealt with one case involving rent supplement payments in 2018, 2019 and 2020.<\/p> <p>This was despite the fact all of the information was there.  It is a very complicated application.  I ask the Minister to review how that rent supplement application is assessed.  It also makes the point that mortgage interest supplement should be reintroduced on the basis that, in September, when the changes to PUP were being made, the banks had cut back on mortgage assistance.  I believe mortgage interest supplement should be looked at.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900050#CCC00200","speaker":"1569","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607536500,"counter":329,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to participate in the debate.  I pay tribute to the staff, as I always do when I speak on this topic, because the Department of Social Protection has excelled in providing services, and I want to say that publicly.<\/p>  <p>  There were points in the Minister's speech that lie outside the legislation, such as the Christmas bonus, the earnings disregard for disability allowance and the increase in the fuel allowance, and I will come back to some of those shortly.  I welcome some of the positive things that have happened and the overall budget, which is &euro;25.1 billion, including approximately &euro;4 billion in regard to pandemic payments.<\/p>  <p>  I want to make some general points and then specific points.  Without the Department of Social Protection and without this budget, we would have a far more unequal society.  Those Deputies who came into the House today and talked about Sesame Street economics fail to see that the public purse is going some way to reduce the equality gap because the wages paid to workers are simply not sustainable.  Into that gap comes the public purse.<\/p>  <p>  The worst thing that ever happened in my short time in the D&aacute;il, and it will be my fifth year here in February, was the campaign led by the current T&aacute;naiste, then Minister for Social Protection, in regard to fraud.  It gave a completely wrong image of the Department of Social Protection.  In fact, the percentage of fraud, as I understand it from my time on the Committee of Public Accounts, is minimal and the level of error is higher.  However, a completely wrong message went out as opposed to a message going out asking people to look at what the State is doing in terms of payments so we can have a more equal society.  If the Minister was to do anything, I would ask her to run with a different image and to run with an image that is absolutely positive.  We cannot do without these payments.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the comments about Sesame Street economics and Deputies on the left not knowing what they are talking about, one has to understand that this budget is unprecedented because, as Deputy Joan Collins said, the pandemic is unprecedented.  The pandemic came into a country that was ill-prepared on every level, with a housing crisis and with more than &euro;1 billion going into the pockets of the landlords through public money, making the market unsustainable.  The pandemic came into a country where the health system simply could not cope and where decisions were made that led to people suffering - certainly people aged over 65 and 70, people in nursing homes, workers in meat factories and so on.  This happened because decisions were made on the basis of the inadequacy of our public services.<\/p>  <p>  On top of that, approximately 680,000 people were living below the poverty line, although that figure might be slightly down.  Of those, 200,000 are under 18, and that is happening in this Republic.  Then, we have at a minimum 100,000 working poor, and the workers who are working part-time who simply cannot get full-time work and are struggling.  That is only a little pen picture of the background that I am talking about when I talk about this social welfare budget.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to specific issues, I welcome the U-turn on the pension age, which is very welcome.  It is now confirmed this is not going to happen in regard to the increase from 67 to 68 and 66 to 67, and I hope the Minister sees sense and it goes back to 65.  I hope we will stop talking about people over 65 as a burden to the economy because they are certainly not a burden to the economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900051#DDD00200","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1607536500,"counter":330,"content":"<p>Well said.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900051#DDD00300","speaker":"1612"},{"type":"speech","time":1607536500,"counter":331,"content":"<p>They are contributors to the economy.  Their skills can be used in so many ways and we greatly need them in so many areas in our country, from teaching to helping out in different spheres.  They are not a burden.  They are active contributors.<\/p>  <p>  On the one hand, we look on them as a burden and during Covid we told them to stay behind closed doors, yet we utterly ignored those over 66 who were working in a very rude way.  The ESRI quarterly economic commentary in the summer estimated 65,000 people above the age of 66 - that is all - reported being in some form of paid work in the final quarter of 2019.   Such workers are not entitled to make a claim for PUP or jobseekers&rsquo; payments and, in most cases, they have lost employment.  For the life of me, I cannot understand how that very restricted number of people have been excluded.  At the same time, we are talking about increasing the pension age.  It simply does not make sense.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to the cost of disability, while I do not welcome it, I acknowledge there is a report from Indecon that is looking at this issue.  The Minister might confirm the cost of that report on the cost of disability payments, something we have all asked for.  If we are seriously interested in bringing equality, that is the most basic payment we could have.  The Minister might address the cost of the report and when it will be published, and come back to me in regard to her own views.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to carer&rsquo;s allowance and the once-off payment that is not means tested and not taxed, I very much welcome that.  However, the Minister perhaps captured the contradictions in the Government's approach to equality.  She stated: &ldquo;Section 11 provides for an increase of &euro;150 in the carer's support grant, raising the payment to &euro;1,850, the highest level at which it has ever been set.&rdquo;  To celebrate that, one has to put it in context and she is not putting any of it in context in regard to what carers do.  They are to be grateful for the &euro;150 extra, which is welcome, but without any context whatsoever.  The context is that carers are saving the State a fortune, day in, day out, and I think the Minister believes and accepts that.<\/p>  <p>  Family Carers Ireland figures show that 79% of those on carer&rsquo;s allowance struggle to make ends meet.  More than half of carers, some 52%, who participated in the State of Caring survey live in households with a total income of less than &euro;30,000 per year.  Almost one in three, or 29%, live in households with a total income of less than &euro;20,000 a year.  They had to put up with reduced home help hours during the pandemic.  Prior to that, they had to put up with hours that were given to them through the new computer approach - I forget what it is called - where there is a one-hour to two-hour assessment on a computer, and the computer tells the family how many hours are needed.  It has absolutely nothing to do with the level of dependence of the person.<\/p>  <p>  I want to give one example from my area of Galway without identifying the person.  This person is minding somebody who has all the symptoms of senile dementia at a young age - their 50s - and there has been no respite care whatsoever since the pandemic started.  Of course, prior to the pandemic, respite care was at a premium in any event but, during the pandemic, there has been none.  When you are talking about carers and clapping yourselves on the back - I do not mean the Minister personally but it is what she said in her speech - it does not strike a musical chord with me because I just see that person and that family as one example of the thousands who are struggling on a daily basis, up all night, up early in the morning, trying to care for their loved one, with absolutely no respite and limited hours.<\/p>  <p>  There are several other issues I want to highlight in the short time left to me.  The core rates of social welfare were left unchanged.  There is no movement at all to introduce a universal state pension.  As I said, there was no change to the cost of disability payment.<\/p> <p>Domiciliary care allowance was not increased and no steps were taken to equalise jobseeker rates for those between the ages of 18 and 24 and living at home.  There is no mention of those in direct provision and a possible increase in their allowance, as recommended by Dr. Catherine Day.<\/p> <p> We were to learn from Covid-19 and have a transformative change in our lives because we know we cannot go back, either in terms of climate change or inequality.  If we do not deal with inequality, we will never be able to face the next wave of whatever pandemic comes our way after this one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900051#DDD00400","speaker":"1577","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607537100,"counter":333,"content":"<p>Does the Minister wish to respond or does she wish us to proceed to take Committee Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900052#EEE00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1607537100,"counter":334,"content":"<p>I am happy to respond.

In response to Deputy Mattie McGrath, between last week and this week we will pay out &euro;500 million in payments.  Like the Deputy, I have been encouraging people to shop local because it is important that this money is spent in the local economy.  It should help businesses the length and breadth of the country that when people go out to spend that money, they go to their local shops to do it.<\/p>  <p>  A number of Deputies mentioned the fact that the Bill was delayed.  A good deal of time was spent on the Brexit Bill and a few other issues but I had to wait until I got the space to come into the House.<\/p>  <p>  At the outset, the Bill will give legislative effect to the changes announced on budget day and significantly, it provides for maintaining the State pension age at 66 years pending the report of the Pensions Commission.  This fulfils a key commitment in the programme for Government.<\/p>  <p>  Many Deputies raised the issue of pensions.  In addition to repealing the increase in the pension age, I have also committed to change the requirement for those who retire from work at the age of 65 to sign on for a jobseeker's payment in order to receive a State income support.  I will therefore shortly introduce regulations, and Deputies Sherlock and Kerrane raised this point, which will formally remove the current requirements for people of this age to sign on, participate in activation programmes or give an undertaking that they are genuinely seeking work.  This will formalise an administrative practice which has been in place for some time.  I hope to have that in place by the end of January.  It will be a special payment for those aged 65.  There will be no requirement to seek work.  They will simply complete the application form.  It does not involve signing on.  It is nonsense to talk about having to stand in dole queues.  That will not be happening.  This payment will be paid for 12 months.<\/p>  <p>  The pension age was mentioned also.  Expenditure on State pensions amounts to approximately 40% of total expenditure by my Department.  We spend approximately &euro;8 billion a year on pensions.  To put that into context, in 2020, approximately 28% of the Department's budget was spent on pensions so it has increased significantly over the past decade.  The pension payment in Ireland compares very favourably with payment rates in other jurisdictions.  The full contributory State pension here is &euro;248 but like many other countries, Ireland is not immune to the challenges of an ageing population.  The pensions issue does affect both young and old.  I have stated clearly that the State pension is the bedrock of the pension system in Ireland but it is in everybody's interest, both young and old, that we make sure it is sustainable for the long term.  <\/p>  <p>  The Pensions Commission has been set up.  It will come forward with recommendations that will take account of everybody's interests.  Its members have a full workload ahead of them.  They have already met twice, and possibly three times.  They are doing a great deal of work and I thank them for the work they are doing.  To be clear, I know the issue of pensions affects many women.  Six out of the 11 members of the Pensions Commission are women and the chairperson is a woman.  A few Deputies mentioned the Stop67 campaign and a number of others wanted to get on the Pensions Commission but their voices will be heard.  They will be given the opportunity to put forward their ideas and suggestions and to consult with the Pensions Commission, whose members will talk to them about their views on it.<\/p>  <p>  I am conscious of the need to maintain the sustainability of the State finances.  However, that is not the only factor to be taken into account when considering the State pension age.  As I said earlier, it is the bedrock of the system and it is extremely effective at reducing the risk of poverty for our pensioners.  The Government is committed to ensuring that that remains the case.  I believe I have covered all the questions on the pensions.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Mac Lochlainn raised the issue of the fishermen and their contribution to coastal communities and to the islands.  We have the fish assist scheme, which is similar to farm assist.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Sherlock raised the issue of fraud.  My Department, supported by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, has reviewed 70,000 claims, with savings of approximately &euro;94 million.  The Deputy also mentioned PPS numbers.  Two hundred extra staff are now working in that section issuing PPS numbers.  I am aware there were some delays but staff had been redeployed to other areas.  They are back working on that now and they are getting any backlog cleared as quickly as possible.<\/p>  <p>  On the question of seasonal workers, I want to clarify an issue regarding the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP.  If one goes back to work and for some unfortunate reason due to Covid one is laid off again, I wanted to make sure that one would be able to go back on the PUP, so we have extended it until the end of March.  In case anybody is concerned that if they return to work and unfortunately are laid off, they can sign back on the PUP.  It will remain open until the end of March.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of paid parental leave was raised with me.  All of us want to make life easier for young parents.  I hope that the sharing of the maternity leave and the provision of paid parental leave for both parents will, in time, remove the unconscious bias against women, particularly those who may be pregnant when they look for another job.  We know there is an unconscious bias.  I honestly believe that equalising the parenting responsibility and the supports we provide to both parents will eventually remove that bias.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of JobPath was raised.  We are facing record unemployment levels as a result of the pandemic and it is not a time to be cutting employment support services of any kind.  JobPath is just one part of this jigsaw.  We are also expanding the capacity of other contracted employment services such as the local employment services, job clubs and the EmployAbility service and these contracts also are being extended into next year.  I will be increasing the local employment services capacity by 50% from 20,000 to 30,000.  I want to expand the community based contracted services into four new geographical areas.  There will be an additional 100 job coaches next year.  The Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science is increasing investment in apprenticeship schemes.<\/p> <p>There will be 35,000 new education and training places for the unemployed.  I have made changes to the back to education and back to work allowance.  I will increase the number of places on the community employment and T&uacute;s schemes by a further 3,000.  These places will come on stream in 2021.<\/p> <p> Regarding JobPath, some people refer to the organisations involved as private companies.  One is an employee trust.  Its employees, including Irish employees, are the owners of the company, so it is 100% owned by the employees.  The other company that offers JobPath is owned by a farmers' co-operative.  It is not a commercial enterprise but a co-operative.  I know Deputy Kerrane raised this issue.  The survey of jobseekers showed high levels of satisfaction with the JobPath service.  These levels of satisfaction are similar to the level of satisfaction with the service delivered by my own Department, and are in the region of 80% or more.<\/p> <p> Deputy O'Dea raised the issue of fuel allowance, as did Deputy Gannon and others.  The cost to any household of any increase in carbon tax will vary depending on a number of factors, notably the energy efficiency of homes of fuel allowance recipients and the amount and type of fuel that they use.  Last year, the ESRI indicated that the additional cost of the carbon tax would be less than the weekly net value of the fuel allowance increase for at least the three lowest income deciles, the very people at whom the fuel allowance is targeted.  This finding is contained in its report, The Economic and Environmental Impacts of Increasing the Irish Carbon Tax.  It is important, when talking about increases to the carbon tax and the impact on low income households, to say that the increases for those with child dependants and those living alone will significantly benefit those same people.  There are many questions and I am happy to go through them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900052#EEE00500","speaker":"1450","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1607537700,"counter":338,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Social Welfare Bill 2020: Committee and Remaining Stages","time":1607537700,"counter":339,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900053#FFF00300"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1607537700,"counter":340,"content":"<p>Sections 1 to 5, inclusive, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1607537700,"counter":341,"content":"<p>SECTION 6<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1607537700,"counter":342,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 are out of order.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900053#FFF00600","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1607537700,"counter":343,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1607537700,"counter":344,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 3:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 5, to delete line 5 and substitute &ldquo;&euro;960 in relation to an eight week period,&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>  <p>I welcome that the Minister has taken on board the proposals, and the concerns and views of the music and entertainment industry.

I acknowledge and recognise the work of the Committee on Social Protection, Rural and Community Development and the Islands and its Chairman, Deputy Naughten, who raised this issue with me, along with Jackie Conboy of the Music &amp;amp; Entertainment Association of Ireland.  I also acknowledge Deputy Cannon, who spoke to me about it, and who is a passionate and committed supporter of our musicians.  I am happy to work with Members and to accept this amendment.  I thank the Deputies and the Committee on Social Protection, Rural and Community Development and the Islands for working with me and for their co-operation.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Naughten asked which expenses will be allowable.  I will make a regulation on it and the expenses will include petrol costs and insurance costs.  These are costs that I can prescribe in the regulations.  These are general costs that business people have.  One gets an income and takes away costs to get the profit.  It includes normal business costs, such as wear and tear, insurance and repairs.  Whatever income is after that is what we will calculate this on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900053#FFF01200","speaker":"1450"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1607537700,"counter":349,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1607537700,"counter":350,"content":"<p>Section 6, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1607537700,"counter":351,"content":"<p>Sections 7 to 10, inclusive, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1607537700,"counter":352,"content":"<p>SECTION 11<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1607537700,"counter":353,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 4 is out of order.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900053#FFF01700","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1607537700,"counter":354,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 4 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1607537700,"counter":355,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 5:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 6, line 5, to delete &ldquo;June 2021&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;January 2021&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>  <p>I am sure the Minister is open to looking at paying the carer's grant sooner than June, if that is possible.

The Covid adjusted unemployment rate is 21%.  The Department paid the Christmas bonus this week and last week 287,000 people received Covid PUP arrears.  The Department is currently adjusting its ICT system so that the parents' benefit can be increased to five weeks.  We are trying to get that out as quickly as we can.  Changing the date to 1 January would not allow carers to have sufficient notice of the changes.  The next planned payment date for the carers support grant is the first Thursday in June.<\/p> <p> I believe in listening to the people concerned.  My Department holds a pre-budget forum every year to which the representative organisations of carers are invited.  I am very happy to engage with the relevant stakeholders and the carers groups.  If carers would prefer this grant to be paid in January, it is certainly something that we will be happy to look at.  We are unable, however, to pay it next month due to the demands relating to PUP.  I will look at it next year if the carers' groups feel that there is a demand for this.  Some people may be happier to get the payment in June because it gives them the opportunity to, for example, take a break.  That is what it was intended for.  It was probably paid in June in order that people could use the money to take a break.  If one is in receipt of the carers payment, one will receive the Christmas bonus.  I would hate to think that if this money were paid in January, it would go towards paying another bill.  The fact that it will be paid in June might mean that people get to use it for the purpose of which it was intended.

I provide a basic income but we need to talk to the Department of Health in order to pay some carers for the amount of work they do.

Much work has to take place in the background before one can change these systems.  As I said, I am happy to look at this proposal and at what will happen next year.  I know that this has been a very difficult year for carers because they did not have the respite they would normally get.  Unfortunately, the systems cannot be changed this year.

The fundamental problem I have with these provisions is that the affected children are the only children whose parents are in receipt of a social welfare payment who will get no increase next year.  Bizarrely, parents in receipt of the working family payment who have up to three children will be &euro;936 better off next year.  With regard to the other social welfare schemes, the child dependant allowance is being increased across the board.  An unemployed family with four children, two of whom are under the age of 12, will be &euro;728 better off, yet we are saying the working poor with four or more children are entitled to nothing.  Every other child whose parents are in receipt of a social welfare payment will get an increase.  Will the Minister explain to me how it is not discrimination if we are picking out a small cohort of children who will not get any benefit?<\/p>  <p>  Let me remind the Minister of the reason payments have been increased across the board for children.  The funding is coming from the carbon tax so people on low incomes and social welfare payments will not be hit unduly by that tax.  Families with four children or more are hit by the carbon tax also.  These are the working poor.  It is not right that we should send out a message from the national Parliament that we are not interested in families among the working poor who have four or more children.<\/p>  <p>  The reality is that this is not an issue that has arisen only this year.  On the last two occasions that the working family payment thresholds were increased, families with four or more children were not included.  This is the third time that a Minister for Social Protection has come in here and left out that group.  The fundamental difference on this occasion, however, is that every other child whose parents are in receipt of a social welfare payment is to get an increase next year.  They are getting the increase next year because of the impact of the carbon tax, yet we are saying that the group of children in question will not get the increase and will have to carry the full burden of the tax.  It seems to have happened just at the stroke of a pen.<\/p>  <p>  I could understand it if budgets were tight and if we were talking about a prohibitive cost.  I acknowledge the Minister's sincerity in this regard but we are talking about &euro;2.6 million out of a budget of &euro;25 billion.  It makes no sense that the small group of affected children should be discriminated against while every other child whose parents are given a payment is to get an increase and is acknowledged.

It was forced through, or voted through, in the Finance Bill.  Large families have lots of expenses.  If they live in the country, they will have to pay even more carbon tax because they have to travel and there is no public transport.  It is unfair.  When considered in the context of such a large budget, as Deputy Naughten put it, the payment is very mean.  I believe it was Deputy O'Dea who once christened cuts as the 12 mean cuts.

The first point I will make is that my Department recently did two reports.  One was on the impact of carbon tax on low-income families and the other was on the qualifying conditions for fuel allowance with specific reference to jobseeker's allowance and supplementary welfare allowance.  Both reports were laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and I can arrange to send the Deputies copies of both reports.<\/p>  <p>  Energy poverty, which includes fuel poverty, is not the responsibility of my Department but instead comes under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan.  Research indicates that fuel poverty is best tackled in the long term by improving the energy efficiency of housing, which, of course, falls under the aegis of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien.<\/p>  <p>  The fuel allowance is a contribution towards the cost of heating a household.  It is intended to provide income support for low-income households, not to address the entirety of issues leading to fuel poverty.  A review of the implementation of the strategy to combat energy poverty will be completed in 2021 by the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  Alleviating energy poverty will also be a key consideration for the national retrofit plan and will be published next year by that Department.  There is ongoing work in that area.<\/p>  <p>  The amendment also calls for a report on the operation of the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS.  The legislation establishing the EWSS was brought through the Houses of the Oireachtas by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe.  It would therefore be inappropriate for me to accept this amendment.  Deputies will be aware that Revenue operates this scheme and therefore has access to the information that the Deputies seek.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the report on reducing the pension age, the Government has just established the Commission on Pensions, as Deputies know.  The commission's terms of reference encompass consideration of issues such as PRSI contribution rates, State pension age and contribution requirements, all of which are mentioned in the proposed amendment.  The commission will also be considering international comparators as a part of its work and it is due to complete that work and report by June 2021.  It would be pre-emptive and futile to accept this amendment because work on these matters is already under way.<\/p>  <p>  The amendment also calls for a report on jobseekers aged between 18 and 24.  A further amendment, in the name of Deputy Kerrane, is on the same issue so I will address both amendments at the same time.   It is not within my remit, as Minister for Social Protection, to report on the mental health of social welfare recipients.  However, I can confirm that my Department is currently finalising a poverty impact assessment of age-related rates of jobseekers or young people aged 18 to 24.  I expect the report will be available for me to consider within the coming weeks.  Jobseekers under 25 years of age who have qualified children, those who were in the care of the HSE immediately before they turned 18 and those who are in receipt of housing supports in their own right and living independent of the family home, for example on rent allowance or housing assistance payment, HAP, are not subject to the reduced rate of jobseeker's allowance.  This ensures that the most vulnerable young people are provided with the higher rates of payment.  Deputies will be aware that the Government has committed to improved jobseeker supports for people aged under 24 over the lifetime of this Government and I feel that the best way to support young people is to prepare and support them into employment.  That includes young people on the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP.  As the public health crisis subsides, we will engage with them to offer access and supports to return to employment.<\/p>  <p>  Those are my responses to the different reports that have been requested.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900056#JJJ00100","speaker":"1450"},{"type":"speech","time":1607539500,"counter":383,"content":"<p>On each of the answers, bar the one on the wage subsidy scheme, all the Minister has done is to pass the parcel for matters that are her responsibility.

At the end of the day, the St. Vincent de Paul Society says 28% of the population is affected by energy poverty.  In fairness to St. Vincent de Paul, it is at the coalface on this issue.  In 2018, it spent more than &euro;5 million helping families just with energy costs.  That is a huge amount of money for a charity and voluntary organisation to give to people.  St. Vincent de Paul has also made the point, which I highlighted earlier in relation to household debt, that a big part of household debt coming down the tracks is people owing money on utility bills.  St. Vincent de Paul has pushed this and the amendment I have tabled comes from that organisation, which is looking for the Minister to take action on this.

There was a commitment in a previous policy proposal put forward by the Government in 2016 which said the Government would look at allowing those on the average industrial wage to be able to apply for and qualify for the carer's allowance.  In the last budget, the hours worked or the hours of study outside the home was increased for those in receipt of carer's allowance from 15 to 18.5.  While carers could go out and work more hours, if they earned more it would impact their carer's allowance.  The increase in the hours should have come with a corresponding increase in the earnings they could make.<\/p><p>It is fair to say the income limits have not changed since 2008, which is a very long time.  The Minister said in relation to the earlier amendment that carers work 24-7.  I appreciate what the Minister said in relation to reports but a couple of years ago, I recall that we asked for a report which Indecon produced.  It was on the 2012 changes to the one-parent family payment for lone parents.  When that report came back, it showed precisely that Government policy had an impact and made life more difficult for lone parents.  Had that policy not been introduced in the first place or had a poverty impact assessment been done on it, perhaps many lone parents and their families would not have suffered so much.  In some respects, reports can make a difference and the Minister should consider this.  She has also made reference to the national carers' strategy, which was brought out in 2012 with no funding whatsoever.  That was accepted by carers at the time.  The money was not there and that was fine.  A new one will come and that needs to have funding.  On the income limits specifically, they have not moved since 2008 and the Minister should really look at this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900057#KKK00400","speaker":"1604"},{"type":"speech","time":1607540100,"counter":394,"content":"<p>I will speak briefly to amendment No. 8 proposed by my colleague, Deputy Kerrane.  The amendment asks to look at the income disregards for those applying for the carer's allowance.  It has not been updated in almost 13 years and the cost of living has certainly changed in that time.  I acknowledge that the number of hours a carer is allowed to work outside of his or her caring role was increased from 15 to 18.5 last year and that was welcome.  However, in many cases, carers who work the additional hours end up losing out because the carer's allowance is a means-tested payment which ends up being reduced.  The stringent means test means that family carers who perform invaluable work which saves the State billions of euro every year often feel worthless at the end of it.  It was supposed to be looked at by the Government which made a commitment to do this in 2016.  I ask that something be done about the income disregard.  Carers feel worthless as they are constantly means tested and, in many cases, they end up caring for someone all their lives.  They are not allowed to work very many hours and coming to pension age, they are means tested for that again.  I would like the Minister to address this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900057#KKK00500","speaker":"1513"},{"type":"speech","time":1607540100,"counter":395,"content":"<p>A comprehensive policy review of carer's allowance, including the means test, was prepared by my Department and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 28 August 2019.  I am happy to provide a copy of that.  In addition, on 15 August last year, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform published a spending review of carer support.  Among its key findings was that the carer's allowance accounted for 77% of total carer support spend.<\/p>  <p>  Given how little time has elapsed between the publication of these two in-depth reports on carer schemes, there is little benefit in doing another report.  However, as said earlier, I think we need a wider conversation about the important role carers play in our society and I suggest, as I did earlier, that the Committee on Health and the Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands engage on this.  <\/p>  <p>  The two principal conditions for receipt of carer's allowance are that full-time care and attention is required and provided and that the means test which applies is satisfied.  If somebody was an employee and leaves work to become a carer, carer's benefit may be the appropriate payment for him or her.<\/p>  <p>  The means test for carer's allowance is one of the most generous in the social welfare system, in that &euro;332 of gross weekly income is disregarded in the calculation of means for a single person.  The equivalent for someone who is married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting is &euro;665 of combined gross weekly income.  This means a couple with two children can earn in the region of &euro;37,500 per annum and qualify for the maximum rate of carer's allowance.  A couple earning &euro;49,750 can, due to the tapered withdrawal approach, retain a payment of just under half rate as well as getting the full carer's support grant every June.  Carers may also, subject to certain conditions, qualify for the household benefits package and a free travel pass.  A half rate carer's allowance is also payable with other welfare payments, such as pensions and disability payments.  The application of a means test not only ensures that the recipient has an income need, but also that scarce resources are targeted to those with the greatest need.<\/p>  <p>  I assure the Deputies that the Government is very aware of the key role carers play in society and will continue to keep the range of supports available to carers.  I can update the figures in the existing report.  I am happy to do that and provide that to the Deputies.  As I said earlier, the role of the Department of Social Protection is to provide a basic income.  It is not its role to pay people for the important job they do.  That involves the Department of Health and I believe that Department has a responsibility.  As the Deputies know, the Department of Health has responsibility for the national carers' strategy.  There needs to be a joined-up approach and my Department preparing another report will not in itself solve the genuine concerns Deputies have.  The Department of Health has a role to play in this.

I hope the Minister will at least consider this amendment.  A number of Deputies from all parties have raised concerns about the amount of taxpayers' money being spent on JobPath.  Last week and again during my Second Stage contribution today, I asked a number of questions on the referral fee.  Every time a person is referred to Turas Nua or Seetec under JobPath, the company gets &euro;311 once the person is signed up.  In more than 33,000 cases, the same person has been referred twice.  Is a payment of &euro;311 made a second time?  For the more than 1,300 people who have been referred a third time, is the referral fee paid a third time?<\/p><p>Now that the Government is extending JobPath for a further 12 months, is there a clause in the contract that allows the fees to be examined and reduced?  The Minister has made reference to the fact that Turas Nua and Seetec are not private companies, but I do not mind what they are.  My issue with JobPath, and what sets it apart from all other schemes, is the level of payments made to it &ndash; the referral fee and four other job sustainment fees, which start at &euro;613 and grow to more than &euro;1,100.  That is what makes JobPath unique.<\/p><p>The second part of the amendment relates to the impact on other schemes.  I do not know whether this point has been put to the Minister, but it has been put to me.  Community employment, CE, schemes cannot fill their places.  Referrals to the local employment service have fallen continuously because everyone is being pushed into JobPath.  People can participate in T&uacute;s and CE schemes on the side, but they have to keep up with JobPath.  If JobPath is so wonderful and great and people are happy on it, why can we not make the referrals no longer mandatory, let people who want to go on it go on it and let others do something else?  CE schemes bring significant benefits to communities.  Where people want to participate in a CE scheme, they should be allowed to.  I do not see why we have to keep pushing JobPath and ramming it down people's necks.  It takes a considerable amount of taxpayers' money.  We need to examine this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900058#LLL00100","speaker":"1604"},{"type":"speech","time":1607540700,"counter":398,"content":"<p>JobPath leaves much to be desired.  Turas Nua and Seetec are not private companies <i>per se<\/i>, but they are acting like private companies.  This is the wrong formula.  They get paid when someone is referred to them and when someone gets a position.  I have dealt with some awful cases where mental distress has been caused by the abuse people received and the hardships they were forced through under JobPath.  &quot;Turas Nua&quot; means &quot;new journey&quot;, but I call it &quot;Turas Uaf&aacute;sach&quot;, which means &quot;awful journey&quot;.  It has been an awful journey.  JobPath is a shameful scheme.<\/p><p>I have been a chairman of a CE scheme that has been running since 1988.

I thank the people in the Department who look after us.  However, we cannot get participants now because they are all tied into this Ponzi scheme.  If it walks like a duck and talks like a duck, it is a duck.  It is a horrible scheme and a turas uaf&aacute;sach.  I appeal to the Minister to do something about it.  People are being bullied and intimidated.  Some are on the verge of doing something awful because of the treatment they have received.  They have to get buses because they do not have transport to get to the towns where the offices are located.  Some of them are very intimidated.<\/p><p>It is a shame that JobPath is focused less on supporting the person than on just ticking boxes, getting people into jobs that they are unsuitable for and then collecting lucrative payments.  Whether they are private companies, semi-private companies or set up as limited companies, this is not right.  Two wrongs will never make a right, and this is very wrong.  It needs to be reviewed and this turas needs to be stopped in its tracks.

However, I have gone into this matter in great detail.  JobPath is providing a service.  It is only one part of the jigsaw.  I have been in touch with local employment service providers and want to increase the local employment service's capacity by 50% from 20,000 people to 30,000.  I also want to increase the number of officials in Intreo offices by a further 100 case officers so that they can deal with the workload.  This is all part of the jigsaw to try to help people, prepare them with their CVs and give them advice and all the assistance they need to identify jobs that suit them and return to the workforce.<\/p>  <p>  I will make the general point that legislation is not the appropriate vehicle for seeking reports.  My officials have explained to me that it is a stubborn creature and, after the report has issued, the relevant section is required to be repealed.  We can carry out reports without putting that requirement in legislation.<\/p>  <p>  Last year, my Department, in partnership with the OECD, published a comprehensive and detailed review that measured the effectiveness of JobPath service provision.  I have recently provided this report to the select committee.  My Department intends to continue reviewing the operation of the JobPath programme and will update the findings of last year's review in due course.  The OECD report indicated that the weekly earnings of people who secured employment following JobPath engagement were 17% higher than the weekly employment earnings of people who secured employment without the support of JobPath.<\/p>  <p>  JobPath is a mechanism through which support is provided.  It provides long-term unemployed jobseekers with access to an employment assistance and advice service for a period of 12 months.  It is a payment-by-results model with the day-to-day operational costs and risks borne by the contractors.  They are paid on the basis of performance.  With the exception of the initial registration fee, payments are only made when a client achieves sustained full-time employment.  Job sustainment fees are payable for each 13-week period of sustained employment up to a maximum of 52 weeks.  The total cost since 2015 has been &euro;247 million.  Given the number of engagements with almost 284,000 people, the average cost per client is &euro;873.  To answer Deputy Kerrane's question, while the JobPath companies get paid for a second referral, there will be no more third referral fees.  There will be two and two only.<\/p>  <p>  JobPath is not an obstacle to filling places on CE schemes or other programmes.  Since June 2018, persons availing of the JobPath service may also participate in CE or T&uacute;s schemes.  It is not the case that everyone is being sent to JobPath.  When my departmental officials examine the figures, they see that so many people go to JobPath, so many go to CE schemes and so many go to the local employment service.<\/p>  <p>  Now would be the wrong time to withdraw this service, given that there is 21% unemployment.  We need to keep it as part of the overall service.  In January, the main focus will be on trying to help people find jobs and get them back to work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900058#LLL00300","speaker":"1450"},{"type":"speech","time":1607540700,"counter":400,"content":"<p>The Minister has stated that not everyone is going to JobPath, but more people are being referred to it than to any other scheme.

The Bill was published on 19 November and, as Deputies will be aware, successfully concluded its passage through the Seanad on 26 November.  I welcome the support received in that House for the core principle of community rating, which is a long-established and well-supported Government policy for the health insurance market.<\/p>  <p>  This is a short and technical Bill comprising six sections, all focused under specific issue of health insurance.  This legislation is needed to revise the parameters of the risk equalisation scheme, which is a financial mechanism that supports our community-rated health insurance market.<\/p>  <p>  It is widely acknowledged that the events of this year have been unprecedented.  Covid-19 has also had a significant impact on the private health insurance market, particularly the claims experience of insurers this year.  This has caused much uncertainty regarding market direction in the year ahead, which is an important additional factor considered in setting the risk equalisation rates for 2021.  I will begin by briefly outlining the purpose of risk equalisation before providing an overview of the process undertaken to set the 2021 rates, and then outline the specific revises rates which will apply next year.<\/p>  <p>  More than 45% of the population in Ireland holds private health insurance.  Health insurance in Ireland is provided according to four principles, namely, open enrolment, lifetime cover, minimum benefit and community rating.  Our community-rated health insurance market means that the cost of healthcare insurance is shared across all members of the market.  In general, with certain exceptions, everyone can buy the same policy at the same price.  Insurers cannot alter their prices based on an individual's current or potential health status.  Older and sicker people pay much less for health insurance than they would in a risk-rated market and people who are less likely to need healthcare pay more than they would in a risk-rated market.<\/p>  <p>  The health insurance Act requires all insurers to apply community rating.  Older and sicker customers, however, are not shared equally across the Irish market.  Some insurers have higher risk profiles than others given they have a much higher proportion of older members.  The number of older customers insured is spread unevenly across individual health insurers.  This is a key issue within Irish health insurance.<\/p>  <p>  To support community rating and reduce the incentives for insurers to target or avoid particular groups of people, some form of risk equalisation is required.  Risk equalisation is, essentially, a transfer mechanism whereby money flows from insurers with healthier members to insurers with sicker members.  Without it, an insurer with older and sicker members would be required to charge much higher premiums than its competitors to cover its claims costs.<\/p>  <p>  The risk equalisation scheme was first introduced in Ireland in 2013.  Under the scheme, credits are paid to all insurers for their older and sicker members.  These credits are funded directly by stamp duty levies on all health insurance contracts written, with all moneys held in the risk equalisation fund.  In effect, the scheme redistributes funds between insurers to meet some of the additional costs of insuring older and sicker members.  None of the stamp duties on health insurance contracts goes to the Exchequer.  They are all redistributed from the fund to compensate for the additional cost of insuring older and less healthy people.  The risk equalisation fund is managed by the Health Insurance Authority, HIA, the independent regulator of the health insurance market.<\/p>  <p>  Amending legislation is required each year to update the amounts of credits paid to insurers under the scheme and the amount of stamp duties levied on health insurance contracts to fund the credit.  As part of the process, the HIA carries out an annual analysis and evaluation of insurers' market data focused on the claims cost every insurer has paid over the preceding year.  Based on this examination, the HIA determines the level of credit to be paid out from the fund and the stamp duties applicable to every contract for the following year.  This evaluation also includes information on market conditions, which is particularly relevant in the current pandemic.  The HIA consults with each of the insurers during the process to ensure the evaluation is thorough and informed.  In recommending stamp duty rates and credits to apply to the health insurance market for 2021, the HIA has the added consideration that market claims for the first half of 2021 were distorted as a result of the pandemic and the longer-term impact and market profile and membership is yet to be determined.<\/p>  <p>  This year's Bill seeks to amend the health insurance licence legislation to provide for: the amount of stamp duty levy to remain unchanged in respect of non-advanced contracts, that is, &euro;52 per child and &euro;157 per adult, and &euro;150 per child and &euro;449 per adult under advanced contracts; the level of hospital utilisation credit, HUC, to increase from &euro;100 to &euro;125 per night payable for overnight stays in hospital, while the level of the HUC for day case admissions is remaining at &euro;75; and a marginal decrease in the risk equalisation credits payable in respect of those aged more than 65 years.<\/p>  <p>Stamp duty rates next year, which are charged on every health insurance policy, will remain unchanged from 2020 levels.  It is considered, in view of the market uncertainty at this time, that the sustainability of the market can be aided by keeping stamp duty unchanged in the period ahead.<\/p> <p> The hospital utilisation credit is a type of risk equalisation credit paid to an insurer each time a customer attends hospital for an overnight admission or day case.  The credit acts as a proxy for health status since it is paid retrospectively and only when a customer needs treatment.  Increasingly, the HUC for overnight stays is intended to improve the effectiveness of the risk equalisation scheme by compensating insurers for the increased risk in providing community-rated health insurance products.  Age-related products are paid from the risk equalisation fund to insurers for customers over the age of 65.  These vary in amount depending on age, gender and the level of cover.  The Bill will provide for a marginal decrease in the quantity of some of the age-related risk equalisation credits payable next year.  While this means insurers will receive lower credit for some older customers, this is balanced by the increase in the hospital utilisation credit, meaning they will receive more credits for the customers who are hospitalised during the year.<\/p> <p> The HIA has recommended the rates for 2021 and the Minister for Health and the Minister for Finance have considered and accepted the recommendations on the basis that the rates will provide stability and some certainty to the market in these unprecedented times.  The amendments in the Bill are in line with the policy objective of the scheme to support community rating in the health insurance market in order that older and less healthy people can access health insurance at the same price as younger and healthier people.<\/p> <p> I will now outline the specifics of the Bill.  Section 1 defines the principal Act as the Health Insurance Act 1994.  Section 2 will amend section 11C of the principal Act to provide for 1 April 2021 as the effective date for revised credits payable from the risk equalisation fund.  Section 3 will amend Schedule 3 to the principal Act with effect from 1 April 2021 whereby the applicable hospital utilisation credits payable from the risk equalisation fund in respect of insured persons are revised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900059#MMM00800","speaker":"1608","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Gn\u00f3 na D\u00e1la - Business of D\u00e1il","time":1607541900,"counter":410,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900060#NNN00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1607541900,"counter":411,"content":"<p>It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that in the event that proceedings on the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2020 are not concluded by 9.30 p.m., business shall not be interrupted until the proceedings on the Bill, in accordance with the arrangements agreed to yesterday, are concluded.

I will support the Bill.  Having said that, we should take the opportunity every year when we debate such a Bill to review where we are with Sl&aacute;intecare and with the commitments that all parties in the House gave to phasing out private health insurance and the private health sector, and to working towards a public, universal healthcare system where people are treated on the basis of need and not of how much money they have in their pocket.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State set out what the Bill will do, which we will support, but there is a fundamental question to be asked as to why people take out private health insurance.  The vast majority take it out because they feel that they need it, that they cannot depend on our public system and that if they get sick, or if a family member gets sick, the fastest route to help them is through private health insurance to get a scan, a test, an assessment, an appointment or treatment.  That is true.  The problem is that all those who cannot afford to take out private health insurance are left on public-system waiting lists.  According to the most recent figures, 613,000 people in the State are waiting to see a hospital consultant, with 150,000 of them having waited more than 18 months.  Where in God's name is the delivery of Sl&aacute;intecare, which promises that people should not have to wait longer than four months, when 150,000 people in the State have been waiting more than 18 months, some of whom, in areas such as orthopaedics or scoliosis, are children?  It is a scandal and it will not happen until we make a commitment to properly resourcing our public hospitals and to recruiting the consultants, the specialists, the nurses and the healthcare assistants we need, and until we put public beds into public hospitals.<\/p>  <p>  There is also an issue with what people get for private health insurance.  Most people who take it out pay tax, PRSI and PAYE, and if they get sick and go to a GP, they have to pay for that as well.  That is the reality for many people.  We are charging, double-charging and treble-charging people for healthcare instead of committing to delivering on the promises we all collectively made in respect of Sl&aacute;intecare to deliver a better public health system.  When the public system does not provide a service, the private, for-profit system will step in to deliver it more quickly if it gets the opportunity to do so.<\/p>  <p>  There was an example in my constituency.  Ten years ago, there was a campaign for a second cath lab at University Hospital Waterford.  I was a member of Waterford City Council at the time and a delegation from the hospital explained to us that if somebody had a heart attack outside of 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. anywhere in the south east, he or she would have to travel to Dublin or Cork for an emergency cardiac procedure, or what is known as a PPCI.  Two years ago, the then Minister for Health signed off on a second cath lab, but to this day, not one brick has been laid in that area because the political will was not there to make it happen because of the way in which capital projects are delivered in the State.  The private hospital built a cath lab, which I do not blame it for, and it is providing a very good service.  From conception to delivery, it took the hospital six months.  Within that time, a private hospital was able to say it would build a second cath lab, open and staff it and provide the service, yet after ten years of campaigning, and two years after it was first supported by the then Minister for Health, still not a single brick has been laid.  The same Government - Fianna F&aacute;il, especially - that promised people that it would deliver 24-7 emergency cardiac care in our public hospital still has not done it and is still hiding behind reviews, yet it is now talking about expanded out-of-hours services but not the 24-7 care that was promised.  That is what happens and part of me thinks that is what Fine Gael wants, namely, not to deliver for our public health system and to allow the public healthcare system to step in.<\/p>  <p>  I will support the Bill, only because change needs to happen, but an awful lot more needs to be done to advance Sl&aacute;intecare and to phase out once and for all the private, for-profit healthcare system, which means that some people get treated more quickly depending on how much money they have, as opposed to people being treated fairly depending on their health need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900060#NNN00600","speaker":"1615"},{"type":"speech","time":1607541900,"counter":415,"content":"<p>The Bill concerns an issue dealt with every year in similar Bills to provide risk equalisation.  Risk equalisation is a mechanism designed to support the objective of a community-rated health insurance market whereby customers pay the same net premium for the same health insurance product irrespective of age, gender or health status.  The Health Insurance Acts have provided for a risk equalisation scheme for the health insurance market since 1 January 2013.  Under the scheme, insurers receive risk equalisation credits to compensate for the additional cost of insuring older and less healthy people.<\/p>  <p>  The differences across the political spectrum are most obvious in terms of the health service.  We need to address the imbalance in healthcare to remove private healthcare from our public hospitals and our public healthcare system.  It is high time we moved from away from a two-tier health system.  I could not afford health insurance as a private citizen and I know many people who make sacrifices to keep their health insurance because they are afraid that without it, they will end up waiting 24 months for a colonoscopy or some other procedure, and this is wrong.<\/p> <p>There are many people stuck in the middle of earning too much to qualify for a medical card and too little to be able to afford health insurance.  This is also wrong.  Ability to pay should not have any bearing on how one is treated in the healthcare system.  The American healthcare system is the extreme side of a private healthcare system but we are not far behind.  I spoke to a lady this week who is scrimping on Christmas this year so that she can pay &euro;250 to a private consultant for an ear, nose and throat, ENT, assessment.  She is in her third year on a waiting list in Tullamore hospital.  A year ago, she received a letter from the hospital asking if she still needed to be on that list and she has had no communication since.  She is one of the lucky ones in that she has health insurance which she hopes to use to have that procedure in a private hospital.  People are languishing on waiting lists getting sicker while those with health insurance are fast-tracked to the front of the queue.  In some cases, they are treated by the same doctors and even in the same hospitals.  As a \"Prime Time Investigates\" programme in 2017 showed, consultants sometimes treat private patients on public time.  A question by my colleague, the former Sinn F&eacute;in councillor, Mr. Thomas Redmond, to the midlands health forum in 2017 showed that this happens in rent-free rooms in our public hospitals.<\/p> <p> Health insurance exploits a failed public health system that is being killed off by successive Governments that favour a private health system.  As with the commodification of housing, the commodification of our health service is hurting those who need it most, such as our elderly and those who are on low incomes - in other words, the working poor.  In an ideal world, we would have no need for the private health insurance market.  The industry exists to paper over the cracks of our broken public health system.  Our waiting lists in most areas are out of control.  Vulnerable people are being exploited.  I recently asked a parliamentary question in relation to the pain clinic in Tallaght hospital.  There are over 1,100 people waiting for up to four years on an appointment there.  These people are living with chronic pain and this is having a profound effect on their lives.  Their mental health is suffering.  In some cases, their life expectancy will be lowered.  Sinn F&eacute;in in government will deliver an all-island health system that is free at the point of delivery and is based on need rather than income.  People deserve nothing less.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900060#NNN00700","speaker":"1588","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607542500,"counter":417,"content":"<p>Bogaimid ar aghaidh anois go dt&iacute; sliot&aacute;n Ph&aacute;irt&iacute; an Lucht Oibre.

The ESRI reported earlier on this year in terms of lifetime community rating.  Like so many aspects of this regime, perverse incentives persist.  What happened on the back of the introduction of lifetime community rating was that younger people responded as intended by entering the market, and the insurance industry responded in kind and developed cheaper plans that give less cover.  The practical effect of it was that younger people were paying less and getting less for their money, which resulted in significant out-of-pocket payments and a lack of solidarity.  The intention of solidarity that was there did not materialise.  Out-of-pocket payments remained very significant.  On top of that, the indications are that premiums will increase next year by up to 7% and we still wait for the implementation of the de Buitl&eacute;ir report.  The solution in all of this is a move away from public investment in private healthcare.  There is significant public investment in private healthcare.

The legislation is introduced at the end of each year to make adjustments to the risk equalisation scheme in respect of the stamp duty levies, risk equalisation credits and hospital utilisation credit rates.  Private health insurance is regulated by the Health Insurance Authority and it is on its recommendation that these annual proposals are made.  They are generally nodded through on the basis that there is general support for the principle of risk equalisation.<\/p>  <p>  If one is going to have a system of private health insurance, risk equalisation is an important element of that insurance system because it prevents cherry-picking in the health insurance system.  This is especially the case given the history of health insurance in this country where the VHI had the field to itself for many years.  It is really only in the last decade that we have seen any competition within the market.  As a result of the VHI having the market to itself for many decades, the company has a disproportionate number of older members and it would be unfair to allow new entrants into the market which could cherry-pick younger and healthier clients or customers.  That is the purpose of risk equalisation and it is very difficult to argue against that scheme.  Most of the new arrangements and rates will apply from 1 April 2021.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister is proposing to tweak what can only be described as a dysfunctional private insurance system relating to what is a dysfunctional health system.  In many ways, we are having the wrong debate tonight.  We are talking about a situation in which nearly half the population feel they have no choice but to take out expensive private health insurance.  That kind of two-tier system does not happen anywhere else in Europe.  Many people who cannot afford private health insurance feel that they have no choice but to pay for it because of our public health system being so weak.<\/p>  <p>  The standard plan B cover that many people take out costs in the region of &euro;1,200 per person when taking all premiums into account.  As we know, that figure can often be a great deal higher, especially for older people.  The average figure for over-50s is more like &euro;1,500 per person.  That is way beyond the reach of many people, especially older people and people who are on pensions, but many of those people make sacrifices in many other aspects of their lives in order to maintain private health insurance.  They do so out of fear that if they are faced with a serious medical condition, they cannot depend on the public health system to be available to them when they need it.  That view of the public health system is a shocking indictment of our public health service.  We are alone in Europe in this regard.  Every other European country has a reliable, dependable public health system whereby people feel that when they need care they will be able to access it in a timely manner.<\/p>  <p>  In Ireland, 46% of people feel mainly out of fear that they have to fork out for high premiums.  In return for those expensive premiums, they do not get a terribly good deal.  Obviously, over recent years many people have had to give up private health insurance.  During the last austerity period, the level of cover went down to its lowest level with the percentage covered in the low 40s.<\/p> <p>It has been gradually creeping up and last year it got to approximately 46%.  The figure has remained at that level.  Some surveys were done in the middle of this year showing it is still in or around 46%.  It certainly did not go up.  The idea that so many people would fork out for private health insurance is unheard of in all other European countries.  Generally, people in other countries in Europe have access to an affordable public health system that is free, or almost free, at the point of use.  That is the kind of system we should have in this country.  It is the kind of system to which Irish people should be entitled.<\/p> <p> Unfortunately, we are in a situation where a large number of people in this country feel they have no choice but to take out health insurance.  That must be seen for what it is.  In effect, it is an extra tax on people.  On the basis of a premium of &euro;1,500 per year, it amounts to an additional tax of &euro;38 per week, or some &euro;167 per month, in order to buy private health insurance.  If it had been announced in the recent budget, or any budget, that new taxes of &euro;167 a month were to be introduced, the Government would have been laughed out of it.  Somehow, people seem to think it is all right to put this kind of charge or tax on people just to access health cover.  This goes on year after year.  On the one hand, there are Government representatives talking about cutting taxes and, at the same time, people are paying out for a very basic service.  There is nothing more basic in terms of meeting people's needs than having access to a public health service.  We cannot even provide that for people in this country and we tax them to the level of &euro;167 a month in order to be able to access timely healthcare.<\/p> <p> The basic plan B health insurance provides people with basic health cover.  It really only enables people to skip the queue and jump ahead of others who do not have private health insurance.  There is cover for elective surgery but there are a lot of other things the premium does not cover.  By and large, the health insurance policies that are available in this country give very poor value for money.  Even where a person has plan B, they will still, in the main, have to fork out to see a GP.  Again, this is unheard of in other European countries.  I do not know whether the Government appreciates that we are the only European country where people have to pay the full amount to see a GP.  It just would not be tolerated anywhere else.  A charge of &euro;50 or &euro;60 is a real disincentive to accessing care when we should be encouraging people to access that care at an early stage.  Even if people have private health insurance, they still have to fork out &euro;200 or &euro;220 to see a consultant.  There are very few policies that give any relief in regard to those charges.  What about accessing medicines?  Again, the standard policy does not provide any relief in that regard.  In all other European countries, medicines are available free of charge or for a nominal charge.  We are completely out of line with what is standard for all our neighbours in Europe.<\/p> <p> The other element of the private health insurance issue is that tax relief is provided to those who access it.  It is a reducing tax relief, which used to be at the higher rate but is now at the standard rate.  The cost of providing tax relief for health insurance is estimated at &euro;355 million.  That is a direct transfer of public money from the weakest to the more affluent.  Everybody contributes to the tax relief but only 46% of people, who make up the most affluent part of society, benefit from it.  There are huge issues of equity there.<\/p> <p> In conclusion, we are having the wrong debate tonight.  The debate that should be happening is about implementing Sl&aacute;intecare and accelerating its implementation.  Everybody is signed up to that but the Government needs to account for its tardiness in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900061#OOO00500","speaker":"1567","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607543100,"counter":422,"content":"<p>Several speakers mentioned that in discussing risk equalisation, we are dealing with another failure in regard to healthcare provision.

I speak to constituents who have arrived here from other countries in recent years and cannot fathom the system we have, including the mixture of public and private provision, the cost of visiting the GP - which some people have to do frequently - and the cost of prescriptions.  Somewhere in there is an ostensibly public system.  It is a crazy mishmash and it is extremely ineffective and wasteful.<\/p>  <p>  The provisions in this Bill relating to risk equalisation make sense only in the context of our crazy system.  It is necessary to equalise risk.  However, as every speaker has said, we need to alter the system fundamentally.  We need a healthcare system where people can rely on public provision.  Healthcare provision is a public good and everyone should be able to expect a decent quality of care through the public system.  That is where we need to get to.  We have all made that point but the past few Governments have not done very much about it.<\/p>  <p>  I want to raise a specific issue in regard to health insurance.  It is one that has been raised with me by constituents on a few occasions.  People who are going into hospital for a procedure may be told by the doctor that they should be admitted the night before.  They go in the night before, they have the procedure the following day and they might stay that night as well.  However, their health insurance company will only cover the second night.  That is not something patients expect because they went in through private health insurance.  They could be left footing bills of &euro;800, &euro;900 or &euro;1,000 for that bed night.<\/p> <p>It is crazy.  Constituents do not expect it.  The health insurance companies should be picking that up.  There is evidence from doctors that consultants are writing to the hospital claiming the stay was necessary for the person's care.  It might be a relatively small issue in terms of the numbers of people affected.  It is a serious issue, however, if people get a bill for &euro;1,000 which they are expecting their insurance company to fork out for.

In fairness to the then Minister, he took on board what I said and reduced the fees for people attending an injury unit from &euro;100 back to &euro;75.

Over the past number of years, people from as far away as Eyrecourt would be better travelling to Roscommon hospital where they would be treated quicker for injuries than going to Portiuncula hospital in Ballinasloe where they would wait hours for an X-ray.<\/p><p>It is wrong that any health insurer should be blatantly acting against stated government policy, which is to put more work through our smaller hospitals and take pressure off our bigger acute hospitals where beds are being occupied for very sick patients in our emergency departments.  Deputy Shortall earlier said this was effectively a tax on access to health cover, amounting to &euro;167 a month.  Not only is it a tax, it is a disincentive in some cases to go to the most appropriate hospital.  Instead, the insurers want people to go to the bigger hospitals, putting pressure on them and their accident and emergency departments, when they can be treated in local hospitals.  It is not right that any insurer should be availing of risk equalisation while at the same time going blatantly against the Government's policy of putting less complex work through our smaller local hospitals.<\/p><p>On foot of taking up this issue last year with the then Minister, Deputy Harris, he stated he would ask his Department, working with the Health Insurance Authority. to review the current regulations that allow Irish Life Health to do what it is doing with a view to removing those particular exclusion clauses whereby providers are effectively banning people from attending smaller hospitals.  Insurance companies should not be allowed to carry out that particular practice.  We are 12 months down the road now.  The Department has been given fair warning on this.  I have not put down an amendment on this occasion because last year the then Minister said the amendment I put down then would have unintended consequences.  I do not see in this legislation provision being made to ban this particular practice.  When the Minister responds, I hope I get a detailed response as to what specific actions have been taken.  The difficulty is that we are 12 months further down the road but nothing has changed.  The list I read out to the Minister is from the Irish Life Health website tonight.  It precludes people from using smaller local hospitals and discriminates against those who do so.  Irish Life Health wants people to spend hours sitting or lying on trolleys in accident and emergency departments rather than accessing the local injury units or elective surgery in our smaller hospitals where we do not have waiting lists.<\/p><p>These were the hospitals which were able to continue to deal with outpatient appointments during the first Covid lockdown.  That did not happen in our bigger hospitals.  If one happens to use Irish Life Health, it wants one to be left waiting or be unable to access outpatient appointments during Covid lockdowns or to get timely access to treatment.  Instead, it wants people to wait and put further pressure on our busiest hospitals.<\/p><p>I want to see movement on this issue.  I was promised this time last year that would happen by the then Minister.  I was informed we would have action and an update by this time today.  This evening, however, I see we still have the same practice from Irish Life Health, advertising openly the blatant discrimination against level 2 hospitals.  This practice must stop.  As someone who knows how urgent and necessary it is to encourage people to use our smaller hospitals, will the Minister directly intervene and ask his officials to table an urgent amendment on this and ensure all health insurers cover all hospitals?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900063#QQQ00200","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speech","time":1607544300,"counter":426,"content":"<p>The Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill is somewhat akin to the Finance Bill or the Social Welfare Bill, as it arrives in November every year.  The measures within are designed to support risk equalisation and to sustain community rating in our health insurance market so that older citizens and people with illnesses can afford health insurance and are not penalised in favour of younger healthier people.<\/p>  <p>  There is no increase in the risk equalisation levy this year.  Risk equalisation and community rating have many merits.  Our values as a people are to support older people and the sick.  This is not just out of a sense of obligation but because we respect and value our older people and the dignity of each person in their illness, medical condition or disability.  We are firm in our view that the principle of solidarity should apply in private health insurance as well as in public health services.  However, I ask the Minister of State what are the potential costs of maintaining this system over time and what are the implications on competition.  The maintenance of a community rate causes a barrier to entry for outside providers.  I understand the balancing act needed to ensure adequate access to care for all of those paying to get value for money but I am also conscious of the rising unfunded liability over time, which has the potential to collapse the private health insurance system.  Ireland has had a murky past in private health insurance provision and I want to flag that, if left unchecked, the current set-up would lead to similar outcomes.<\/p>  <p>  While I recognise the current measures in place are interim in nature until the full roll-out of Sl&aacute;intecare, the values executed through the risk equalisation scheme are those we should uphold in the provision of our healthcare systems, specifically, equal access for all.  I want to ensure everyone is working towards a system that will enable us to continue to uphold these values and provide care in the most cost-effective manner.<\/p>  <p>  At an individual level, some of the most challenging issues facing all Deputies, including me, are those arising from people's health insurance.  Some very difficult and desperate cases have come through our offices, whereby people may have gone as far as getting insolvency practitioners involved as a result of healthcare bills.  It is critical that the State continues to legislate in this area.<\/p>  <p>  I have a significant concern for the many families in the squeezed middle for whom the cost of private healthcare may be just beyond their means.  As a Government, we have to try to do more to assist these families because getting access to a medical card or an emergency medical card can be quite a challenge in some cases, where there are issues with regard to the eligibility criteria.  This causes major issues with private health insurance and people trying to get access through the public system.  It is an area on which we need to see greater emphasis placed by the Government.  It is a significant issue.  I take this opportunity to raise this matter while speaking about health insurance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900064#RRR00100","speaker":"1516"},{"type":"speech","time":1607544300,"counter":427,"content":"<p>What we are speaking about is the continuation of a two-tier health system that has been allowed to develop because of underinvestment in our public health service.  The situation is such that we have citizens who have become reliant on a private system that many cannot afford but cannot afford to give up either.  Many people in my constituency are faced with regular increases in already huge health insurance policies and must give up something to pay for them.  In one case, a parent had to postpone going to the doctor because it was not free for him at the point of entry and he could not afford the doctor's fee while continuing to pay for his family's health insurance.  This is one example of how the two-tier system has failed us.  People cannot afford to go to a doctor.  This is wrong on all counts.<\/p>  <p>  What about those who cannot afford private health insurance?  They are left with the prospect of lengthy waiting lists in an under-resourced public health system.  Over the years, Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael have promoted a policy that allows those who can afford to pay to skip the queue.  All others must tighten their belts and take out a policy or else deal with waiting lists in the public system while their conditions get worse.  Where are we now?  We find ourselves being asked to ensure older and sick people will not have to pay more for health insurance.  While we support this, ultimately people should not need private health insurance.  We should not have to be here today taking measures that spread the cost of private insurance.  We should be discussing universal healthcare.

I speak to people who want to use health insurance and the greatest issue is that the cost prevents them from doing so.  Recently, people have been contacting my office to say there have been several increases that are putting health insurance out of the reach of the ordinary person.  This is an issue that needs to be addressed because we cannot have everybody in the medical card system.  People try to put some money aside for health insurance but the cost is getting out of hand.<\/p>  <p>  The entire health system is in trouble.  I know people who have health insurance but still cannot access specialists.  This week, my office is trying to access a specialist for a very sick child in west Cork but the earliest appointment for a paediatric gastroenterologist is at the end of March.  The child is extremely ill, can barely get out of bed with pain, cannot go to school and cannot go about daily life in the same way as other children.  The family cannot get an appointment with a paediatric gastroenterologist because there are only five in the country.  The earliest appointment is 25 March.  It is outrageous.  Today, I was in contact with doctors in Germany to see whether we can do something.  This is the problem with the system in this country.  We are exporting all of our problems.  We have been looking to Northern Ireland and everywhere and anywhere as we frantically try to find a specialist that could look after this child and give her some relief coming up to Christmas.  God knows the stress it must be causing to her family because we are stressed about it.  Our hearts and souls go into someone, especially a young person, and we try our living best to make life somewhat easier.  I would appreciate if the Minister of State could intervene and perhaps I can speak to him afterwards or he can contact me.  I would like to look after this person.<\/p>  <p>  Private health insurance is in crisis.  We also have issues with Covid.  Someone rang me recently who drove for two hours to Cork city to get a Covid test carried out but the person was having a procedure done in Bantry General Hospital.  The Covid test should have been carried out in Bantry General Hospital rather than the person having to make a two-hour journey to Cork and a two-hour journey back.  It took almost a day to get a Covid test and then the person went to Bantry General Hospital for a minor procedure.  We are afraid to use local smaller hospitals that can deliver so much.<\/p>  <p>  Quite a few people in west Cork who have fallen ill have been told when the ambulance arrived that they are being taken not to Bantry General Hospital but to Cork.  They are then left in the ambulance outside Cork University Hospital, which cannot cope.  That is not the fault of staff at the hospital, which just cannot cope with the number of people who go there, while we have a beautiful hospital in Bantry that serves a massive population.  People told me when I was canvassing out east along Bandon that they go to Bantry General Hospital and not to Cork University Hospital, CUH, because they get looked after by the excellent staff there.<\/p> <p>There is nothing wrong with the staff in Cork University Hospital but they cannot cope with the demand.  We tend to look as if we would shut all these smaller hospitals.  We do not give them the resources they need or provide ambulance services.  It is nicely done behind the scenes, and people say, &ldquo;Oh, CUH is actually much better than Bantry General&rdquo;.  It is a closure.  It is a nice way of closing the door.  However, we are keeping a very close eye on what is going on.<\/p> <p> People are suffering.  Regardless of whether they have health insurance or not, they cannot get cataract operations.  Bus 63 has just come back into Cork this evening and bus 62 went up on Sunday, and there are another 28 people who have had their eyesight saved.  That procedure should be taking place in Cork.  However, the worry now is that, given the fact it is not happening enough to get some solution, they are going to Northern Ireland.  From what I gather, the Government is lying idly by, and is going to put in a scheme that is not going to work.  All it has to do is replace the scheme that is there with a new scheme that operates across the Border into Belfast.  I would appreciate if the Minister would work on that. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900064#RRR00300","speaker":"1461","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607544900,"counter":430,"content":"<p>C&aacute; bhfuil an tAire Sl&aacute;inte?

That is no disrespect to the Minister of State, Deputy Frankie Feighan, but the Minister for Health is so precious.  If he was here, he would leave before any of our group come to speak.  It is a total abdication of his role as Minister and our right to have him present for these debates.<\/p><p>Someone referred to this debate as being like the Finance Bill or the Social Welfare Bill.  At least with the Finance Bill or the Social Welfare Bill people get something out of it, and while they might lose something too, at least it is a cogent piece of work.  This is like papering the parlour for the stations mass.<\/p><p>With regard to health insurance, it is the wild west out there.  People have health insurance but there are so many excesses and restrictions that they do not have the cover they need, and when they go into hospital, they have to pay all of these excesses on top.  It is totally unfair.  We have a two-tier system that is not working.<\/p><p>We went off and did a massive deal during Covid with the private hospitals instead of buying one of them under a compulsory purchase order.  We brought in legislation to stop thousands of small businesses operating and we cannot do anything with private health because we know the powerful men who own them.  That is what is going on.  We are lining their pockets.  We need to have proper, meaningful legislation that is robust enough and that will deal with the racketeering that is going on.  There are powerful and excellent specialist surgeons and doctors, and I support them and salute them, but, as I said, they charge us.<\/p><p>My brother-in-law went into hospital lately after having a mini-stroke.  My sister was with him to mind him and the nurse insisted at accident and emergency that she travel 11 or 12 miles back home to get his PPS number and his private health insurance number.  Even though he was sitting on a chair and did not get a bed, they wanted to charge the insurer for the price of a bed.  I could stay in the Gresham Hotel cheaper.  The Burlington or other hotels are a lot cheaper and when people ask for service, they get it.  The nurses are so stretched.  It is shameful what is going on.<\/p><p>Insurance premiums are being hiked up because of the claims and people do not even know it is happening.  If someone is there to have a test, a little form is slipped in front of them and they sign it because they would sign anything if they are ill and want better treatment.  It is not right what is going on; it is very wrong indeed.<\/p><p>Why would we not have that?  When we had the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, here all through March, April and May, the HSE seconded for Covid step-down patients a beautiful hospital in Carrick-on-Suir that has been there since about 1820.  Councillor Kieran Bourke, a very hard-working councillor from the town, came up to Dublin and met the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, and I met him the same evening.  He was sure it would be returned as a hospital.  The three hospital units there do tremendous work.  Huge fundraising was done by the locals of south Kilkenny, west Waterford and south Tipperary.  We were told again by the Minister, Deputy Harris, that it would be reopened.  However, the staff were informed this morning it is d&uacute;nta, shut, <i>finito<\/i>, gone as an institution - a proud institution, with wonderful staff and with the investments built.  They built a huge monstrosity of a primary care centre right beside it that cost &euro;10 million, and it is half empty &ndash; follaimh.  Now, there are no more hospice beds.<\/p><p>I was promised by the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, there would be some private arrangement with nursing homes.  Everything is private - push it out into the private sector, where people are fleeced.  The care they got in the palliative care unit there, and the care they got from the specialist nurses and other ancillary staff, was fabulous and it was known locally.  Many people from Carrick-on-Suir were born there because it was a maternity hospital.  Now, it is no more.<\/p><p>The deceit and the lies we were told are shocking and there is no accountability.  The Minister will not even reply to Councillor Bourke, even to registered letters.  Neither will the Taoiseach, who is the Fianna F&aacute;il leader.  The councillor is so disappointed, a man who served the people on a voluntary basis, and he and others are trying to do their best.  People have campaigned to have it reopened and now they find the lights are turned off and they will never again be turned on.<\/p><p>We were promised it was going to be a step-down facility for diabetes or something else.  We want it there for respite.  We want that as a hospital when people are ill in the area and as a step-down from other hospitals after surgeries.  People have died without the palliative care they were entitled to.  I know the palliative care teams and the nurses do tremendous work in people&rsquo;s homes but people need a bed in a hospital.  However, it is locked up, gone away from the people, with no access after people have been fundraising so much for years to put the facilities in there.  They were put into the new extension in the hospital, which was beautiful, and I have been in to see people there during their last days.  It is so sad.<\/p><p>The Minister is gone like snow off a ditch.  As I said on another night here, a cat would not go out through a skylight as fast as when we get up to speak here.  It is fear.  He is not accountable to this House.  It is scandalous.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900065#SSS00200","speaker":"1612"},{"type":"speech","time":1607544900,"counter":431,"content":"<p>As Deputy Fergus O'Dowd is not present, I call Deputy Murnane O'Connor.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900065#SSS00300","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1607544900,"counter":432,"content":"<p>Every year, legislation is needed to update and revise the scheme which allows our system of sharing of risk across the insured population in Ireland.  This year we have had big challenges in this area, with the growing elderly population, with Covid and with long Covid, as it has come to be known, and the risks people may be taking because they are afraid to seek help in hospitals.  We must maintain the affordability of health insurance to offer real choice to people.<\/p>  <p>  One issue that has come across my desk is the availability of some services which customers are paying for under their health insurance.  There are issues related to Covid, which we know cannot go on forever, but this is certainly something which concerns me.  A 78-year-old Carlow lady with poor sight, who requires monthly injections, missed out on her appointment when the HSE took over the private hospitals for a short period earlier this year.  She was informed by her health insurer that the private hospital was now public and her procedure would not be covered.  She had to pay &euro;1,600 herself in order to save her sight.  She had paid health insurance all her life only to be told she had to pay this.  This was an old lady who had paid her insurance and had a medical card.  I am sure there are more cases like this.  If she was not covered by her insurance, and her insurer has told her that where she went to was a public hospital for a few months, why will the medical card not cover her?  That lady cannot afford &euro;1,600.  She depended on that operation because her eyesight was getting worse and she had to get this injection.  This is unacceptable and I am sure there are more cases like this.  I want the Minister and the HSE to refund this lady her &euro;1,600.  It is unacceptable that a lady who paid her health insurance all her life and had her medical card was not covered.  It is very unfair.  She was so upset and so were her family.<\/p>  <p>  More and more people have taken out health insurance because, sadly, it offers faster access.  However, I have recently been informed of concerns regarding the rising cost.  Somewhere in the region of half the population have health insurance in one form or another.  During the Covid-19 lockdown, many health insurers refunded their customers, which was welcome, and I believe another refund will be coming shortly.  It is very important that we look after people, particularly during Covid.<\/p>  <p>  Equalisation is very important in this country so that older people can access health insurance at the same cost as younger, healthier people.  We see in other jurisdictions and other health insurance models that the riskier the health of the customer, the higher the premium paid.  It is so important that, in this Bill, we protect that access and protect affordability of health insurance.<\/p>  <p>  For those who have health insurance, the renewal process is very confusing and there is a fear attached that to step down a level or take something off a plan is the same as tempting fate.  It is amazing the number of people who will say that.  There is a body of work to do to communicate ways to save money on plans and to eliminate aspects of plans which are wholly unnecessary.<\/p> <p>It would be helpful if, when shopping around, which I would always encourage, customers could see in a straightforward manner the plans across different providers so they could know exactly what they were getting.  That might be something we could examine.

The two-tier system of healthcare and, in particular, the mingling of private and public care in our public hospital system is the key obstacle to equity of access and a fit-for-purpose national health system open to all and free to use.<\/p>  <p>  In the 1950s, the VHI was established as a not-for-profit State insurance company to provide health cover for the top 15% of income earners who were then not able to access the public hospital system.  A key factor then, as now, was the determination of consultants to protect private practice and the lucrative nature of it.<\/p>  <p>  The public hospital system, on paper, is open to all today, yet we know approximately 50% of the population buy private health insurance, which is one of the highest levels in the OECD.  The question has to be asked why people on moderate incomes would take out expensive private health insurance when they are entitled to public care.  They are not doing so because they can have luxury treatment in a private hospital.  Much of the private care takes place in public hospitals.  The reason is simple - waiting lists.  The VHI helps people to jump the queue.  That is inherently unfair and the fact that it is subsidised both by tax relief and the use of the public system by consultants to treat private patients defies all logic, unless one believes that the profit motive comes before people's health.<\/p>  <p>  I have not been able to get a figure for the cost of tax relief on health insurance but the average premium is around &euro;2,000.  Twenty per cent tax relief on that is &euro;400, and with half the population covered, it must be a cost to the Exchequer.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of risk equalisation, my understanding is that the VHI dominates the market and that no transfer funds between companies has ever taken place.

Under the Scheme, insurers receive risk equalisation credits to compensate for the additional cost of insuring older and less healthy members. <\/blockquote>  <p>Is that not a sad and depressing statement?  I believe it is.  Nobody on the opposite side of the House will believe it but that is the case.  It is the financialisation of human lives and the health insurance market, so-called.  We are all commodities in this marketplace called neoliberalism.<\/p><p>The genesis of this Bill is to amend the 1994 Health Insurance Act and the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999.  The risk equalisation scheme was approved as state aid for the period 2016 to 2020 and this Bill is seeking to extend that scheme for a further 15 months.<\/p><p>I have been studying the instances and prevalence of Covid-19 in Donegal and areas around Donegal and our neighbouring counties in the North.  The areas with the highest levels of deprivation have been most impacted.  The higher levels of Covid can almost be mapped completely to the less affluent areas.  Why?  It is because an unequal society causes more people to become ill and die.<\/p><p>The Bill digest states that a study in early 2020 by the Health Information Authority, HIA, found that:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThose with PHI [private health insurance] are more likely to be from the more affluent white collar workers\/professional cohort ... whilst those from more manual professions or reliant on state benefits are significantly less likely to have cover.<br \/><br \/>[...]<br \/><br \/>This finding on the social divide is consistent with previous studies commissioned by the HIA. <\/blockquote>  <p>The programme for Government, Our Shared Future, committed to accelerating the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare, which, as I have said, is very welcome.  However, because of Fine Gaelness and Fianna F&aacute;ilness, as it were, the Government explicitly states its support for private healthcare while it talks about supporting Sl&aacute;intecare also.  It states that it would retain access to private health services, ensuring choice for those accessing healthcare.  The irony is never lost on the Minister of State.  The only people who have a choice are those who have the means to afford private healthcare.  He should have spoken about ensuring choice for those who could afford it.  That would have been a truer statement to make in this regard.<\/p><p>We facilitate a private health system - this Bill is facilitating it - and we will pay &euro;350 million out of State funds to support wealthy people and people who can afford to have private health insurance and to fill up our hospitals so that people who cannot afford it cannot get into them.  That is crazy.  If the Minister of State had written this as a comedy, people would say it could not be true, but that is what we are doing.  We are facilitating that so that wealthy people can access the health services over people who cannot afford them who are more likely to be sick and will actually cost the State more in the long run because they cannot afford private health insurance.  That is what the Minister of State and the Government is facilitating and what every Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael Government in this State has facilitated along the way.<\/p><p>Members spoke earlier about elderly people who have private health insurance and cannot get access to healthcare, yet those same elderly people have a medical card and could get their care free of charge.  I meet people all the time in my constituency and they talk about private health insurance.  They do not know that there is no charge for hospital care other than the charge for the bed, which is maximised at &euro;350 or &euro;360.  They believe that if they need an operation they have to pay the cost of that.  The Government facilitates that because it pushes people into private healthcare to make sure they get it.  People are putting themselves at risk by paying for it.  I tell them, and rightly so, that they would be better off saving their money in the credit union and if they feel they need to buy a service such as a CAT scan or whatever, they can get a loan from the credit union to pay for it and they will still have their savings in the credit union.  They would be far better off than paying for the private health insurance we have in this State.  That would make far more sense for individuals throughout the country because this is an absolute disgrace.  Ministers whose job it is to represent the people of this State should be embarrassed to stand up and push this along.<\/p><p>The Minister of State will say that the purpose of this legislation is to equalise the system and make it more fair, but it should not have to be made more fair.  The bottom line is that this has been put into the Bill because the Government has broken the system.  It is to facilitate wealthy people who can afford it.<\/p><p>I am totally opposed to this legislation.  I have opposed it all the way.  I will not call a vote on it but I am totally opposed to what the Minister of State is doing in regard to it because it is wrong, but he will continue to do what he is doing, which is fair enough.<\/p> <p>We can then actually make the changes that would make healthcare in the State reflect the people who live here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900066#TTT00400","speaker":"1547","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607546100,"counter":438,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies for their contributions to the debate on this Bill.

It is important that we took the opportunity to discuss this Bill and the positive effect that community rating and other aspects of health insurance regulation have on people's daily lives.  The voluntary health insurance system in Ireland operates on the basis of community rating, meaning people who are old or sick do not have to pay more than the young and healthy.  Community rating is a fundamental cornerstone of the Irish health insurance system and in other health insurance systems.  The level of risk presented by an individual directly affects the premium paid.  The objective of community rating is supported by a risk equalisation scheme which aims to keep health insurance affordable for older and less healthy members.  Under the scheme, all the money raised on levies from insurers is paid into a fund for the sole purpose of supporting the market in the forms of credit payable.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of this Bill is to specify the revised credits and corresponding stamp duty levels to apply on health insurance.  I thank the Deputies for the issues they have raised.  Deputies Cullinane, Patricia Ryan, O'Rourke and Shortall talked about Sl&aacute;intecare.  I hope that Sl&aacute;intecare will eventually impact on implementing the removal of private healthcare.  It will happen progressively.  Anyone with health insurance can continue to receive private care in public hospitals for the foreseeable future.  After that, anybody with private health insurance will still be able to receive private care in private hospitals.  When there is certainty about the timeframe for the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare and a public-only consultant contract, a broader discussion on the role of private health insurance will follow.  We are committed to introducing Sl&aacute;intecare as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  Deputies &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and Gould talked about addiction services.  I would be concerned that the &euro;90 cost for an assessment for treatment is a barrier.  I ask Deputy Gould if he could raise that again because we want to support recovery, especially for people in addiction services.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Naughten talked about Irish Life Health, and how one major insurer was not supporting level 2 hospitals such as Clonmel, Louth, Roscommon and many more.  There is no obligation for insurers to cover all the hospitals in the manner outlined because it limits the commercial decisions of the insurers.  We would be concerned that this would increase the cost if legislation tried to oblige insurers to cover all hospitals for treatments, procedures etc.  I agree with Deputy Naughten and I am familiar with Roscommon University Hospital.  It is a level 2 hospital and much great work has happened there.  We need to try to talk to the GPs and many other stakeholders, to say that there is better, quicker treatment available at level 2 hospitals than at level 3 or 4 hospitals.  They have a role there and Deputy Naughten has a point.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy O'Connor talked about cost systems and outside providers.  We keep an eye on it.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Michael Collins talked about a young child in Cork.  If he writes to me and the Department, we will follow up on that serious issue and try to sort it out or see exactly what is happening.<\/p>  <p>  Although the private health insurance market has demonstrated resilience and remained reasonably stable amid significant uncertainty in 2020, the longer-term impact of Covid-19 on the health insurance industry has yet to be determined.  Against the background of some uncertainty about the potential impact on market profile and membership, the credit and levy rates for next year strike a fair balance between the need to support community rating and maintaining the sustainability of the market.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Pringle has some interesting points about health insurance.  He made an interesting point about credit unions and we must have a discussion about that in the future.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill allows us to maintain support for the core principle of community rating, which is long-established and well-supported Government policy for the health insurance market.  The Bill will ensure that we can continue to provide the necessary support to ensure that the costs of health insurance are shared across the insured population.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900067#UUU00200","speaker":"1608"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1607546100,"counter":439,"content":"<p>Question put and declared carried.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1607546100,"counter":440,"content":"<p>Bill reported without amendment, received for final consideration and passed.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1607546100,"counter":441,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at at 9.38 p.m. until 9 a.m. on Thursday, 10 December 2020.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
