I am very concerned about the way the energy regulator is doing its business.  It is not providing transparency in its decisions or reaching those decisions in a timely manner.  A project which clearly illustrates the problems with the energy regulator is the proposed Mayo renewable energy project, a 45 MW high efficiency combined heat and power biomass fuelled plant to be built on the former Asahi site outside Ballina.  The project lodged applications to the regulator for various consents and licences in June 2018.  Previously, the project, under a different promoter, had been licensed in 2012 by the energy regulator.  Unfortunately in 2016, even though the project was partially built, progress stalled due to financial difficulties.  Progress stopped but new promoters have now come on board.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michelle Mulherin:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2309\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2309&amp;amp;pid=MichelleMulherin&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This project is worth &euro;255 million, of which &euro;95 million has been invested to date by the new promoters who have taken an equity stake of &euro;95 million in the project.  The promoters have taken on the task of revitalising and reviving the project.  The planning permission has been extended by Mayo County Council and the promoters have received renewed consent from the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, in respect of emissions.  The promoters have received confirmation from ESB Networks that the grid offer remains in place and will be offered to the new company.  However, the promoters have tried to deal with the energy regulator, now known as the Commission for Regulation of Utilities but have run into a stone wall.  Initially the energy regulator appointed consultants and the consultant did not want to give the project a high efficiency certificate, as had previously been given and subsequent to that the energy regulator has retained new consultants.   <\/p><p>International consultants retained by the new promoters have certified that no material change has been made to this project since it was initially certified in 2012.  Equally to my knowledge, there has been no change in legislation.  I am very concerned that there will be a repeat of what happened when Apple proposed to build a data centre in Athenry.<\/p><p>This project is a golden opportunity for north Mayo and is key to developing our national policy objectives, such as renewable heat and energy, to which I know the Minister is very committed.  It is also tied in with the development of a data centre on the same site, which requires a renewable energy project to be co-located with it.  This critical project has been stalled.  <\/p><p>I believe that under the process that is being pursued by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, the promoters should be entitled to know what the problem is and the reason for such delays when there has been no material change in the projects and why a second set of consultants had to be retained.<\/p><p>Second, in respect of the legislation covering the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, I believe there should be a time limit placed in legislation upon the regulator wherein it must give a decision.  As the Minister knows, time is of the essence for the development of projects, promoters and investors do not wait around and will go somewhere else.  This project is commercially sensitive to time delays. <\/p><p>With all the resources available to the energy regulator, why is it outsourcing the evaluation of the project to another set of consultants?  All this is taking time, when we have a project that is time sensitive.  As I have said already, we have seen what happened in Athenry.  The whole community was devastated by the outcome of the delay in giving a decision of consent to Apple and ultimately because it took so long to do so, Apple pulled out.<\/p><p>There are commercial realities.  There are climate change objectives and objectives for the development of the site.  This site is in a peripheral area, where it is hard to attract investment and growth.  This project offers a golden opportunity and I do not believe the energy regulator has dealt with these investors in a fair way.  I do not believe it is fair from all the view points I have set out to the Minister and I believe it should be prescribed in legislation that the regulator should make a decision within a certain period.  When Deputy Bruton was Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, one of the directives that came from his Department and the Taoiseach of the day was that all Government agencies dealing with commercial projects should deal with them in a time-sensitive way and this clearly has not happened in this case.  The other three agencies have given consent, but the regulator has not.  Is this rocket science?  Why is there no transparency?  Why should I and any ordinary person not know what is happening in respect of a project which is of such critical importance in the area?<\/p><p>I look forward to the Minister's response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019020500002#B00500","speaker":"1425","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1549377000,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this matter.<\/p> <p>I should outline very clearly that the Commission for Regulation of Utilities is an independent regulator.

In this instance, it is establishing the heat efficiency of the particular plant.  The European documentation sets out the issues that must be considered.  I am sure the Senator and the applicant  have already had regard to those issues.  This is a complicated matter by any standard.  The regulator must examine several issues in the context of an application, including electrical, thermal and overall efficiency, power-to-heat ratios, electricity from the high-efficiency combined heat and power and primary energy savings.  It does so in accordance with formula set out in the original directive and its annexes.  The regulator has been transparent about what are the requirements.  I cannot second-guess its assessment of an application such as this, no more than the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government can second-guess An Bord Plean&aacute;la when it independently assesses an application made to it.<\/p><p>The legislation clearly sets out that the regulator is not accountable to the Minister but it provides for accountability to the Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  The independent regulator is accountable to the Oireachtas, as ought to be the case.  I cannot shed light on why nothing has changed in the view of the promoters but they have not been granted the approval which was previously given.  That is entirely a matter for the Commission for Regulation of Utilities to assess.  Unfortunately,  I am not in a position to provide an insight as to what difficulties this application may be encountering other than to point the Senator and the applicants to the very detailed guidance on what needs to be submitted, the calculations conducted by the regulator and how it weighs applications.  The very detailed source document specifies the terms within which it operates.<\/p><p>I understand the Senator's enthusiasm to have the plant approved.  However, in order to access state aid or aid through the various refit programmes it must, in addition to acquiring planning permission and EPA approval, fulfil certain criteria which are set independently, policed by the EU and administered by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities.  Obviously, it is an important element in any project but there be an independent process to vet approval in any case where benefit is being conferred.  It is not a political decision and nor should it be.  That is the position as I understand it.

They have to make sense to somebody, somewhere, and some empirical standard and test has to be applied.

The EU code states that each generational unit shall be compared with the best available and economically justifiable technology for the separate production of heat and electricity on the market in the year of construction of the cogeneration unit.  That suggests that a unit in construction in 2012, as against a unit in construction in 2018, will be compared to different economically justifiable and best available technology.  A regulator continues to evolve against the rules which are set for it.  It does not follow that if something was approved in 2012, it will be identical in 2013.  In annexe 3, it states that they are looking at a different test, and at today's technology rather than that of 2012.<\/p> <p>I do not know anything about the process but it is not as clear cut as asking why the regulator is not repeating what it did before.

Major controversy arose last year when iCare, Bluestack Special Needs Foundation and Extern were refused funding.  When we look at a map of the State, only one organisation north of the famous Galway to Dublin line, which was located in Roscommon, had received funding.  Major controversy surrounded that because both iCare and the Bluestack Special Needs Foundation have existed for many years without any substantial State funding.  iCare based in the Inishowen Peninsula, my home area, has been in existence for 18 years.  It has raised a great deal of money.  This organisation involves families who are taking care of their loved ones with intellectual special needs and trying to fundraise massive amounts of money every year.

I am delighted he is here to take this matter in which I know he has a strong interest.  My Commencement matter is to ask the Minister for Justice and Equality to provide information on the progress made to date in conducting the three-year review of the operation of section 7A of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993.  In particular, I seek an outline of the progress made in providing the additional resources promised to support those seeking to exit prostitution and for research into the operation of section 7A.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State is well aware of the context for this question.  It is the passing into law in 2017 of Part 4 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act, which created in section 7A of the 1993 Act a new offence of purchasing sexual services, thereby criminalising the buyers of sex, while also decriminalising individuals who sell sex.  The primary objective, as the Minister of State is well aware, was to tackle the demand that leads to sexual exploitation, predominantly of women and girls.  The context was the 2013 recommendation of the justice committee, which was chaired at the time by the Minister of State and on which I served, that a law be introduced here in line with the approach taken in Sweden and an increasing number of other countries worldwide which seek to tackle demand by criminalising the purchase of sex.  In Ireland, we had seen a long campaign by the civil society alliance, Turn Off the Red Light, TORL, to which more than 70 groups were affiliated.  The work of TORL fed into the committee's review but, as the Minister of State is aware, we also conducted extensive hearings.<\/p> <p>The legislation was commenced on 28 March 2017 and I understand the three-year review is thus due in March 2020.  There is some concern among civil society groups that worked with the Turn Off the Red Light campaign and are very supportive of the legislation about how the review required by section 25 of the 2017 Act will be rolled out.  My objective today is to get some clarification as to how it is proposed the review will be conducted and to ask the Minister of State to outline whether the promised additional resources will be provided to support those seeking to exit prostitution.  A review of the debates on this matter would show that even those who opposed the legislation supported the provision of resources to assist those who wish to exit prostitution.  There was an expectation that projects such as the Women's Health Project and groups working closely with those seeking to exit prostitution such as Ruhama would be given resources to assist them in their important work.  The Minister of State travelled with other members of the committee to Sweden on a fact-finding trip in 2012 when we saw the resources that are put in place in that country to support the implementation of its law.<\/p> <p>I am also keen to find out what progress has been made in resourcing research into the operation of section 7A.  We need to ensure the review will be evidence based and research will be done to provide facts on which the review will be based.<\/p> <p>I would also like resourcing to be provided for a public awareness programme on the legislation and its purpose.  The first conviction under Part 4 was reported on 21 January last.  One assumes the reporting of that conviction will have knock-on and deterrent effects.  We know from other research that knowledge that people are likely to be prosecuted acts as a deterrent and has a very welcome effect of suppressing demand.  We know also that implementing new criminal legislation creates challenges.  While the reporting of cases such as the conviction secured in recent weeks will have an important chilling effect, we are all conscious that resourcing must be put in place for specialist Garda units assigned to the work of targeting sex buyers and the organisers of prostitution who feed on demand.<\/p> <p>I have raised a number of different issues.  I know the Minister of State is personally concerned about this matter and I welcome his attendance in the House to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019020500002#H00100","speaker":"1402"},{"type":"speech","time":1549377000,"counter":27,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Charlie Flanagan, I thank Senator Bacik for raising this important matter and offer the Minister's apologies for not being able to address it in person.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy David Stanton:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1053\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1053&amp;amp;pid=DavidStanton&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is hard to believe it is so many years since we addressed this.  It was 2012. <\/p><p>I remind the House of the provisions of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 that related to prostitution-related offences.  Part 4 of the Act provides for two new offences: paying for sexual activity with a prostitute and paying for sexual activity with a trafficked person, with the latter offence carrying a penalty of up to five years' imprisonment or an unlimited fine, or both.  The Act removes those who offer their services as a prostitute from the existing offence of soliciting for the purpose of prostitution.  A key objective of Part 4 of the Act is to reduce demand for sexual services, as the Senator said.  As regards actions on the ground, I believe the message is getting out to those who purchase sex.<\/p><p>In recent months, a number of files have been sent to the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, resulting in the much-published first conviction for the purchase of sex earlier this month.  Furthermore, the Department of Justice and Equality has advanced plans to conduct an awareness-raising initiative later this year relating to the offence of purchasing sex.<\/p><p>As regards supporting persons who wish to exit prostitution, comprehensive measures are already in place.  The Department of Justice and Equality provides annual funding to Ruhama to ensure that women who wish to exit prostitution receive the necessary support to develop the confidence and capacity to rebuild their lives.  This funding was increased in 2017 and again in 2018.  With regard to State support, the HSE's women's health service provides sexual health and outreach support for women affected by prostitution and trafficking for sexual exploitation.  The service comprises a free comprehensive sexual health service, including full sexual health testing, treatment and contraception.<\/p><p>The Act was enacted on 22 February 2017, and much of the Act, including the provisions I have described, were commenced on 27 March 2017.  Part 4 of the Act specifies that, not later than three years after its commencement, a report will be prepared on the number of arrests and convictions in respect of the new offences, as well as an assessment of the impact of the section on those who provide sexual services for payment.  Inputs to the report will come from a number of sources.  The first will be from the monitoring of investigations, arrests and convictions by the Garda National Protective Services Bureau.  Additional information will be provided by the HSE's women's health service and by civil society organisations working in this field.  Furthermore, this year the Department is funding a number of research projects that will measure the impact of the new legislation on the welfare of women engaged in prostitution, the outcomes of which will inform the report.  I hope that answers the Senator's points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019020500002#H00200","speaker":"1277","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1549377000,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for the very full response.

I note the Minister of State does not refer to any additional resources being provided to the HSE women's health service.  I wonder whether resources to that important service will be increased also because the service does a great deal of work in supporting women and others involved in prostitution.<\/p> <p>I note the Minister of State's point about the report.  Section 27 of the Act states it shall include information on arrests, convictions and the impact of operation.  Is it possible, however, that other material might be in the report?  Could the Minister of State comment on that?

I am sure he will agree with me that the crisis unfolding in Venezuela over recent weeks has shocked many people with news reports of people rooting through bins to feed their children, a crisis in the availability, as well as a lack of, basic medical care and supplies, along with inflation of 1 million %.  This is all in a country which has generated $320 billion in oil revenue in the past ten years.<\/p> <p>Last year&rsquo;s Venezuelan presidential election exposed and saw electoral fraud on a massive scale.  This has been roundly condemned by the European Union and all international observers.  We have seen serious human rights abuse reports with 8,000 extrajudicial killings in the past three years by the state security services, while thousands more have been detained without charge, trial or any due process.  Many Venezuelans have been stranded abroad during the crisis, including many in Ireland, because their worsening situation has meant that they are able unable to renew their travel documents.<\/p> <p>I would be grateful if the Minister could outline what steps the Government is taking about this serious situation, particularly in conjunction with the European Union, to bring about an end to this crisis and an improvement in the lives of ordinary people in Venezuela.  Is the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade aware of Venezuelan citizens who may be stranded in Ireland and unable to return home?<\/p> <p>Will the Minister of State agree with me that some political parties and Members of the Oireachtas have not covered themselves in glory on this issue?  Many Members of this House spent much time raising human rights abuses in the context of the debate on the occupied territories Bill but have been curiously silent on this issue.  The Minister of State will be aware that two senior members of Sinn F&eacute;in, including its general secretary, attended Mr. Maduro&rsquo;s inauguration recently.  It was Sinn F&eacute;in's connected organisation, the IRA, which committed 1,800 extrajudicial killings on this island that are still not condemned outright.  In one way, we cannot be surprised that it has no objection to 8,000 extrajudicial killings committed by the Venezuelan regime.<\/p> <p>It is not just Sinn F&eacute;in of course.  Over the weekend, I heard Deputy Paul Murphy of the so-called Socialist Party say that the economic crisis in Venezuela was due to the fact that Mr. Maduro was not left wing enough.  Even our President has joined this bandwagon in the past, I am sorry to say.  He praised the former Venezuelan President, Hugo Ch&aacute;vez, for achieving \"a great deal in his term in office, particularly in the area of social development and poverty reduction&rdquo;.  These policies are now the policies universally agreed to be the root cause of the current misery of the Venezuelan people.  I do not say this to be nit-picking but because it is a serious subject.  It highlights the bankrupt political ideology of many of the hard left.  It does not seem to matter how many people suffer or die, so long as their left-wing experiment is protected at all costs.<\/p> <p>I hope the Minister of State will agree with me that sentiments praising the Maduro regime do not represent the views of the Irish people.  The Government has moved on this issue by recognising of the head of the Venezuelan National Assembly, Juan Guaid&oacute;.  Will the Minister of State endorse what two Venezuelan nationals living in Ireland, Kley Salinas and Liliana Fernandez, who said in an interview at the weekend that &ldquo;Your body is here in Ireland but your mind is in Venezuela&rdquo;, living in fear for those back home?

It stated that if no announcement regarding fresh elections were to be made over the intervening days, the EU would take further actions, including regarding the issue of recognition of the country's leadership.  Ireland reaffirms its full support for the democratically elected National Assembly, the last remaining fully democratic institution in Venezuela, emphasising that its powers need to be restored and respected.

Ms Mogherini also took the opportunity to announce the establishment by the EU of an international contact group for Venezuela.

Such vacancies which could offer jobseekers opportunities to take up locally-based and suitable employment that contributes to the community.

It is the product of a major body of work with academics, sexual health experts, teachers organisations, bodies representing students and school boards of management.  We have made a number of wide-ranging recommendations on curriculum reform that will now be delivered to the Minister for Education and Skills and fed into the review being carried out by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA.  Our recommendations have at all times been guided by best practice and domestic and international evidence, and motivated by wanting to see our young people happy, empowered and informed as they explore relationships and sexuality for the first time.  It has been over 20 years since the social, personal and health education, SPHE, curriculum was last reviewed and we want to make sure our proposed reforms reflect the huge social and political changes in Ireland during that time, particularly the recent referendums on same-sex marriage and repeal of the eighth amendment.<\/p> <p>The report and its recommendations are detailed and comprehensive.  I would like to draw attention of the House to some key changes we have proposed.  We want relationships and sexuality education, RSE, and SPHE classes to start at a younger age in primary school and in a developmentally appropriate manner.  The use of outside providers is the most common way RSE is delivered to students at the moment and we want such providers regulated by the HSE and the Department of Education and Skills.  We want teachers to be able to be specialised in RSE and we want RSE reform to be taught as part of a whole-school approach, with extra resources given to school principals and boards to support this.  In terms of the curriculum, we have recommended that LGBTQI education, consent, reproductive healthcare and pornography form part of any new curriculum.  We have also called for the amendment of the Education Act 1998 to remove ethos as a barrier to delivering objective and factual sex education.  This is a progressive report, proposing some big changes that will benefit students and young people.  I would like the Leader to organise a debate in the Seanad on the report in the near future.<\/p> <p>On a related note, I ask the Government for an update on the plans to fully commence the Data Protection Act 2018, including the provisions on the micro-targeting of children, which Senator Higgins and I worked to include in the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019020500002#P00200","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"speech","time":1549377000,"counter":47,"content":"<p>Like others, I want to raise the issue of the nurses strike and to express support and solidarity with the 30,000 members of the INMO who are striking for the first time in 20 years.  I join with others in calling on the Government to engage urgently with the INMO to address, in particular, the very valid concerns it has raised around recruitment and retention of nurses and around patient safety in hospitals because of under-staffing as a result of the difficulties with recruitment and retention.  As Deputies Howlin, Kelly and others have stated in the D&aacute;il, this engagement can be carried out within the framework of the public service stability agreement, PSSA, particularly in the context of the issues relating to recruitment and retention.  It is worth noting the Opposition has been calling for a general review of changes in work practices and of additional duties now being taken on by nurses, and that such a review should consider, therefore, the issues the INMO has been raising around the increased professionalisation of nursing.  I should add I have been contacted - as I am sure Senators Norris and Ruane have - by Trinity nursing graduates who point out to us the huge transformation that has occurred in recent years within the nursing profession, with the increased professionalisation of nursing and the awarding of degrees.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Ivana Bacik:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2248\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Furthermore, the huge expansion in postgraduate nursing studies has resulted in some incredible research coming out of third level institutions which has really changed the nature of the nursing profession.

We need urgent clarification from the Government on this issue.  It raises the question down the road about the cost and the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare, which is a real elephant in the room.  We see the issue of the children's hospital and the difficulty bringing it forward in a responsible manner and in accordance with projected costs and then we look at the enormous cost potential of Sl&aacute;intecare, yet there is a very significant political buy-in to Sl&aacute;intecare and its proposals.  We ask the Leader for clarification from Government and the Minister for Health on this issue.<\/p><p>I also ask colleagues for support on the parental leave legislation, which we will bring forward in the Labour Party's Private Members' time tomorrow.  I thank all those colleagues who have assisted us in this regard.  My Labour Party colleagues and I, and Senator Norris in our Seanad Technical Group, are putting forward this Bill on Committee Stage.  We will table amendments and we hope colleagues will support the amendments, which are mostly technical, simply to ensure that the Bill will be straightforward and effective in implementation.

I would like to have outlined to me what its expertise is, since the first thing it did was to telephone England and find some other organisation that might be able to research what has happened here for &euro;450,000.  I just question its expertise.  Why must it bring in someone from outside this island?  There is nothing wrong with doing so, but we could have done that ourselves.  That is the first thing.  I want an explanation.<\/p> <p>The second matter I wish to raise concerns the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan.  A very interesting thing happened on a certain road in Ireland recently.  Two semi-detached houses were up for sale at reasonable prices.  Families with two, three and four children came to view the houses and queued, but the houses were bought by Chinese people who were able not only to match the price but nearly to double it and pay in cash.  In this country Chinese businessmen are given residency and the possibility of national passports - there is nothing wrong with that - for investments, be they in research, property or other fields.  I would like some explanations about this.  There is nothing wrong with people buying houses if they have a legal right to do so, but I think this activity is pushing up prices here for all the wrong reasons.  I know of two or three instances of students living in the houses, which could be best bought by the Irish and be home to a family of five or six.

As everyone knows, the CAO is the mechanism by which we assess and allocate college places, based on a points system related to performances across academic subjects.  I want to make a specific proposal and I would like the Minister to come to the House to address it.  I am proposing that 80 points - that figure is open to negotiation - of the now 630 points are taken away, with 50 of them committed to involvement in social work and social action and the remaining 30 committed to sport and cultural activities, to be monitored and assessed by a subgroup of teachers in the pastoral care sector of the school and to be part of the assessment of the child.  This would create a social awareness in our young people.  It would create an interest in social action and social concern, which is a crucial in young people.  The cultural-sporting dimension would reward children for participation in school musicals, the county minor teams and so on so that their sporting and cultural lives would develop.  The question might be in some people's minds that this would compromise academia and reduce academic performance but the contrary is the case as it would bring social concern, social awareness and social commitment, plus sporting and cultural development, into academia.  Students would do a much better job and better understand their academic studies.  Whether studying the humanities, the social sciences or science in general, they would do so with a consciousness that is very important.  We need to have young people who understand their society and how it works.  I am effectively asking the Leader to invite the Minister for Education and Skills to the House to begin the debate in this House - it should be in this House - on how the points system functions, what it assesses in young people, what type of young people it prioritises into courses and what we could do complement what is there.

All the secondary schools in County Cavan have completed the programme, with 27 teachers across the county now qualified to teach CPR.  The schools in County Monaghan are not far behind, with 83 secondary schools currently engaged on the programme.  The Irish Heart Foundation, which I congratulate on its initiative, hopes to roll out the CPR 4 Schools programme to all secondary schools in the country.  It is a very ambitious plan to save lives.  Schools in counties Monaghan and Cavan are leading the way and I compliment them for that.<\/p> <p>It should be noted that there are 5,000 cardiac arrests each year in this country.  A person qualified in CPR being close by when a person suffers a heart attack could be the difference between life and death.  In any given year, there are approximately 365,000 students in our secondary schools and there is the potential for all of those students to become competent in CPR, which could save lives.<\/p> <p>While I commend the teachers and students for their passion and initiative, the programme shines a light on the Department of Education and Skills which is not doing its job in regard to CPR and first aid in general.  That was one of the main reasons that I introduced the First Aid and Mental Health in Schools (Existing Teachers) Bill 2018 and the First Aid and Mental Health in Schools (Initial Teacher Training) Bill 2018 a couple of weeks ago which, thankfully, received the unanimous support of all Senators.

It is made even more deceptive by a letter suggesting doctors could face legal action for &quot;assaulting&quot; women unless that GP had recorded evidence that the woman consented to a termination of pregnancy.  This cohort of activists uses such names as The Women's Centre, Good Counsel Network Ireland and Ultrasound Services WCN for the purposes of sounding legitimate.  The bogus clinic previously came to our attention when an undercover video was posted of a woman receiving untruthful, unscientific advice, which was used to prevent her getting an abortion, such as suggesting an abortion could cause cancer or that women who have abortions are vulnerable to committing child abuse.<br\/><br\/>Let us be under no illusions.  Those who wish to deceive doctors and shame vulnerable women are not justified in what they are doing.  We have had national conversations about this and have had referenda on the subject.  The public has given its answer as to whether abortion services should be available to women.  We have had enough stories of shame and stigma and those who wish to return to that by protesting, offering GP services or posting confidential doctor and patient information online should reconsider their actions.

I know of some young people who have done the leaving certificate applied and gone to college through it.

It is important we have a respectful implementation of the new law of the land.  That requires respect for different viewpoints.  It is disappointing that the types of activity referred to are being carried out.  I know there is a debate during the week in the Oireachtas on these types of protest.  I do not believe anybody should be allowed to protest at a maternity hospital or a doctor&rsquo;s surgery.  The dignity and privacy of citizens going about their business, for whatever reason, should be respected.

It is very important to say that for many of the things we count or many of the different pieces of information we put out, we are gathering statistics from local authorities or other areas and compiling them for publication.  That is done at official level.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Eoghan Murphy:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2288\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2288&amp;amp;pid=EoghanMurphy&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Figures for emergency accommodation every month come from the different regions which themselves collect the information from local authorities.  The Dublin Regional Homeless Executive is involved in compiling them.  We have said that that data collection needs to be improved because it is not capturing enough information.  When the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive did a deeper dive last year and produced a report over two quarters, it was able to tell us a lot more information.  It is the type of information that we should always be gathering so that work to capture more data for those monthly reports is now happening.<\/p><p>Senator Mullen asked about a particular Dublin City Council site and housing body.  He said there had been a delay.  I am not sure of the specific site.  The Senator can provide me with information.  We have a delivery office in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government so that where there are delays and snags or problems that require people to sensibly put their heads together, it does that.  As we all know, things can sometimes crop up which can lead to long delays if they are not resolved quickly.  The housing delivery office is there to work with the local authorities.  I have asked colleagues in this House and elected representatives in local authorities to bring areas where they think there are unnecessary delays directly to my attention so that I can chase them up in the Custom House.<\/p><p>Senator Mullen also asked about voids.  He mentioned 4,000 voids.  We have remediated 8,000 to 9,000 vacant social housing homes that were empty and needed significant repair over the last four to five years.  We are coming towards the end of that programme.  These are social housing homes that were vacant and required as much as &euro;30,000 in investment to get them back into use and letting.  I hope we will have the numbers for 2018 next week.  We will see that approximately 500 to 600 voids have been remediated over the course of 2018.  We would have done much more than that but we agreed that we would not count above what was in the targeted amount.  A lot is happening in that area.<\/p><p>I am supportive of pre-fabrication, modular and rapid technologies.  It is also important that as we bring in new housing, we have to bring in all of the facilities required.  While there are efficiencies and gains to be made with these new technologies, one still needs to go through planning and procurement, and to put in footpaths, electricity and water.  We want to and are doing it, as is the private sector but it has other time and investment requirements that traditional housebuilding also has.<\/p><p>Senator Kieran O'Donnell made a point about recognising that a Government that is led by Fine Gael, Independents and the Independent Alliance is building social housing homes, as have previous Governments.  People hark back to different times in Irish history where it is assumed that we were building more social housing homes.  While that might be correct for individual years, I read an interesting piece by Karl Dieter over the weekend in which he wrote about the 1950s being the most successful decade for the building of social housing in the State's history.  The average output per year in the 1950s was 6,000 social housing homes.  We will build more than that this year.  We have brought that responsibility back to the heart of Government and local authorities.  Delivery is ramping up and I will have confirmation of the 2018 figures next week, I hope.  They will show that, at the moment, one in four to one in five of new homes built in the country is a social housing home.  That has not happened for a long time and it is welcome.<\/p><p>Senator Kieran O'Donnell was also right to talk about how we need to make sure that we build mixed tenure estates.  We want our housing policy to help to build, unite and support communities rather than dividing them.  That means having mixed tenure, whether in apartment or housing developments.  He also asked about whether empirical work had been done on the viability of house-building.  It has been done with regard to the building of semi-detached or terraced homes and apartments.  When doing these viability reports, one builds in margins in certain areas as contingencies against risk.  There has to be a profit margin because it has to be affordable for the builder to develop it.  Depending on the project itself, there will be a greater or lesser gain depending on how risk was programmed into different elements of the build.  It is also true that land costs could be a significant contributory factor.  Land costs in the State plummeted after the financial collapse but began to rapidly increase again from 2015 onwards.  It will depend on when many builders bought the land.<\/p><p>The Rebuilding Ireland home loan has been a success.  We have seen that in the level of drawdowns.  It has been operating for almost a year and as of December, approximately half of the allocation for three years has been drawn down.  That has been successful.  Senator O'Donnell made a point about some local authorities building in the wrong locations and that there was inadequate due diligence.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Eoghan Murphy:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2288\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2288&amp;amp;pid=EoghanMurphy&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->If that is the case and if he has examples of that, it is difficult to square it with people stating that we need to cut red tape in the Custom House and strip out some of the oversight that exists.  The Senator makes an important point.  However, we in government and as Members of the Oireachtas have to make sure that, as we rebuild our housing sector and get local authorities back into building, we build the right homes in the right places and that we do not relax things so much that we end up making mistakes like we did in the past, leading to ghost housing estates or developments like Priory Hall in the future.  While we have cut red tape and streamlined things in the Department, and we are looking to make a few more changes in that area, we have to be careful that we do not go too far.<\/p><p>Senator Norris described the role of the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government as a poisoned chalice.  I do not agree.  Of course, it is a challenge.  It is perhaps the most important domestic challenge we face but it is one we can resolve and are resolving.  Within the plans we have, some things will work well initially and others will not and will need to be reformed and monitored to see that they are working.  Overall, at a high level, when we look at what we are trying to achieve, which is basically to increase the supply of homes as quickly and sustainably as possible.  That is happening..  Even in the supplements of the newspapers, we can see that it is happening.  Of course, we need to do more but the fundamental supply problem is being corrected and we need to drive that further.<\/p><p>Senator Norris is correct to state that this cannot be solved overnight.  When we are talking about building any house or housing scheme, it will take a time to move from the initial idea to planning, design, procurement, building and occupancy.  We are not just talking about a few schemes but about thousands upon thousands of new homes.  We are also talking about rebuilding those elements of the housing system that had been broken, whether in regard to the skilled labourers who are needed, the architects whose profession got hammered or those who had emigrated.  In addition, we did not initially have the finances and they had to be restored.  New procurement and planning procedures have been put in place, including the fast-track process.  We are doing all of those things and increasing our resources in each part of the housing sector while at the same time starting to build.  It is happening now but it takes time.<\/p><p>I also agree with Senator Norris that we cannot return to the sprawling housing estates of three-bedroom semi-detached homes.  Let us take the example of Crumlin, a great area and a very desirable location but the density is far too low in terms of what should have been built there.  Good planning should take advantage of the infrastructure that is there in the city and also have regard to issues such as climate change and the environment that are very important for us and for future generations.  We have to make sure we do not make those kinds of density mistakes into the future.  When we talk about building now, we must look for infill development or increasing densities where we can, particularly around transport corridors, and that means more apartment building.<\/p><p>Senator Norris also referred to the numbers in emergency accommodation and to the massaging of the figures.  I have to disagree with that absolutely.  We are talking about people in emergency accommodation.  What was discovered by the Dublin Region Homeless Executive when it was doing its work in conjunction with my Department was that some people had been categorised as being in emergency accommodation when they were not.  These are people who had been in their own homes and who had been at risk of going into emergency accommodation but, because of the financial support they received from local authorities, they never had to leave their own home, never presented for emergency accommodation and never became homeless, yet were counted as being in emergency accommodation.  That miscategorisation issue was accepted by the Oireachtas when we discussed it at the Oireachtas committee, although some have since gone back on that for political reasons.<\/p><p>It is very important that we understand who is in emergency accommodation, not just because of the numbers involved but because we need to know why they are in emergency accommodation and how we get them out of emergency accommodation in a sustainable way.  That is where the Department and the local authorities are focused, namely, on understanding who is there and how we help them out of emergency accommodation into sustainable homes.  It is very important that we can do this work and that we have an accurate understanding of the enormous scale of the challenge.  We will continue to work with local authorities to address all of the issues we can but, of course, concomitant with that is the delivery of new homes, which is happening, and, in addition, the delivery of a family hub programme where we can have safe, secure supports for families until we get them into their new homes.  The figures show that, on average, families are spending less than six months in family hubs, which is very important for those families.<\/p><p>Senator Buttimer was right to refer to focusing on affordability.  It is incredibly important that the State is directly involved in building social housing homes but it must be noted that the majority of people do not qualify for social housing.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Eoghan Murphy:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2288\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2288&amp;amp;pid=EoghanMurphy&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is true to say that the vast majority, with just a little bit of help, could make that money go a long way.  That is the reason we put together the help-to-buy scheme, to help people put together a deposit because they were finding it difficult.  That is the reason we have the Rebuilding Ireland home loans, namely, to give people affordable mortgages where they were not able to borrow from the banks because the rates offered by the banks would not allow that.  This fixed-rate product over the lifetime of the loan, linked to affordability, rather than loan to income, had been very successful in that regard in helping people to get affordable mortgages.<\/p><p>We have the rent pressure zones, which are rent caps, and they have been shown to be working, although we need to do more work to make them work better.  We also have the serviced sites fund, which is an affordability package to help local authorities to deliver affordable homes on their own land.  All those things will help with affordability, as will the delivery of new homes.  Recent evidence has begun to show us that the increasing supply is having a moderating impact on house price inflation.<\/p><p>I believe the Central Bank mortgage rules are prudent and should remain because it is important that we do not return to practices of the past.  We have made a number of changes to address the cost of building homes and making it more viable but we will not be stepping into areas that were shown to be mistakes in the past such as using tax incentives to promote a particular type of building in a particular area.  That did not work.  It hollowed out the tax base and was very risky and as a result our stock of public debt ballooned.  It did not balloon because we took on bank debt.  Bank debt is only about a quarter of the stock of debt we took on.  We took on a significant stock of debt because we had to continue to fund public pay, public pensions and the various social services support, but because the taxes had dropped so dramatically, because there were unsustainable tax changes such as the ones I mentioned, that is where the real exposure came and the significant risk to the economy.  That burden that was taken on by taxpayers, by all of us.  We will not be returning to that old thinking of the past.<\/p><p>I agree with what was said about the need for more private homes in Cork.  We set up a task force in Cork to look at a range of issues and that has been very successful in terms of driving delivery.  We are going to replicate that approach in other parts of the country where it is needed.<\/p><p>I was asked whether the Rebuilding Ireland home loan approval is even throughout the country.  There was some reportage on it which said there was a lack of consistency across the country.  I do not think it was comparing like with like in terms of time horizons but if Members are concerned, we carried out a review of the Rebuilding Ireland home loan to make sure that it is being applied consistently across the country, which is very important.  On a number of occasions we have worked with the Housing Agency and some of the key local authorities to make sure that the staff involved in the scheme have the training and know exactly how the loan is to be applied.<\/p><p>Senator Lawlor referred to the increase in social housing in Kildare since 2011.  It is important to note that according to some of the latest figures I have seen, there has been an eight fold increase in new social housing homes being built since the year before Rebuilding Ireland was launched.  That is not a coincidence.  It is because of Rebuilding Ireland and the policies in it that we have seen that dramatic increase in social housing supply.  He asked about the Land Development Agency.  Its intention is to lodge its first planning applications this year.  The first board meeting was held on Monday of last week.  There is a great team involved in the board and the organisation itself.  The agency continues to hire staff.  It has its first eight sites and it is moving on those as quickly as it can.  What we have seen recently is some very important reportage on the reason we need the Land Development Agency and why it should always have been there.  It will do very important work, long after we all have left both this House and the D&aacute;il.<\/p><p>Home Building Finance Ireland is open.  The website is in place.  A total of &euro;750 million is available for lending.  It wants to begin lending in the first quarter.  It is primarily looking at starter homes and small and medium sized builders.  The capital is available and more capital can be made available.  We want to make sure that we are communicating to people that they can borrow.  A roadshow is about to get under way, working with the Construction Industry Federation and another organisation, the name of which I cannot recall.  Given that we have been putting the plans in place for Home Building Finance Ireland, a lot of people know that it is there and are ready and waiting to put their applications in, so we hope it will start lending in this first quarter.<\/p><p>I already talked about the Rebuilding Ireland home loan.  We are looking at a possible second tranche at the moment with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  Local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, funding is ring-fenced.  Some sites are very complex because they involve a number of landowners and a number of different types of infrastructure to unlock the housing.  Other sites are more straightforward, such as some of the sites in Fingal, where the Donabate distributor road is already under construction.  LIHAF, funding is ring-fenced to be drawn down as it is needed.  That &euro;200 million commitment is safe.  It is possible for someone who is divorced or separated to apply for the Rebuilding Ireland home loan, even though he or she may have owned a home previously.  If there are difficulties in terms of interpretation of the application form, Members should please bring them to my attention.<\/p><p>We need more modular homes, more timber-frame homes.  Frameworks are in place for prefabricated technology to be used.  I am going to speak at a thought leadership seminar on that after this session as to how we can get people to do more in terms of using prefabrication.  It is important to note, however, that it is only one part of the process.  It is a good part because it involves new efficient technology that should be used, but one still needs to have planning, do procurement, build the roads and the infrastructure and everything else.  While it is an efficiency, and it is of great benefit to those who are building but also those who will live in the new homes and it will cut timelines and cut costs, other things need to happen as well in tandem with that.<\/p><p>In regard to listed buildings, heights and the notion of overlooking, one of the things I wanted to make sure that we were doing in removing the height caps that we have in towns and cities throughout the country is that it could not then be undermined by, for example, the degree to which a new building might overlook a historic building.  It is important that we keep in mind our heritage, in particular our built heritage and history in cities, but other modern cities have managed to bring in tall buildings and protect their heritage.  We can do it too.  Many of the bad planning decisions that were made in the past in cities were not necessarily made in relation to height but other factors that meant whole buildings were torn down that should not have been torn down or the building of a particular type where the design rather than the height was inappropriate for the context or setting into which it was going.  That has changed.  Some of the building that has happened around Leinster House has been built bearing in mind its local environment and it has sat very well into the streetscape, so we can have modern new buildings that are exciting, visually appropriate and tall without having a negative impact on historic settings.  We are talking about lifting the height caps, not so that we can necessarily go to the moon but to make sure that we build an appropriate shoulder height and maximising the type of densities that we want to achieve where the existing infrastructure and places to work and live are already there.<\/p><p>Senator Humphreys talked about the investment in housing and he made some points about an increased investment in the build-to-rent sector.  We can have a detailed discussion on that.  Build to rent is going to be an important part of the rental market in the future.  It will be important in terms of more apartments being built.  We developed build-to-rent guidelines for the first time to encourage more investment in the build-to-rent sector and we are seeing that happen.  We want larger, more professional landlords because we need a better balance in the landlord sector.  We are still too reliant on small and accidental landlords for the provision of much of our rental stock.  It is very important in parts of the country where one only needs a smaller amount of rental provision that there will be smaller individual landlords with one or two properties but in other parts of the country one needs the bigger investors coming in and that is the reason there are better regulations for it.  It is important that we have that kind of investment where people are investing for a rent roll rather than capital appreciation, where people are happy to look for modest increases in rent over a period because they are looking for a steady and sustainable return on investment rather than investing in a property, hoping it might skyrocket in price over a five or ten year period and then get out and get that capital appreciation.  That is the type of reform we have seen in the rental sector, which we are trying to drive with new guidelines and regulations.<\/p><p>More people will be renting.  It is not just a function of the fact that house prices have gone back up again to a point where they are out of the reach of many.  It is because people are staying in college later.  They are meeting their partners later.  They are starting families later.  They are moving jobs more frequently and they are moving in and out of the country.  Some people will want to maintain the flexibility that renting gives, even as their lives change.  The key responsibility for us as a Government is to make sure that renting is affordable and can be safe, secure and sustainable for them.  That speaks to the changes that we are trying to bring forward in the rent Bill and changes that will come in the rent Bill after that.<\/p><p>We also need cost rental.  I was at the St. Michael's Estate where we want to do the first cost rental properties at scale.  Other countries have cost rentals as part of the rental landscape of the order of 20% to 25% of the stock of what is being rented.  If we are honest about it, it will take us a long time to get there, but we need to make sure that we can do it at scale and that is what the St. Michael's project is about.  We will do it at scale first and then replicate it.  Once we have proven that concept, we can then roll it out to other areas.  That will suit young couples, young workers and the elderly.  We know cost rental can get longer term leases that are secure, and that also provide security on rent payments that are below the market rent, linked into a nominal increase, that is nothing like even the 4% we have in rent pressure zones.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Eoghan Murphy:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2288\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2288&amp;amp;pid=EoghanMurphy&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> Regarding short-term letting or home-sharing, Senator Humphreys asked whether the changes have been published.  We have sent the proposed changes to the Oireachtas joint committee and it has already examined them in a private session.  I will bring in a very simple change to primary legislation and I hope to do that soon and then we will lay the regulations, when finalised, before the House.  That change came into effect on 1 January this year.  <\/p><p>On the proposed development at Poolbeg, that matter is still with An Bord Plean&aacute;la but I hope it will have been dealt with soon.  I am reticent to talk about it publicly while it is still before An Bord Plean&aacute;la but the commitments that have been made on that front must be honoured. <\/p><p>Senator Mulherin asked about the important issue of mica and pyrite.  This issue has been raised by a number of colleagues from different parties and particular counties.  Thanks to the work of Senator Mulherin and others, agreement was reached at budget time between my Department and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to introduce a scheme.  The scheme was approved by Government we will put it in place this year.  We have been doing considerable work with officials in the background to work out the details.  The scheme is basically ready and it is now a question of aligning the funding for it in order that people can start to make applications.  I will publish more details when I have them.  We hope to bring the scheme before Cabinet again very shortly.<\/p><p>A housing summit in the next two weeks will discuss the targets we set for 2018 and what was delivered against them.  In terms of the social housing needs assessment, the number of people waiting for social housing has dropped in recent years because of the increased social housing supports and solutions that have been put in place.  Security of tenure is an important issue and changes are coming in that respect.<\/p><p>I spoke recently about the repair and lease scheme.  We had to make changes to the scheme because it was not working in the way we had initially hoped.  As a result of the reforms that have been made, the scheme is working better, although more could be done with it.  In some cases, local authorities found that applicants to the repair and lease scheme were better suited to the buy and renew scheme and they were transferred into the latter scheme.  While the repair and lease scheme is working, the vacancy level was not as high as we initially anticipated because the figures from the Central Statistics Office included homes for sale, homes in between lettings and holiday homes.  As we drill down into each local authority area, we see the true level of vacancy.  <\/p><p>I spoke to Senator McFadden in the Chamber last week about the vacancy level in County Westmeath.  The vacancy team in the Westmeath local authority area has started work and we have vacancy action plans for each local authority area.  I would be happy to discuss with any Senator the local authority plan in his or her area and what has been achieved in terms of compulsory purchase orders issued or homes identified to bring into the social housing net.  The key point is that such homes are in the right area, namely, villages and town centres where we also want regeneration.  <\/p><p>Senator Boyhan asked about the Shanganagh Castle site.  To update him briefly, my Department has been meeting officials from D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdwn County Council on a regular basis about this proposal.  We also meet them every month to discuss housing delivery in general at which time we raise this issue because we know how important it is for the area.  The council is also working with the National Development Finance Agency with regard to funding options.  Five meetings took place between February and September 2018 on this particular proposal and the funding potential.  The council has been briefed on the different models that could be progressed.

If the Minister is saying that the Attorney General cannot ask anybody else if they are willing to take the job and that nobody else can indicate that they would be willing to take the job - I do not like the word; I prefer \"position\" - , although he says he is preserving the Government's constitutional prerogative, he is no longer providing a means whereby it can be exercised.  If the constitutionality of this Bill was being considered, a court would have to interpret it in a manner which is consistent with the Constitution.

First, I do not agree with my distinguished colleague, Senator McDowell, in objecting to the word &quot;job&quot;.  Being a judge is a job.  They get paid for it and they do it.  It is a job.  Let us not be snobbish about it.  We do not all live in Rathmines.  Second, the Minister has described this as undesirable.  In what way is it undesirable?  Can he give reasons for considering this process to be undesirable?<\/p><p>Many years ago - it must be over 50 years ago - a job came up in the English department in Trinity College.  Some 47 people applied for it, and I was given the wink.  I had not been considering applying for it; I did not think I would get it.  I did apply for it and I got it.  It was amazing, particularly since the leading candidate delighted me because they asked him what he thought about Anglo-Irish literature and he said he would prefer not to think about it at all.  That was the end of him, and I got the job.  I am very grateful for this idea of being able to let somebody know about a job because there might be a very good candidate who had not thought of it, was away on holidays or whatever.<\/p><p>On the idea of letting somebody know that the Government regards them as suitably qualified and a proper person, the Minister is talking about openness and transparency.  Surely to God that is openness and transparency.  There is no intention of concealing this.  If the Minister would prefer, we could insert an additional form of words in the amendment saying that this correspondence had to be published in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il<\/i>so that the public would know about it.  I have no problem with the public knowing but I certainly believe that a member of the Judiciary should be allowed to know that the Government would look favourably upon his or her candidacy.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator David Norris:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1758\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I am struck by the logic and justness of Senator McDowell's argument that if there are only three candidates - there is a limit of three on these shortlists - and if all three are regarded by the Government as not completely suitable, what is it to do?  It could issue advice to all of those involved or make a special broadcast on Raidi&oacute; &Eacute;ireann to the effect that there is a judicial appointment coming up but that the three boyos who are in for it are all useless and that it would therefore like to solicit applications from others.  What is proposed seems to be a nonsense.  Senator McDowell is well advised in what he says regarding the constitutionality of it.  This is, to quote a favourite phrase from my late brother, the rock upon which the legislation might perish.  Perhaps the Government thinks that would be quite a good idea.  Perhaps it secretly approves of the work that Senator McDowell and I, among others, have done in laying the foundation for a review of this legislation regarding its constitutionality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019020500002#HH00900","speaker":"1392","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1549377000,"counter":436,"content":"<p>I do not accept the view that aspects of this Bill impinge adversely on the constitutional right of the Government to determine the names for appointment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019020500002#JJ00200","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1549377000,"counter":437,"content":"<p>The Government is not doing it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019020500002#JJ00300","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1549377000,"counter":438,"content":"<p>There may well be circumstances, for example, where the Government could ask the commission to revisit, to readvertise or to rehear.

What is it to do when that happens?  I do not see written into this Bill the phrase, \"Sorry, try again\".  I do not see provision for an indication to the commission that the Government is unhappy with the three people nominated and that it requires the commission to readvertise the position or to look again at candidates 4, 5 and 6 to see if any of them might be suitable.  With the greatest respect, I do not think that any of that is possible under this Bill.  I do not think the Government is entitled to state that candidates 1, 2 and 3 on the list are not of interest to it for appointment to the Supreme Court and to ask the commission to look again at the remainder.  I do not think there is any provision for interaction between the commission and the Government along those lines, which is a very serious problem.  The Government is faced with three names which it has rejected or with which it is not happy, deeming the individuals involved not to be the best.  It does not propose to appoint any of them to the Supreme Court but what it is to do then?  Is it to communicate with the commission and ask it to look at candidates 4, 5 and 6?  Is it to ask the commission to give it another three names until it is happy?  No, because that would fly in the face of that the Minister says is the policy of this legislation.  Is the commission to readvertise the post, throw all of the cards up in the air and see how they fall a second time?  Perhaps more people will apply second time around but the commission might have no idea who the Government thought was better than those recommended and who would be acceptable to it.<\/p> <p>This is very much the central problem with this legislation.  If the Government has a prerogative to reject the three names suggested, there is absolutely no guidance or provision in the legislation for telling the commission to come up with other names.  If the Government, in those circumstances, tried to remedy the situation by asking the Attorney General if there is anyone better that he or she thinks the Government should appoint and whether that person is available, the Minister is saying that this, at a minimum, is undesirable.  He called this reverse canvassing and it seems to be something which he is not prepared to accept can happen because he keeps rejecting amendments to permit it to happen.  What are we to make of this legislation?  As already stated, if legislation is put to the test, the test that the courts apply is whether there is a reasonable constitutional construction which would save the Bill.  The courts do not determine whether the provision means either A or B.  If, on the face of it, the legislation looks like it means A but B is also a reasonable interpretation of it and if B is the constitutional interpretation of it, then under the double construction rule, the courts save the legislation and say that it means B.  I am merely asking why, in those circumstances, the Minister is incapable of accepting any amendment which would allow the Government to exercise its discretion and to take the initiative in certain circumstances to identify a person it considers suitable and to determine whether that person is ready and willing to serve as, for example, an ordinary member of the Supreme Court.  I cannot see why this legislation would not make such provision, except for two possible reasons.  Either the Minister is unwilling to accept an amendment to that effect because it might look like a formal escape route for the Government from the judicial appointments commission process or, alternatively, this is a political decision on the part of the Government to keep up the pretence that the Government will, in effect, never appoint somebody who is not on the judicial appointments commission shortlist.  Those two possibilities are equally reprehensible.<\/p> <p>In the dying minutes of the debate on the previous occasion, I asked the Minister to state clearly whether the Attorney General would be entitled to inform the Government as to whether there were other people seeking judicial appointment who were not shortlisted.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michael McDowell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->At an earlier stage in the debate the Minister intimated that he was minded to reconsider whether there could be an effective prohibition on the Attorney General making that information available to the Government.

A reading of sections 27 and 28 makes it clear that members of the commission shall be bound by confidentiality.  A member of the commission is the Attorney General.  Therefore, the Attorney General will be bound by a similar stricture.<\/blockquote><p>I need not remind the Minister or the House that the stricture in question is not merely a duty of confidentiality as one could be held criminally liable for its breach.  We have come to a sorry pass.  The Minister may be proceeding with this as a bluff.  I do not not impute that he or the Department is doing so in bad faith.

The true constitutional position is that the Government alone makes these decisions.  It may take advice from an expert body established by the Oireachtas but it cannot be corralled into a corner such that it must accept the advice of an institution established by legislation.  If that is the true constitutional position, why is there such a reluctance to accept it and to give the Government some means of getting around the circumstances which could quite easily crop up in the application of this legislation?  If the Government is not happy with any of three nominees shortlisted for a vacancy as an ordinary member of the Supreme Court, how could it be wrong for it to make inquiries regarding other people it believes would be preferable?  The suggestion that the Bill provides that the Government could somehow ask the commission to reconsider its shortlist is simply not accurate.  That is not provided in the Bill and it will not be in the Act if the Bill is passed.  There is no provision whereby the Government can indicate it is not happy with the three nominees and require the commission to come up other nominees.  <\/p> <p>Curiously, the reverse is provided for in the Bill.  Provision is made further on in the Bill for the commission to readvertise the position in a circumstance where it can only provide one or two nominees, or cannot provide any.  That gives the commission the power to declare it is not happy with the quality of the candidates.  However, the Bill does not provide an equivalent power to the Government.  There is something wrong there.  Surely, if the Government disagrees with the shortlist it must be entitled to remedy the situation and disregard the advice with which it disagrees.  That is dealt with by amendment No. 86d.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 86e, which I have not yet addressed, provides: \"Nothing in this Act affects, limits or inhibits the function of the Attorney General under Article 30 of the Constitution to freely advise the members of the Government at a meeting thereof in relation to the suitability for appointment to any judicial office of any person whether or not such person has been recommended by the Commission to the Government in respect of any judicial appointment.\"<\/p> <p>If it cannot be accepted that the amendment accords with the policy behind the legislation, I am truly worried.  How could one find objectionable the statement that nothing in the Bill affects, limits or inhibits the function of the Attorney General - the adviser of the Government in legal matters and on the law - under Article 30 of the Constitution to freely advise the members of the Government at a meeting thereof in regard to the suitability for appointment to judicial office of any person whether or not such person has been recommended by the commission to the Government in respect of any judicial appointment?  It is extraordinary that it is suggested that that is somehow objectionable and cannot be accepted.  If it cannot be accepted, that is because the Government wishes to create a false impression that the Attorney General may not offer such advice and that the Bill would affect the right to do so.

It seems Senator McDowell is very much exercised about two matters.  The first concerns maintaining the constitutional integrity of the Government&rsquo;s position, which is important.  I have listened carefully over a number of weeks to what the Senator has had to say and I am satisfied there is no infringement or restriction on what is a constitutional requirement of the Government to be free to make a choice.  I do not see where such a restriction might be evident in the legislation.<\/p> <p>The second point concerns the role and function of the Attorney General being a member of the commission and also sitting in, as that officeholder does, at Cabinet meetings.  I have pointed out previously that the Attorney General, like other commission members, is bound by statute, or by the terms of the legislation.  The role of the Attorney General, as a commission member, continues to apply in the context of the consideration by the Government of the recommended names.  My advice still is that the Attorney General would not be at liberty to say a candidate who is not recommended by the commission is, in the opinion of his office, more appropriate and suitable and, therefore, a better candidate for consideration.  This, however, has no implications for the exercise by the Government of its constitutional power to advise the President on appointments.  At the Cabinet, the Attorney General will still have an advisory role under the Constitution.  I do not see inconsistency in that.  Under the Constitution, the Government can, of course, decide whether to opt for a commission recommendation.  Alternatively, it can decide to accept names but perhaps not in the order recommended.  I am satisfied, therefore, as to the role of the Attorney General in the process.  If, like Senator McDowell, Senators continue to be concerned about the maintenance of constitutional integrity on the part of the Government to ensure it exercises free will in forwarding the name to the President, I can, if it would help to reassure them, come back with a form of wording on Report Stage, but I have built in such a provision.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Charles Flanagan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=414\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=414&amp;amp;pid=CharlesFlanagan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I reject assertions that the enactment of this Bill, leaving aside amendments Nos. 86c, 86d and 86e, will in some way unduly restrict Government in a way that conflicts with its constitutional role and function.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019020500002#LL00700","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1549377000,"counter":466,"content":"<p>I would like to tease out the astonishing absurdity of this situation.

There is no provision for that.  I ask the Minister to confirm that I am right in saying that there is no provision for the Government to communicate to the commission that it is not satisfied with the three names put forward and asking for it to put forward other names.  If I am right, the problem I am talking about is all the more obvious.  In the circumstance that the Government rejects the three proffered names ranked in the order of the commission, what is the Government practically to do?  Surely, it should be able to communicate, through the Attorney General or the Minister for Justice and Equality, with a person that it would like to appoint and ask if he or she is willing to take up the position.  The Minister has gone so far as to say that is undesirable, but he has not said it is excluded under the Bill.  Even if it were only undesirable and the policy of this Bill was to make it undesirable, we are left in the situation that, effectively, that the Government is the original submarine without a periscope in that it is told it has constitutional prerogatives and freedoms but it is given no means to ascertain how it might exercise them.  I take it that I am correct that there is no provision for the Government to go back to the commission.

Persons who are eligible for a judicial appointment and who express an interest are entitled at some stage to have the Government made aware that they are constantly being rejected.  As the Bill operates, or is intended to operate, the Government will never know that Mr. Justice or Ms Justice Bloggs has applied constantly for the past five years and will never see the shortlist.  It will be left in the exact same position of wondering whether Mr. Justice or Ms Justice Bloggs is interested in the appointment or not.  We will not know, and the Minister has crafted this legislation to ensure we never know because the only way Ms Justice or Mr. Justice Bloggs can show an interest is to apply to the commission, and the Government will not be entitled to know that fact.<\/p><p>I am not accusing the Minister or his officials of this, but there is a certain intellectual arrogance that this commission should know better than the Government and will probably make wiser choices than the Government as to who should be appointed.  That lies at the back of this proposal.  The Minister, Deputy Ross, has constantly said he wants to take the decision away from the Government and away from the hands of politicians.  Surely it must be wrong, however, that an eminent member of the Judiciary could be applying for five or seven years for appointments within the Judiciary and the Government could never know that and never know that that person was being excluded from the shortlists it is receiving.  This is what the Minister is deliberately putting in place, and there is no escaping this.  He cannot fudge this one.  What possible good is served by providing that someone who is ploughing away in the courts, doing his or her job as a judge and impressing the public never features on a shortlist?<\/p><p>Another feature of this legislation that worries me is that the Government will be faced with the same shortlist again and again.  I ask the House to imagine the following scenario, which is within the contemplation of this legislation.  If the Government receives a shortlist ordered according to the commission's preference and it goes for the commission's third preference, it is by definition saying it is not attracted to appointing No. 1 or No. 2 in preference to No. 3.  If it does appoint No. 3, however, No. 1 or No. 2 may be thrown at it again and again on shortlists, and at the expense of people whom the Government might be much happier to appoint, and the Government is kept in ignorance of this fact.  Let us be logical about this for a second.  If the commission were to recommend three candidates, A, B and C, in the order No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3, and C were appointed, would it exclude A and B at its next sitting or when the next vacancy in judicial appointments arises?  Would this be fair?  Given that the Government did not seem to be interested in A and B the last time, would the commission decide not to repeat the recommendation?  That is one scenario.  Another is that, given that the Government went for No. 3 on the previous occasion and that, logically, the commission thought A and B were better candidates, it would short-list A and B and put it back to the Government yet again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019020500002#MM02300","speaker":"1403","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1549377000,"counter":489,"content":"<p>The commission might put forward only two names, A and B.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019020500002#NN00200","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1549377000,"counter":490,"content":"<p>No.  It must put forward three under the provisions of the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019020500002#NN00300","speaker":"1403"},{"type":"speech","time":1549377000,"counter":491,"content":"<p>I thought three was the maximum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019020500002#NN00400","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1549377000,"counter":492,"content":"<p>Sorry.

I do not think it will.<\/p> <p>I do not want to be prolix.  The three amendments we are dealing with are efforts to create some means for the Government to operate in the circumstance in which it does not agree with and is unhappy with the shortlist and some means for the Government to know what the real situation is in the judicial appointments commission.  The Government will wonder why a certain perfectly good judge has never featured in a shortlist coming to it.  It will not be able to ask anyone about the matter.  Let us be clear about that.  That is what this Bill says.  One may not ask the commission why so and so is not getting appointed because the only person who will be available to answer that question is the Attorney General, who is bound by confidentiality as to why this perfectly eminent judge just never seems to make the grade and be put on a shortlist.  This is a seriously defective proposal.  When discussing a later amendment we will come to the whole business of whether people who never make it, first, will really be told they are not making it and, second, will be given what the Minister referred to, which I do not think is provided anywhere in the Bill, that is, feedback as to why they did make it, yet the Attorney General will not be given the right to tell the Government the feedback on such a person.

It will only be in exceptional circumstances that the recommendation of the commission will not be accepted by Government and I point to the history of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB, in that regard.

These are the people best placed to recognise a legal whizz-kid among them and ensure that their influence is brought to bear in the preparation of the list for Government, which is what the commission is all about.  I reject the notion that, because of the composition of this commission, talent of an extraordinary type can be blackballed by the non-legal members of the commission.  I fail to see how that could happen, having regard to the composition of the commission, including such eminent legal experts as the presidents of the court.  We are being treated to a red herring.   That said, I take very seriously the earlier points raised in respect of the constitutionality of the legislation and the maintenance and preservation of the discretion for Government to recommend for appointment somebody from the middle of the list, the top of the list, number three on the list, or from outside the list if it so chooses.

In any event, that is my personal view.  Just so the Minister is not under any illusion, I am not in favour of a self-perpetuating judicial elite and I would not be happy if the Minister reduced the number of lay people to three or two and said that was okay.  It is the rest of this Bill that I am deeply unhappy with from a constitutional perspective in that the Executive's function is being effectively transferred to a judicial appointments commission, and even though the fig-leaf to which the Minister refers is left there, every possible impediment is put before the Executive in exercising its independent choice by making it almost impossible to find out who is available, who has applied and all of that.<\/p> <p>The Minister said he hopes it will only be in exceptional circumstances that the recommendation of the commission in regard to judicial appointments will not be followed.  What the Minister forgot, when he challenged us to say from past experience what the problem was, is that it has never, ever been the case that the Executive's right to appoint or to recommend for appointment a member of the Judiciary has been in any shape or form the subject of any participation by JAAB.  That is the point the Minister is forgetting.  This is the first time the members of the Judiciary themselves are being told they must apply to this commission.  In the past the Government could say there is a vacancy in the Supreme Court and it would like to look first to the Judiciary to fill that position, it is not involving JAAB in the process at all and does not propose to do so, and it proposes to nominate a judge of the Court of Appeal or the High Court to fill that vacancy.  That is the position that exists at the moment and it has never been the occasion of cronyism.<\/p> <p>The Supreme Court has served this country extremely well.  On a point where I have some experience, although I do not profess to be infallible on the matter, the Government of the day, in deciding who it wants to be on the Supreme Court, is making a policy decision about the future direction of that court.  One cannot simply say that there is a person who is brilliant on trademark law or international law and, on some kind of calculus that might or might not impress other judges, the judicial appointments commission or anybody else, say that person on merit deserves to be in the Supreme Court.  One cannot do that.  One cannot say someone is a brilliant lawyer with a brilliant mind that can solve the most incredible legal conundrums with great facility, and that is the person who on merit should be on the Supreme Court.  If the Government comes to the view that Ms Justice so-and-so or Mr. Justice so-and-so is a brainbox, and has been there for donkey's years, the Government still has to decide whether that person's appointment to the Supreme Court directs the Supreme Court in the policy direction of that Government with regard to how the Supreme Court should look.  It is a political decision with small \"p\" and with no party attached to it, as it has been in the past.  I participated in that and I believe the Minister has participated in that.  There is no question of saying one is appointing this person simply because he or she is intellectually capable or objectively fits criteria which are set out in a statute.  It is the Executive's function to make these decisions and to apply its political judgment with a very small \"p\" to such appointments.<\/p> <p>Nobody should be under any illusion but that that is the case.  That is the right of the Executive and is why the Constitution gives this function to the Executive.  Therefore, when the Minister says that I am worried about a lay majority, he is wrong.  I am not worried about the lay majority on this occasion; I am worried about saying to sitting members of the High Court and Court of Appeal that, except in exceptional circumstances, in order to be appointed to the Supreme Court, they must be short-listed by some group outside Government.  That is my objection.  It is a rooted, radical objection to what is happening here.  I believe the Government is entitled to say, for example, there are 12 people who it considers likely candidates for the vacancy in the Supreme Court which has just emerged, but its judgment is that Ms Justice so-and-so or Mr. Justice so-and-so is the person it wants to appoint.  It does not need them to start filling out forms describing where they went to school or to prove they are representative of society as a whole.  It does not care about his or her gender, in particular.  It has different criteria, for example, it is concerned that the court is taking a conservative or a liberal direction.<\/p> <p>It was widely thought, and I think I am on safe ground on this, that some decades ago the contenders for the position of Chief Justice were too activist as members of the Supreme Court and it was generally thought that William O'Brien Fitzgerald was selected to move the Supreme Court in a slightly more conservative direction.  That was what was thought at the time.  There were eminent jurists on the Supreme Court and the Government at that time, apparently, believed that it wanted a more conservative direction to the Supreme Court, and that was its choice.  It has nothing whatsoever to do with the judicial appointments commission, which has no right to tell the Government, \"By the way, it should be Mr. Justice Bloggs or Ms Justice Bloggs.\"<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019020500002#PP00300","speaker":"1403"},{"type":"speech","time":1549377000,"counter":510,"content":"<p>Did he turn out conservative?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019020500002#PP00400","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1549377000,"counter":511,"content":"<p>He was more conservative than some of the people who were seen as the front runners, very definitely.

Whether that was a justified concern or not is a totally different matter, but that was the Government's choice and it was nothing to do with some other group of people.<\/p> <p>When looking at a decision of this kind, how can this commission evaluate whether the Government should appoint a liberal or a conservative to the Supreme Court?  If it comes up with three liberals, say, or three people of one social outlook and the Government says it is not keen on that and would like to rebalance the Supreme Court in favour of a different approach, that is the Government's prerogative alone.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michael McDowell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It has nothing to do with whether there is a lay majority on the commission.  It would apply equally if it was a self-selecting judicial college and I would have exactly the same objection.  The real question is who the Constitution states makes the choice and whether this Bill now circumscribes the way the choice is made.<\/p><p>The Minister states that it is undesirable for the Government to make approaches to anyone.  From where he does he get that idea?  What is undesirable about a Government making an approach to somebody and asking if he or she is interested in being appointed to a vacancy in the Supreme Court?  There is nothing undesirable about that but this is the result of the convoluted thought process at which we have arrived today.  It has gone on for a long time and it has made perfect sense because it is a necessary outworking of the Government's discretion to find out whether that discretion can reasonably be exercised in one direction or another, or towards one candidate or another.  For the Minister to state that it is undesirable for the Attorney General or the Minister for Justice and Equality to ask an individual, on behalf of the Government, whether he or she is interested in being appointed is absolutely misconceived.  It is totally desirable for a Government to be able to that if it so desires.<\/p><p>I am not suggesting anything radical but this option is open to the Government; it has been frequently exercised and has led to good, rather than bad, appointments.  If the Government's prerogative is preserved, as the Minister insists, it must have the necessary liberty to make inquiries and approaches in order to discover who is interested and what is going on in the judicial appointments commission, rather than be required to take its three recommendations on faith and without any knowledge as to how they were arrived at or who may have been overlooked for the shortlist.<\/p><p>This has nothing to do with the lay majority and I would be just as horrified if the Minister proposed that it should be an entirely judicial body.  I would be just as horrified if the Government was left equally tethered by the legislation.  This legislation constrains the Government, for the first time, in the context of whom it can appoint to vacancies in the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court when it wants to appoint a judge.  If it wants to appoint a serving judge, it should be free to do so.  It should be free to know whether particular people were seeking that appointment and whether they would accept it.  There is no logical reason to justify the rejection of the amendments that have been tabled other than on the basis of hostility to the Government doing it.  It is fanciful for the Minister to state that it would only be in exceptional circumstances that one of three people, nominated by the judicial appointments commission, would not be favoured by the Government for appointment to the Supreme Court.  There could be many serving members of the bench whom the Government would want but who are not on any list.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019020500002#PP00500","speaker":"1403","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1549377000,"counter":513,"content":"<p>I am glad that Senator McDowell has clarified matters because the Minister appears to have suggested that the Senator was in favour of some kind of Masonic elite within the legal profession.

I presume that refers, specifically and directly, only to subsection (2) but at the same time there is a very clear implication as a matter of policy that limiting the advice the Government may give to the President is a bad thing to do and should not be contemplated.

It can be taken as a general principle that the Government believes the advice it can give should not be limited.  Then, however, it goes on to clearly limit it.  It will limit the knowledge the Government has and the knock-on effect of this will be to automatically limit the advice it gives to the President.  It is violating the principle enunciated in section 40(3) that limiting advice is a bad idea and should be stopped.  That is why subsection (3) is there.

It also accords with what is happening in other jurisdictions, particularly the common law jurisdictions and most especially, as I have said on several occasions, in Scotland, England and Wales where we have not seen the type of trenchant opposition to change that has been spearheaded here for the past number of months by Senator McDowell.  He appears to wish to hold on to a system which is far less transparent than under the current proposals, where nobody really knows what happens.  As Senator McDowell himself says, drawing on his own experience, there is much tapping on the shoulder and requesting people to make certain overtures to the Attorney General or to Government, or both, in a way that could well be described as canvassing.  It is time we moved on to a more modern arrangement for the appointment of judges.<\/p><p>As I said earlier, I do not subscribe to the view that the commission will be anti-lawyer or anti-judge in the manner in which Senator McDowell fears in the context of non-legal representation on the commission.  I do not see it like that.  These will be people of considerable expertise who will need to accord with the various terms and conditions that we have placed in aspects of this legislation.  I am unwilling, therefore, to accept amendments Nos. 86c, 86d and 86e because I do not wish to interfere in any way with the central tenet of the reformist nature of this legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019020500002#QQ00800","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1549377000,"counter":521,"content":"<p>I wish to make a number of brief comments in response to the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019020500002#RR00200","speaker":"1403"},{"type":"speech","time":1549377000,"counter":522,"content":"<p>Go ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019020500002#RR00300","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speech","time":1549377000,"counter":523,"content":"<p>He used the word \"regularise\" as if to say that what has happened in the past is somehow irregular and I object to that proposition.

The Minister is not regularising the appointment of judges by putting this system in place.<\/p> <p>The Minister went on to claim that this will be far more transparent.  How will it be transparent?  How will anybody who has been rejected know why he or she was rejected?  How will the Government know why people who appear to be eligible are not getting shortlisted?  How can that happen if the Attorney General cannot even comment on who has failed to be shortlisted on a number of occasions?  It simply is not transparent.  There is nothing transparent about it at all.  In fact, it is all circumscribed with confidentiality and criminal sanctions for telling us the reasons behind what went on.<\/p> <p>It is now being suggested that sitting judges should go through this procedure in every case but has anybody sought the views of the Judiciary on that?  I have not seen it expressed that sitting judges should be vetted by a body for appointment to the Supreme Court.

It is important to formalise the process and that is what we are doing here.  I do not intend to accept these amendments because they go against the spirit of formalising the new structures.  That is important.  It is also appropriate that sitting members of the Judiciary are encompassed under the new legislation precisely because the nature of the informality could well give rise to a perception that matters are less than transparent.<\/p> <p>At an earlier stage I made reference to the fact that there was a large measure of consultation and that judges themselves participated in the process.
