I am very concerned about the way the energy regulator is doing its business.  It is not providing transparency in its decisions or reaching those decisions in a timely manner.  A project which clearly illustrates the problems with the energy regulator is the proposed Mayo renewable energy project, a 45 MW high efficiency combined heat and power biomass fuelled plant to be built on the former Asahi site outside Ballina.  The project lodged applications to the regulator for various consents and licences in June 2018.  Previously, the project, under a different promoter, had been licensed in 2012 by the energy regulator.  Unfortunately in 2016, even though the project was partially built, progress stalled due to financial difficulties.  Progress stopped but new promoters have now come on board.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michelle Mulherin:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2309\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2309&amp;amp;pid=MichelleMulherin&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This project is worth &euro;255 million, of which &euro;95 million has been invested to date by the new promoters who have taken an equity stake of &euro;95 million in the project.  The promoters have taken on the task of revitalising and reviving the project.  The planning permission has been extended by Mayo County Council and the promoters have received renewed consent from the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, in respect of emissions.  The promoters have received confirmation from ESB Networks that the grid offer remains in place and will be offered to the new company.  However, the promoters have tried to deal with the energy regulator, now known as the Commission for Regulation of Utilities but have run into a stone wall.  Initially the energy regulator appointed consultants and the consultant did not want to give the project a high efficiency certificate, as had previously been given and subsequent to that the energy regulator has retained new consultants.   <\/p><p>International consultants retained by the new promoters have certified that no material change has been made to this project since it was initially certified in 2012.  Equally to my knowledge, there has been no change in legislation.  I am very concerned that there will be a repeat of what happened when Apple proposed to build a data centre in Athenry.<\/p><p>This project is a golden opportunity for north Mayo and is key to developing our national policy objectives, such as renewable heat and energy, to which I know the Minister is very committed.  It is also tied in with the development of a data centre on the same site, which requires a renewable energy project to be co-located with it.  This critical project has been stalled.  <\/p><p>I believe that under the process that is being pursued by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, the promoters should be entitled to know what the problem is and the reason for such delays when there has been no material change in the projects and why a second set of consultants had to be retained.<\/p><p>Second, in respect of the legislation covering the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, I believe there should be a time limit placed in legislation upon the regulator wherein it must give a decision.  As the Minister knows, time is of the essence for the development of projects, promoters and investors do not wait around and will go somewhere else.  This project is commercially sensitive to time delays. <\/p><p>With all the resources available to the energy regulator, why is it outsourcing the evaluation of the project to another set of consultants?  All this is taking time, when we have a project that is time sensitive.  As I have said already, we have seen what happened in Athenry.  The whole community was devastated by the outcome of the delay in giving a decision of consent to Apple and ultimately because it took so long to do so, Apple pulled out.<\/p><p>There are commercial realities.  There are climate change objectives and objectives for the development of the site.  This site is in a peripheral area, where it is hard to attract investment and growth.  This project offers a golden opportunity and I do not believe the energy regulator has dealt with these investors in a fair way.  I do not believe it is fair from all the view points I have set out to the Minister and I believe it should be prescribed in legislation that the regulator should make a decision within a certain period.  When Deputy Bruton was Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, one of the directives that came from his Department and the Taoiseach of the day was that all Government agencies dealing with commercial projects should deal with them in a time-sensitive way and this clearly has not happened in this case.  The other three agencies have given consent, but the regulator has not.  Is this rocket science?  Why is there no transparency?  Why should I and any ordinary person not know what is happening in respect of a project which is of such critical importance in the area?<\/p><p>I look forward to the Minister's response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019020500002#B00500","speaker":"1425","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1549377000,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this matter.<\/p> <p>I should outline very clearly that the Commission for Regulation of Utilities is an independent regulator.

In this instance, it is establishing the heat efficiency of the particular plant.  The European documentation sets out the issues that must be considered.  I am sure the Senator and the applicant  have already had regard to those issues.  This is a complicated matter by any standard.  The regulator must examine several issues in the context of an application, including electrical, thermal and overall efficiency, power-to-heat ratios, electricity from the high-efficiency combined heat and power and primary energy savings.  It does so in accordance with formula set out in the original directive and its annexes.  The regulator has been transparent about what are the requirements.  I cannot second-guess its assessment of an application such as this, no more than the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government can second-guess An Bord Plean&aacute;la when it independently assesses an application made to it.<\/p><p>The legislation clearly sets out that the regulator is not accountable to the Minister but it provides for accountability to the Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  The independent regulator is accountable to the Oireachtas, as ought to be the case.  I cannot shed light on why nothing has changed in the view of the promoters but they have not been granted the approval which was previously given.  That is entirely a matter for the Commission for Regulation of Utilities to assess.  Unfortunately,  I am not in a position to provide an insight as to what difficulties this application may be encountering other than to point the Senator and the applicants to the very detailed guidance on what needs to be submitted, the calculations conducted by the regulator and how it weighs applications.  The very detailed source document specifies the terms within which it operates.<\/p><p>I understand the Senator's enthusiasm to have the plant approved.  However, in order to access state aid or aid through the various refit programmes it must, in addition to acquiring planning permission and EPA approval, fulfil certain criteria which are set independently, policed by the EU and administered by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities.  Obviously, it is an important element in any project but there be an independent process to vet approval in any case where benefit is being conferred.  It is not a political decision and nor should it be.  That is the position as I understand it.

They have to make sense to somebody, somewhere, and some empirical standard and test has to be applied.

The EU code states that each generational unit shall be compared with the best available and economically justifiable technology for the separate production of heat and electricity on the market in the year of construction of the cogeneration unit.  That suggests that a unit in construction in 2012, as against a unit in construction in 2018, will be compared to different economically justifiable and best available technology.  A regulator continues to evolve against the rules which are set for it.  It does not follow that if something was approved in 2012, it will be identical in 2013.  In annexe 3, it states that they are looking at a different test, and at today's technology rather than that of 2012.<\/p> <p>I do not know anything about the process but it is not as clear cut as asking why the regulator is not repeating what it did before.

Major controversy arose last year when iCare, Bluestack Special Needs Foundation and Extern were refused funding.  When we look at a map of the State, only one organisation north of the famous Galway to Dublin line, which was located in Roscommon, had received funding.  Major controversy surrounded that because both iCare and the Bluestack Special Needs Foundation have existed for many years without any substantial State funding.  iCare based in the Inishowen Peninsula, my home area, has been in existence for 18 years.  It has raised a great deal of money.  This organisation involves families who are taking care of their loved ones with intellectual special needs and trying to fundraise massive amounts of money every year.

I am delighted he is here to take this matter in which I know he has a strong interest.  My Commencement matter is to ask the Minister for Justice and Equality to provide information on the progress made to date in conducting the three-year review of the operation of section 7A of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993.  In particular, I seek an outline of the progress made in providing the additional resources promised to support those seeking to exit prostitution and for research into the operation of section 7A.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State is well aware of the context for this question.  It is the passing into law in 2017 of Part 4 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act, which created in section 7A of the 1993 Act a new offence of purchasing sexual services, thereby criminalising the buyers of sex, while also decriminalising individuals who sell sex.  The primary objective, as the Minister of State is well aware, was to tackle the demand that leads to sexual exploitation, predominantly of women and girls.  The context was the 2013 recommendation of the justice committee, which was chaired at the time by the Minister of State and on which I served, that a law be introduced here in line with the approach taken in Sweden and an increasing number of other countries worldwide which seek to tackle demand by criminalising the purchase of sex.  In Ireland, we had seen a long campaign by the civil society alliance, Turn Off the Red Light, TORL, to which more than 70 groups were affiliated.  The work of TORL fed into the committee's review but, as the Minister of State is aware, we also conducted extensive hearings.<\/p> <p>The legislation was commenced on 28 March 2017 and I understand the three-year review is thus due in March 2020.  There is some concern among civil society groups that worked with the Turn Off the Red Light campaign and are very supportive of the legislation about how the review required by section 25 of the 2017 Act will be rolled out.  My objective today is to get some clarification as to how it is proposed the review will be conducted and to ask the Minister of State to outline whether the promised additional resources will be provided to support those seeking to exit prostitution.  A review of the debates on this matter would show that even those who opposed the legislation supported the provision of resources to assist those who wish to exit prostitution.  There was an expectation that projects such as the Women's Health Project and groups working closely with those seeking to exit prostitution such as Ruhama would be given resources to assist them in their important work.  The Minister of State travelled with other members of the committee to Sweden on a fact-finding trip in 2012 when we saw the resources that are put in place in that country to support the implementation of its law.<\/p> <p>I am also keen to find out what progress has been made in resourcing research into the operation of section 7A.  We need to ensure the review will be evidence based and research will be done to provide facts on which the review will be based.<\/p> <p>I would also like resourcing to be provided for a public awareness programme on the legislation and its purpose.  The first conviction under Part 4 was reported on 21 January last.  One assumes the reporting of that conviction will have knock-on and deterrent effects.  We know from other research that knowledge that people are likely to be prosecuted acts as a deterrent and has a very welcome effect of suppressing demand.  We know also that implementing new criminal legislation creates challenges.  While the reporting of cases such as the conviction secured in recent weeks will have an important chilling effect, we are all conscious that resourcing must be put in place for specialist Garda units assigned to the work of targeting sex buyers and the organisers of prostitution who feed on demand.<\/p> <p>I have raised a number of different issues.  I know the Minister of State is personally concerned about this matter and I welcome his attendance in the House to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019020500002#H00100","speaker":"1402"},{"type":"speech","time":1549377000,"counter":27,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Charlie Flanagan, I thank Senator Bacik for raising this important matter and offer the Minister's apologies for not being able to address it in person.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy David Stanton:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1053\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1053&amp;amp;pid=DavidStanton&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is hard to believe it is so many years since we addressed this.  It was 2012. <\/p><p>I remind the House of the provisions of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 that related to prostitution-related offences.  Part 4 of the Act provides for two new offences: paying for sexual activity with a prostitute and paying for sexual activity with a trafficked person, with the latter offence carrying a penalty of up to five years' imprisonment or an unlimited fine, or both.  The Act removes those who offer their services as a prostitute from the existing offence of soliciting for the purpose of prostitution.  A key objective of Part 4 of the Act is to reduce demand for sexual services, as the Senator said.  As regards actions on the ground, I believe the message is getting out to those who purchase sex.<\/p><p>In recent months, a number of files have been sent to the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, resulting in the much-published first conviction for the purchase of sex earlier this month.  Furthermore, the Department of Justice and Equality has advanced plans to conduct an awareness-raising initiative later this year relating to the offence of purchasing sex.<\/p><p>As regards supporting persons who wish to exit prostitution, comprehensive measures are already in place.  The Department of Justice and Equality provides annual funding to Ruhama to ensure that women who wish to exit prostitution receive the necessary support to develop the confidence and capacity to rebuild their lives.  This funding was increased in 2017 and again in 2018.  With regard to State support, the HSE's women's health service provides sexual health and outreach support for women affected by prostitution and trafficking for sexual exploitation.  The service comprises a free comprehensive sexual health service, including full sexual health testing, treatment and contraception.<\/p><p>The Act was enacted on 22 February 2017, and much of the Act, including the provisions I have described, were commenced on 27 March 2017.  Part 4 of the Act specifies that, not later than three years after its commencement, a report will be prepared on the number of arrests and convictions in respect of the new offences, as well as an assessment of the impact of the section on those who provide sexual services for payment.  Inputs to the report will come from a number of sources.  The first will be from the monitoring of investigations, arrests and convictions by the Garda National Protective Services Bureau.  Additional information will be provided by the HSE's women's health service and by civil society organisations working in this field.  Furthermore, this year the Department is funding a number of research projects that will measure the impact of the new legislation on the welfare of women engaged in prostitution, the outcomes of which will inform the report.  I hope that answers the Senator's points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019020500002#H00200","speaker":"1277","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1549377000,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for the very full response.

I note the Minister of State does not refer to any additional resources being provided to the HSE women's health service.  I wonder whether resources to that important service will be increased also because the service does a great deal of work in supporting women and others involved in prostitution.<\/p> <p>I note the Minister of State's point about the report.  Section 27 of the Act states it shall include information on arrests, convictions and the impact of operation.  Is it possible, however, that other material might be in the report?  Could the Minister of State comment on that?

I am sure he will agree with me that the crisis unfolding in Venezuela over recent weeks has shocked many people with news reports of people rooting through bins to feed their children, a crisis in the availability, as well as a lack of, basic medical care and supplies, along with inflation of 1 million %.  This is all in a country which has generated $320 billion in oil revenue in the past ten years.<\/p> <p>Last year&rsquo;s Venezuelan presidential election exposed and saw electoral fraud on a massive scale.  This has been roundly condemned by the European Union and all international observers.  We have seen serious human rights abuse reports with 8,000 extrajudicial killings in the past three years by the state security services, while thousands more have been detained without charge, trial or any due process.  Many Venezuelans have been stranded abroad during the crisis, including many in Ireland, because their worsening situation has meant that they are able unable to renew their travel documents.<\/p> <p>I would be grateful if the Minister could outline what steps the Government is taking about this serious situation, particularly in conjunction with the European Union, to bring about an end to this crisis and an improvement in the lives of ordinary people in Venezuela.  Is the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade aware of Venezuelan citizens who may be stranded in Ireland and unable to return home?<\/p> <p>Will the Minister of State agree with me that some political parties and Members of the Oireachtas have not covered themselves in glory on this issue?  Many Members of this House spent much time raising human rights abuses in the context of the debate on the occupied territories Bill but have been curiously silent on this issue.  The Minister of State will be aware that two senior members of Sinn F&eacute;in, including its general secretary, attended Mr. Maduro&rsquo;s inauguration recently.  It was Sinn F&eacute;in's connected organisation, the IRA, which committed 1,800 extrajudicial killings on this island that are still not condemned outright.  In one way, we cannot be surprised that it has no objection to 8,000 extrajudicial killings committed by the Venezuelan regime.<\/p> <p>It is not just Sinn F&eacute;in of course.  Over the weekend, I heard Deputy Paul Murphy of the so-called Socialist Party say that the economic crisis in Venezuela was due to the fact that Mr. Maduro was not left wing enough.  Even our President has joined this bandwagon in the past, I am sorry to say.  He praised the former Venezuelan President, Hugo Ch&aacute;vez, for achieving \"a great deal in his term in office, particularly in the area of social development and poverty reduction&rdquo;.  These policies are now the policies universally agreed to be the root cause of the current misery of the Venezuelan people.  I do not say this to be nit-picking but because it is a serious subject.  It highlights the bankrupt political ideology of many of the hard left.  It does not seem to matter how many people suffer or die, so long as their left-wing experiment is protected at all costs.<\/p> <p>I hope the Minister of State will agree with me that sentiments praising the Maduro regime do not represent the views of the Irish people.  The Government has moved on this issue by recognising of the head of the Venezuelan National Assembly, Juan Guaid&oacute;.  Will the Minister of State endorse what two Venezuelan nationals living in Ireland, Kley Salinas and Liliana Fernandez, who said in an interview at the weekend that &ldquo;Your body is here in Ireland but your mind is in Venezuela&rdquo;, living in fear for those back home?

It stated that if no announcement regarding fresh elections were to be made over the intervening days, the EU would take further actions, including regarding the issue of recognition of the country's leadership.  Ireland reaffirms its full support for the democratically elected National Assembly, the last remaining fully democratic institution in Venezuela, emphasising that its powers need to be restored and respected.

Ms Mogherini also took the opportunity to announce the establishment by the EU of an international contact group for Venezuela.

Such vacancies which could offer jobseekers opportunities to take up locally-based and suitable employment that contributes to the community.

It is the product of a major body of work with academics, sexual health experts, teachers organisations, bodies representing students and school boards of management.  We have made a number of wide-ranging recommendations on curriculum reform that will now be delivered to the Minister for Education and Skills and fed into the review being carried out by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA.  Our recommendations have at all times been guided by best practice and domestic and international evidence, and motivated by wanting to see our young people happy, empowered and informed as they explore relationships and sexuality for the first time.  It has been over 20 years since the social, personal and health education, SPHE, curriculum was last reviewed and we want to make sure our proposed reforms reflect the huge social and political changes in Ireland during that time, particularly the recent referendums on same-sex marriage and repeal of the eighth amendment.<\/p> <p>The report and its recommendations are detailed and comprehensive.  I would like to draw attention of the House to some key changes we have proposed.  We want relationships and sexuality education, RSE, and SPHE classes to start at a younger age in primary school and in a developmentally appropriate manner.  The use of outside providers is the most common way RSE is delivered to students at the moment and we want such providers regulated by the HSE and the Department of Education and Skills.  We want teachers to be able to be specialised in RSE and we want RSE reform to be taught as part of a whole-school approach, with extra resources given to school principals and boards to support this.  In terms of the curriculum, we have recommended that LGBTQI education, consent, reproductive healthcare and pornography form part of any new curriculum.  We have also called for the amendment of the Education Act 1998 to remove ethos as a barrier to delivering objective and factual sex education.  This is a progressive report, proposing some big changes that will benefit students and young people.  I would like the Leader to organise a debate in the Seanad on the report in the near future.<\/p> <p>On a related note, I ask the Government for an update on the plans to fully commence the Data Protection Act 2018, including the provisions on the micro-targeting of children, which Senator Higgins and I worked to include in the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019020500002#P00200","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"speech","time":1549377000,"counter":47,"content":"<p>Like others, I want to raise the issue of the nurses strike and to express support and solidarity with the 30,000 members of the INMO who are striking for the first time in 20 years.  I join with others in calling on the Government to engage urgently with the INMO to address, in particular, the very valid concerns it has raised around recruitment and retention of nurses and around patient safety in hospitals because of under-staffing as a result of the difficulties with recruitment and retention.  As Deputies Howlin, Kelly and others have stated in the D&aacute;il, this engagement can be carried out within the framework of the public service stability agreement, PSSA, particularly in the context of the issues relating to recruitment and retention.  It is worth noting the Opposition has been calling for a general review of changes in work practices and of additional duties now being taken on by nurses, and that such a review should consider, therefore, the issues the INMO has been raising around the increased professionalisation of nursing.  I should add I have been contacted - as I am sure Senators Norris and Ruane have - by Trinity nursing graduates who point out to us the huge transformation that has occurred in recent years within the nursing profession, with the increased professionalisation of nursing and the awarding of degrees.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Ivana Bacik:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2248\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Furthermore, the huge expansion in postgraduate nursing studies has resulted in some incredible research coming out of third level institutions which has really changed the nature of the nursing profession.

We need urgent clarification from the Government on this issue.  It raises the question down the road about the cost and the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare, which is a real elephant in the room.  We see the issue of the children's hospital and the difficulty bringing it forward in a responsible manner and in accordance with projected costs and then we look at the enormous cost potential of Sl&aacute;intecare, yet there is a very significant political buy-in to Sl&aacute;intecare and its proposals.  We ask the Leader for clarification from Government and the Minister for Health on this issue.<\/p><p>I also ask colleagues for support on the parental leave legislation, which we will bring forward in the Labour Party's Private Members' time tomorrow.  I thank all those colleagues who have assisted us in this regard.  My Labour Party colleagues and I, and Senator Norris in our Seanad Technical Group, are putting forward this Bill on Committee Stage.  We will table amendments and we hope colleagues will support the amendments, which are mostly technical, simply to ensure that the Bill will be straightforward and effective in implementation.

I would like to have outlined to me what its expertise is, since the first thing it did was to telephone England and find some other organisation that might be able to research what has happened here for &euro;450,000.  I just question its expertise.  Why must it bring in someone from outside this island?  There is nothing wrong with doing so, but we could have done that ourselves.  That is the first thing.  I want an explanation.<\/p> <p>The second matter I wish to raise concerns the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan.  A very interesting thing happened on a certain road in Ireland recently.  Two semi-detached houses were up for sale at reasonable prices.  Families with two, three and four children came to view the houses and queued, but the houses were bought by Chinese people who were able not only to match the price but nearly to double it and pay in cash.  In this country Chinese businessmen are given residency and the possibility of national passports - there is nothing wrong with that - for investments, be they in research, property or other fields.  I would like some explanations about this.  There is nothing wrong with people buying houses if they have a legal right to do so, but I think this activity is pushing up prices here for all the wrong reasons.  I know of two or three instances of students living in the houses, which could be best bought by the Irish and be home to a family of five or six.

As everyone knows, the CAO is the mechanism by which we assess and allocate college places, based on a points system related to performances across academic subjects.  I want to make a specific proposal and I would like the Minister to come to the House to address it.  I am proposing that 80 points - that figure is open to negotiation - of the now 630 points are taken away, with 50 of them committed to involvement in social work and social action and the remaining 30 committed to sport and cultural activities, to be monitored and assessed by a subgroup of teachers in the pastoral care sector of the school and to be part of the assessment of the child.  This would create a social awareness in our young people.  It would create an interest in social action and social concern, which is a crucial in young people.  The cultural-sporting dimension would reward children for participation in school musicals, the county minor teams and so on so that their sporting and cultural lives would develop.  The question might be in some people's minds that this would compromise academia and reduce academic performance but the contrary is the case as it would bring social concern, social awareness and social commitment, plus sporting and cultural development, into academia.  Students would do a much better job and better understand their academic studies.  Whether studying the humanities, the social sciences or science in general, they would do so with a consciousness that is very important.  We need to have young people who understand their society and how it works.  I am effectively asking the Leader to invite the Minister for Education and Skills to the House to begin the debate in this House - it should be in this House - on how the points system functions, what it assesses in young people, what type of young people it prioritises into courses and what we could do complement what is there.

All the secondary schools in County Cavan have completed the programme, with 27 teachers across the county now qualified to teach CPR.  The schools in County Monaghan are not far behind, with 83 secondary schools currently engaged on the programme.  The Irish Heart Foundation, which I congratulate on its initiative, hopes to roll out the CPR 4 Schools programme to all secondary schools in the country.  It is a very ambitious plan to save lives.  Schools in counties Monaghan and Cavan are leading the way and I compliment them for that.<\/p> <p>It should be noted that there are 5,000 cardiac arrests each year in this country.  A person qualified in CPR being close by when a person suffers a heart attack could be the difference between life and death.  In any given year, there are approximately 365,000 students in our secondary schools and there is the potential for all of those students to become competent in CPR, which could save lives.<\/p> <p>While I commend the teachers and students for their passion and initiative, the programme shines a light on the Department of Education and Skills which is not doing its job in regard to CPR and first aid in general.  That was one of the main reasons that I introduced the First Aid and Mental Health in Schools (Existing Teachers) Bill 2018 and the First Aid and Mental Health in Schools (Initial Teacher Training) Bill 2018 a couple of weeks ago which, thankfully, received the unanimous support of all Senators.

It is made even more deceptive by a letter suggesting doctors could face legal action for &quot;assaulting&quot; women unless that GP had recorded evidence that the woman consented to a termination of pregnancy.  This cohort of activists uses such names as The Women's Centre, Good Counsel Network Ireland and Ultrasound Services WCN for the purposes of sounding legitimate.  The bogus clinic previously came to our attention when an undercover video was posted of a woman receiving untruthful, unscientific advice, which was used to prevent her getting an abortion, such as suggesting an abortion could cause cancer or that women who have abortions are vulnerable to committing child abuse.<br\/><br\/>Let us be under no illusions.  Those who wish to deceive doctors and shame vulnerable women are not justified in what they are doing.  We have had national conversations about this and have had referenda on the subject.  The public has given its answer as to whether abortion services should be available to women.  We have had enough stories of shame and stigma and those who wish to return to that by protesting, offering GP services or posting confidential doctor and patient information online should reconsider their actions.  Given that legislation has now been passed, I ask the Leader to ask the Minister, Deputy Harris, to come to this House to discuss how we can best protect women in vulnerable situations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019020500002#U02500","speaker":"1372","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1549377000,"counter":241,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the efforts of the Leader to get the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, to come to the House on the question of Alzheimer's disease and dementia.

As Senators will know, they are out in protest.  This is the first of two days that nurses will be on strike this week and next week they will be joined by the Psychiatric Nurses Association for three days on strike.  Almost 50,000 nurses are protesting on the picket lines.  It did not dawn on us initially this morning but as we looked around, we saw hundreds of nurses protesting on one side, while on the other side, we saw a massive crater in the ground where our national children&rsquo;s hospital is to be built.  The irony of this juxtaposition of these two sights was not lost on us.<\/p> <p>Nurses are demanding &euro;250 million to achieve pay parity.  Every year, &euro;120 million is spent on agency nurses alone.  Someone has not done the maths on those figures and they have certainly not done the maths on the national children&rsquo;s hospital, the cost of which could run to &euro;2 billion.  The public cannot get to grips with that.  Where were the checks in the procurement process?  Who was looking after the public purse when it was being robbed and dipped into?  The irony of that is not lost on nurses or members of the public.  I support my colleague, even though the confidence and supply agreement needs an injection.  What other capital projects will we lose because of this massive cost overrun?  I advise Senator Colm Burke that no amount of spin about how beautiful this hospital will be will create a soft landing for people given that the cost will run to &euro;2 billion?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019020500002#W01400","speaker":"1388"},{"type":"speech","time":1549377000,"counter":262,"content":"<p>The Senator should address her comments through the Chair.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019020500002#W01500","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1549377000,"counter":263,"content":"<p>There is no spin, just facts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019020500002#W01600","speaker":"1409"},{"type":"speech","time":1549377000,"counter":264,"content":"<p>No amount of soft spin will do it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019020500002#W01700","speaker":"1388"},{"type":"speech","time":1549377000,"counter":265,"content":"<p>The Senator should check the facts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019020500002#W01800","speaker":"1409"},{"type":"speech","time":1549377000,"counter":266,"content":"<p>I endorse the call for the Minister to come to the House to outline the further impact this project will have on the public purse and public health.

Today is Safer Internet Day, among many other days.  Almost one year ago, Senator Ruane and I successfully introduced an amendment to the Data Protection Bill, now the Data Protection Act, to prohibit the profiling of children under the age of 18 and the use of such profiles for commercial purposes.  I ask the Leader for an update on when the Minister plans to commence that aspect of the legislation.  It is no longer a proposed amendment.  I understand Deputy O&rsquo;Callaghan put forward a variation of the proposal in the D&aacute;il.  Will the Minister commence that aspect of the legislation which protects children under the age of 18 from commercial targeting, fast-track the alternative version put forward by Deputy O&rsquo;Callaghan or take action of his own volition?  It is not satisfactory that almost a year after the legislation was passed, we have not taken steps to protect younger people, which is vital, and ensure they are not targeted in a shocking way based on their vulnerabilities or insecurities.

I chaired the Joint Committee on Health and we were on the site on a number of occasions.

It is very important to say that for many of the things we count or many of the different pieces of information we put out, we are gathering statistics from local authorities or other areas and compiling them for publication.  That is done at official level.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Eoghan Murphy:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2288\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2288&amp;amp;pid=EoghanMurphy&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Figures for emergency accommodation every month come from the different regions which themselves collect the information from local authorities.  The Dublin Regional Homeless Executive is involved in compiling them.  We have said that that data collection needs to be improved because it is not capturing enough information.  When the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive did a deeper dive last year and produced a report over two quarters, it was able to tell us a lot more information.  It is the type of information that we should always be gathering so that work to capture more data for those monthly reports is now happening.<\/p><p>Senator Mullen asked about a particular Dublin City Council site and housing body.  He said there had been a delay.  I am not sure of the specific site.  The Senator can provide me with information.  We have a delivery office in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government so that where there are delays and snags or problems that require people to sensibly put their heads together, it does that.  As we all know, things can sometimes crop up which can lead to long delays if they are not resolved quickly.  The housing delivery office is there to work with the local authorities.  I have asked colleagues in this House and elected representatives in local authorities to bring areas where they think there are unnecessary delays directly to my attention so that I can chase them up in the Custom House.<\/p><p>Senator Mullen also asked about voids.  He mentioned 4,000 voids.  We have remediated 8,000 to 9,000 vacant social housing homes that were empty and needed significant repair over the last four to five years.  We are coming towards the end of that programme.  These are social housing homes that were vacant and required as much as &euro;30,000 in investment to get them back into use and letting.  I hope we will have the numbers for 2018 next week.  We will see that approximately 500 to 600 voids have been remediated over the course of 2018.  We would have done much more than that but we agreed that we would not count above what was in the targeted amount.  A lot is happening in that area.<\/p><p>I am supportive of pre-fabrication, modular and rapid technologies.  It is also important that as we bring in new housing, we have to bring in all of the facilities required.  While there are efficiencies and gains to be made with these new technologies, one still needs to go through planning and procurement, and to put in footpaths, electricity and water.  We want to and are doing it, as is the private sector but it has other time and investment requirements that traditional housebuilding also has.<\/p><p>Senator Kieran O'Donnell made a point about recognising that a Government that is led by Fine Gael, Independents and the Independent Alliance is building social housing homes, as have previous Governments.  People hark back to different times in Irish history where it is assumed that we were building more social housing homes.  While that might be correct for individual years, I read an interesting piece by Karl Dieter over the weekend in which he wrote about the 1950s being the most successful decade for the building of social housing in the State's history.  The average output per year in the 1950s was 6,000 social housing homes.  We will build more than that this year.  We have brought that responsibility back to the heart of Government and local authorities.  Delivery is ramping up and I will have confirmation of the 2018 figures next week, I hope.  They will show that, at the moment, one in four to one in five of new homes built in the country is a social housing home.  That has not happened for a long time and it is welcome.<\/p><p>Senator Kieran O'Donnell was also right to talk about how we need to make sure that we build mixed tenure estates.  We want our housing policy to help to build, unite and support communities rather than dividing them.  That means having mixed tenure, whether in apartment or housing developments.  He also asked about whether empirical work had been done on the viability of house-building.  It has been done with regard to the building of semi-detached or terraced homes and apartments.  When doing these viability reports, one builds in margins in certain areas as contingencies against risk.  There has to be a profit margin because it has to be affordable for the builder to develop it.  Depending on the project itself, there will be a greater or lesser gain depending on how risk was programmed into different elements of the build.  It is also true that land costs could be a significant contributory factor.  Land costs in the State plummeted after the financial collapse but began to rapidly increase again from 2015 onwards.  It will depend on when many builders bought the land.<\/p><p>The Rebuilding Ireland home loan has been a success.  We have seen that in the level of drawdowns.  It has been operating for almost a year and as of December, approximately half of the allocation for three years has been drawn down.  That has been successful.  Senator O'Donnell made a point about some local authorities building in the wrong locations and that there was inadequate due diligence.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Eoghan Murphy:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2288\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2288&amp;amp;pid=EoghanMurphy&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->If that is the case and if he has examples of that, it is difficult to square it with people stating that we need to cut red tape in the Custom House and strip out some of the oversight that exists.  The Senator makes an important point.  However, we in government and as Members of the Oireachtas have to make sure that, as we rebuild our housing sector and get local authorities back into building, we build the right homes in the right places and that we do not relax things so much that we end up making mistakes like we did in the past, leading to ghost housing estates or developments like Priory Hall in the future.  While we have cut red tape and streamlined things in the Department, and we are looking to make a few more changes in that area, we have to be careful that we do not go too far.<\/p><p>Senator Norris described the role of the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government as a poisoned chalice.  I do not agree.  Of course, it is a challenge.  It is perhaps the most important domestic challenge we face but it is one we can resolve and are resolving.  Within the plans we have, some things will work well initially and others will not and will need to be reformed and monitored to see that they are working.  Overall, at a high level, when we look at what we are trying to achieve, which is basically to increase the supply of homes as quickly and sustainably as possible.  That is happening..  Even in the supplements of the newspapers, we can see that it is happening.  Of course, we need to do more but the fundamental supply problem is being corrected and we need to drive that further.<\/p><p>Senator Norris is correct to state that this cannot be solved overnight.  When we are talking about building any house or housing scheme, it will take a time to move from the initial idea to planning, design, procurement, building and occupancy.  We are not just talking about a few schemes but about thousands upon thousands of new homes.  We are also talking about rebuilding those elements of the housing system that had been broken, whether in regard to the skilled labourers who are needed, the architects whose profession got hammered or those who had emigrated.  In addition, we did not initially have the finances and they had to be restored.  New procurement and planning procedures have been put in place, including the fast-track process.  We are doing all of those things and increasing our resources in each part of the housing sector while at the same time starting to build.  It is happening now but it takes time.<\/p><p>I also agree with Senator Norris that we cannot return to the sprawling housing estates of three-bedroom semi-detached homes.  Let us take the example of Crumlin, a great area and a very desirable location but the density is far too low in terms of what should have been built there.  Good planning should take advantage of the infrastructure that is there in the city and also have regard to issues such as climate change and the environment that are very important for us and for future generations.  We have to make sure we do not make those kinds of density mistakes into the future.  When we talk about building now, we must look for infill development or increasing densities where we can, particularly around transport corridors, and that means more apartment building.<\/p><p>Senator Norris also referred to the numbers in emergency accommodation and to the massaging of the figures.  I have to disagree with that absolutely.  We are talking about people in emergency accommodation.  What was discovered by the Dublin Region Homeless Executive when it was doing its work in conjunction with my Department was that some people had been categorised as being in emergency accommodation when they were not.  These are people who had been in their own homes and who had been at risk of going into emergency accommodation but, because of the financial support they received from local authorities, they never had to leave their own home, never presented for emergency accommodation and never became homeless, yet were counted as being in emergency accommodation.  That miscategorisation issue was accepted by the Oireachtas when we discussed it at the Oireachtas committee, although some have since gone back on that for political reasons.<\/p><p>It is very important that we understand who is in emergency accommodation, not just because of the numbers involved but because we need to know why they are in emergency accommodation and how we get them out of emergency accommodation in a sustainable way.  That is where the Department and the local authorities are focused, namely, on understanding who is there and how we help them out of emergency accommodation into sustainable homes.  It is very important that we can do this work and that we have an accurate understanding of the enormous scale of the challenge.  We will continue to work with local authorities to address all of the issues we can but, of course, concomitant with that is the delivery of new homes, which is happening, and, in addition, the delivery of a family hub programme where we can have safe, secure supports for families until we get them into their new homes.  The figures show that, on average, families are spending less than six months in family hubs, which is very important for those families.<\/p><p>Senator Buttimer was right to refer to focusing on affordability.
