To assist the committee today, I am pleased to welcome Mr. Duncan Graham, managing director, Retail Excellence; Mr. Keith Rogers, ECCO; Mr. Macdara Doyle, co-ordinator, retail sector group, ICTU; Mr. Gerry Light, general secretary of Mandate; and Ms Michelle Quinn, sector organiser, SIPTU.<\/p> <p>  Before we start I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses in respect of reference witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.  However, today's witnesses are giving their evidence remotely, from a place outside of the parliamentary precincts, and, as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, I will direct them to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.<\/p> <p>  To commence our consideration of this matter, I now invite Mr. Graham to make opening remarks on behalf of Retail Excellence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021070700002#A00400","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625612400,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman, Deputies and Senators for their invitation to meet with the committee.  I am joined by Keith Rogers from ECCO.  He is a former chairperson of Retail Excellence.  Retail Excellence is the largest representative body for the retail industry in Ireland.  We have more than 2,000 members across various retail sectors, and the industry employs approximately 280,000 people throughout the country.<\/p> <p>  Since the emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic in Ireland in March 2020, retailers have faced an unprecedented level of disruption to their livelihoods.  The vast majority of retail stores were shut for almost nine months in total, that is, nine months out of the past 15.  Many could not trade at all.  For others, huge effort and cost were invested in trying to pivot to online sales and delivery systems to survive.  While contending with a major drop in income, retailers were obliged to invest in control measures to safeguard customers and staff while their stores were open, including Perspex screens and hand sanitisation units, while all were forced to reduce selling space to facilitate in-store social distancing.  Retailers also had to struggle with the mixed signals and confusing messages as to how long the lockdown would last.  Many of our members incurred significant expenses on season-specific stock ,which has had to be discounted as the seasons have moved on.  In short, the Covid pandemic has not merely disrupted the retail industry but has decimated it.  For example, at the end of quarter 4 of 2020, there were 2,000 more commercial vacancies in Ireland compared with the same period a year earlier.  There have been several high-profile retail closures and exits from Ireland since last year, including Gap, Carphone Warehouse and Topshop.  No doubt various factors influenced these decisions but there is no doubt either but that the impact of Covid-19 was a significant influence.<\/p> <p>  It is regrettable to note that these closures are a reflection of what is happening to retailers of all sizes throughout the country.  When big name brands are involved, a closure announcement gets national attention.  That is not so when the business closing is a small shop in a small town, but that does not diminish the tragedy for the individuals involved or lessen the impact on the community in which the shop is based.  These smaller closures are happening every day.  Technically, non-essential retail fully reopened on 17 May, but it is important to point out that the continued restrictions on the hospitality sector are having a significant knock-on impact on retail.  In towns and cities, retail and hospitality have an extremely close relationship.  People go to town not just to shop but also to eat, have a coffee or a drink and so on.  While hospitality is still restricted, retail can only get by rather than thrive, so we are desperately keen to see hospitality fully reopened as soon as possible.<\/p> <p>  Meanwhile, Covid-19 has led to several major international retailers deferring planned investment in Ireland.  Businesses such as sporting goods retailer, Decathlon, and homewares provider, Jysk, said in March this year that tough Government restrictions meant that they had been forced to re-evaluate their plans, and now there is no indication that the Government will go back on its original decisions.<\/p><p>There are several challenges which face the retail industry following the Covid-19 pandemic.  Chief among them is the issue of rent.  While many commercial landlords have struck fair deals with tenants who did not take any income for well over half a year, there are several examples of others who continue to pursue retailers for overdue rent payments in full.  We believe that all landlords should, at the very least, be offering a two-month rent amnesty to commercial tenants, which would represent half the time retailers were shut during the third lockdown from January to May this year.  In the absence of any leniency from landlords, we would ask the Government to consider introducing a mandatory mediation scheme through which landlords and tenants could settle disputes and move on.  Were all landlords to demand overdue rent payments in full from their tenants, it is obvious that we would be facing the collapse of the retail industry in Ireland and a resulting economic catastrophe.<br\/><br\/>In a wider sense it is clear that the disruption of the pandemic has brought about a change in the very nature of shopping.  We are starting to see a new trend, a mixture of physical and digital shopping.  People have embraced multi-channel shopping over the past few months, perhaps browsing online and making a purchase in-store where possible, or <i>vice versa<\/i>.  This is good news for larger businesses that can afford to invest heavily online, but has been a significant challenge for small businesses that do not have the time or resources to properly develop their online presence.  Government initiatives such as the online retail scheme have helped, but in reality these are just a drop in the ocean for the thousands of businesses that now find themselves on the brink.<br\/><br\/>However, it is clear that, along with challenges, the pandemic has created opportunities for the retail industry, and for society as a whole.  Covid-19 has given us a chance to reimagine what we want our towns and cities to look like.  In recent years, city centres have been hollowed out by the rapid emergence of several large shopping centres in city suburbs.  Our towns and cities are places where people should want to live and shop, as well as work.  If anything, this pandemic has shown that we must invest in these places in order for them to survive and thrive.  We have a huge job ahead of us, rejuvenating our towns and city centres.  Figuring out how we can attract people back into city centres should be key goal of this Government.  <br\/><br\/>There are other issues too.  Brexit has not gone away for retailers.  It still has the potential to cause prolonged disruption.  Even though a deal has been done, it remains to be seen how logistical issues manifest themselves in trade between the EU and the UK.  It will clearly have an affect on costs and supply chain, along with the added bureaucracy, so retailers will be keeping a very close eye on developments.<br\/><br\/>The retail industry in Ireland has never experienced a crisis quite like Covid-19.  Thousands of businesses have already been forced to close their doors and many will not survive the coming months, as society begins to return to some form of normality.  Considering the retail industry employs more than 10% of the country's entire workforce, it is beholden on us all to ensure its survival.  After such an intense and deep shock, the industry and its staff now require major investment, resources and support from Government in order to emerge better and stronger<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021070700002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Duncan Graham","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625612400,"counter":10,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Graham.

I am joined by my colleagues, Ms Michelle Quinn of SIPTU, and Mr. Gerry Light of Mandate, on behalf of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions' retail sector group, which I co-ordinate.  The retail sector group is an all-island body that is comprising affiliated unions North and South, representing workers in retail and distribution sectors in both jurisdictions, including Mandate, SIPTU, Unite, Usdaw and GMB trade unions.  <\/p> <p>  I would like to outline some key points of the campaign that we launched late last year, A New Deal for Retail and Distribution Workers, which sets out the need to see real change for workers in these crucial sectors, as a matter of urgency.  As mentioned already, we are an all-island grouping and despite the differing currencies and the differing political structures, we see a remarkable commonality to the problems faced by workers in these sectors, North and South.  If anything, the strength of those shared interests has been underlined and emphasised over the last 18 months.  What is often forgotten - and I concur with the previous comments - is the size and scale and the importance of the retail sector to the wider economy.  Prior to the pandemic, in this jurisdiction, it employed up to 300,000 people and it is one of the largest contributors to the annual tax take, contributing &euro;7 billion in direct taxes alone, twice that of the financial sector.  Clearly, the sector played a pivotal role in the economy prior to Covid-19, and will be a key driver of any post-pandemic recovery that we hope to put in place, but that cannot be a recovery that comes at any price.  <\/p> <p>  Over the last 18 months, workers in the sector have suffered the shock of sudden closures and the loss of their jobs, while others have coped with a dramatic shift to online trading.  Crucially, many thousands of workers in the sector have spent the last 18 months on the front line of the public health emergency, and have been transformed overnight into newly essential workers, without whom large sections of society would have ground to a halt.  If the pandemic did us at least one favour, it helped to reveal that terrible hypocrisy at the heart of the modern economy, our shameful dependency on workers who are among the lowest paid and the most insecure in the workforce.  In Ireland, according to the OECD, we have a low pay rate of 23%.  The OECD average is about 15%.  Our low pay rate is the third highest in the EU and applies to a disproportionate number of those employed in sectors such as retail and distribution.<\/p> <p>  In addition, there is a gender pay gap of up to 19%, which again impacts heavily on the high number of female workers in this sector.  Retail is also the largest single employer of young workers and 36% of their number are on part-time and temporary contracts.  However, these workers still face the same exorbitant childcare and housing costs that afflict all of us, and reflect the very poor social wage that exists here, relative to other EU states.  Housing costs are now some nine times average earnings and the average house price in Dublin, the area of greatest housing need, is now beyond the financial reach of 85% of the population, which is a truly shocking indictment of housing policy over recent years.  Threshold points out that average rents in Dublin are now &euro;1,717.50 a month and upwards - that is not the highest, but the average - which is greater than the monthly income of minimum wage workers.  Many lower wage workers have been entirely priced out of the rental and the housing market.<\/p> <p>  In that context, it is hardly surprising that retail workers alone account for 19% of all HAP recipients, the largest for any employment sector.  When the pandemic eventually ends, many of the workers on whom we relied so heavily during these critical periods will face a very uncertain future in terms of employment and issues such as housing, given the underlying difficulties within sector.<\/p> <p>  The same arguments have been made very coherently by the ESRI and by the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, as part of what it calls the Good Jobs Agenda under its shared island initiative.  The same case has also been made quite forcefully and frequently by the T&aacute;naiste.  It is our view that the living wage provides the crucial benchmark for any society that wants to think of itself as decent, and in the aftermath of the pandemic it should be our goal to ensure that workers in this sector can enjoy a proper standard of living.  In this regard, the recent request made by the T&aacute;naiste to the Low Pay Commission in respect of how we might progress to the living wage is to be welcomed.<\/p> <p>  As a society, we now need a detailed and robust conversation about these glaring contradictions and how we can transform bad jobs into good jobs and meaningful careers.  Applause and praise are important, but they will not pay bills or find a place to live.  What we need now is very concrete action on pay and conditions for workers in the sector and some very lasting and tangible recognition of the essential role they play.  They need decent pay, they need job security and they need a voice at work, and that means collective bargaining rights across the sector.  They also need to see a stronger social wage, particularly affordable childcare and affordable housing.  <\/p> <p>  As a first step, there should be an immediate restoration of the joint labour committee across the sector, which would help at least establish a basic level of decency around pay and conditions.  The support of this committee for this very tangible measure would be very welcome and very valuable.<\/p> <p>  Good employers have nothing to fear from this agenda.  Employer and lobby groups that are often vocal about upwards pressure on wages might be better served directing their attention and energy at Government and the policies that make so many crucial services unaffordable for low wage workers.  In tackling these issues, we have the opportunity to rebuild and to reimagine the sector as one that is characterised by decent work and by high employment standards.  We need a new blueprint for the sector into the future and this would be best undertaken by a new, dedicated retail stakeholder group comprising all relevant stakeholders.<\/p><p>That is a call we have made repeatedly, or has been made repeatedly by the congress representative on the retail consultation forum, which is headed by the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Damien English.  As I said at the outset, the applause has long since faded.  It is time for action and for real change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021070700002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Macdara Doyle","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625612400,"counter":13,"content":"<p>Thank you very much Mr. Doyle.

I have read the submissions and a number of things jumped out at me.  Certainly, the threat to jobs is one.  On the flip side, we have to examine the kind of jobs these are.  An opportunity exists, and we all have said it.  Probably every member of this committee has at some point said that the pandemic has caused us to re-evaluate what we regard as the front line and who we regard as front line workers.  They are not just doctors and garda&iacute;.  They are the people who kept us supplied, kept us fed and kept us going all the way through the pandemic.  I would say to the representatives of industry and of the workers that we owe a debt of gratitude to those people who went into work when it was not safe, when we did not know the scale or the issues and when we were still getting to grips with the pandemic.  The people in the shops and the people working in distribution and in the supply chain were still there while everybody else was trying to figure out how to deal with this.  We should not let any opportunity go without putting on the record our gratitude and our admiration for those workers.  It is good that we are now looking at the work they do and the essential nature of that work.<\/p> <p>  We have an opportunity post-pandemic to rebuild, and both of the submissions alluded to this.  We need to look at how we are going to do that.  To borrow a phrase from the US President, Mr. Joe Biden, \"Can we build back better?\".  Building back better has to be about sustainable jobs and about jobs that can meet the cost of living.  Mr. Doyle is right that the Government has a job of work to do to ensure that it controls the cost of rent, in particular in our capital but not exclusively.  We know that over the last ten to 15 years successive Governments have facilitated this housing crisis and we now see that that is having an impact right across all of the sectors.  I have said this on a number of occasions and I have said it directly to the T&aacute;naiste and to Ministers in government.  I have asked them not to give up on retail.  I worry sometimes when the question is asked that representatives of Government seem to just say that retail is changing.  It is changing but that does not have to mean the end of the shops on our main streets and the death of our city and town centres.  Retail is changing but we need to be able to move with that.<\/p> <p>  With that in mind, I have some questions on rent, which is an issue I have raised many times.  I am fearful for many businesses that when they pull up their shutters to try to work that there is going to be a big bill on the mat.  I know the Government is saying that it hopes landlords will show forbearance.  It has great faith in landlords but I do not share that.  Perhaps Mr. Graham might be able to outline to us the extent to which the rental crisis is there and any discussions that he has had with Government specifically in relation to the mandatory mediation scheme.  The words \"mandatory\" and \"mediation\" contradict each other but I understand the point that he was trying to make.  Could he outline areas of best practice internationally and any feedback received from Government in this regard?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021070700002#C00300","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625612400,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy O'Reilly.  We have been talking around this now for quite some time and it has been very evident over the last year.  We have seen 2,000 retail outlets close their doors over that period.  There has been much high profile retail closures that have been well pointed-out in media.  The key things that we have approached Government around initially were that there needs to be some form of mediation.  We are talking about something like the WRC or something that is put in place on a temporary basis whereby landlords and tenants can get around a table and where a legally-binding arrangement that enables something like a turnover-based rent to be put in place for a period of time to enable retailers to get back on their feet.<\/p> <p>  In terms of other things we have looked for, taking the last five months that we have just gone through, we do not feel it is appropriate for retailers to be saddled with 100% of the rent payment for that period.  What is very evident is that some retailers are able to do deals with landlords, but this is not consistent across the piece.  There are deals being done, and there are 50% off and better deals than that being done across the sector.  Equally, there are landlords who have dug their heels in and are basically saying, \"Read the lease; you owe us the money\".  That is resulting in these closures.  Many of the retailers we have spoken with that have closed, the UK ones in particular, were in a difficult situation beforehand.  Covid-19 and this rent crisis has put them over the edge.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the measures that we have taken, we wrote to the T&aacute;naiste and to the Minister of State, Deputy English, during the course of last year.  We have raised this regularly as part of the retail forum which ICTU is on as well.  To date, the only thing that has come back from Government is a code of conduct that was introduced in September of last year.  We need to see something more than that.  The code of conduct really is not worth the paper it is written on in terms of the response from landlords, in particular.  We need to see something that is a bit more legally-binding to prevent this rent crisis from gathering momentum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021070700002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Duncan Graham"},{"type":"speech","time":1625612400,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Graham.  I have a few questions for ICTU.  I, and Sinn F&eacute;in, absolutely support a JLC for the sector.  It is absolutely necessary and I know that ICTU has produced a document and a plan on retail workers.  Perhaps Mr. Doyle might outline where he sees this going and where he sees these jobs going.  Is it possible?  I keep saying not to give up on retails but, for God's sake, let us make them decent jobs.<\/p> <p>  I will share with the committee figures I obtained from the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment's office.  Over a three year period, the WRC recovered &euro;1,148,170 in unpaid wages in the retail, wholesale and distribution sector.  That does not paint the sector in a great light and I do not think anyone would say that it does.  When we talk about rebuilding, I would like to hear from ICTU its vision on how those jobs can be saved in the first instance but also on how we can ensure that they are decent jobs.<\/p> <p>  I note the reference to the housing crisis contained within the submission, and there is a job of work that has to be done by us here in this Parliament to control the cost of housing.  We know who has been in government for the last 15 to 20 years, so we know where this has come from.  However, we also know that this crisis has now reached its tentacles into every aspect of our society and it absolutely has to be tackled.  Alongside that, it cannot simply be the case that wages must rise to meet the exorbitant cost of living.  There has to be a consequent reduction in the cost of living but in terms of wages, it is a sector characterised by precarious work, long hours, etc.  I would like to hear from ICTU how it sees this sector being able to develop, to grow and sustain the decent jobs that are so essential.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021070700002#C00500","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625612400,"counter":17,"content":"<p>The most urgent thing we need to do is to \"build back better\".

There are big issues.  If we could use this opportunity to develop that new blueprint with all the relevant stakeholders around the table, there could be a thriving, sustainable sector which could be characterised by decent work, high standards, good career progression and meaningful careers, instead of low pay and insecurity.<\/p><p> I might ask my colleague, Mr. Gerry Light, the congress representative on the retail consultation forum to add a few comments on that. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021070700002#C00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Macdara Doyle","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625612400,"counter":19,"content":"<p>It is always important to identify areas of common interest and agreement.  If we are serious about rebuilding the retail sector, if we can identify agreement and a commitment to that from early on, that is vitally important.  It is very welcome to hear Mr. Graham talk about seeing the dark and the despair that has come out of Covid-19 as an opportunity to look at the retail sector and reinvent it in many ways.<\/p> <p>  I have long held the view, in my capacity as a trade union official for many years, that the retail sector has been treated as some kind of a Cinderella sector, insofar as the supports and the commitments that it has been given from a wide range of different Governments over the years.  In comparison with other sectors such as manufacturing industry and so on, there is nobody looking to bail out retailers, whether a store that employs 300 to 400 workers, or one of the smaller stores Mr. Graham talked about.  I pushed this with the T&aacute;naiste before I became a member of that retail forum group.  I have to say, in fairness, I believe there is widespread support for the notion of looking at the sector and understanding the challenges, in particular the challenges facing traditional bricks and mortar retail, and working together to try to rebuild a sustainable sector, built on new values and new standards.  After all, what is good for the retail sector and what is good for the businesses within is good for workers and, as Mr. Graham said, for society generally, namely, the small towns and shopping centres and all the other aspects that need to be considered.  They are all the key aspects.<\/p> <p>  We need to be serious about this.  There is no point paying it lip service and then when it comes to the first initiative that seeks to increase or enhance workers' rights or participation, or to give them the best possible living standards and terms and conditions, saying that it is only feasible in accordance with what the business is able to pay.  There is no point in us getting the standard response we have been getting down through the years.  I spent five and a half years on the Low Pay Commission and I heard many submissions.  The automatic response for many employers is that putting a cent onto the wage rate will cost jobs and will be damaging to the sector or to the relevant sectors they represent.  However, the truth is that all the independent research that has been done through the years for the Low Pay Commission has debunked those scaremongering predictions.  I do not believe that would be the case if we worked in unison and in respect to try to drive the sector into a better place.  I do not think it is an issue of whether businesses can afford to pay decent wages and have decent terms and conditions but I think it is an issue of whether the market can afford it.  We all know that the market is consumer-led.<\/p> <p>  I could debate, not in a very aggressive or adversarial way, the whole notion of where we are going to end up eventually with the online development.  There was a rush to online during the first lockdown but during the second lockdown what we saw was a 1% difference in the months between June and October, a 1% increase when people could get back out and physically do their shopping again.  We have also seen considerable bounce-back in some business across retail with the move back.  Of course, we have heard the debate about the retained personal savings and that when the opportunity arises, there will be a real willingness to go out and spend that money.<\/p> <p>  While you could not ignore the impact of online shopping going forward, I do not think it is going to be the phenomenon people predict it will be.

What strikes me is that we are seeing the dilemma evident in the two presentations in that people are looking at the same set of circumstances through different ends of the binoculars.  What I would be interested to know from both sides is what our committee can do to help get this strategy off the ground because we need a retail strategy to cover many issues, including the issues that have been ventilated but also the challenge of climate, the circular economy, the elimination of plastic from our retail chain, more sustainable methods of production, and so on.  There are many tricky issues where retail will be at the epicentre for much of the change that is going to happen - for example, in the sharing economy.  I can see both sides.  I can see the precarious nature of some of the employment and, indeed, the threat of more of that, going by some trends in the sector, but also the difficulty of low margins.  It would be interesting to see if we can see a few shared pillars of what that strategy might be, whether it be around pay and conditions and training or around the circular economy and the change that will bring.  If there were some shared pillars of this strategy, our committee would certainly be willing to assist.  To be fair to the Minister of State, Deputy English, he is an experienced and flexible person who would try to facilitate that move forward.  How much shared ground is there?<\/p> <p>  On this mandatory request from Government, as I understand it the only way you can force the reduction in a contract is through court supervised processes.  That is why our committee has just heard of a small company rescue scheme, and the Bill will go through the Houses.  That will allow more informal ways of tackling these things.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of requiring someone to go to mediation, I am surprised that many of them do not go to mediation before court anyhow, but does it solve anything?  If these landlords are not willing to get involved in codes of conduct, will having a Government requirement that they must go to a mandatory meeting of some sort change the outcome?  That is the question I have.  It is important to understand that sometimes the other side of the rent is often a pension fund.  We have an image of landlords as people sitting back sipping claret wine or whatever, but some of these are people who have debts, so it is not all as easy to unravel as might meet the eye.<\/p> <p>  I would like to ask about this promotion.  I agree there is going to be this retail experience and the bulk retail, which it seems will become increasingly separate sectors.  What can Retail Excellence do to support a town centre first initiative?  We have seen many of the big names vacate town centres.<\/p><p>Should Retail Excellence be promoting high street locations for some type of presentation to bring people back into the town centre, rather than deciding to go out of town for the cheaper rents and so on.  Can we work together on this with Retail Excellence to see some quality in town centres?  Much of what I see in town centres are the bookies and the pubs, and little else to attract people in apart from the hospitality sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021070700002#D00800","speaker":"1549","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625612400,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I will pick up those three points Deputy Bruton made and then I will ask Mr. Rogers to elaborate and give his thoughts.  In terms of shared ground and what the Government could do, things like the online retail scheme, as I said, have been extremely well supported.  The reality is that they have been oversubscribed in most cases.  Last year &euro;11 million was allocated for the scheme, but in the end &euro;12 million was actually granted to businesses to help them develop.  There has only been &euro;5 million allocated this time around, and there is no current view that there is going to be any more money allocated to that scheme during the latter part of this year.  We need to make sure that there is money to enable businesses to trade online as well as physically.  We will end up with a retail industry that has both physical shops and online support.  That is going to happen.<\/p> <p>  The reality is that we will also require less retail space in towns and cities going forward.  One way to rejuvenate towns and cities is to bring more people back to live over the shop, if you like.  This has been talked about quite a bit before but there seem to be some onerous planning restrictions that make that quite difficult at times.  Going forward, I do not see a situation where retailers will have stock rooms on first and second floor levels in town centres.  That could easily be used for housing.  Increasingly, we will see retailers servicing both shops and online from edge of town locations.  That sort of support would be important.<\/p> <p>  The other things that are happening, and where some of the big costs are coming through for retailers, and will continue to come through over the next few months and years, relate to Brexit and importing products.  Much work has been done in terms of supply chains to ensure that rather than using the land bridge, businesses are now starting to import and use suppliers direct from northern Europe and beyond.  We are very conscious that that has brought a cost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021070700002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Duncan Graham"},{"type":"speech","time":1625612400,"counter":28,"content":"<p>Your time is running out, if you want to let Mr. Rogers in briefly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021070700002#E00300","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625612400,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I thank the committee members.  My message to Deputy Bruton is to give us a leg up.  Covid-19 has been hugely difficult for the retail sector, for all the people who work in it and for the whole industry.  What can we do?  If we get into a support mode, the first thing we need is continued supports on the wage subsidy through all of this year and perhaps into next year until we realise what the post-Covid-19 scenario is like for us.  The second thing is that we need to take our towns and cities seriously.  We need every local authority to appoint a retail manager with a keen retail focus, to treat the town centres in the same way as we treat our shopping centres, where every shopping centre has a manager taking account of the retail mix, the day time and the night-time, to promote our towns and to incentivise business back in.  We have a difficulty at the moment where Covid-19 has taken out a huge amount of retail and in every town, city and village, we are seeing incredible vacancy rates and empty sites.  How can we be proactive about that?  How can we incentivise retailers and businesses to expand their business?  Can we encourage recruitment, like we did in the post-financial crash, with the Government paying a portion of the cost, so that business, while coping with the property costs, rent and everything else, can have a dig-out in this time of need to cover that cost?  Perhaps local authorities can be inventive by offering rates waivers for the first year or two years to allow properties get off the ground.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021070700002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Keith Rogers"},{"type":"speech","time":1625612400,"counter":30,"content":"<p>Thank you Mr. Rogers.

It is the largest employer in the country, and one which is in every town, village, city and community.  It is vital that every effort is made, and I share Deputy Bruton's view on the need for a retail strategy.  It goes beyond the issues of rent and pay to the issues of sustainability, transport, access and all those other things.  To pick up on what Mr. Rogers talked about, issues of planning and local authorities all need to be included.  The congress proposal of a retail stakeholder group is very important and one that I will be supporting and pushing the Government to bring about.<\/p> <p>  I want to ask Retail Excellence about the very serious issue it raised regarding the rent.  I want to get a better handle on what is happening with the rent review that is taking place.  What share of those who have engaged in a rent review have been institutional investors or have been individual landlords, because understanding who is engaging and who is failing to engage should determine the Government response?  On that vein, who is the worst affected?  Are we talking about individual shops?  Is it more a town or a city issue?  What type of retail is affected?  Perhaps Mr. Graham could shed some light on who precisely is affected, who precisely are the landlords - I am not asking for names now but the types of landlords - and where those shops are located.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021070700002#E00600","speaker":"1683"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625612400,"counter":32,"content":"<p>It is very varied.  When we talk to our members we hear of examples where certain retailers have done deals in shopping centres and of other retailers that have been unable to do deals in the same shopping centre, so it is very dependent on the one-to-one relationship that retailer has with that centre or with that landlord.  By and large, the issues being raised with us are more to do with the institutional landlords than they are with private landlords.  Whenever you have an opportunity to get around a table with somebody local, by and large, that opportunity is being taken.  It is not consistent but, by and large, it is happening that way.  It is the shopping centres that seem to be causing the most difficulty with this.

I would like to get a picture of the current situation in the retail sector.  I note from Retail Excellence's opening statement the issue of Perspex screens was mentioned, which was advice given at an earlier stage of the pandemic.  As I understand it, the latest advice is that Perspex screens are a problem and should be removed because they restrict air flow.  What advice on ventilation does Retail Excellence give its members?

Ventilation is more difficult in a large store compared to a small store where more often than not doors can be kept open and so forth.  Retailers have done everything that has been asked of them so far to keep their premises and their employees safe.  If that was not happening, we would see far more cases of Covid emerging in the retail sector.  We would also see many more stores closing for short periods due to outbreaks of the virus.  We are not seeing that.  We did not see that at the height of the pandemic in January and we have not seen it to an great degree in supermarkets and other retail outlets during the pandemic.

We felt there was a way forward, but then we were told that there was not.  We would be keen to examine ways of removing or changing upward-only rents.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the process the Deputy mentioned, the committee should take it as read that we want to engage early with that.  We will take up any opportunity for retailers to be a part of it and to restructure their businesses as a result.<\/p> <p>  On the dominance of multiples, there will still be multiples.  The UK multiples in particular seem to be the ones that are exiting the Irish economy, including the Arcadia Group last year with Top Shop and so on and the closure of Debenhams, which has been well reported.  There has been a significant exit but that space is ripe to be filled by indigenous retail.  We are a part of initiatives such as Champion Green, which encourages people to shop local and shop Irish.  We were a part of it when it was initially established approximately two years ago as a green Friday idea related to Black Friday.  We continued with it when it was launched properly last June.  Through it, we are trying to increase opportunities to develop Irish retailers and put new retail entrepreneurs into pop-up shops around the country.  In the latter regard, we see an opportunity to develop that entrepreneurial spirit and give people the chance to take units for short periods of time, test out the markets and establish businesses.

The former Minister and Deputy, Mr. Pat Rabbitte, championed the argument in his pre-election manifesto, as did the former Taoiseach, Mr. Enda Kenny, and the current Taoiseach shortly afterwards.  None of them was able to deliver for us.  In the early 1990s on, retailers were forced to sign up to 30-year upward-only deals.  Many of those deals are still washing themselves out.  We hope that the issue will fix itself in time, but it remains a significant issue for many retailers.<\/p> <p>  To pick up on another of Deputy Shanahan's points, I would tell people not to lose faith in retail.  Retail has gone through a tough time and Covid has had a negative effect, but we are a resilient bunch, which we have proven during the many challenges that have come our way.  There is a great future ahead.  Over the past 18 months, people were locked out of retail for a long time.  Since we opened on 17 May, though, they have come back, embraced shopping and enjoyed the experience of getting out, touching and feeling goods and being able to try on clothes.  It remains challenging because many areas of retail that were not mentioned in our submission are still closed, but people are coming back.  Shopping is the No. 1 hobby in Ireland and will continue to be so.<\/p> <p>  Regarding multiples, the largest growth area in retail at the moment is in small towns and villages, including craft and organic retail, with local shopping being supported.  There are great opportunities, and it is important that our legislators understand this.  We need a dig-out and support at the moment.  We can work with our colleagues from Mandate and ICTU on supporting people to be better employers and supporting the recent legislation on promoting better jobs.  We have proven that we can do the right thing in the past and can prove it again.  We are proud that we paid every member of our staff full wages throughout the lockdown.  We have got that back in spades in terms of loyalty and appreciation.  We have not had a single personnel issue since reopening.  This is against a backdrop where recruitment, job losses, roster niggles and so on are the greatest issues at operational level.  There are great signs for our industry and I urge the Deputy to keep that, rather than the challenges, to the fore of his mind.  With everyone's help, we will get through this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021070700002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Keith Rogers"},{"type":"speech","time":1625612400,"counter":55,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for allowing me to contribute.  I thank the witnesses for participating in this meeting.  It has been informative.<\/p> <p>  I will go through a few points, buried within which will be a couple of questions, so the relevant witnesses might reply to me.<\/p><p>I pay tribute to the retailers large and small who have come back.  I will follow up on the point made by Mr. Rogers.  I know workers have made a huge sacrifice throughout Covid but we cannot forget retailers, particularly smaller retailers.  The fact that they were locked out of their businesses for so long must have been hugely frustrating to them.  I represent Longford.  I know there was a huge uplift in the community when our traders got to open their doors again.  It was a psychological lift for the whole community to see those shops back open.  As a community, we were at one with those retailers.  It is very important to point out that in the main, all our retailers are excellent employers.  There might be some issues across the sector but in the main, our retailers are excellent employers.  <\/p><p> I was interested to hear Mr. Light's observations on retail.  I would concur with him.  It has plateaued.  It is not without challenges.  With big businesses, it is easy to scale retail but it is increasingly difficult for small and medium enterprises to get out there and get the margins they require to make it work.  A huge level of investment is required.  <\/p><p> Regarding rents, have the witnesses carried out an analysis across the sector?  I know they were looking for a two-month rebate on rents.  Do they have any indicative information in terms of how landlords are treating Covid?  How many of them have given a rent break?  Many smaller landlords have in the main been very co-operative and are working with retailers but it is probably an issue in terms of institutional landlords.  <\/p><p> In respect of Retail Excellence's submission, the challenges in retail are much more pronounced in rural Ireland.  We have our town centre first strategy.  For someone in rural Ireland, it is very frustrating to hear people talking about the over the shop concept.  Anybody dealing with families looking for housing on a daily basis knows that very few of those families will put their hands up and say they will live over a shop on a main street.  It is probably easy for politicians to say \"Town centres are hollowed out.  Let's put people back living over shops\" but it is not the quick fix people think it is.  At the same time, I do not expect retailers to be using the first and second floors for storage either.  We must be more imaginative in our town centre first approach.  <\/p><p> Does Retail Excellence have a view on getting more involved in the circular economy?  There is significant opportunity, particularly for those retailers in rural communities and provincial towns where they might need to broaden and look at niche offerings.  I take on board the point that more supports are needed for the retail sector.  <\/p><p> Mentoring is a key issue.  If we look at the way retail is changing across the globe, we can see that it is very much a case of experience shopping.  People like online shopping but it does not give that experience.  It is about what a retailer can do to give customers a better experience when they go in.  What value can it add to its business?  There is also an opportunity for employees in terms of upskilling.  There is probably an opportunity to look at something like a mentoring package and a re-examination of how medium-sized businesses can upskill.  <\/p><p> I am very interested in the idea of a retail manager.  It is certainly the way to go.  Could Mr. Rogers give some indication of what buy back he is getting from local authorities and the Department on that?  Local authorities are working on their county development plans and subsequently their retail strategies but that is something we really need to push.  It would be a key appointment across all our local authorities.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021070700002#G00500","speaker":"1597","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625612400,"counter":57,"content":"<p>I will respond to a few points raised by the Deputy.  Regarding rent, I go back to the point I made earlier, which is that it is very varied.  As this emerges and as businesses reopen, it will become very much more apparent as to where the issues lie in terms of those landlords who are playing ball and those who are not.  We will come back to the Deputy on that issue.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy's point on the circular economy is very well made.  A number of clothing retailers, particularly some of the larger ones, now have what are almost recycling opportunities within them.  This will be a growing trend and is something we support.  It is something the country should look at more.  Bringing old clothes back into new retailers that can be recycled is starting to happen.  Increasingly, we are seeing sustainable packaging being used by many new brands.  This is happening with a lot of these new retailers, which are very focused on sustainability and the circular economy, particularly the younger retailers.  We have run a number of webinars on this topic and will continue to support our members in respect of it.  <\/p> <p>  We fully support mentoring.  With more than 2,000 members across the board, we have a lot of very experienced and skilled retailers we can call on to provide those mentoring services.  We have done it in the past and are in a very good place to help support that and the town centre first initiatives around mentoring.

Estate agents go with the trendy centres.  We were looking to expand some years ago and estate agents told us to stay away from Limerick city and that the Crescent Shopping Centre in Dooradoyle is where it is at.  Retail Excellence organised an initiative with local government to promote Limerick city.  We opened in Thomas Street in Limerick and got a better deal and better property costs.  We have been in a store there since 2016 and are delighted with it.  It is one of our most successful stores and most improved on a like-for-like basis.  There are great examples of this.  Michael Walsh, the city and county manager in Waterford, is the best in the business.  It is an awful pity we cannot clone him.  We need a manager to take responsibility for the town; look at the mix in it; see whether we have shoe shops, clothes shops, department stores and appropriate eateries and night-time and day-time outlets; and compete with shopping centres.  Shopping centres and out-of-town centres, including those in Longford and the Deputy's constituency up as far as Carrick-on-Shannon, are dragging people out of towns and centres.  We can promote our towns with events.  There are great examples of this in the likes of Westport, Galway and Limerick.  We created an initiative a couple of years ago with Carlow where people could be charged car park prices at the times they are coming anyway to incentivise them to come in during late afternoon when they do not come in and the car parks are sitting empty.  There are loads of things that can be done.  There are activities that can be done in link areas.

Employers are struggling to retain people due to the precarity of work in the industry.  We do need a career path, sustainable jobs, decent pay and conditions.  The only way we can address those issues is together.  That would be best done initially by the retail stakeholder group.  We have strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats in reshaping the industry into the future.  The sooner we begin to have honest and open conversations in relation to how we best address those challenges and opportunities the better.  I entirely agree with Mr. Rogers that we cannot lose faith in the sector.  There are good people there.  There are people who wish to remain within the sector.  We need to support and encourage them.  We need mechanisms whereby the employer and the worker both have supports.  One of the manifestations of supports for workers would be the re-establishment of the JLCs across retail.  Collective bargaining would play an essential part in establishing a level playing field for workers in Ireland, not only in the retail sector but across the board.  I am struck by the contributions today that we have more in common than not.  We need to begin that discussion at the earliest opportunity.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Bruton asked a very profound question in his opening remarks, namely what do we need the Government to do.  The resolution of this issue, which is complex and multifaceted, requires a robust acknowledgement that the only solution will be arrived at by working together.  There is no longer a place for a silo mentality, if there ever was one.  If the pandemic did anything, it levelled the playing field for us all whether we liked it or not.  If you stand back and look, whether from the point of view of employer groupings or the worker representative bodies, you can see we are all in the same boat.  How we got in the boat is academic.  We need to shape a future where we are all part of the solution.  I know our members - and I am sure that Mandate and Unite are no different - have a real desire for us to forge with all stakeholders a sustainable future for retail and distribution.  They will play a part, I am sure, but we need to demonstrate that we have the collective will to put in place mechanisms that support retail and distribution into the future, given the change in nature of retail, including the rise in online shopping, which is here to stay because the way the public shops has changed for ever.  Yes, there is a significant place for bricks and mortar traditional retail but we need to look at a mix of how we address the rise of online shopping and how we retain traditional retail.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Rogers observed that the public has flocked back to retail and supported it.  It is one of Ireland's pastimes and we need to ensure we sustain that.  Part of sustaining that is building careers where people see they have secure jobs with decent pay and conditions and a career pathway that takes them from the door to something more meaningful along the way.  Many may not choose to have a career path within the industry, they may be quite happy in their current environment, but we owe them the potential to have a career path should they choose to do so.  One of the great challenges now is the retention of employees generally.  Covid-19 has caused many people to reflect on their lives as they are and reimagine what the future looks like for them.  People in retail have great interpersonal skills from dealing with the public.  I imagine that, as time goes by and the economy reopens, those skills will be highly sought after by other employers and we run the risk of losing people from retail.  Rather than risk that wash out of people from within retail with that skill set to other employers, we need to demonstrate that there is a career path and a meaningful way of earning a living within the industry.  That will be enhanced by the initial step of restoring the JLCs.<\/p> <p>  It will be further enhanced by the long-sought-after collective bargaining mechanism.  It behoves us all to embrace that thorny issue in our deliberations within the retail stakeholder group.  Mr. Graham stated that if we are going to reimagine retail and distribution, we have an obligation, collectively, to get it right.  There are a number of things we need to put in place in order to ensure that the journey is as important as the destination.  The only way we can do that is by working together.  The employer groups are aware of the challenges, as we are , but may have different perspectives on those challenges because they may manifest themselves in a different way.  That does not stop us from having meaningful and robust conversations that lead us to a joint destination.  I am more than anxious to have that discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021070700002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Michelle Quinn"},{"type":"speech","time":1625612400,"counter":64,"content":"<p>I want to return to my original questions, which could only be partially answered.  There seems to be a consensus between both sides that we need a strategy and that the five pillars of this revolve around transition problems, pay, conditions, education and training, location, planning, flexibility and support from councils, digital transformation and the circular economy.  Those five pillars seem to be agreed.  Can the committee simply articulate that as a way forward or are there institutional or structural barriers that either side see to our articulating that or seeking to address those with the Minister of State, Deputy English, who is taking the lead on this?<\/p> <p>  I do not understand how this mandatory proposal will operate.  Is it mandatory for landlords before they go to court to engage in a mediation process or does it seek to oblige them to settle on some particular outcome that an arbitrator other than a court feels should be the 50% or whatever?  They are in two very different categories. One, under existing law, has to be done through the small companies rescue plan where there is some recourse to the courts where someone does an assessment of viability etc. as precursors to a cramping down of the rent or whatever.  That seems to me to be the only way we can do that.  That is why we have been treating this small companies rescue as an emergency piece of legislation.  This committee did not undertake any scrutiny of it because we felt it was sufficiently important.  What exactly is Retail Excellence looking for in this context?  The advice seems to be that the Government cannot just declare 50% rents, and off you go.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021070700002#J00300","speaker":"1549"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625612400,"counter":65,"content":"<p>To answer the Deputy's second question first, this came out of the code of conduct that was put in place in September.

We wanted to make sure the forum was being used fully and that there was an obligation to settle, to go back to the point made by the Deputy.  The small companies rescue plan has since been put into place.  It may be possible for those two aspects to be bolted together.  It is currently very evident that there is no fully independent body to deal with issues a landlord has with a tenant and the only option is to go to court.  There is no stepping stone in that regard and that is why many of these issues currently end up in court, with significant associated cost, resulting in businesses closing.  We were looking for such a stepping stone to be put in place.

The State can play a role in that regard and partly fund it.<\/p> <p>  There has to be an incentive to encourage retailers to expand and fill the vacant spaces around the country.  I do not wish to disagree with Deputy Shanahan but there is a great opportunity to partly fix the housing crisis with apartments in every town, village and city, as we see in cities all over the world, through an incentive tax initiative to get landlords to upgrade the upper floors of their buildings.  That would pay for itself and it would be a great initiative to get people back into towns.  The planning system and the craving to expand retail in the past 30 years has brought new competition outside town centres.  Covid has given us an opportunity we did not seek to fix towns and make it more appealing to live in town centres.  We have a chance to exploit the current support for local businesses, to help start-ups and to fix a large part of the housing crisis.

From that point on, I have taken the view that we need a broader strategic approach involving all stakeholders, including me and others on the retail consultative forum.  We are agreed on that in broad terms.  That is a really important piece of work and it is vital that the committee take on board the need to push it on with a sense of urgency.  It is taking a little longer than it should.  We were given a commitment at the forum that the officials are preparing a piece of work that may be ready in autumn.

I agree with him 100% in respect of the idea of a retail manager.  He referred to the significant work that has been done in Waterford.  I commend Michael Walsh and his team there.  I point out that Waterford is the oldest city in the country.  In the context of incentives for doing up buildings, there is a particular problem in Waterford as much of the commercial heartland is made up of very old stock.  Many of the premises are listed buildings and for many retailer it is just not economically viable to take on that task.  Government policy comes very much to the fore in this regard in terms of infrastructure, planning and access.  That is a problem for all towns, villages and cities.<\/p> <p>  Beyond that, one of the other problems in my city of Waterford is the whole viability of every sector.  They are totally dependent on good value jobs.  There is a far deeper national conversation to be had about the importance of having vibrant jobs.  One can see from areas such as Kildare and south Dublin how that drives investment and consumption.<\/p> <p>  I wish to reflect the positivity that has been referenced this morning.  The idea of a group stakeholder forum is very important but it must have teeth.  Deputy Bruton addressed the issue of rents, landlords and so on.  That is one of the issues that has to be tackled from a financial point of view and it is the prerogative of the Department of Finance to consider that.  That is where we need to go.  We need to ensure there is high-level access to the Ministers and try to get three or four key incentives or initiatives off the ground.  If we can do that, it will certainly go some way towards addressing the issue of rents and rates, as well as the need, referenced by Mr. Rogers, to keep employee supports going in the sector for another while in order to allow people to get back to a viable footing.  I will give full and wholesome support to that, as, I am sure, will the committee.

I am certainly not an expert even though I have worked around retail for most of my working life and have been directly involved with it from a worker representative perspective, but one of the great challenges for retail and retail representatives as we go into the future and some of the great unknowns and challenges we will have to face is the need to think differently in terms of how they conduct business.  Grocery and convenience retail in particular has traditionally been built around a model of high volume and low margins, as has been noted several times during the meeting.<\/p><p>In my view and that of others, that kind of price-led proposition, as opposed to a value proposition, is unsustainable in the long term for operators.  Now is the time for them to grasp the opportunity to play to their strengths through the provision of excellent customer service, accessibility, quality-led offering in store and positive community engagement - all that kind of stuff.  It is our view and that of others that a price-led strategy leads to staff suppression.  A value-led strategy, such as the one I have outlined, with customer service and proactive community engagement at its heart leads to investment in staff, their skills wages and working conditions and improved staff retention and motivation.

It is welcome and it is one of the reasons we have these sort of engagements.  We all know and acknowledge the fact that the sector was facing huge challenges even before the pandemic and they have been exacerbated.  We have heard today that what we need to do ultimately, to meet those challenges, and what retail employers need to do, is to make the sector an attractive place to work.  People need to want to go into retail and be drawn into it as a place where they can see a good and decent career where they can earn a decent standard of living.  That, of course, goes back to the wider social wage costs that we see in terms of housing and childcare.  They are not costs for the employers to meet, obviously, but there are wider issues around the social costs that need to be addressed.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Bruton asked earlier if there were two immediate things that could be done.  Some of them have been addressed.  There are immediate things that could be done.  The committee could immediately back the restablishment of the JLC for the sector as a first step towards establishing that kind of basic threshold around pay and conditions.  That is the first incremental step towards making the sector a place of greater job security, bringing people back into it, attracting workers back into it and giving them meaningful careers.  As has already been suggested, the second action would be to back with urgency the establishment of that critical retail stakeholder group that would be tasked with developing the blueprint for the future of the sector and to deal with all of the issues that are out there.  In terms of the wider issues, including the digital transition, the automation and so on, I remind the members that the National Economic and Social Council produced a good report in 2019 on how we manage the digital and climate transition as a society.  It applies to all sectors of the economy.  As far as I know, it has not been touched in terms of Government recommendations or action.  Those are two actions that can be taken immediately.  If the committee could add its voice to that, it would be extremely helpful for us.  Perhaps my colleagues want to comment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021070700002#L00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Macdara Doyle"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625612400,"counter":77,"content":"<p>To be clear, and it has been mentioned a few times today, we talk about the statutory wage-setting mechanisms.  I was one of the founding members of the JLC many years ago that existed before it was deemed to be unconstitutional and was challenged by a number of employers - not all employers, by the way.  It worked very well for the sector for the vast majority of its years.  It covered the retail grocery sector.  On the other side was a registered employment agreement that covered the drapery sector, which also worked very well for many years in respect of engagement between the worker representatives and the employer groups.  We have put out many calls over the last number of years seeking re-engagement now that the JLC structure has been deemed to be constitutional again.  Alas, those calls and requests for re-engagement have fallen on deaf ears.  As Ms Quinn said earlier, it is the pathway to getting to a better place in respect of the engagement of workers, giving them a sense of engagement and a say in their place of employment.  Collective bargaining is a pathway on the road to that.  It is certainly something that needs to be considered as part of where the sector goes next.  As we said in our submission, as has always been the case in the past, good employers have nothing to fear from it.  Mr. Rogers provided a good example today of the immeasurable return that employers get from employees if they treat them fairly and look after them when they are in greatest need.

I published the general scheme with a view to having the Bill enacted before the summer recess.  This is necessary to enable the Revenue Commissioners to make the essential technical and administrative preparations to implement the various changes to the local property tax, LPT, regime that are contained within the Bill before the valuation date of 1 November 2021.<\/p> <p>  Perhaps the most significant proposal in the Bill is a revised method for calculating local property tax liabilities.  The 2019 review of the local property tax, which the committee is aware of, analysed five scenarios in detail, broadly based on a &euro;500 million target yield excluding any local adjustment factor, LAF.  The scenario analyses were based on a data set assembled by the Revenue Commissioners from the property price register combined with Central Statistics Office and Revenue data and Department of Finance forecasts.  The analyses are based on economic modelling and the predicted outcomes can offer only indicative rather than certain conclusions.  The analyses can provide only a broad picture of the estimated effects on taxpayers.<\/p> <p>  A key challenge encountered during both the work on the review and the more recent analysis is the significant variation of property price increases geographically, especially the uneven pace and rate of increases in residential property values throughout the country since the original valuation on 1 May 2013.  A key principle that informed the design of the local property tax in 2012 was simplicity for taxpayers and for Revenue, which collects the tax.  In that regard, the new basis for calculating local property tax liabilities builds on the existing band structure and is a variation of scenario 5.  The new approach maintains the number of bands at 20.  Band 1 is expanded from &euro;1 to &euro;200,000 and band 2 contains values in the range &euro;200,000 to &euro;260,500.  The LPT charge is fixed at the current charge for bands 1 and 2, which are &euro;90 and &euro;225 respectively.  The other bands are widened by 75% to create bands of &euro;87,500, which is an increase from current range of &euro;50,000.  For properties in bands 3 to 11, a mid-point rate of 0.1029% will be charged.<\/p> <p>  There is currently a higher rate for properties valued above &euro;1 million, with the first million charged at 0.18% and everything above at the higher rate of 0.25%.  Under the proposed variation of scenario 5, it is likely that owners of high value properties, meaning values over &euro;1 million, would benefit from reductions in LPT liability, due to the widening of the bands and the reduced rate.  We therefore have a higher rate which will apply to properties above &euro;1 million, by charging at a higher mid-point rate on bands above &euro;1.05 million and introducing a third rate for properties valued above &euro;1.75 million.  Therefore properties in bands 12 to 19, between &euro;1.05 million and &euro;1.75 million, are charged a mid-point rate of 0.1029% on the first &euro;1.05 million and 0.25% on the balance over &euro;1.05 million.<\/p><p>Properties in band 20 are charged on individual property values as before.  In other words, the charges are 0.1029% on first &euro;1.05 million, 0.25% between &euro;1 million and &euro;1.75 million and 0.3% on balance.  All new residential properties built between valuation dates will be retrospectively valued as if they had existed on the preceding valuation date.  New properties becoming liable for the local property tax at the next liability date, which will be the following 1 November, will be valued at the previous valuation date of 1 November 2021.  Revenue will provide assistance to property owners to determine this value.<\/p><p> Property valuations will be reviewed every four years, rather than the current three years.  This will provide a balance between the timely capture of changes in the property market and the need to limit compliance and administrative costs.  It also assists the regular addition of new properties into the local property tax charge.  From its inception the local property tax has been underpinned by the principle that keeping the number of exemptions low helps to keep the tax rate low for those who are liable to pay it.  I have decided to allow the exemptions for first-time buyers and homes in ghost estates to lapse and to phase out the exemption in respect of pyrite damaged properties.  In recognition of the enormously difficult situation facing homeowners affected by pyrite and mica in counties Donegal and Mayo, I am providing for a similar temporary exemption from local property tax for homes in those counties that have been damaged due to the use of defective concrete blocks in their construction and eligible for the defective concrete blocks grant scheme.<\/p><p> I propose to implement the 2019 review group recommendation that the income thresholds for local property tax deferrals be increased from &euro;15,000 to &euro;18,000 for a single owner and from &euro;25,000 to &euro;30,000 for a couple.  I am also reducing the rate of interest on deferred local property tax from 4% to 3%.<\/p><p> I believe the measures proposed for the Bill will fulfil the programme for Government commitments and will secure the future of the local property tax although in a reformed structure that better suits our current national needs.

The retention of 100% of local property tax by local authorities does away with a large element of the regime.  Notwithstanding our position on the local property tax, I want to dig into the details of this legislation.  Under this legislation the requirement to put 20% into an equalisation fund, which is then distributed, is gone.  We understand the Government is committed to making up the shortfall.  Under this Bill the equalisation fund will no longer exist.  Will the Minister outline the alternative model to the equalisation fund?  The Minister will be very conscious that a number of counties, including my county of Donegal, rely heavily on the equalisation fund.  Counties Donegal, Tipperary, Mayo and Waterford make up 40% of the total of &euro;133 million in payments this year.  What will be the alternative model?  Has the Minister looked at what Dr. Gerald Turley and Dr. Stephen McNena have said?  They said the old model was not good international best practice and that what is needed is a new model that would increase the fund from &euro;133 million to &euro;210 million.

Nor was it contained in the original legislation.<\/p> <p>  To deal with the Deputy's substantive point regarding the need to maintain fairness of treatment for all counties, particularly counties that depend on the equalisation fund, to make up the shortfall in their funding for important local services, I have made a commitment to maintain the equalisation approach.  It will need to be funded through the Exchequer.  My objective is to put this in place over a two year period commencing with the local authority budgetary periods in 2023 and into 2024.  I will work out how that will operate with the Minister, Deputy O'Brien.  My intention is that no local authority or county would be worse off as a result of this change.  The reason it will not happen in the approaching local authority budgetary cycle is because we need to allow the revaluation to happen first to understand what will be the impact on the revenue that various local authorities will receive.

Until now local authorities gathered the local property tax in the relevant area and 80% of it was retained while 20% went into the equalisation fund.  The difference between the baseline and what the local authority retained was the amount paid out from the equalisation fund.  This equalisation fund baseline was the 2014 grant received before the local property tax and what it was retaining in pension-related deductions.  Is this still the baseline?  Will the baseline increase each year?  My concern is there is a commitment from the Government to ensure nobody is worse off.

If the equalisation fund remains the same as it was last year, it will be &euro;133 million.

I will ask a few questions on this issue.  How long will these properties be exempt from the LPT?  Will properties with mica in County Donegal, for example, whose owners have previously paid the LPT, be rebated for that charge?  How do they qualify for this exemption?  As the Minister knows, the upfront cost for an engineer's report on mica properties is approximately &euro;6,000.  Most homeowners in Donegal cannot afford this and it is one of the reasons thousands upon thousands of people came to the streets of Dublin to protest at the scheme and its unaffordability.

The committee on housing met yesterday with officials from his Department and from Revenue as well because we wanted to look at the LPT.  I understand the collection of the LPT rests with his Department but the spend and allocation of it is with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  It is important we make that distinction clear.  I am glad to hear there are talks ongoing between the Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, because our local authorities do depend, albeit some more than others, on the collection of the LPT.<\/p> <p>  I view the LPT as a progressive tax.  It is a tax on the wealth that is in property.  I realise that not everybody sitting on a property that is worth a lot of money has a high level of income.  We should not mix up the two of those things; just because your house is worth &euro;1 million does not mean that relates to your income.  It could be just the luck of the location of your house or when you bought it.  Thus there are allowances there and scope for people to defer the payment of property tax in case of inability to pay or hardship.  For example, I was, as were many of us, canvassing in Dublin Bay South over the past couple of weeks.  Taking an expensive house owned by a couple who are both on the State pension, will the Minister explain what the situation is for that couple regarding the payment of property tax on a property I estimated to be worth somewhere north of &euro;1 million?  It would put them into, say, band 11.

That is a question which comes up now and again from people on limited incomes whose houses are of high value.  There was much discussion of this issue - just after this was introduced - at local authority level where a lot of the decisions are made to raise or reduce the local adjustment factor.  Senator Casey will remember the discussions we had many times at meetings of Wicklow County Council.  It is very easy to estimate where money is being spent in a county.  It is easy to work out the <i>per capita<\/i>spend.  Where that income is being generated from is harder to define with the LPT because one cannot identify the districts or areas that are generating the higher levels of LPT.  In the interests of fairness and so that people within a county can see equity of spend across that county, is there provision for Revenue, which collects the tax, to identify the exact position, by municipal district or, possibly, electoral district, in order that we can finally show people there is equitable income and spend with the tax across a county?

This may well be possible on an postcode basis and the Deputy may be ahead of me in his understanding of that.  The only caveat is that there are important pieces of local infrastructure that can straddle a number of different postcodes and that is potentially an issue which would need to be considered.

He will be aware that tis is a matter on which I have engaged with his Department.<\/p> <p>  Will he comment on a vacant property tax?  Is there, or should there be, more scope in this proposed legislation to address the issue of vacant properties?

Should that opportunity be seized in the context of the proposed legislation?<\/p> <p>  The other issue I wish to raise was indicated at the beginning, namely, the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, legislation.  It has to do with its timing and its scope.  I am conscious, as is the Minister, that the fiscal rules in Europe are currently suspended.  The latter allows for much potential investment in areas.  There has been a very strong emphasis on stimulus from international bodies such as the IMF and the EU and its institutions.  Following that, there is a process on the future of Europe which is a combined initiative of the Council, the Commission and the Parliament.  I am lucky enough to be involved in that process.<\/p><p>I am concerned that the legislation on the ESM, in particular, the approach being taken to the precautionary credit line, could be seen as either being at cross purposes or even, indeed, pre-empting the goals and policies that have been set out by the three European institutions.  Specifically, I am talking about the idea of tight fiscal targets, which in the past took precedence over agreed social goals.  I am concerned by placing precautionary credit line targets, which, I understand, even before Covid only nine countries could reach, as a goal, there is a danger that if those targets, under the ESM and under the precautionary credit line should be used - I note there is an intention for the ESM to engage with the future of the semester process - they could create a pressure for a return to the same model of austerity at a time the discussion in Europe is on a different approach forward based more on stimulus and public investment.  We felt the cost of failure to invest in that area during Covid.  I would be grateful if the Minister could comment on the relationship between those proposals, which he is spearheading as part of the Eurogroup, and those processes that are under way and what we hope is an open space for a different approach to policy as part of the future of Europe and its institutions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021070700002#D01100","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625612400,"counter":129,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for the range of questions.  I will deal with the first question, which was on the issue of vacant properties.  What the revaluation will lead to is that for the first time homeowners will be asked to declare if a property is vacant and will be asked on the IT portal to register for the tax to declare if a property is vacant and indicate a reason the vacancy is occurring.<\/p> <p>  This is a significant development for us because this will be the first time our tax authorities will have this kind of information.  This has been a subject of debate in this committee previously and one of the challenges that we have had is forming an accurate view regarding the breadth of this as an issue and the cause behind levels of vacancy that are there.  This is an issue that, once I have data that is evaluated and robustly collected by the Revenue Commissioners, I plan to consider.  I will not be able to do it imminently because we need to have the data first and need to have data that has been collected for taxable purposes, but this is a matter that I will give consideration to once it is available to me.<\/p> <p>  The Senator raised the operation of the ESM and the conditionality for the precautionary credit lines that could be available.  In the most recent funding instrument that the ESM made available, which was the precautionary credit line for dealing with the effects of the pandemic on Europe, no conditionality attached to it.  As she will be aware, no country has accessed that credit line either.  In the discussion regarding conditionality, it is relevant to note that for the most recent intervention from the ESM there was no conditionality attached.<\/p> <p>  On the Senator's question regarding the use of precautionary conditioned credit lines in the future and the conditionality that is there, she is correct that this is related to the measurements within the Stability and Growth Pact, but that is because the only fundamental budget architecture currently in place in the treaties of the EU are the provisions of the pact and if the use of a credit line is to make reference to changes in a country's budgetary performance then the only anchor available to the ESM to use under EU treaties is the pact.  I do not believe that undermines the debate that is due to begin on the pact.  The EU, as the Senator will be aware, can only operate on the basis of law and precedent, and if it decides to make some change in fiscal rules in the future, this would, of course, be recognised by the institutions of the Union in the years to come.  That would not undermine the debate that I am sure the Senator is eager to participate in but I believe it is important, at a time in which we could yet face economic and financial challenges because of how uncertain the current environment is, to bring forward the operation of the ESM and its relationship with the Single Resolution Fund by two years.

Seven or eight other local authorities are affected by this issue.  The baseline has not been reviewed for many years.  Wicklow is the one I am most familiar with, as will Senator Casey.<\/p><p>By population, we are well below what the baseline figure should be.  By population growth over the past ten years or so, we are way below where we should be.  Another way to measure this is by county area, which I know is not a good metric.  There was a request for the local authorities to make submissions to review the baselines.  I do not know whether that went to the Minister's Department or to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, but we will have to look at that.  There are local authorities that will bring in a higher local property tax rate than they had under their baseline.  This is a complex matter.  I know the equalisation would be gone but there is the self-funding element.  Some local authority members will agree to raise local property tax because they want to provide services.  However, it will not hugely increase the discretionary spend of local authorities.  Some councillors are progressive and brave enough to take the responsibility for raising revenue at local level each year.  Some parties consistently seek to reduce that funding but still go to the top of the queue when they want to spend that funding.  However, we have councillors who take responsibility, and face down the flak that comes with it, to provide local services, which is a really important part of local government.  I have four scenarios for Wicklow.  I will not go into the detail of them but I would appreciate the opportunity to go through the Wicklow scenario with the Minister in finer detail to show him that even though we are looking at a potential increase of perhaps &euro;2.4 million with the 2013 housing brought into it, when you go through the complexity of how the allocation is spent or divided out, the local authority will still end up with only &euro;400,000 extra.  We need to support councillors who make these decisions to raise property tax to provide local services without penalising them by almost an accountancy-style movement of figures.  I will leave it at that but I would like the opportunity to talk further to the Minister about this as well as to the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, and the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021070700002#E00900","speaker":"1626","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625612400,"counter":138,"content":"<p>I would be very happy to speak to the Deputy about that.

As the Deputy will know, the majority of local authorities are either not using the LAF to reduce the LPT bill or are using the LAF to increase the LPT bill for homeowners in order to pay for more and better local services.  I am aware of some of the challenges as to how those decisions are made.

I take the point that this will give Revenue a proper opportunity to analyse and quantify the situation, but we know that roughly one in 33 houses is empty, which adds up to about 250,000.  About 60,000 of those are holiday homes.  We also know we are in a housing crisis like no other.  Any levers that could be used to get some of those vacant properties into use would make a massive humanitarian difference to people.  You need only walk around any provincial town in the country to see the evidence in front of you of the level of vacancy that exists in those towns.  I urge the Minister to see whether there is a stick we can add to the carrot in respect of the grant funding of these buildings to get them into use.<\/p> <p>  The second issue I wish to raise relates to the equalisation fund going.  In many ways, often as an Opposition Deputy you are asked by the Government to trust in the Government in the future.  We are being asked to delete the equalisation fund but are being told that some day we will have a solution to make up for it.  We do not have the details in front of us but the Government is saying \"trust us\".  It would be great if we could make sure, especially given the country we live in and the lopsided spatial development we have, that we are confident there is a solution in place now for those 20 counties that benefit from that equalisation.<\/p> <p>  Maybe the Minister could address those two questions first before I go onto the rest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021070700002#F01400","speaker":"1504"},{"type":"speech","time":1625612400,"counter":150,"content":"<p>In response to Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's first question, I accept that the issue of vacant homes is one we have to consider far more actively now in light of the great housing challenges we have and our need to provide homes for more people.  It is important to understand the scale of this issue and why this vacancy is occurring in the first place.  This is why the local property tax return is a very important development.  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n and I have had debates on this and on the scale of vacancy and why it is occurring, but until today we have not had information collected through paying a tax.  I have accepted in debates I have had on this issue that this was an omission on which we needed to be able to make progress, and we will do that.  When that information becomes available to me through the Revenue Commissioners, I will evaluate it very quickly to see whether it can be of use to us in the design of future policy.  That is why the change we will make now in the information portal of the local property tax is an important development.<\/p> <p>  Regarding Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's second point about the equalisation fund, I emphasise again that the fund is not being deleted.  In fact, it will be in place for the forthcoming year.  It will operate as normal and as it has done in the past under the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  The equalisation fund and issues related to it are not in the local property tax Bill.  If they were, I would have said it to the Deputy.  It will take us a year to make this change.  There is the issue of funding being raised within a particular area and in particular local authorities and that being transmitted and shared to other parts of the country that need that funding and will need it in the future.  That issue had to be addressed in the context of the future of local property tax.<\/p><p>While I cannot address it in the Bill, I am trying to give a policy direction in relation to it and the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and I are committed to implementing it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021070700002#F01500","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625612400,"counter":152,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire as sin.  Unfortunately, I missed the start of the Minister's presentation because Teams was not operational for me at that time.  I understand in the Bill itself the definition of a residential property will be amended in three ways.  The first one is that land adjoining the house, which exceeds an acre, that is suitable for occupation or for the enjoyment of the house, will be specified as part of the property.  Then it goes further and it changes the reference from acre to hectare, which is for compliance with EU standards.  Obviously a hectare is bigger than an acre, so that measurement could have a material change along with the first one.  Do those two potential changes mean that rural homes could be hit with a higher cost?  I have been contacted by people who say they have a turf shed, a driveway, and elements within the plot of land on which their home is located, and the definitional changes look like they could put them into a higher estimation of value and therefore a higher LPT.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021070700002#G00200","speaker":"1504"},{"type":"speech","time":1625612400,"counter":153,"content":"<p>I do not believe that it will, when these changes are implemented.  In fact, one of the changes that we have made in the LPT structure and the banding of the LPT, is that we have increased the breadth of the entry band for local property tax up to &euro;200,000.  One of the reasons I have done that is the risk that was there of homes that had a lower value than the national average could have had the largest percentage increase and one that was ahead of the national average increase since 2013.  That could have had an effect on homes with a lower value.  In the absence of broadening the band, many of them could have faced LPT increases.  In an effort to deal with that issue, which would have been one of equity for them, we have broadened the early bands of LPT to deal with those kind of issues.  In any event, the chargeable value itself is unchanged.  What has always been the case, is that the chargeable value is based on the house, any associated building or structure such as garages and any adjoining area.

I welcome the Minister.  Having sat on the council and gone through a few budgetary processes, including the LPT, I have waited for this opportunity for a good few years.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the address of the inequality I believe has existed in the LPT process, where more than 100,000 houses have not been liable to pay the LPT tax since 2013.  Having gone through a number of those budgetary meetings, that income would have been very helpful to balance the books at the time.  I welcome, therefore, that decision to bring them back into the net.<\/p> <p>  A number of speakers mentioned previously how we try to retain as much of that as possible within the local authority level.  The baseline figure has been mentioned to the Minister on a number of occasions.  Equally, it is the self-funding element by the Department.  I know these are not directly within the Minister's control but these two elements are flexible within the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  The actual value one gets out of the increase is diminished significantly.<\/p> <p>  I will move on to the definition mentioned by Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n because it has been raised with me on a number of occasions.  The heads of the Bill refer to associated building structures such as sheds, and gardens and any adjoining outdoor area up to one acre.  I understand the acre.  The Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 refers to \"his or her own occupation and enjoyment with that residence as its garden or grounds up to an area ... [of] one acre.\"<\/p> <p>  What people in rural areas are probably slightly concerned about is that sheds of no value are now included in the property valuation.  I can understand if we are talking about a sauna, gym, or in some cases, even swimming pools that are included in the valuation of the property, once it is within one acre.  It then comes to outhouses that serve no purpose only storage, however.  As Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n mentioned and as has been raised with me, an element of clarification is needed around that.<\/p><p> The payment of property tax for local authority housing and long-term leasing housing is like an in and out accounting exercise.  It does not serve any purpose.  I cannot refer to what happens in every local authority but some local authorities take that payment out of the housing budget and redistribute it to fund other departments rather than housing.  While it is an in and out accounting exercise I would prefer if that money were to stay in the housing budget.  That is just an observation.<\/p><p> I find the lack of the alignment of the local property tax since its introduction with the local authority budgetary process frustrating.  That is political and there is no point in saying otherwise.  Deputy Matthews mentioned it.  It is the people and the councillors who take the tough decisions.  The people who do not believe in the local property tax, who will not vote on it, who will not increase it or decrease it and who want nothing to do with it are the first in line when it comes to the budgetary process to try to spend that money on foot of the councillors' decision on the local property tax process.  <\/p><p> There is a need for the alignment of the local property tax decision and budget decision on the one day.  We have been given reasons as to why that does not happen.  We have been told Revenue needs those figures in September or October and the budget is not decided until November.  If anything can be done to align the budget process with the local property tax process that should be done as it is needed.  It accounts for nearly 30% of the income revenue of the local authority in Wicklow.  It needs to be aligned with the budgetary process to ensure the people who are not willing to take the hard decisions are now there to decide where it is to be spent.  <\/p><p> I acknowledge that self-financing funding and the baseline are the responsibility of the Minister, Deputy O'Brien but this is a critical issue for counties such as Wicklow and it is hampering what they can deliver at a local level.  Anything the Minister can do to influence the baseline, which has not been reviewed for a number of years, would be helpful.  The other term now being used is the \"self- funding\" element.  Suddenly local authorities are self-funding something they never funded because the Department wants to keep the money or it does not want to give it to the councils to spend. <\/p><p> Deputy Matthews raised the equalisation fund in terms of getting an understanding of where the property tax comes from within each county.  A member of my local authority raises this issue on an annual basis.  With the original equalisation fund the richer counties would have helped subsidise the poorer countries.  I have some reservations when we get into this level of detail.  One area of Wicklow would be a significant revenue generator of property tax but that property tax is needed for the poorer areas of the county.  While I have some sympathy with respect to the equalisation fund I would not like it to come down to a local level where one part of a country could ring-fence its fund for its own use.  Those are a few observations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021070700002#H01000","speaker":"1640","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625612400,"counter":187,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for the points he made.  I also thank him for his recognition of the value of ensuring those 80,000 homes that have been built and purchased since 2013 come into the perimeter of this tax.  It is important once we do this revaluation that we are never in this place again.  It raises an important issue of fairness and within local authorities, as the Senator said, it raises a demanding issue that local authority councillors are supplying services to an increasing number of homes and those homes are not creating the revenue the local authorities need to provide the additional services.  The Senator would expect I would advocate the case for this Bill but an important part of it is making a change to ensure in future when a new home is built and purchased it will always enter the valuation perimeter from the following November.  It means the issue the Senator raised, if and when this Bill is passed, should not happen again.<\/p> <p>  There has been much focus on the baseline issue in this committee.  All I can say at this point is I appreciate the importance of the review under way with regard to the future of the baseline and what that means for different local authorities.  I will certainly pass on the views of the committee to the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Brien.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the different points the Senator made on when decisions are made, the Revenue Commissioners have indicated to me that they believe there is an opportunity to move the notification date for local adjustment factor, LAF, decisions by local authorities out to the middle of October.  I understand at the moment that is the middle of September and that is for non-valuation years.  At this point the Revenue Commissioners have indicated to me they are not in a position to offer more flexibility beyond that point if the arrangements we have regarding local property tax are to be implemented on time.  <\/p> <p>  The Senator also touched on how the decision is made.  I accept, in particular, for local authorities that might decide to increase the value of local property tax, if they make that decision, we should at least consider if that is a decision that has to be made again and again.  That is a decision purely for the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Brien but it is something he and I have discussed.  While it will not be possible in the coming year to deal with that because we will have our hands full implementing the new valuation, it is an important point for the future in terms of how we integrate the decision point of this tax into the decision-making timetable of local authorities and whether this is a decision that needs to be made year after year.  That was an interesting point.<\/p> <p>  The Senator asked if we were to understand how the money is spent within discrete local authority areas what the consequences of that would be.  I agree with him that we should not get into a debate where we begin to talk about money that is raised in one part of a local authority area and spent in another or revenue that is raised in one part of a local authority area and whether it should be spent in another part of a local authority area.  That is not a productive debate to enter into.  Local authority areas in Ireland are mostly compact areas or if they are not, in most case they are configured on county boundaries.  That is the appropriate point for decision making.  Our councillors decide what kinds of projects they want to support and they should do it on a county-wide basis, and that is the way it should be kept. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021070700002#J00200","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1625612400,"counter":188,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021070700002#J00300","speaker":"1640"},{"type":"speech","time":1625612400,"counter":189,"content":"<p>The next questioner is the Vice Chairman of the committee, Deputy Durkan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021070700002#J00400","speaker":"1553"},{"type":"speech","time":1625612400,"counter":190,"content":"<p>I apologise for being absent at the start of the meeting.

We have had a debate over many years regarding the future of the local property tax and whether we should revalue or not.  I have not become aware of significant issues or concerns about how this revenue is being spent.  Senator Casey made an interesting point that 30% of the revenue on which local authorities make decisions comes from the local property tax.  In my experience local authorities are aware of the importance of this revenue stream and the contribution it makes to the funding available to them.  They try to make good and responsible decisions regarding how the money is spent.  I am not aware of accounting or competence issues regarding how the funding is administered.

I listened to previous speakers in the debate refer to vacant houses and their future role in contributions and their potential to resolve the housing crisis.  From my knowledge, and this is my opinion, if there is an expectancy to resolve the housing crisis or make any serious impact on it through the medium of vacant houses throughout the country I have to say we will be very sadly disappointed.  This is because of the scale of the problem ahead.  To my mind, it requires the most appropriate action, which is the direct build as quickly as possible of as many affordable houses as can be made available given there are well over 100,000 families on the waiting lists for property.  The longer this remains, the higher rent prices will go and the pressure to increase rents will continue.  I am particularly concerned about the cost of restoration of some of the vacant houses referred to.  All builders would tell us the restoration of an existing house is more costly for many reasons than to build from scratch on a greenfield site.  This is by way of observation.  I have considerable grounds for believing this.  If the Minister would like to respond I will take the response now and I have one more question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021070700002#K00300","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1625612400,"counter":194,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Durkan.  I take on board what he is saying, which is why I suggest the sequencing of gathering thorough data on this matter first.  This appears to be the sensible first step we should take.  As I said in my engagement with Senator Sherlock a few moments ago, there are many reasons a property could be vacant.  A number of these reasons could be very understandable from a family and homeowner point of view.  They may even be reasons that are acceptable to society.  When we decide we are going to tax something we need to be very clear on the behaviour we are taxing, what is the objective of doing so and what is the desired change we are looking to bring about.  To give some detail on this, if I look at information available from GeoDirectory on 16 rental pressure zones, it indicates a very low level of vacancy in urban areas.  For example, in the north inner city of Dublin, which is a lead part of my constituency, it indicates a vacancy rate of 0.86% of all the properties registered and surveyed.  The rate in Clontarf was 0.24%.  In the south east of Cork city the rate was 0.77%.  The percentage of properties vacant in the surveyed area is lower than some may expect.  We need a better understanding of why they are vacant than we have at present.

I was interested in the discussion I heard at the outset on the need for continued spending in the aftermath of Covid and, as far as this country is concerned, of Brexit.  I strongly support the concept of prudent spending.  This does not mean it is not necessary to spend more than would be advised at other times.  I noted in the course of the conversation there is a difference between the circumstances prevailing now and the circumstances 12 or more years ago.  It is now possible under the EU rules to borrow at very low interest rates.  What is equally important is the use to which the funds are put.  If they are put to good use the country will reap the harvest it deserves.  If not, other things will happen.  Reference is often made to austerity as if were a tool used by government, and it can be used, to slow down economies or to accelerate growth.  However, there were some circumstances in which there were no choices.  Because there were no choices there was nothing that could be done because there was no money.  All of us need to take this on board and remember that the situation that prevails now would not have come about unless careful management of the funds was undertaken at that particular time.<\/p> <p>  As the Minister knows, I have often been critical of economists.  I usually start by apologising to them in advance.  In particular, in the aftermath of the economic crash they came forward from various areas with advice all of which was proved wrong.  Someone I respected over the years is no longer with us.  John Kenneth Galbraith served four Presidents of the United States.  Something he said which is pertinent now is that in the event of introducing stimuli to the economy there may be a necessity to control prices.  His reason for so doing was that on every occasion it happens there is an increase in price.  There is an increase in building costs now.  There is an increase in materials.  There are various increases for which I certainly cannot identify the real reason.  Arising from the huge supports the State rightly had to give the economy and people in the past 18 months or so is there a danger that we could be overtaken by inflation that would create additional problems for the country further down the road?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021070700002#K00500","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1625612400,"counter":196,"content":"<p>I seek guidance from the Acting Chairman as to whether or not I should answer that question?

I have two questions for the Minister.  Before I pose them, I want to make it clear - the Minister is aware of  this - that I am an opponent of this property tax.  I believe that it is wrongly named and that it could be more accurately described as a tax on the family home.  I have no issue with real property taxes such as, for example, a tax on the owners of multiple properties etc.  This is a tax on the family home.  I favour, not its reform or tweaking, but its abolition.<\/p><p>I will now pose a couple of questions in regard to what is under discussion today.  My first question relates to pending increases in the property tax.  I understand from the reports that approximately 36% of households will see their property tax increase in the next round and that a large majority of the increases will be on properties which move up one band and, therefore, a &euro;90 increase and that a minority will be on properties which move up two bands and, therefore, a &euro;180 increase.  I am looking for as accurate as possible an indication from the Minister as to where these increases are likely to fall.  Common sense would indicate that given that property prices have risen most rapidly in recent times in the larger urban areas, the increase in the property valuations and the skipping of bands will be concentrated in those areas and, therefore, the 36% of households that will experience an increase in their property tax bill are likely, although not exclusively, to be concentrated in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway, Waterford and the larger urban areas.  There will be exceptions to that, but I am dealing with the general trend.  The Minister might comment on that.  <\/p><p>My second question is in regard to the finances of the local authorities.  I was a member of a local authority for 12 years, three of which, 2013-2016, were years in which the local property tax was <i>in situ<\/i>.  At that time, the local authority retained 80% of revenue, which it is proposed now to increase to 100%.  The experience was that no local authority retained 80% of revenue.  It may have done so technically but that was compensated for on the other side of the balance sheet by cuts in funding from central Government by a corresponding amount.  What a local authority gained on the swings, it lost on the roundabout.  I ask the Minister to give a commitment that that will not happen this time around and that for local authorities that gain extra funding there will be no corresponding cut in grants from central Government.  In posing that question, I am not holding my breath in terms of the Minister's reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021070700002#L00300","speaker":"1522"},{"type":"speech","time":1625612400,"counter":199,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the questions.  On the first question regarding where increases are likely to fall, I want to emphasise again that most homeowners will not see an increase and, in terms of those who do, the majority of them will move up one band and, therefore, an increase of &euro;90.  As to where they will be, there is no precise answer to that question.  It depends on the value of individual homes and how they have changed versus where they were in 2013.  Of the approximately 30% of homes that will see an increase of one band, some will be in Dublin.  We expect others will be in counties along the east coast.  In regard to those that will see an increase larger than two bands, we expect some of them to be larger properties in the midlands of the country.  The Deputy asked if all of the homes that will face an increase are concentrated within particular cities.  That will not be the case.  It depends on how the value of the home changed versus the national average since 2013.  The households that will face the largest increase will be those currently not paying the local property tax who will have to pay under the revaluation.  They will move from no payment to the new LPT valuation.  There is no absolute geographical definition as to where the charges will fall.  Some parts of Dublin will be affected but they will be distributed alongside the eastern counties as well.  While many households in those areas might see an increase, many others will see no change or, perhaps, a decrease.<\/p> <p>  On the commitment sought by the Deputy, I cannot give a detailed answer now to that question.  The issue of the allocation of funding and how it is distributed is a matter for the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien.  I will work with him to ensure that no local authority is worse off as a result of the changes that are being made.  We will do that work in a year's time when we have implemented this revaluation, to which I know the Deputy is opposed.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021070700002#L00400","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1625612400,"counter":200,"content":"<p>I would like to put a brief supplementary question on the Minister's response to the first question regarding pending increases.  The Minister has indicated that approximately 30% of households will face an increase.  The figure I have, which is taken from reports and the media, is 36%, which is closer to 40% than 30%.  The Minister might confirm that that is the case.<\/p> <p>  On statistics, the Minister says that many households will experience a freeze or a decrease as opposed to an increase.  The figures would indicate that the ratio in terms of the numbers that would not increase is less than 2:1 and that the number that decrease would be less than one third of the number that increase.  The question element on this is in regard to the big cities.<\/p><p>I take the Minister's point there cannot be an absolute indication of where the increases will hit.  However, I believe it is a fair comment - I am asking the Minister if he disagrees and I am couching this in quite general terms - that given the fact property price increases have tended to be greater in more concentrated urban areas and the bigger cities, it will tend to be the case that a disproportionate amount of the increases in property tax bills will be concentrated in those areas.

The caveat we put on all the information is in that key word \"approximately\".  This is very general guidance because we are looking to form an evaluation of around 1.7 million properties and each one of those properties has a different valuation.<\/p> <p>  On the general question the Deputy put to me about whether increases are likely to be concentrated within cities, if I look at what I expect to happen when the bills come out in November and at where I believe most properties that will not see an increase will be, I expect most of them to be within Dublin.  This is because we have increased the bands and cut the rate by so much.  It is actually within Dublin and, possibly, one or two other cities, where I expect a concentration of most of the homes that will not see an increase.  Out of the one in three homes, provisionally and generally, that will see an increase, some will be in Dublin.  However, for me to equate this to or be able to give the Deputy an absolute assurance that, for example, the majority of homes that will face an increase will be in Dublin, I do not have the information to be able to tell the Deputy, definitively or even generally, that will be the case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021070700002#M00200","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1625612400,"counter":203,"content":"<p>I am aware the Acting Chairperson also wants to come in so I will ask my two questions together because we only have approximately seven minutes.  My first question is on the surcharge for non-compliance with LPT requirements that was provided for by section 38 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012.  This 10% surcharge is applied against the amount of tax contained in an income tax, corporation tax or capital gains tax return.  According to Revenue's tax and duty manual on the local property tax surcharge, an LPT-generated surcharge will not apply where a person has a nil tax liability where income refers to corporation, income and capital gains tax.

On the use of a charitable trust ownership structure, and I understand this is relevant to the previous Act rather than the one we are talking about now, has any analysis been done on the possibility that investment firms have used the LPT exemption for residential properties owned by a charity?  If investment firms have been using this charitable trust ownership structure, have they been exempt from the tax?  Has any analysis been done to ensure that structure has not been used and, if not, can we take a look at it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021070700002#M00500","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speech","time":1625612400,"counter":206,"content":"<p>I am not aware of this being an issue.

I am acting director in the health infrastructure division of the Department of Health and I am joined by my colleague, Mr. Eamonn Quinn, principal officer for major capital projects.<\/p> <p>  The new children&rsquo;s hospital project is the most significant capital investment programme ever undertaken in Ireland&rsquo;s healthcare system.  The development of the new children&rsquo;s hospital is a Government priority project and will bring together the services currently provided at three children&rsquo;s hospitals into a modern, custom designed, world-class, digital hospital to deliver the best care and treatments for Ireland&rsquo;s sickest children.  The project comprises the new children&rsquo;s hospital at St. James&rsquo;s Hospital as well as outpatient and urgent care centres located at Connolly Hospital, Blanchardstown and Tallaght University Hospital.  The construction project is only one part of three interrelated elements of the NCH programme for the delivery of a new paediatric model of care in Ireland, the others being the ICT infrastructure and the operational integration of the three existing children&rsquo;s hospitals.<\/p> <p>  Despite the obvious challenges the Covid-19 pandemic has imposed on us, significant progress has been made on the project.  Mr. Gunning and his colleagues will speak to the specifics, but the distinctive shape of the building is becoming clear.  The fit-out of certain internal areas has begun, with rooms and clinical areas now discernible.  On a recent site visit, we got a real sense of how welcoming an environment it will be for children, their families and CHI's staff, with plenty of natural light and breakout spaces in addition to the world-class health facilities.  It is clear that this is not just a hospital.  It is effectively a new village to provide for Ireland&rsquo;s sickest children, their families and the healthcare professionals who will care for them.  There will be gardens, recreational facilities, a school for the patients and a university campus for future health care professionals.  One of most impressive aspects for the team was the seemingly endless corridor on the theatre level, which will be home to 22 world-class theatres and the respective preparation and ante rooms.  With the mock-ups of how the various rooms will be completed, there is a tangible sense of the positive clinical care experiences that patients and their families will have in the new hospital.  We encourage members of the committee to accept the development board&rsquo;s invitation to visit the site and see the vision being realised.<\/p> <p>  The paediatric outpatient and urgent care centre at Connolly Hospital opened in July 2019.  Ms Hardiman of CHI will speak further to the benefits that have been realised for paediatric care, but a 65% reduction in the waiting list for general paediatrics within a year of opening, despite the challenges of the pandemic, speaks volumes.  The second satellite centre at Tallaght University Hospital will open before the end of this year.  This opening of the second of the three new campuses will be another important milestone in the NCH programme and in the delivery of children&rsquo;s health services.<\/p> <p>  The Department acknowledges the responsibilities and duties of the committee and the interest of members in the timeline and projected costs for the completion of the project.  However, there is a live contract in place and ongoing commercially sensitive engagements between the NPHDB and BAM.  The development board representatives will speak to the programme supplied by BAM but, given the ongoing commercial engagements, a definitive update on costs cannot be provided as it would be inappropriate and very likely detrimental to the project to speculate on those.  The NPHDB and BAM are currently working together to identify and work through possible obstacles to the timely completion of the project.  This is very much welcomed by the Department.<\/p> <p>  While there is demonstrable progress, there are also challenges.  However, many of these are not specific to this project.  We are still in the midst of a global pandemic.  While work on NCH sites continued through the lockdown earlier this year, NPHET is advising that we should expect a significant wave of Delta transmission and we must anticipate the many challenges this pandemic will continue to present.  Indeed, the wider construction industry is challenged by supply chain issues and dramatic price increases.  This was reflected in the recent national economic dialogue, where it was noted that the pandemic and Brexit are impacting the economy, productivity and creating bottlenecks in supply.  These challenges face the NCH project as well and, notwithstanding the commercial sensitivities, make speculation and definitive forecasting of costs and timelines even more unwise.  Nevertheless, reflecting the positives, we now have paediatric outpatient and urgent care being delivered at Connolly Hospital, a site at St. James's that is progressing well, with constructive engagement between the development board and the main contractor, and a new paediatric outpatient facility coming online later this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021070700002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Prendergast"},{"type":"speech","time":1625612400,"counter":223,"content":"<p>Thank you.

I am the chief officer and I am joined this morning by Mr. Phelim Devine, our project director, and Dr. Emma Curtis, the medical director.<\/p> <p>  The board was appointed in 2013 to design, build and equip the new children&rsquo;s hospital on the campus shared with St. James&rsquo;s Hospital in Dublin 8 and two paediatric outpatient and urgent care centres at Connolly Hospital, Blanchardstown, and Tallaght University Hospital.  The NCH project, a Government priority, will have a significant impact on the healthcare outcomes of 25% of the population once completed and is the single most significant capital investment project in the healthcare system ever undertaken in Ireland. <\/p> <p>  The new paediatric outpatient and urgent care centre at Connolly Hospital is fully operational.  It was opened in July 2019.  In the packs supplied to members, we have provided a set of photographs which I urge them to examine.  They show the significant progress that has taken place across the sites.  It is a priority for the NPHDB and all stakeholders to open the paediatric outpatient and urgent care centre at Tallaght in 2021 and we are pleased to report that we are on target to do that.  Members will see from the images distributed as part of the briefing pack that construction work on the 4,600 sq m centre is nearing an end, with a substantial completion date scheduled for September 2021.  The centre will then be handed over to CHI to open for services after an approximately eight-week period of operational commissioning and equipping.  The works at Tallaght are progressing at pace.  Final internal works comprise placing the ceiling panels, completing the painting, commissioning and testing of the mechanical and electrical services, cleaning and snagging.<\/p><p>External works comprise finalisation of pavements around the centre and landscaping.  The work on the centre at Tallaght included a significant investment in the adult hospital, which involved the delivery of a new changing and administration block, a new cr&egrave;che and the upgrade of roads and pavements, car park, and electrical infrastructure.<br\/><br\/>Progress on the main new children&rsquo;s hospital is also continuing.  The primary concrete frame was completed in March 2021.  The infill concrete slabs over the steelwork frame closing in the concourse will be completed by August 2021, as will the unitised glazing to the ward block at levels 4 to 6, which is the doughnut shape on the top of the building.  It comprises the colours of the rainbow that the committee members will be familiar with from the design drawings they have seen. The facade to the building will be practically complete by the end of 2021, with the glazed biome that links the building to complete in the first quarter of 2022.<br\/><br\/>The fit-out of the south finger rooms comprising outpatients, cardiology wards and therapies, and the hot block rooms comprising emergency department, imaging, critical care and theatres are progressing well.  The remainder of the fit-out of the north finger rooms, comprising outpatients, the hospital school, the third-level education centre, the parental overnight accommodation and pharmacy and the ward block, will commence in the next month.  <br\/><br\/>The primary mechanical and electrical plant comprising boilers, combined heat and power, generators, transformers, main distribution boards and medical gases are well progressed with the focus now on primary and secondary distribution of those services around the building.  Some of the group 1 medical equipment, such as the pendants in the operating theatres and critical care rooms, are being installed.  The group 2 equipment comprising automated guided vehicles and clinical decontamination unit equipment is currently in procurement.  The balance of the group 2 equipment, such as MRIs, CT scanners and all the other advanced imaging equipment, will commence procurement in the next quarter.<br\/><br\/>Sustainability is embedded in the design of the children&rsquo;s hospital.  The hospital recently received an excellent rating in design under the building research establishment environmental assessment, BREEAM, method and is one of only a small number of hospitals in the world to have achieved such a rating.  BREEAM is the world&rsquo;s leading sustainability assessment method for projects, and <br\/><br\/>The global pandemic has disrupted the construction sector and all its supply chains both nationally and internationally.  Unfortunately, the NCH project has not been immune to this.  In 2020, both the construction site of the new children&rsquo;s hospital and the new centre at Tallaght were closed for a period, following the arrival of Covid-19 in Ireland.  In 2021, the sites remained open as essential sites during the level 5 lockdown.  The contractor introduced extensive health and safety measures, which included weekly screening and PCR testing for all workers.  More than 5,000 tests have been conducted and I am delighted that no positive cases were detected on site up to the end of June.  This level of focus has enabled the national children's hospital site to remain open and is a testament to the contractor&rsquo;s diligent staff and the health and safety measures put in place.  The challenges presented by Covid-19 remain immense and will be with us for the foreseeable future.<br\/><br\/>It is acknowledged by all stakeholders that Covid and Brexit will likely place pressure on the availability of essential supplies in the global market.  The construction sector is facing challenges related to the supply of market essentials as a result of increased global demand and shortages driven by Covid-related factory shutdowns, production disruption and inventory depletion.  In addition, it is reported that there is a shortage of shipping containers and Brexit-related import delays and constraints.  This is a global challenge and one that is not unique to the construction sector but it will have potential impacts on the project with cost and lead time uncertainty.  The contractor continues to work through these challenges and will manage the risk as much as possible.<br\/><br\/>As previously outlined to this committee in November 2020, there are delays to the programme of works in part due to the wider construction sector challenges I have mentioned.  We have previously reported to the committee that we did not have a compliant works programme from the contractor.  I am delighted to be able to report to the committee that a compliant programme was submitted by the contractor in March 2021 and has been determined by the employer&rsquo;s representative as being compliant.  That is a major milestone for the project.  With over 40,000 separate activities to be completed over the course of the build, the programme details each and every one, ensuring that it is in the right sequence and at the right phase of the build.  By determining the programme as compliant, the employer's representative has essentially confirmed that it is feasible to complete the construction phase within the timeframe set out.  This is only feasible if the project is executed and resourced efficiently by the contractor and its subcontractors and if all other external factors, including Brexit and Covid, do not impact on supply issues and goods and services.  The compliant programme takes account of the known delay, and all stakeholders are fully aligned around the goal of opening the hospital in 2024.  The NPHDB and the main contractor are engaged in a series of workshops to map out the detail within the programme to take account of the risks that remain and to make every effort to ensure the target date can be achieved.<br\/><br\/>As a part of the combined effort to achieve delivery of the programme within the shortest timeframe, all dispute mechanisms have been paused.  This moratorium has been agreed between both parties, which enables the parties to solely focus all their efforts on ensuring that the new target completion date can be realised.  This does not remove the risk of claims, nor does it mean that we will not continue to receive claims.  It does, however, temporarily take away the time and cost burden of defending those claims robustly.  <br\/><br\/>In December 2018, the Government approved an investment decision of &euro;1.433 billion for the project.  As communicated to and by Government at the time, this decision excludes items for which there was no price certainly and nor can there be for the duration of the project.  These excluded items are construction inflation, statutory changes, any change in scope resulting from healthcare policy changes and the sectoral employment order, SEO.  While we now have a compliant programme, the target completion date for the programme is 14 months later than the timeframe upon which the contract was determined.  Any elongation of the programme equates to additional cost.  There are potential cost implications arising from Covid-related delays, additional health and safety measures, as well as ongoing claims issues that have the potential to contribute to the overall costs.  These matters, as well as those associated with the change to the programme duration, are currently subject to commercial mechanisms and are part of the live contract that exists between the NPHDB and BAM, the main contractor.  I am, therefore, not in a position to elaborate further at this time as it could compromise our ability to negotiate on behalf of the State at a later date.  There is an extremely high likelihood that any discussion on costs, however hypothetical, would prejudice enforcement of the existing contract and very likely negatively impact or jeopardise our current engagements with the contractor.<br\/><br\/>The hospital and the centre at Tallaght are taking shape.  Significant progress has been made as is evident from the photographs and video that we have shared.  The project continues to have challenges but we are moving forward with a spirt of co-operation with the main contractor and with all of our stakeholders to ensure that this badly needed hospital is delivered as soon as possible.  I look forward to answering any questions about the project the Chairman and members might have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021070700002#A00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Gunning","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625612400,"counter":226,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for inviting Children's Health Ireland to attend this meeting.  As client to the NPHDB for the new children&rsquo;s hospital project, I welcome the opportunity to provide the committee with an update from CHI's perspective.<\/p> <p>  CHI was established as a statutory entity in January 2019 to govern and manage acute secondary paediatric services for the greater Dublin area as well as national tertiary and quaternary paediatric services, some of which are on an all-island basis.  This saw the children&rsquo;s hospitals at Temple Street, Tallaght and Crumlin merge to form CHI in preparation for the move into the new children&rsquo;s hospital.  In July 2019, we also opened the first of our two paediatric outpatient and urgent care centres at Connolly Hospital, Blanchardstown.  <\/p> <p>  The NPHDB has advised that the second paediatric outpatient and emergency care centre building based at Tallaght University Hospital will be completed and handed over to CHI in September 2021.  CHI is planning an eight-week operational commissioning period before opening services in this new building in November 2021.<\/p><p>I will turn to our service.  In 2020, a total of 260,000 children and adolescents were treated in our services at Crumlin, Temple Street, Tallaght and Connolly hospitals.  This was a reduction of just over 20% compared to the 2019 activity as a result of Covid-related service reductions.  Timely and greater access to our services remains our single greatest operational challenge as a healthcare provider.  CHI has several infrastructure and workforce constraints contributing to lengthy waiting lists and access challenges.  These constraints are primarily in the theatres, radiology, critical care, laboratory and outpatient departments, and these have been exacerbated by the Covid-19 outbreak with the recent cyberattack adding further to this challenge.  Opening of the new children&rsquo;s hospital and the new facility at Tallaght will in time address these access challenges.<\/p><p> In March of this year, CHI was operating at 86% of its March 2019 activity. That was a significant improvement from March 2020 when services were severely restricted at the beginning of the pandemic.  Since then we have innovated with virtual clinics.  We had a significant reduction in emergency department attendances throughout 2020, which has since reversed in 2021.  This has not resulted in an increase in emergency admissions, with patients being treated and discharged home from our emergency departments and urgent care centre.  We have seen a significant increase in children and adolescents with mental health presentations coming to our hospitals, which we attribute to the pandemic.  This has put pressures on our resources.<\/p><p> To meet infection prevention and control guidance of 2 m distancing between beds, CHI has had to repurpose spaces such as play rooms, family lounges and other communal spaces in our children&rsquo;s hospitals into clinical spaces to accommodate beds displaced from our multiple occupancy wards, which are rooms with two to six beds in a room.  The new children&rsquo;s hospital with its single occupancy rooms, designed with infection prevention and control in mind, will significantly improve how we can treat and care for children even in a pandemic.<\/p><p> The criminal cyberattack on the healthcare system has had a material impact on our IT systems in CHI and our ability to deliver services to our patients and families.  While most of our IT systems are back up they continue to be slow and not all are connected or linked to each other.  Patient information from manual records over the past seven weeks are being uploaded into our IT systems and it will take weeks to get back to our starting point in May.  Despite this, several initiatives are being progressed to improve access to care.  As part of the first phase of access to care funding, CHI secured confirmation in late June of additional once-off funding of &euro;1.9 million in 2021 to support specific initiatives to address long waiting times across 15 specialties.  Discussions are also at an advanced stage with the HSE on expanding MRI capacity in Crumlin and Temple Street hospitals to address waiting times for this specialist imaging.  These are welcome and required investments in acute paediatric care.  CHI has consistently apologised to our patients and their families who are experiencing long waiting times.  We acknowledge this can be a source of anxiety for parents, children and indeed for our staff and it is our primary operational priority to have this addressed. <\/p><p> CHI is entering the final stages of the electronic healthcare record procurement process using a competitive dialogue methodology.  It is anticipated to have a preferred vendor selected by the fourth quarter of 2021 and approval secured to sign contract in the first quarter of 2022.  It is planned to open the new children's hospital as a full digital hospital and alignment with the capital build programme is key to achieving this objective.<\/p><p> Expansion of services in CHI at Tallaght will enhance the delivery of secondary paediatric services in south county Dublin, Dublin south west, Dublin south city and the surrounding areas of Kildare and Wicklow by delivering the right care, as close to the child&rsquo;s home as possible.  These expanded services are in addition to inpatient and outpatient services currently at CHI Tallaght, which will remain there until the new children&rsquo;s hospital opens.  This new facility is purpose built for children and families and will deliver emergency care, outpatient services, radiology, medical forensic examination and child sexual assault counselling and therapy services.  We will have more capacity to deliver short-stay care in emergency care so that children can have a consultant-led assessment and treatment and be discharged home without needing inpatient admission.<\/p><p> When fully operational this new facility in CHI Tallaght will provide 17,000 additional outpatient appointments predominantly in general paediatrics, specialist and orthopaedic clinics, and up to 25,000 emergency care attendances annually.  We have seen a 65% reduction in the waiting list for general paediatrics since the opening of CHI Connolly and we expect to see this waiting list reduce further by the end of 2022 with these expanded services in CHI Tallaght.  A public awareness campaign is planned for families, GPs and healthcare professionals in Dublin south, Dublin west, Kildare and Wicklow informing them on the expanded services in CHI Tallaght. <\/p><p> To conclude, the additional challenges in healthcare caused by a global pandemic and a cyberattack has only magnified the need for our new children&rsquo;s hospital.  Our staff experience difficulties daily in delivering acute paediatric care services to Ireland&rsquo;s sickest children and adolescents in outdated facilities in our existing hospitals that have poor digital infrastructure and old equipment.  I re-emphasise the criticality of the new hospital and the new Tallaght facility.  Their space, digital infrastructure, modern equipment and enhanced workforce are at the core of our plans to enhance clinical outcomes and develop services provided to children, adolescents and their families.  I wish to express my deep appreciation to the staff in CHI for their continued dedication, professionalism and innovation throughout the past challenging 17 months.  We look forward to walking through the doors of our new children's hospital and delivering care and treatment there.  In the meantime, we remain committed to reforming our services and prioritising investment and innovation to support improvement in paediatric services and child healthcare.

All of us have come across difficult cases recently, whereby children and adolescents who require psychiatric care and attention are having difficulty in accessing programmes, residential places, care and attention.  I am concerned that an increased number of people feel they are excluded from the system, nobody cares for them, there is little provision of medical psychiatric attention for them, and they are abandoned.  Some of these have been the subject of court cases and some of them involve the Departments of Education and Health.  This situation has now come to a serious stage where it is imperative that some action be taken, of an emergency nature, to deal with these issues.

In my opening statement I raised the issue of the significant increase in mental health issues.  This is not just in Ireland.  From talking to staff in children's hospitals internationally, we know this is a global matter.  We have seen a 58% increase in attendances in our hospitals in the second half of 2020 compared with the same period in 2019.  We have also seen a significant 66% increase in children presenting with eating disorders.  The HSE is investing a significant investment in the community for eating disorders, which is quite welcome.  That is part of the 2021 investment.<\/p><p>CHI have been meeting with its child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, colleagues in the greater Dublin area and in the regions to implement this so that we catch these children earlier and treat them in the community before they have to attend acute hospital services.  The new children's hospital has 20 beds assigned for mental health as part of the plan for inpatient mental health facilities.  These are quite specialist beds.  Twelve of them are for general mental health conditions, particularly children who are very young and may need intervention from medical colleagues as well as those in mental health.  There are eight eating disorder beds.  CHI is working with CAMHS colleagues to ensure that we are designing those beds so that they will be operational when the hospital opens.  <\/p><p> This is a challenging area.  From a child and adolescent perspective, it is the post-Covid element of care on which we need further engagement regarding the models of care are we need to implement and much more collaboration internationally.  We must look at working with schools, local sports clubs and families so that we support our young people to be resilient and to deal with the challenges of growing up in modern society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021070700002#C00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Eil&iacute;sh Hardiman","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625612400,"counter":235,"content":"<p>There is a need for emergency measures to deal with these issues right now.

There are plans to develop more beds, as outlined, but they take time to implement.  CAMHS plan to enhance community services earlier.

I will follow on from what some other committee members have asked.  Our guests can tell by the questions they have asked that those committee member are not based in Dublin.  Taxpayers around the country will read about this meeting in the newspapers tomorrow or hear about it on the radio.  There are mixed feelings about the project.  It is seen as essential but the cost involved has been extortionate.  When this hospital has been delivered and built, taxpayers will want to know that it is a national hospital and not a Dublin hospital because that is what the taxpayers are funding.  I will bundle together a few questions relating to that issue which Ms Hardiman might be able to answer.  Has the surge in terms of delivering this project had any knock-backs for the likes of the Children's Ark ward at University Hospital Limerick, or similar children's wards elsewhere?  Is funding being taken from those wards and channelled towards the NCH project?  Will the national children's hospital be completed at the expense of wards in Crumlin, the Ark ward, etc.?<\/p> <p>  Will there be an enhanced ambulance service to give connectivity to the new hospital?  There is, of course, a public National Ambulance Service but it seems to me that many of the transfers of children to the current children's hospital in Crumlin from other parts of the country occur through voluntary service, such as BUMBLEance.  Please God children from the west and south of Ireland will not need to go the new NCH but, if they do, taxpayers want to know that the hospital is for them, the children concerned will be able to get there easily, there will be a bed for them and they will be well looked after.  Perhaps Ms Hardiman could offer some clarity in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021070700002#L00800","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625612400,"counter":427,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his questions.

We work in partnership with BUMBLEance.  Neonatal services have extended to 24-hour cover.  Newborns who are born anywhere in the country can be brought immediately to Dublin, either to the maternity hospitals, the existing children's hospitals or the new children's hospital.  We also have a plan to extend the paediatric emergency ambulance service.  That service is working predominantly in daytime hours at the moment.  Plans are being developed and funded to make that a 24-hour service.

I reiterate the role of the NCCA on the first question around the bonus points.  The current consultation which is still open is based on the draft specifications.  As we noted in our opening statement, we are hearing and getting feedback on the draft specifications but we are also hearing wider points and messages, for example around encouraging the take-up particularly of the T1 specification.  All of that feedback is being recorded, will be analysed and will be included in the report we provide at the end of the consultation.<\/p> <p>  The decision around measures to encourage take-up of the draft specifications is a Department decision and not one of the NCCA.  The Gaeltacht strategy refers to a number of measures that could be considered to encourage take-up but that is not part of our role.  We do not make the decisions around that point but all of the feedback that we are hearing on this, some of which includes the call for bonus points, will form part of our report on the consultation itself.  <\/p> <p>  The first point to make on the use of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages, CEFR, is that the NCCA draws very heavily on extensive research which includes practice and policy trends internationally, as we noted in our opening statement.  We would have drawn on the CEFR in very broad terms as we were developing the two draft specifications.  For example, we would have drawn on it in the structure of the draft specifications.  That can be seen in the strands and elements that sit in the two draft specifications.  We would also have drawn broadly on it in the five key language skills.  <\/p> <p>  There are a number of things that are important to bear in mind in particular in the case of the CEFR.  It is a framework that is designed to support second language adult learners.  Another key point is that the draft specifications for leaving certificate Irish are part of the overall leaving certificate programme which is aligned with levels 4 and 5 of the National Framework of Qualifications, NFQ.  The CEFR itself was not designed to support national accreditation at the upper end of secondary education.  While we drew on it in very broad terms, it was in that context.<\/p> <p>  Going back to one of my first points, the consultation is ongoing and if people have particular comments or thoughts on the CEFR and its use, that can all be fed back to us during this consultation.  Like the point I was making on bonus points, we will take and report on all of that feedback and it will inform our ongoing work on the draft specifications.<\/p> <p>  I am not sure if either of my colleagues would like to add to any of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SC12021070700002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Arlene Forster"},{"type":"speech","time":1625612400,"counter":489,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom teacht ar ais m&aacute;s f&eacute;idir liom.

I thank the Senator for the question.  It is not surprising that bonus points have become such an important point of discussion throughout the consultation.  The point to reiterate is that it is not within the remit of the council to advise on this.  The council, therefore, has not had an opportunity to discuss the issue.  It is not just difficult but is impossible for us to offer a council position when it has not had an opportunity to deliberate on this as yet.  There are probably a range of measures that would need to be considered but bonus points is something that has entered the mix early, possibly because it was something that was offered in 2012 to encourage uptake in higher-level mathematics.<\/p> <p>  I will make a number of points on this without making any judgment on the effectiveness of the initiative.  The measure was introduced with two goals in mind.  One was to increase uptake and the other was to improve the mathematical competence of students.  It is quite clear from the data that it has improved uptake but there has not been a formal evaluation of the initiative.

I understand the perception that has emerged to the effect that there may be lessons to be learned from the provision of applied maths in this context.  There is practice in other jurisdictions of providing additional time for study of more advanced material.<\/p><p>This is usually a means to resolve a tension between different areas that should be studied, to provide differentiation or to support students studying in areas which relate to future learning needs.  It is probably not accurate to categorise applied maths in that way.  The syllabus now in place is over 40 years old.  The group of students taking the examinations next year will be the last to study this old syllabus.  In the absence of an aim or rationale, it is difficult to ascertain the cohort of students it was designed to serve.  It is fair to say that, over the last 40 years, it has become a popular subject among 3% of the overall cohort of students.  That is a quite a small proportion but it is a steady 3%.  It is typically studied by male students who are also studying physics and maths at higher level.  In the consultation on the new specification being introduced in September, which was held a couple of years ago, these issues were discussed.  At the time, there was strong consensus that the applied maths specification, which has been developed and which is to be introduced in September, would not relate to an advanced maths course but an applied mathematics curriculum which would be offered at higher and ordinary level.  What we have now and what we will have in the future is not based on a model of advanced or non-advanced maths.  As Mr. &Oacute; Buachalla said at the start, something akin to the concept of a core common curriculum for all students with additional subjects containing advanced material was offered in 2015 at the junior cycle but the feedback on it was quite negative which resulted in a change of tack and the development of te T1-T2 specifications that now exist at junior cycle.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SC12021070700002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Slattery","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625612400,"counter":507,"content":"<p>I will come in with regard to the texts list.  To build on what Mr. &Oacute; Buachalla said, reference was made earlier to the fact that there are currently no texts lists in the draft specifications.  That is absolutely correct.  Perhaps I could clarify a few points with regard to the texts lists.  When the NCCA undertakes consultations on draft language specifications, we do not have the texts lists developed yet.  This is simply because the draft specifications are just that; they are drafts and are open to change.  It can be very difficult to ascertain the degree of change that may arise on foot of a consultation.  In my opening statement, I mentioned that this consultation has been on the council's agenda at each of its meetings since the consultation went live in February.  At the most recent meeting of the council in June, the likelihood of holding a second phase of consultation on the specifications was discussed.  It was suggested that we would take all of the feedback from the current consultation, which has now been extended until the end of November, and use it to support our work in further developing the draft specifications.  It is to be hoped that this reporting on the consultation would also be helpful in making decisions on the big questions regarding implementation, supports and choice.  We would then be in a position to hold a second round of consultation on the updated specifications.  At that point, we could certainly look at the feasibility of making texts lists available for that second round of consultation because we hope we will be much closer to having final versions of the specifications at that time.<\/p> <p>  I will go back to one of the first points I made.  The consultation is ongoing and people can share their perspectives and thinking on those texts lists as well.  As part of the overall process of developing texts lists, we also have an online survey that is open to teachers, parents and so on to allow them to share their ideas and suggestions around texts to be considered for inclusion on those texts lists.  That is another way in which the public at large can contribute to the work.  It is important to outline that in response to the point made earlier with regard to texts lists.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SC12021070700002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Arlene Forster"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625612400,"counter":508,"content":"<p>Maidir leis na liosta&iacute; t&eacute;acsanna, tuigim go maith nach bhfoils&iacute;tear liosta&iacute; t&eacute;acsanna mar chuid de phr&oacute;iseas mar seo.

We drew in broad terms on the CEFR, but there is not a direct link between T1 and C1 in the CEFR.  There are a couple of other points, in addition to what Mr. &Oacute; Buachalla said, to be made in response to Deputy Moynihan's question around the overall purpose of the T1 specification.  Mr. &Oacute; Buachalla has outlined that language enrichment piece.  Another important point about the T1 specification is the contribution that learning through that specification can make to the young person's overall education right across the curriculum, because they are using the Irish language to access the full curriculum.  There are dividends and benefits to the student, beyond the Irish classroom.<\/p> <p>  The point I would make, in terms of the value or merit in taking the T1 specification, is the point mentioned earlier about further enabling these young people as active, engaged contributors in the Irish communities in which they live day-to-day, and as young citizens.  When you put all of that in the mix, together with the point Mr. Slattery was making, it is a different way of conceptualising the differences between the T1 and T2 specifications.<\/p> <p>  The T1 specification is about enabling the young person and providing him or her with a deeper, more engaging and richer experience of the Irish language.  In the case of the T2 specification, it is about building on and continuing the young person's language acquisition.  The two categories of young person are coming to these specifications from quite different places and positions in terms of their overall language learning.  That is important in terms of understanding the differences in what the specifications are attempting to do for young people as language learners and how those specifications will involve the young people in the language learning experiences that take place in the classroom, whether they are in a scoil T1 or a scoil T2.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SC12021070700002#H00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Arlene Forster"},{"type":"speech","time":1625612400,"counter":517,"content":"<p>An bhfuil an Teachta Moynihan cr&iacute;ochnaithe leis an &aacute;bhar sin?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SC12021070700002#H00700","speaker":"1485"},{"type":"speech","time":1625612400,"counter":518,"content":"<p>T&aacute; an freagra sin ag preabadh anonn is anall i mo cheann.

We advise on implementation issues which are directly related to the enactment of the curriculum in the classroom.  They would typically be supports with regard to guidance and support materials required for teachers, the nature and scale of continuing professional development and the lead-in for implementation of the curriculum; all focused on the implementation and enactment of the curriculum in the classroom.

We are hearing much of this in the consultation, in terms of the points everyone has mentioned around encouraging uptake, wider implementation and systemic issues.  We are hearing those.  We are taking note of them and we will analyse and report on those in the consultation report.  As Mr. Slattery said, our remit is specifically on the development of curriculum and assessment advice.  While that is the key focus of our consultation, we will be reporting on the wider feedback we are receiving.  That will be published early in 2022.<\/p> <p>  If the Department were to ask us to advise on something such as bonus points, we would approach that work in the same way in which we have approached the development of the draft specifications.  We would be drawing on research, consulting on it and, as Mr. Slattery has already mentioned, there is little research in the Irish context on the impact of the use of bonus points.  We only have it in the context of one subject.  If we were asked down the line to advise on it, we would have to put that course of action in place.  The council would deliberate on the matter if it were asked to advise on it, but we have not been asked.<\/p> <p>  In response to the wider point made about encouraging the uptake, the Gaeltacht policy references a number of possible measures or strategies that could be considered to encourage more young people to take up the T1 specification.  The Gaeltacht policy references the possibility of some scholarships based on particular achievement levels within the leaving certificate examination.  There is also reference to a number of places being kept on particular courses in higher education.  There are a number of measures already mentioned that could be looked at but it is not within the remit of the NCCA to adjudicate on those measures.<\/p><p>That decision will be taken by the Department of Education, not the NCCA, but we will be reporting on what we hear during the consultation on those wider matters.<\/p><p> I will go back to something I mentioned earlier because I think it is very relevant to this point.  At the June council meeting, the council discussed a second phase of consultation on the updated specifications, based on the work we would do on foot of the current consultation.  In that discussion, the council was very much of the view that if we were to go out to a second consultation on the updated specifications, it would be important to have clarity on the wider issues that have been raised here today and that are emerging during the consultation.

The purpose of our meeting is to engage with the chairperson designate of the Pensions Council, Ms Roma Burke, and the chairperson designate of the Citizens Information Board, Ms Catherine Heaney, in order to discuss their strategic priorities for their roles and their views on the challenges currently facing their organisations.  The Pensions Council was set up to advise the Minister for Social Protection on matters relating to policy on pensions.  It represents and protects the consumer interest and helps to ensure that the system has a far stronger consumer focus.  Among the significant work it is undertaking at present, the council is currently considering the gender pension gap in supplementary pensions and is working to identify practical solutions to this challenge.<\/p> <p>  As part of the committee's work programme, we recently made a submission to the Pensions Commission in which we made 18 recommendations on pension reform.  We look forward to meeting Ms Burke and the Minister, Deputy Heather Humphreys, to discuss the implementation status of those recommendations in the autumn session.  <\/p> <p>  The Citizens Information Board is the national agency responsible for supporting the provision of information, advice and advocacy on social services and for the provision of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS.  With the widespread issue of disinformation and misinformation and the ongoing pandemic, which has left many people in need of information from trusted sources, the role of the Citizens Information Board is crucial for citizens looking for a trusted and impartial source of information.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome Ms Burke and Ms Heaney to the meeting. <\/p> <p>  With regard to privilege, all witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  For witnesses attending remotely outside the precincts of Leinster House and its buildings, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses physically present do.  Caution should be exercised accordingly.  <\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. <\/p> <p>  I now call on Ms Burke to make her opening statement, followed by Ms Heaney.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021070700002#A00200","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625612400,"counter":657,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to meet it today.  As outlined, the Pensions Council was set up to advise the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection on matters relating to policy on pensions.  It was established under section 26B of the Pensions Act 1990 and held its first meeting in 2015.  It comprises ten members, made up of six lay members, three officials representing the Departments of Social Protection and Public Expenditure and Reform and the Central Bank, and the Pensions Regulator.  The lay members give of their time on a voluntary basis.  All members are enthusiastic, experienced, skilled and have a diverse, yet relevant, background in pensions, law, actuarial science, public administration, finance and pension scheme governance.<\/p> <p>  I was glad to be appointed as a member in 2015 through the public appointments process.  Led by the chairman, Mr. Jim Murray, we have worked hard and accomplished a lot since we were established.  By way of example, early on we shone a light on approved retirement funds and buy-out bond charges and highlighted the very complex manner in which charges are applied and the wide variety of charging rates.  We concluded that consumers can make significant savings if they shop around.<\/p> <p>   We have made numerous detailed submissions in response to relevant consultations held by the Central Bank, Pensions Authority and interdepartmental pensions reform and taxation group.  We have carried out work on auto enrolment and master trusts, considered gender pension issues and presented to a joint committee on pension matters.<\/p> <p>  As the pensions environment has evolved, so has the council.  While we advise the Minister at her request, we are also proactive.  We raise and investigate matters that we identify as important and draw them to the Minister&rsquo;s attention.  That is the particular benefit of the lay members.  They can bring insights to the council and Minister that may not otherwise be available to departmental officials.  <\/p> <p>  We have three important work streams under way.  First, we have commenced a research programme on the interaction of housing and pensions.  This will be important if home ownership is less typical at retirement than it is at the moment.  <\/p> <p>  Second, we are considering the gender pensions gap in supplementary pensions.  By supplementary pensions, I mean income in retirement over and above the State pension.  Our work with the ESRI so far has highlighted that there is a gender pension income gap of 35% and that only 28% of women have private or occupational retirement income compared to 55% of men.  We are keen to identify practical solutions to this challenge, and to this end the council recently undertook a public consultation on the topic.  I am looking forward to the council&rsquo;s deliberations on the suggestions received and the recommendations that will come out of it. <\/p> <p>  Third, based on our earlier work on charges, as well as learnings from the UK, we are also considering whether it would be worthwhile to introduce a cost transparency initiative for pension providers in Ireland and whether this could work on a voluntary or compulsory basis.  A simplified system of transparency could help to drive consumer and provider behaviour to the advantage of the consumer.  <\/p> <p>  A significant amount of work has been done by the council.  As the committee knows, there are several challenging, relevant and complex projects in progress.  Notwithstanding that, the pensions roadmap is at about the halfway point in terms of its timeline.  The committee will also be aware that substantial changes were made to the Pensions Act earlier this year as the EU IORP II pensions legislation was transposed.  I expect to see the pensions environment react to this legislative change.  There is likely to be consolidation of pension schemes and pension products.  Some will not survive, while other pension vehicles will play a more prominent role in the future.  This change will have a direct impact on consumers.  <\/p> <p>  Our current chairman, Mr. Jim Murray, has done an excellent job stewarding the council.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank him for his hard work and dedication over the past six years.<\/p><p>His previous experience as director of consumer affairs has certainly influenced the work of the council in a very positive manner.<\/p><p> The Minister has designated me as the next chairperson.  I am an actuary and partner with Lane Clark &amp;amp; Peacock, LCP, and I have more than 20 years&rsquo; experience in the pensions industry.  I currently lead LCP&rsquo;s governance practice in Ireland.  I was the chairperson of the pensions committee of the Society of Actuaries in Ireland from 2016 to 2018 and a member of the council of the society from 2016 to 2019.  In 2020, I co-authored a paper entitled Private Pension Tax Relief: A Paper on the Irish Pensions Taxation Landscape which was referenced in the report produced by the interdepartmental group on pensions reform and taxation.  I am a member of the Pensions Commission which was set up to examine sustainability and eligibility issues relating to the State pension.  I am an independent non-executive director of Dublin Simon Community and I was chair of its audit and risk committee from 2016 to 2020.<\/p><p> In my role as chair of the council, I intend to successfully conclude and report to the Minister on the current workstreams that are under way.  We will also undertake new projects on pensions matters that are important to the Minister, particularly the impact of the amended Pensions Act on the pensions environment.  Following in the footsteps of my predecessor, I hope to ensure that where change occurs, it will be to the benefit of consumers.  It is important to clarify that this ultimately means financial benefit through encouraging people to save more for retirement, lower costs, greater certainty of benefits at retirement or higher investment returns.  There is a significant amount of work for the council to do and, in my role as chairperson, I am looking forward to encouraging council members to raise issues, guiding the discussion, developing reports and, ultimately, influencing the pensions environment so that more people enjoy a decent standard of living in retirement.  I am happy to answer any questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021070700002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Roma Burke","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625612400,"counter":659,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Burke and invite Ms Heaney to make her opening presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021070700002#B00200","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625612400,"counter":660,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat.  Is pribhl&eacute;id dom a bheith os comhair an choiste inniu.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to present before it.<\/p> <p>  As members will be aware, the position of chairperson was advertised through the Public Appointments Service, PAS, process.  I was informed of my appointment by the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, in June.  I am honoured to have been selected and I pledge my utter commitment to the role for the next five years.<\/p> <p>  Ahead of making this presentation, I was advised to focus on two areas, namely, a run-through of my career background to date and an outline of some objectives for my term of office.  I am pleased to do so now, within the time available to me.<\/p> <p>  As regards my background, I have always been committed to a sense of social justice, public service and human rights.  This has underpinned my career choice and voluntary work to date.  After I graduated, I began my career on a community employment scheme with the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed.  In the role of press and information officer, I supported the development of the first edition of Welfare to Work, a guide that many members may use at constituency level.  That guide is now in its 27th edition and its publication continues to be supported by the Department of Social Protection.  I moved on to other press officer roles but my career shifted to a broader leadership role when I was appointed as chief executive of the Irish Family Planning Association.  A particular achievement of my tenure in office was the roll-out of the national non-directive pregnancy counselling service across the regions.  In the past 15 years, I moved on to build DHR Communications, a strategic communications practice.  The company works on public interest campaigns, with clients drawn from the public sector as well as community and voluntary sector organisations.  Last year, I took a step back in the business and appointed a replacement managing director.  In addition, I have undergone a process of devolving my shareholding to staff in the company.<\/p> <p>  Beyond my day jobs, I have always committed myself to voluntary and advocacy work.  I have served on the boards of the National Union of Journalists, Women&rsquo;s Aid, Connect Ethiopia, the Heritage Council and the Liberties Business Forum, which covers the area from which my business has operated.  In the past three years, I have chaired the corporate social responsibility, CSR, stakeholder forum at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and I have just completed a five-year term as chairperson of the National Museum of Ireland.  On invitation of the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin, I have agreed to serve a further two-year term in this role, ensuring continuity in board transition.<\/p> <p>  I have constantly invested in my personal education and learning.  I have undertaken post-graduate studies in criminology, employment law and strategic communications, as well as undertaking refresher courses in corporate governance on an ongoing basis.  I am currently completing an MPhil in public history, with my dissertation focusing on how the heritage of communities that have been engaged in turf cutting and peat extraction will be considered in the just transition.  I have noted the activity of Senator Murphy on this topic in recent Oireachtas committee debates. <\/p> <p>  It is my hope that I can bring the learnings from my career, as well as my lived experience, to the table when I commence in the role as chairperson of the Citizens Information Board.  However, I will be closely guided by the provisions set out in the mandating legislation of the Citizens Information Board, CIB, namely, the Comhairle Act 2000, the Citizens Information Act 2007 and the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2008.  I will also be guided by the code of practice for State boards and, importantly for me, I will turn to the public sector equality and human rights duty set out under the Human Rights and Equality Act 2014.<\/p> <p>  When applying for the role of chairperson of the Citizens Information Board, I focused significantly on its role as an information giver.  As a communications professional, I am acutely aware of the growing importance of trusted sources of information, as alluded to by the Chairman, particularly against a backdrop of growing disinformation and misinformation.  Members will be aware of the recently published Reuters Digital News Report which was supported by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.  The report demonstrates the growing public desire for trusted sources of information.  Although people continue to access social media in increased numbers, trust in these platforms is falling.  At global and domestic levels, people want news and information that is impartial and from trusted sources.  As members are aware, most people now use their smartphone to access information.  Members probably do likewise.  These insights probably come as no surprise, but they place an onus and pressure on organisations such as CIB and all its associated services to ensure it remains a trusted voice and continues to be agile in communicating in order that information gaps do not arise.  I am especially conscious of those who experience disadvantage and ensuring they are communicated with in formats that suit their needs.<\/p> <p>  During the pandemic, I was deeply impressed by how the CIB and all its services maintained and increased capacity.  The instigation of a call-back service, the introduction of a web-chat service for the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, and increased social media presence are among the initiatives undertaken to remain available to people while face-to-face appointments were restricted.  I was also pleased to learn that work was done by CIB to challenge disinformation, particularly as this related to Covid and the vaccine.  This agility took place during a concurrent shift and rise in public need for information, particularly as it relates to job and income loss.  I understand the organisation saw increased contact through the National Advocacy Service, particularly for people with disabilities who became more isolated during the pandemic.<\/p> <p>  As we start to envision a post-pandemic society, CIB emerges with an expectation of a return to in-person contact.  However, I anticipate the public will also require continued high levels of telephone and online services.  Furthermore, the pandemic aftermath will leave new scars of indebtedness and further effects of isolation of which I am sure all members are aware.  Finding the sweet spot will be a challenge for CIB.  All services require capacity and CIB is committed to ensuring consistency of service across the country.  However, continued support in the 2022 budget Vote will be critical to supporting the vital work that CIB does.<\/p> <p>  Beyond being an agile and responsive organisation, there are several immediate issues facing the board of CIB.  As I understand it, a periodic critical review of CIB by the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is set to commence shortly.  This will be an important and welcome opportunity to evaluate the efficiency, efficacy and accountability of CIB, especially in the context of its relationship with its parent Department.  I look forward to engaging in this process.<\/p><p>As members will likely be aware, periodic critical reviews are provided for under the code of practice, so it is a very welcome measure that is taking place.  Their purpose and remit are set out in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's guidelines for such reviews.  The results of the periodic critical review will be extremely timely and important in informing the development of a new strategic plan for the organisation.  The current strategy is due to expire at the end of this year.  Following the retirement of CIB's chief executive, Angela Black, a recruitment process for a new leader of the executive will commence shortly.  This is a very important task for the board that will involve a significant time investment.<\/p><p> In taking on these challenges, I intend to use the following weeks to become more fully briefed on all issues relating to the board of the CIB.  In addition to executive briefings, I also intend to make time to meet individually with board members, many of whom have given great service to the CIB and are highly experienced and committed people.  In particular, I note the commitment by Sean Sheridan, who has been acting chair in recent months.  He has been particularly welcoming and supportive of me and he has already briefed me on the role.<\/p><p> Furthermore, I am looking forward to meeting with officials from the Department of Social Protection next week.  As with other boards, I hope to demonstrate strategic leadership and to offer an approach that is both collaborative and effective.  I very much see the relationship between the board of a statutory organisation and that of the relevant joint Oireachtas committee as a two-way process.  I would be very pleased to provide regular briefings and to establish systems of information exchange with members that are appropriate and useful.  The committee can perhaps engage with me further in that regard.<\/p><p> In reporting to the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, it is my experience that she is extremely responsive and supportive and makes herself available in a timely way.  I know she has appeared frequently before the committee.  I look forward to working with her and her officials as I embark on this new role.  I again thank committee members for their time today.  I look forward to continued dialogue with them all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021070700002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Catherine Heaney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625612400,"counter":662,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Heaney and Ms Burke for their opening statements.

One issue in particular keeps surfacing.  I am from County Clare.  Correspondence has been received by this committee on numerous occasions and I received information myself on possible under-resourcing of the service in County Clare.  The service has been incorporated into a north Munster structure and it does not operate on an individual county basis.  I ask that she look at that issue as it is not going away.  County Clare deserves the same resources as any other county in the north Munster network of MABS.  Could Ms Heaney ensure the periodic review that is under way looks specifically at the resources and the footprint of MABS in County Clare in terms of the resource available to the public?  The resources dedicated to County Clare should be made available in line with other counties.

We are in a very different context today than we were 18 months ago in terms of Covid-19.  The dynamics of the delivery of services will be very different.  The Citizens Information Board is very upfront and visible.  Something that would be extremely useful would be to look at a one-stop-shop for the public.  All of us as public representatives use the CIB website on a daily basis.  It is a great resource for us all.<\/p> <p>  There are 130-odd Government agencies and bodies providing supports to small businesses across the country.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has established an SME small business tool website which lists the various supports and schemes available when one puts in one's business details.  It would be useful if something proactive could be done through the Citizens Information Board.  It would allow the information and services to be available to a far bigger cohort.  What I mean is that it would not just be limited to people who have the technology available to them but that public representatives or the local postmaster or postmistress could put in the data for an individual and tell them what schemes they would potentially be eligible for.  I would like the CIB to explore something like that, in particular in the context of Covid-19.<\/p> <p>  While I know the Pensions Council is not a customer-facing body, it has a consumer advocacy role.  Unique challenges have been brought about by Covid-19 and the change in the working environment with remote working and so forth.  There will be many more challenges and people could potentially slip through the cracks in terms of pensions or pension contributions.  The one that we see as public representatives on an ongoing basis is people in employment who are paying PRSI, who lose their job, possibly start a small business and do not continue to make voluntary contributions, which impacts on the State contributory pension down the road.  With Covid-19 a lot of people are reassessing how they are going to work and many more people are going to move into self-employment.  There are going to be challenges as a result of that.  In terms of Covid-19, the dynamic and change in society as a whole, how do the witnesses see their role in bringing their organisations around to addressing some of those challenges?  Perhaps Ms Burke could respond first, followed by Ms Heaney.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021070700002#C00600","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625612400,"counter":667,"content":"<p>That is a really good question.  There is no doubt the environment in which we have had to live over the past year or so has had an enormous impact on the way people go about their business and daily lives.  We have all learned an awful lot from it.<\/p><p>One thing I think people have learned - this has come through in some surveys - is that saving and putting away money for the longer term is important.  Where that money goes into retirement savings it is particularly important to help people understand what they are doing, making sure they make the right decisions for themselves and their families.  Pensions has a name to it that can be a little more intimidating for people than other investments and financial products.  Pensions are complicated.  One thing I have found over the years is that where you can help people understand and gain confidence in what they are doing, they take things on with both hands and are embracing of this.  A big item for me will be helping people to be more confident in their saving for later life, including through understanding the various tools and options available to them.  The Chairman mentioned that if you stop work and do something else, there is an opportunity to continue your PRSI contributions.  That is a very valuable part of the options available to us and should be encouraged.  There is also understanding how much you need to save for retirement, how you go about it, what options are available when you get to retirement and managing expectations.  I think a big part of our role will be to help consumers and people saving for retirement understand and be comfortable with that part of their financial planning journey towards retirement.  I think that will be a big focus.  This is not just technical stuff for technical people; we have to make it accessible to everybody.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021070700002#C00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Roma Burke","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625612400,"counter":669,"content":"<p>In many ways I regard the Citizens Information Board website as a key instrument with which to engage with the public and to help people such as the committee members to navigate social services and to provide coherent, trusted and clear public information.

We are still travelling through much change and do not know how the dust will settle but we have to be cognisant in looking at our future planning and how we respond to how society is interacting and how people get their information.  I would emphasise the importance of trust in everything we do to ensure we maintain that reputation and trust in order that people know where to turn to.  As a point of information, Citizens Information had about 15 million hits to its website in 2020, which shows that people are looking for information and turning to Citizens Information.  We have to make sure we do everything to be visible and available to all our publics, including people who, as was said, do not have immediate access to certain technologies, are not digitally literate or may not even have effective broadband technology to be able to take part in the likes of the chat function.

I wish them both all the very best as they set out in their new roles.  I am sure it is an exciting and very proud time for both of them, so I offer them my congratulations and best wishes.<\/p> <p>  I have just a couple of brief comments and questions about the work of the Pensions Council.  The point about the work it is now undertaking on transparency on fees and charges is really important because a lot of the time pensions is such a complex world and for an awful lot of people it is really important we have that transparency on fees and charges.  That will be particularly important as the new auto-enrolment system rolls out.  Ms Burke might be able to tell us about the level of engagement or work the Pensions Council has on auto-enrolment, whether it plays a role in any of that and what that will look like.  Auto-enrolment is really important because we know that so many people rely on the State pension and do not have the supplementary pension to allow them to enjoy a decent or basic standard of living in retirement.  I hope that when we see auto-enrolment set up it will be transparent, we will have the likes of an app on our mobile phones and we will be able to see what our contributions are coming to in a pension pot.  That is really encouraging for people.  You can be paying off bits and pieces through your wages, various taxes and everything else; you do not really know where they are going.  It is really important we can see where our pension contributions are going, see throughout our working life where we are with our pension pots and see the fees and charges we are paying.  All of that will play a role in encouraging people to set up their pensions for later life.<\/p> <p>  I note that Ms Burke is a member of the Pensions Commission.  If appropriate, she might tell us where the report the commission will bring forward is.  It was to be published at the end of June.  That has not happened.  That is fine, but is there any update on that?  It is a critical piece of work, as Ms Burke will know.<\/p> <p>  I thank Ms Heaney for her presentation.  I hope I am not repeating what has been said, but she mentioned, I think, something about a review of MABS, which is a really important service for people the length and breadth of the State.  Ms Heaney will know that when regionalisation was proposed, this committee in the previous D&aacute;il had brought in the CIB and members of MABS and did a report that recommended that that regionalisation not go ahead at that point.  It did go ahead, and it is really important that that be reviewed and that we see how that regionalisation has worked for the services on the ground because the work they do is so important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021070700002#D00300","speaker":"1604"},{"type":"speech","time":1625612400,"counter":671,"content":"<p>We will start with Ms Heaney on this occasion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021070700002#D00400","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625612400,"counter":672,"content":"<p>I will outline again that the periodic strategic review relates to the governance of CIB.  Any reorganisation process is a process rather than an end in itself.  Regarding the regional structures and how CIB is operating now, the changes, as I understand them, have been quite effective in helping to consolidate oversight.  One of the advantages, as I understand them, is how the organisation has been able to manage during Covid.  The ability to put in place new structures and services, particularly at the level of MABS, has been very effective.  The callback service, the chat service and those new functions have been much easier to roll out in an organisation led by 16 as opposed to 93 companies.  However, I would be interested to hear members' feedback on how the roll-out has been going.  We are embarking, as I said, on a new strategic plan.  As a publicly funded organisation, we have a duty to be accountable, to evaluate and to review, and that has to be part of our ongoing mandate as a board.  Once something happens, it is not the end of it.

Our role is an advisory one to the Minister.  Effectively, what that means at the day-to-day level is that where the Department of Social Protection is working on various projects such as auto-enrolment, the Pensions Council is called on to provide input, whether expert industry insights or just generally being practical about something.<\/p><p>There has been much discussion on various details of auto-enrolment and how it might work in practice.  It is absolutely right that one of the key things is not just putting the whole mechanism and machine into operation.  It is getting people to understand what is going on and take an interest in it and feel it is something worthwhile to do.  Being in a scheme like this is very worthwhile.  People benefit from it.  They benefit from employer contributions and a State contribution.  There are various ways of disclosing information to people.  There is disclosing it and there is making it engaging.  At present, while a lot of information is available to people saving for retirement it is effective to a certain extent.  Where people get a statement on an annual basis and charges are expressed in terms of a percentage a couple of pages into a document, it is not particularly conducive to getting a handle on what is going on and understanding how it will impact retirement goals.  The other side of this is using tools such as apps and the Internet, and using clever people such as those we have in this call today who are good at communications, to make this connection with individuals.<\/p><p> Something coming out of the IORP II directive is that until now pension benefit statements used to have to be issued on a paper basis.  People got a piece of paper in the post.  From now on this can be done electronically.  Email addresses and other ways to communicate with people saving for retirement give opportunities to undertake other initiatives to get the message across effectively to people.  This is something that should certainly be encouraged.  It is a very cost efficient way of communicating with people.  If the State is putting the effort into helping people save for retirement it should want to put in something people are proud of and think is good to do.  This is something that will feature.  It has been raised at our discussions in council meetings.  It is not just about providing information.  It is making it engaging to the people who are using a system such as auto-enrolment and other retirement savings vehicles.<\/p><p> A question was asked about the commission.  I am a member of the commission and today I am here in my role as a member of the Pensions Council.  The commission has done its work in line with its terms of reference.  The report is due to be issued to the Minister, it is almost there.  When she gets it I am sure she will have some thoughts on it and we will share it with everybody else.  An awful lot of work has been done by the commission and I am very glad to be a member of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021070700002#D00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Roma Burke","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625612400,"counter":675,"content":"<p>I have been very impressed by the two presentations from Ms Burke and Ms Heaney.  I missed part of Ms Burke's presentation because I had to rush out for a few moments.  I endorse the comments made by the Chair and Deputy Kerrane on pensions.  I will not repeat all of them.  An existing problem I find is where one of two partners who are both on pensions dies, the income reduces from almost &euro;500 to &euro;250 but the same electricity bill has to be paid as do all of the other bills such as refuse.  The bill for food does not change much really because the consumption of food by older people is lower.  This is a huge area.  I get up to half a dozen representations a year, which is significant, from people who all of a sudden find their income has been cut by half and they have no reserves.  They find themselves in real difficulty.  It is a very sad situation.  Even though these people have wonderful families and wonderful sons, daughters and grandchildren who would help, in their pride they do not want to ask their children or grandchildren.  This is a very important issue.  I know it will be taken up with regard to getting the message across to people to put in place extra savings or pension for such an eventuality.  I would like to hear the comments of both witnesses on this.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Kerrane referred to the deficit in Ireland regarding explaining the importance of preparing for pension time.  Admittedly, people, including me, are careless for years about it because it does not bother us.  We find at some stages in our life that we cannot afford it and it is not a priority.  It has already been said this morning, and all of my Oireachtas colleagues know it, that when people come to us with a pension issue they want to hand us the paperwork and ask us to deal with it.  They do not want to deal with it.  This is not a criticism of people.  As has been said, many people do not understand the structure of pensions.  Is there any way we can simplify it to brass tacks so it would be easier to explain to people?  The letter from the Department can be rambling.  Sometimes it decides not to send out a letter but to make a phone call.  I have to say I find the Department and the Minister very helpful but rambling letters do not make sense to people and frustrate them more.  Simplifying it would be very important.<\/p> <p>  Would Ms Burke be willing to make presentations to local authority members?  They make representations to me on pensions.  I am thinking about how to get the message out.  Would this be something worth examining?

Would it be an idea that she could make a short presentation to local authority members?<\/p> <p>  I thank the witnesses.  Listening to the paths as to how they got here is very enlightening.  We have two excellent people in the positions and I mean this sincerely.  I thank Ms Heaney for her observations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021070700002#E00200","speaker":"1674"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625612400,"counter":676,"content":"<p>The Senator has raised very interesting questions.  It is not something that comes up a lot but it can be a shock to people when one partner in a relationship passes away and all of a sudden people are not just dealing with the loss of somebody close to them but also a change to their financial circumstances.  When we think about it, pensions are made up of a number of pillars.  I called them three legs of a stool.  One leg of the stool is the State pension, the second leg is a workplace pension arrangement that provides income in retirement and the third leg is saving extra on a voluntary basis.  This becomes more important to people the closer they get to retirement.<\/p> <p>  Starting with the first leg of the stool, when one person passes away there is a living alone allowance that kicks in.  Just like the comment on continuing PRSI contributions if working arrangements have changed, it is key that people understand their rights and entitlements in the event of a change to their family circumstances.  One way to deal with this is to ensure people know what they can apply for in the event their financial situation has changed.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the second leg of the stool, which are occupational pensions, there are two types of pensions.  There is the defined benefit pension where people get their pension based on their salary and service.  There is also the defined contribution pension where people save a pot.  The defined benefit pension is good to the extent that once it comes into payment it is guaranteed for life.  It is very predictable.  It generally has a survivor's pension attached to it.  If the person who earned the pension passes away there can be a benefit to the spouse, which is typically 50%.  There is a drop and I will come to this.  On the other side of the equation, the other workplace pension is the defined contribution pension.  In this situation people build up a pot of money to the point of retirement.<\/p><p>When one reaches retirement, one can choose to secure an annuity, that is, a pension with an insurance company, or to secure an approved retirement fund.  The latter is simply a post-retirement account from which one draws down money when one needs it.  The good thing about an approved retirement fund is that the pot of money stays there regardless of whether one person has died.  That is a plus on that side.  The negative side is that if one is drawing money from a pot, there is a risk of running out of money.  There are pros and cons.  This is what makes pensions complicated.  These are big decisions relating to big pots of money after one has worked a full working lifetime.  If people are concerned about their financial situation after retirement, there are ways to address that issue.<\/p><p> The third leg of the stool is encouraging people to put more money aside.  That is done through pension campaigns.  Several years ago, there was a pensions week but that is less prevalent now, although there are other measures.  A campaign such as that to encourage people to save into a very long-term rainy day fund to ensure they are self-sufficient would be of benefit.  The Senator mentioned that many people are too proud to approach their sons or daughters for financial help.  If one can start early and make provision for oneself, one will have the confidence that one will not need to approach one's sons or daughters.  The third leg is about being proactive and saving money.  The State provides very valuable tax incentives to do so.  It is very worthwhile.  There is significant encouragement to put money away.<\/p><p> The Senator referred to presentations to local authorities.  One of the positive things to come from Covid is the increase in virtual online communication.  One no longer has to physically attend meetings.  Part of my day job involves meeting groups of employees who are members of pension plans to explain what they should be doing, why it is important, the tax reliefs available and so on.  In a single day, I was able to give presentations to almost 500 people through a series of sessions.  The new online environment means we can do that with local authorities or any other organisation.  Where we can help to facilitate that, we would be more than happy to speak to the CIB if it needs any sort of expert input in that regard.  It is not really a big deal to do so now because we are all able to use these tools to communicate with each other.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021070700002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Roma Burke","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625612400,"counter":678,"content":"<p>I do not have very much to say on the whole area of pensions because, obviously, it is Ms Burke's area of expertise.

I am very conscious of the fact that many people who access, in particular, MABS, the Abhaile service and our advocacy services are often income disadvantaged.

A way of simplifying that and communicating it to the public would be worthwhile.  Many people believe it is just a tax that disappears because they do not necessarily understand the social insurance aspect and their rights and entitlements in that regard.  That is the case in respect of ongoing entitlements and pensions.  <\/p> <p>   My next question is specifically for Ms Burke.  We know the pandemic affected incomes in two ways.  Some people ended up significantly worse off as a result of the pandemic but a large cohort ended up significantly better off because their work continued and their outgoings lessened.  In the context of what has been described in some quarters as a savings war, should people be encouraged to put some of those savings aside?  I have a nagging concern that there may be a temptation to just unleash those savings on the economy for some sort of economic bounce through a significant jump in consumption when there may be an opportunity to take a longer-term view in the context of those savings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021070700002#F00600","speaker":"1617"},{"type":"speech","time":1625612400,"counter":683,"content":"<p>I invite Ms Heaney to respond first, to be followed by Ms Burke, to whom the bulk of the questions were directed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021070700002#F00700","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625612400,"counter":684,"content":"<p>The Deputy's question is very focused around pensions but to pick up on the point in respect of PRSI contributions and the public understanding thereof, CIB provides a comprehensive and clear breakdown of what comprises one's PRSI contributions and the benefits available as a result.

I have noted his comments in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021070700002#F00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Catherine Heaney"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625612400,"counter":685,"content":"<p>As regards the question on PRSI, that probably falls more under the remit of the Pensions Commission and the Pensions Council but it is certainly an issue of which I am aware through my role on the commission.  It is valid to observe that people wish to know how the contributions they are making are being allocated.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the different ways in which people's financial situations have changed due to the impact of the pandemic.<\/p><p>There was a report in the newspapers a couple of days ago that was carried out to ask financial advisers if people were saving more for retirement or if things were continuing as is.  I do not know how scientific or otherwise it was but the findings of the report were that people were putting more aside and that they were, in some cases, putting it into pension savings.  Is there an opportunity to encourage people to save for retirement, given they might have a bit more cash because they have not been out spending it?  There definitely is.  Think back to the special saving incentive accounts, SSIAs.  If pensions are complicated, the SSIAs seemed to be very easy to understand.  People really got it.  I loved the way in which Irish people understood it, embraced it and took advantage of a very innovative initiative at the time.  Particularly in the context of auto-enrolment, AE, if the message can be delivered in a way which is similar to the SSIA, though obviously this is on a much longer term, and if people can understand the benefit to themselves and their families in a simple, easy-to-understand manner then they will take action and save.<\/p><p> The second element is the hurdle of getting people to save in the first instance.  It is sometimes easier to save if you are already in a pension scheme and if you can increase your pension saving simply by emailing the HR department.  If is more difficult if that initial step has not been overcome.  If a person is not saving at the moment it seems to be quite a big hurdle for them to actually work out how to save for retirement and how does this whole thing start off.  That is where some more time and effort could probably be spent on making that bit of the pensions journey easier.  The hardest bit is getting going.  I certainly take on board the Deputy's comments and we might have a think about how to do that.  Perhaps it has not been considered as much as other areas have been, once you are on your journey towards retirement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021070700002#F00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Roma Burke","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625612400,"counter":687,"content":"<p>I too want to be associated with everything that was said about Ms Heaney's and Ms Burke's presentations.  They were very informative.  I have a couple of questions.  I was particularly struck by the gender imbalance Ms Burke mentioned in her presentation.  The figure she gave was 28% of women versus 55% of men.  What can we as a committee do to address that imbalance and indeed what is the Pensions Council doing to address it?  It is very important for the Oireachtas to address this.  Ms Burke might just come back to us on those figures again because they are a worry and were very striking in her opening presentation.<\/p> <p>  Turning to Ms Heaney, I want to be associated with the Chairman's comments.  The Citizens Information Board is a daily tool for every public representative in this country.  Without it we would all be lost.  There is not a day goes by when I do not refer to the board's website.  I have a couple of questions around that.  How has social media affected that?  I know the board is on Twitter and Facebook.  Yesterday I was looking at one of its presentations on social media on derelict houses.  There seemed to be a lot of interaction with people through social media.  Is that changing the focus of the board?  As I said it is a huge resource for us but has social media changed the way the board is interacting with the public?  On the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, which does terrific work throughout the country, there was an issue with waiting times for it over the last number of years.  Will Ms Heaney comment on that?  They differ across the country but the terrific services MABS offers should be availed of by as many people as possible as quickly as possible.  It is a most difficult time for people as well.  Are those waiting times coming down?  Have they been affected by Covid?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021070700002#G00200","speaker":"1684"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625612400,"counter":688,"content":"<p>Ensuring women are saving for retirement is something that is very close to my heart.  Going back to the previous question and the comment I made, the act of starting to save for retirement at the outset is key and auto-enrolment is helping to address that.  It helps because a person is brought into a pension system, he or she is set up for saving and must elect to step out of that system.  It is the principle of inertia that people tend to stay in something.  Saving for retirement is important and by making it as easy as possible it encourages more people to save.  Auto-enrolment also has a role in encouraging more women to save for retirement.  Men and women sometimes have different priorities and are focusing on different things.  It is a fact of life that women do not have as much retirement savings as men.  Where they are automatically enrolled into this new system, it will encourage them to start saving.  I wish I had done the numbers on it but there is a really big impact to saving a little over a long time and not trying to do the whole lot in the last run up to retirement.  It is about small, steady saving from the day a person leaves school or college and is in his or her first job.  It is about building that over time and that is what auto-enrolment does.  The Citizen's Assembly said auto-enrolment should be gender-proofed.  Women are sometimes in a lower salary bracket than men.  There is a lower limit that on the level of salary a person is automatically enrolled into the system on.  If that salary level is brought down it means more women are brought into the net.  That is one thing we have discussed at council meetings, that is to say, if the salary threshold for joining the AE system is moved up or down it will impact on gender balance.  We have brought that to the Department officials and they are considering that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021070700002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Roma Burke"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625612400,"counter":689,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Wall for his comments.  There are a couple of questions here.  On the one about social media, it has certainly become a bigger agent of communication for the board, particularly over the pandemic.  It is something we all must be cognisant of because there is a whole generation which does not consume information the way we all do.  Thankfully, there has been growth in the number of people going back to trusted sources of news, such as broadcast news media, for instance.  At the same time, the huge growth and the huge interaction is on social media.  It is an area where CIB has invested more time and resources, particularly during the pandemic.  That presents challenges in itself because as I said in my presentation, while people are using social media more they trust it less.  Thus it is really important for us as an organisation to consider that when we are putting out information on social media we are also dealing with misinformation and disinformation on social media.  That whole job is becoming bigger and is something we will have to look at resourcing and developing, so I am glad the Senator raised it.  It also points to something the Cathaoirleach said on the notion of a one-stop shop and ensuring we are accessible to everybody.  As I understand it, CIB ran a pilot last year on an app for people with disabilities and that has been a great success.  If pilots are a great success then we must mainstream them and ensure we continue with them.  The ways we communicate and the platforms we communicate on will have to extend.  We must also ensure people who need face-to-face are getting face-to-face.<\/p> <p>  On the question about waiting times, I do not have detail to hand on that.<\/p><p>There are a couple of issues worth bringing to the committee's attention.  One of the experiences of CIB during the pandemic was that volunteers, on whom we heavily rely, were not in a position to provide services.  We are yet to see how things will pan out with the return of volunteers to local services and how they can support them.  That is one thing that may impact on our service and we have to ensure that we have consistency of services and that there is no rolling back.  Now there are additional platforms that we have to be available on.  I already pointed to one innovation, the web chat service.  I would be interested to know if it has been effective in dealing with people's queries because there is a whole generation which does not like speaking to people in person or even on the phone.  It is about making sure that we are available to people in all formats.  I am conscious that increased availability online and with the call-back service may be able to impact on any potential waiting times.  <\/p><p> As members will be aware, CIB did make submissions to the Oireachtas during the pandemic.  One issue, to which Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh already alluded, is that some people suffered greatly in their financial means, including people already on social welfare because the payment pattern changed.  That affected budgeting and maintaining basic quality of life at home.  As my submission mentioned, as we move out of the pandemic there may be legacy issues around indebtedness.  That is something we are very conscious of and we keep a close eye on.  Early intervention is the best intervention, a bit like Ms Burke's policy on the pensions, the earlier that you start the better.  In money management, the earlier someone gets to grips with their financial situation the more manageable it is in the longer term.  I will return to the committee on waiting times.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021070700002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Catherine Heaney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625612400,"counter":691,"content":"<p>I congratulate Ms Heaney and Ms Burke on their presentations and wish them the best in the future.<\/p> <p>  I think the Chair asked about class K PRSI earlier.  There are no great benefits for people paying the class K contribution.  I would ask Ms Burke to look into the class K contributions and benefits.  Take an Oireachtas Member who loses their seat, perhaps after two or three years service, their contributions for pension purposes is broken.  The class K they paid on their D&aacute;il or Seanad salary does not qualify them for anything.  They cannot even sign for credits afterwards.  It is an area that should be looked into.<\/p> <p>  The other issue around PRSI contributions relates to those who continue to work over the pension age of 66 years or whatever it is or will be.  They still pay PRSI on pension charges if they continue to work over the age of pension.  I would like some clarity on that.  It might be something Ms Burke can look into.

It is probably worth reminding the committee that the focus of the Pensions Council work is the Pensions Act.  That is in the realm of supplementary pensions, namely, saving for retirement through an occupational arrangement or personal retirement savings account, PRSA.  PRSI is important.  It provides a person with a range of benefits both while working and after retirement age when they becomes eligible for a State pension.  It is not directly related to the council's work but there are certainly valid comments coming out of today's discussion.  I will relay the Senator's comments to the Department and make sure that he gets a comprehensive response on the status of both PRSI class K and the status of PRSI after 65 years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021070700002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Roma Burke"},{"type":"speech","time":1625612400,"counter":694,"content":"<p>I thank both witnesses.  I ask Ms Burke to bring one thought back to the Pension Council for its deliberations.  During the term of the last D&aacute;il I was directly involved in the fossil fuel divestment legislation that was brought through the Houses in terms of the State divesting from investment funds that were involved in companies that were focused on fossil fuels.  There needs to be far more engagement with the public and pension funds about divestment in fossil fuels.  As we all know, money makes the world go around and pension fund money makes the world go around.  It has a big role to play in how investments are focused on an international level.  It is important that pension funds and contributors to pension funds become far more conscious of the detrimental impact to our environment of particular investment approaches that are not just about the short-term financial return but also the long-term impact on our climate and future generations.  I would like Ms Burke to take that back with her.<\/p><p>Finally, both witnesses are women taking over pretty significant roles in public bodies.  Both have a very important role to play in encouraging more female participation on State boards.  The existing rules state that 40% is the target for gender balance on State boards.  When I was Minister, trying to make appointments to State boards, my biggest difficulty was the lack of applications being submitted by women in the first instance.  I openly put this challenge out.  Hopefully some of my successors in the current or future Cabinets will be left in the position where they are forced to appoint a man to a State board to bring about that 40% threshold.  That should be our objective.  There is an important role that both of our witnesses can play in encouraging more women to apply for State boards and to go on them.  I would call on the public and my colleagues to actively encourage women to register with <i>stateboards.ie<\/i>.  The numbers are quite small and the more women who apply provides far greater opportunities for every woman to actively participate in State boards and bring about what is a very important balance on boards that helps break down the group think that sadly, in no small way, led to the economic recession we saw in the decades past.  I hope the witnesses will take that away with them today.  <\/p><p>I would also like them to consider the now stated Government policy that by the end of 2021, 20% of staff in the public sector and public bodies will be working remotely, whether from home, a hot-desking facility or a blended form of working.  I hope that as chairs of their respective committees, they will actively encourage and help to achieve those targets within their own bodies but also more generally across the public and private sectors.  I sincerely thank both Ms Heaney and Ms Burke for putting their names forward for these particular roles.<\/p><p>They are eminently qualified for both roles and will bring a huge amount of expertise and knowledge to the boards of both organisations.  I hope that you will be hugely successful in your endeavours over the coming years.  Thank you most sincerely for giving your time and providing your expertise to public bodies, which are ultimately about delivering for each and every citizen across this State.<\/p><p> We have finished with questioning, so I again thank Ms Burke and Ms Heaney for attending today, and for their constructive engagement with the committee.

As the witnesses are aware, the committee may publish the opening statements on its website following the meeting.<\/p> <p>  Before I invite the witnesses to make their opening statements, which are limited to three minutes for each organisation or witness attending, I wish to advise them of the following in relation to parliamentary privilege.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  As the witnesses are attending remotely from outside the Leinster House campus, I ask them to note that there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does.  Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside of the State are advised that they should also be mindful of their domestic law and how it may apply to the evidence they give.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the place which Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House or the Convention Centre Dublin or both, in order to participate in the public meeting.  I will not permit a member to attend if he or she is not adhering to the constitutional requirements.  Therefore, any member who attempts to attend from outside the parliamentary precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  I also ask members to identify themselves when contributing for the benefit of the Debates Office staff who are preparing the Official Report.  Microphones must be muted when not contributing to reduce background noise and feedback.  I ask members and witnesses to use the raise-your-hand function on their screen if they want to contribute.  I remind those participating in the meeting to ensure their mobile telephones are on silent mode or switched off.<\/p> <p>  That concludes the housekeeping.  I hope it is clear.

My background is set out in full in my written submission of 19 March 2021.  The evidence I am giving today is simply as an independent legal practitioner, not on behalf of the Law Library or Alternative Operators in the Communications Market, ALTO, which is a telecoms group that I chair.  I was privileged to have been appointed to the internet advisory board, the Internet Safety Advisory Council, ISAC, which now operates as the National Advisory Council for Online Safety, NACOS.  Many members of the committee will be aware of the child safety and online advisory role that NACOS undertakes under the auspices of the office for Internet safety, which had resided previously within the Department of Justice but is now part of the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.<\/p> <p>  Members will have seen my written submission of 19 March 2021, which I was invited to put in.  I took a very legalistic approach in relation to my submission, as members will have seen, suggesting that we should get on with the business of the audiovisual media services directive, AVMSD, and perhaps forget or park aspects of the online safety and media regulation, OSMR, national legislation until such time as the European law in respect of the Digital Services Act and the Digital Markets Act is concluded.  I have moved away from that, having followed the business of the committee in the last number of weeks.  I have been paying attention to the submissions being made by various parties.  I understand the position that the committee is now in and fully appreciate that.  <\/p> <p>  In my opening statement, which is a separate document, I have set out five key points on which I want to give evidence today.  Hopefully, I can get through them in the next two minutes.  The first is the issue of the forthcoming European law and making sure that the committee, which I know it is, is fully mindful of the flight path and dual track that is happening in respect of amendments to the area of online safety and the general e-commerce amendments which are planned centrally in Europe.  That legislation is coming at us like a train.  In terms of the OSMR and the pre-legislative scrutiny, we must bear in mind that some unpicking may have to happen if we go ahead and legislate for many of the developments within the heads at this stage.  There are some examples but I do not intend to go into them at this particular time.  The second point is that I welcome the establishment of a new media commission.  It is quite clear that it needs to happen.  We do not need to spend more time on that. <\/p> <p>  The issue of online safety is a massive one for everybody on the committee and every individual living in Ireland but it is something that has effectively been subject to self-regulation for quite a number of years.  That is no longer adequate, given the nature of the environment we operate in, the pervasive nature of the Internet and our duty and responsibility as legislators, lawyers and so on.  From that point of view, I have to also welcome - and I do so quite clearly - the initiatives and the basis of the legislation, as drafted.  I wish to highlight a point which I know Senator Malcolm Byrne and others on the committee have raised before, namely, the issue of civil versus criminal law regulation on how that interworks and operates.  It is obviously a very serious point.  Members will see, in my opening statement, that I make the delineation between a civil matter as something that you report to the Garda versus what we can do in terms of regulation and making sure that complaints are properly handled and dealt with.  <\/p> <p>  Finally, the committee administrators asked me to deal with the issue of levies.  I have done that by comparison to the ComReg telecoms levy.  It may not be that the ComReg telecoms levy is an appropriate model, but I have set it out so members can at least deliberate on it.  I have concluded, in my opening statement, that it is really a matter for the new media commission to consult upon how levies will operate in the future.<\/p><p>That is the sensible approach to take at this point.  Those are the five areas I have prepared.  The committee will have seen in my opening statement that I have carefully considered the evidence of Dr. T.J. McIntyre of Digital Rights Ireland and Professor Conor O&rsquo;Mahony to the committee along with their written submissions.  I would associate myself with everything they have submitted and filed in written form.  That is it for me.  I will happily address any questions, queries or comments the committee has afterwards.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021070700002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ronan Lupton","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625612400,"counter":705,"content":"<p>I now call on Ms Fitzpatrick to address the committee on behalf of Technology Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021070700002#B00200","speaker":"1545"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625612400,"counter":706,"content":"<p>I thank members of the committee for inviting Technology Ireland to participate in these hearings as it conducts its pre-legislative scrutiny of the online safety and media regulation Bill.  Technology Ireland is an association within IBEC that represents the ICT, digital and software technology sector.  Technology Ireland is a member of the National Advisory Council for Online Safety since its establishment in 2018 and continues to participate in and support the council.  Technology Ireland has consistently expressed support for the overall goals of the proposed online safety and media regulation Bill, which should provide for a systemic approach in regulating online platforms and digital services.<\/p> <p>  I will not cover the full extent of the Technology Ireland submission to this committee in the three minutes available to me today.  I will instead focus on four key points.  First, this Bill seeks to transpose the EU audiovisual media services directive into Irish law.  This important legislation governs EU-wide co-ordination of national legislation on all audiovisual media and further enshrines the country of origin principle, which is of particular importance to Ireland given the number of video-sharing platforms established in the State.  Since the deadline for the transposition of the audiovisual media services directive into national law has already passed, Technology Ireland members encourage the swift adoption of this Bill to ensure legal certainty in the regulation of video-sharing platforms across the EU.<\/p> <p>  The second key point concerns the media commission and the establishment and appointment of the regulator.  The rapid establishment of a fully resourced and staffed regulator is of crucial importance.  It is essential that the commission is staffed with sufficient in-house expertise to negate the need for external consultants, which may result in a process of uneven and inconsistent decision making.  In our submission, we call for the rapid establishment of an online safety commissioner and the prioritisation of existing EU online safety law.<\/p> <p>  The third key point concerns sanctions for non-compliance and senior management liability.  Technology Ireland members believe that administrative financial sanctions should be limited to the most serious, repeated and systemic cases to ensure that systemic failures are penalised rather than isolated individual ones.  Technology Ireland believes that the inclusion of senior management liability could have a detrimental effect on prospective investment into Ireland.  Such clauses are also unlikely to be practical in terms of proof of liability and as such could undermine the credibility of the Act.  Inclusion of senior management liability could also create an international precedent, which could be utilised by more oppressive regimes seeking to pressure management of media outlets without the checks and balances present in Irish law.<\/p> <p>  My fourth and final point is on the designation of relevant online services.  Technology Ireland supports the two-step process by which a targeted list of in-scope services is set out in primary legislation.  The regulator has a duty to designate individual services or categories of service for statutory regulation based on an objective and evidence-based assessment of risk to Irish consumers and in consultation with the service provider.  This will ensure that providers have maximum certainty as to which services are in scope and the regulator focuses its resources where the public interest and risk is greatest.  To conclude, I reiterate that Technology Ireland is strongly supportive of the overall objectives of the online safety and media regulation Bill and I look forward to today&rsquo;s engagement and responding to members' questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021070700002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Una Fitzpatrick"},{"type":"speech","time":1625612400,"counter":707,"content":"<p>I now invite Dr. Pierre Fran&ccedil;ois Docquir, who I understand is joining us all the way from the UK, to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021070700002#B00400","speaker":"1545"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625612400,"counter":708,"content":"<p>I am actually joining the meeting from Lisbon, Portugal.  I thank members for the opportunity to speak before the joint committee.  Article 19 is a global freedom of expression non-governmental organisation.  We work for a world where all people everywhere can freely express themselves and actively engage in public life without fear of discrimination.  <\/p> <p>  Article 19 acknowledges that part of the content that circulates on social media platforms can contribute to undermining safety and civility and we also acknowledge that preventing social harms linked to the circulation of online content is a worthy objective.  It is a very difficult issue, however, especially with categories of speech that are, as the expression goes, \"lawful but harmful\".  As our colleagues from the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, have developed in their submission to this committee, definitions of categories of \"harmful content\" are highly problematic from the perspective of freedom of expression.  Dealing with each category of social harms is a complex matter that requires many different perspectives and different forms of expertise.  It cannot be expected that social media companies would take the place of therapists, social workers, researchers, media literacy experts and others.<\/p> <p>  We believe that bringing together the different stakeholders concerned with content moderation in a transparent and participatory forum could provide an effective approach to the external oversight of social media platforms.  Such a mechanism could ensure both the protection of fundamental rights and the effective regulation of problematic content.  This is why, as part of Article 19&rsquo;s efforts to promote freedom of expression online, we have developed the idea of a social media council, which is a model for a multi-stakeholder mechanism of voluntary compliance that will oversee content moderation practices on social media platforms on the basis of international standards on freedom of expression and other fundamental rights.  The social media council would have the power to review individual content moderation decisions and to elaborate general recommendations for social media platforms.<\/p> <p>  During our discussions on the social media council model, one of the concerns that emerged as particularly important is that the oversight of content moderation practices should be well informed of the linguistic, political, historical, cultural and social dimensions of the context of a content moderation dispute.  This is why Article 19 considers that, where possible, social media councils should be created at the national level.  We have submitted the idea to a broad range of stakeholders in Ireland and on the basis of the interest of the majority of the people with whom we spoke, we have initiated a process that could lead to the creation of the first social media council.  I want to make it very clear that Article 19 proposes to facilitate a process and does not plan to operate or control the Irish social media council.<\/p> <p>  We believe that the social media council could work well to complement a future public regulatory authority.  In our written submission, we made suggestions for how the social media council could fit within the future legal and regulatory framework for social media platforms in Ireland.  I am very happy to respond to any questions members may have.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021070700002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Pierre Fran&ccedil;ois Docquir"},{"type":"speech","time":1625612400,"counter":709,"content":"<p>I thank all the witnesses for their very interesting and insightful contributions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021070700002#B00600","speaker":"1545"},{"type":"speech","time":1625612400,"counter":710,"content":"<p>I thank all our witnesses not just for their presentations but for their submissions, which have been highly informative.

He gave me the elephant trap question how to define harm, and I appreciate that greatly.  The situation is extraordinarily complex and if we borrow from the UK jurisdiction in terms of the efforts to define precisely what harm is, we will end up spending a serious degree of time, work and effort to try to find that definition.<\/p> <p>  From my point of view, there are two fundamental aspects we as a society and as legislators need to think about.  The first is harm that is purely of a criminal nature, and we must ensure the Statute Book is tooled up and equipped to deal with criminally harmful content.  Online-offline dynamics, which under the heads of Bill comprise the dissemination of information, intimidation, threatening, humiliating, persecuting and those types of behaviour, have been called out in various witness evidence as being somewhat vague.<\/p> <p>  The difficulty is that those definitions can be brought to the nth degree and it will take years trying to codify them and to set down what they are and need to be.  It is a very difficult question to answer with any surety, but on one side - the important side - it is only when the code of conduct on criminal behaviour is dealt with properly on the Statute Book that it will become slightly easier to legislate for the civil harms and to give the job of regulation to a regulator, whether that is a digital safety commissioner under the new commission or otherwise, and we are not there yet.<\/p> <p>  As I mentioned earlier, while we are lucky to have Coco's Law passed and on the Statute Book, we are deficient in Garda training, for example, and in having the powers on the Statute Book necessarily to prosecute the egregious criminal harm that is going on.  We have then to look at what the civil side is and how to get there.   The efforts in the Bill are a starting point but the committee's deliberations will have to come to a certain point and members will have to try to draw a line under where the Bill can go.

The Facebook oversight board is the only mechanism today that exercises external oversight of a social media company.

The oversight board is for Facebook only, whereas the social media council, SMC, would be an industry-wide mechanism.  The oversight board applies Facebook's community standards and we propose that the social media council should work on the basis of international standards regarding freedom of expression.  Finally, the oversight board is a global mechanism of 20 people who are supposed to take care of the entire planet, or almost that, given that that is the size of Facebook, to a degree.  By contrast, the social media council in Ireland would be for Irish cases only and would be operated by people who speak the language and know the context very well.

I thank the Deputy for the questions.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the appointment mechanism, the social media council is a multi-stakeholder mechanism.  We suggest that the different categories of stakeholders, by which we mean social media platforms, media companies, the advertising industry, academia and civil society organisations representing the diversity of society, should appoint one member each or two members for some of these categories.  This is detailed in our written submission.  In addition, then, a number of independent directors and members would be chosen by the first set of directors.  This is from conversations we have had so far with our interlocutors in Ireland.  This seems to be a governance structure that makes sense for the people with whom we have been speaking.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the role of the social media council for the appeals mechanism and how it would impact content moderation decisions, we suggest there should first be an attempt to deal with the problem internally with the company whose platform is concerned with the content moderation dispute and then the case, if not solved internally, could be brought to the social media council.<\/p> <p>  The social media council would have the capacity to choose the cases it wants to focus on to avoid being drowned in too many cases.  On the other hand, however, every person should also have the possibility to send their requests.  A filtering mechanism will, therefore, be fine-tuned in the constitution of the social media council.<\/p> <p>  The decisions of the council will not be based on companies' terms of service or community standards.  They will be based on international standards on human rights, which is where the protection of freedom of expression and other fundamental rights come into play.  The decisions of the social media council would be binding for the companies within the framework of a voluntary compliance mechanism, of course.  Nonetheless, companies that take part in the mechanism would commit to executing the decisions of the social media council.  That is how we suggest things could work and then reach a result that would combine the protection of fundamental rights with an effective regulation of problematic content.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021070700002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Pierre Fran&ccedil;ois Docquir"},{"type":"speech","time":1625612400,"counter":721,"content":"<p>Finally, I call Mr. Lupton.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021070700002#D00400","speaker":"1545"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625612400,"counter":722,"content":"<p>In terms of the Digital Services Act and the Digital Markets Act, the main legislation we will need to worry about is the Digital Services Act.  What that will do is modify fundamentally legislation called the e-Commerce directive, which we transposed into Irish law under SI 68 in 2003.  That provides a number of protections for online platforms, which are really the nuts and bolts of what this Bill needs to fix, in other words, how does one get content taken down and reported and so forth.<\/p> <p>  My main point is this.  If we are at pre-legislative scrutiny at this stage and we have a large item of legislation such as the Digital Services Act at least being drafted and put out there for the European processes to take effect, what is happening is a dual track.  We are operating on the online safety and media regulation Bill, which will fundamentally put in national criteria for dealing with content online.  As that will all shift, we are working on the current legislative basis in terms of how the platforms operate at this stage.<\/p> <p>  My main point initially was to ask why do we not just get on with the AVMSD, park the rest of it and see what comes out in terms of the Digital Services Act?  That is not really practical when we think about what could go on online in the interim.<\/p> <p>  The key question Deputy Mythen was really getting at was, therefore, what the differences are and whether we can identify them.  I would need much more time to do that but I know from the written submissions the committee has received, particularly from the platforms, that much of the information is broken out to show were those issues arise, fundamentally with regard to the defences around hosting.  In other words, is the platform a publisher?  The answer is invariably \"No\" but what are their duties in terms of taking down deleterious, criminal and questionable content?  If we are going to have a situation where a regulator has certain powers under national legislation, which fundamentally conflict with what the Digital Services Act ultimately ends up legislating for and dictating, that is the type of scenario we need to be careful about.  Ultimately, it will mean possibly unpicking, which is really where I am going in terms of my very clear one-word submission in the opening statement.  I want to make sure that we do not inefficiently use our time and that of the Attorney General's office and the various parliamentary draftspeople.<\/p> <p>  That is not to the detriment of society, it must be said.  I would never say that.  Ultimately, we would be doing something but the question is, how is it going to play out?  Ultimately, European law will be superior to what we do.  We will, therefore, have to retrofit it and that is a key issue.  It is difficult in the sense that, yes, the AVMSD is there, we are late on it and need to do it and therefore, let us get it done.  There is that aspect of it.<\/p> <p>  I have, however, been involved in reports in this space since 2014 and 2017 through the Internet content advisory group and the Law Reform Commission.  I agree with the conclusions of both even though they are different.  It is, however, really that point of whether we can look at the future and see what is going to be there and maybe try to plan for that.

Is it broadcasts that are made available in this jurisdiction?  Ultimately, the model I have given assumes national location, national accounts filing and so forth, which may be something that a regulator considers in part.  From that point of view, therefore, it was just a suggestion.  There will have to be consultation, however, not necessarily limited to Ireland but maybe pan-European consultation on how that ultimately works.<\/p> <p>  One observation, however, and I think it is quite clear that the Deputy has heard it before, is that many member states have not gone for this model or at least have reservations as to how it will work.

In Ireland, we are in the lucky position where we have the constitutional right to freedom of expression.  This has been pointed out in many submissions to the committee.  This is codified under Article 40.6.1&deg;.i of the Constitution.  As an adjunct to that, there has been case law through the courts that deals with online rights.  Those rights have been vindicated by the courts.  Some people bristle at the mere concept of that.  However, picking up from Dr. Docquir&rsquo;s point on this supervening European law, the charter, and the convention aspects, we are in a unique position.  We should bear that in mind.  We are a fairly liberal society.  We have this in what is an old Constitution at this stage.  It mentions organs of political press and the media and so forth, but also the right of the individual to communicate.  We need to be careful, both as legislators and citizens, not to impinge or trample on those rights.  This point on how we do things is a common thread, in line with Dr. Docquir and Ms Fitzpatrick.  Liability for carriers and platforms is going to be regulated, as I said in my earlier answer to Deputy Mythen.  It will be European law.

Could Mr. Lupton please comment on that?  <\/p> <p>  Third, Ms Fitzpatrick mentioned in her opening statement - and others made reference to this - that only the most serious repeated and systematic cases should be penalised.  Does she come from a position of protecting the tech giants from any significant responsibilities or liabilities?  She will understand the objective of the Bill and what we are trying to do.  Yet, she is also against any senior management liabilities.  She had said that it may have a detrimental effect on investment in Ireland.  Is it her position that tech giants should be immune from oversight or responsibility, in case they move their business elsewhere?  That would be tough to swallow.  We all know why they are here.  It is to pay less tax.  I am, therefore, curious about that. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021070700002#E00900","speaker":"1497"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625612400,"counter":735,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the questions.  I will start by commenting on the funding.  In our view, it is key to make sure the funding of the social media council does not undermine its independence.  There are various possibilities for sources of funding.  One is contributions from the social media platforms.  After all, as they would also benefit from the service that the social media council would provide, they might as well incur part of the cost.  Another source of funding, as for press councils, might be of a philanthropic origin.  Another option that we discussed is that there might be a contribution from the future regulator, if the social media council itself has been contracted to operate an individual appeals mechanism on behalf of the regulator.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy&rsquo;s second question points to the coexistence of different regulatory approaches.  One is a statutory approach with laws and the possibility of courts imposing sanctions.  The other model is voluntary compliance, which does not come with the strength of the law.  At this particular stage of history, a combination of the two approaches to regulation of social media platforms might be effective.  The danger with a legal regulatory approach is that with the risks of sanctions and fines, companies might at some point lawyer up.  This might lead to long legal proceedings, before we can see the effect of regulation coming into practice.  A voluntary compliance mechanism can be more flexible.  It can offer a space which, in my most optimistic moments, I would call a \"space for co-learning\", of what it means for social media platforms to be regulated externally.  Recognising a social media council in the law might prove to be an interesting incentive for social media platforms to join the social media council and to play fairly within that voluntary compliance mechanism.  That is the sense of our proposal.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021070700002#E01000","nonspeaker":"Dr. Pierre Fran&ccedil;ois Docquir"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625612400,"counter":736,"content":"<p>As for the rights of the child, the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, UNCRC, is quite clear.  We are obliged to take consideration of the youngest and most infirm in society and ensure their rights are heard and vindicated.  A good example of consultation taking place was that with the Data Protection Commissioner on the digital age of consent aspect of that legislation.  I agree with Professor O'Mahony in terms of his submission on that.<\/p> <p>  I have a couple of issues with the idea of an individual complaints mechanism, the first of which relates to the experience in the data protection space, whereby people send individual complaints to the regulator when some of them should be sent to the person who is perpetrating the breach rather than being sent straight to a regulator.  We could end up having a regulator or commission that is under-resourced and if that is so, that will not do the job we want it to do.  In examining how something arises online, the first step that should be taken is to report the deleterious or negative content to the service provider, which should assess that content and take steps, although it usually will not or will have reasons it might not, for example.<\/p> <p>  The second step is to report the content to a regulator, which is what the Bill aims to achieve, but the question is what the regulator will do.  I believe the regulator should be an advocate for the individual or child whose complaint has fallen on deaf ears, whether it is a criminal or civil complaint.  We should build in the necessary mechanisms to allow it to go directly to the social media company, telephone company or whatever it is, and to make the case that this has not been dealt with, without recourse to the courts.  That is fundamentally what the correct approach should be.<\/p> <p>  The Australian approach is a little more detailed and possibly would not suit the Irish environment.  That said, while there is room for that model, opening an individual complaints mechanism to the football pitch, if one likes, and allowing everybody run to the new digital safety tsar, who will be either a member of the media commission or somebody separately appointed, will mean that within six to eight months, he or she will not be able to deal with the complaints as lodged and there will be a difficulty in that regard.  It might suit from a constituent point of view to say we now have a Bill for this and here are the legislation and the regulation but if it is not functional, we will have a major problem with it.  It will not do what it says on the tin.<\/p> <p>  The question is how to set the rules of engagement.  Should we bring about codes of conduct and put them on a statutory footing in respect of how the behaviour should be engaged with between the content providers and the regulator, with a mechanism for the regulator acting as an advocate for the complainant to go the Garda and do the necessary when it comes to that?  It is a vexed question - there are no two ways about it - but both as a citizen and as somebody giving evidence to the committee, I want to avoid ending up with a regulator who, first, may be under budget and under-resourced and, second, may be unable do the job he or she was put in place to do and as reflected in the legislation.<\/p> <p>  The question is how to build the rules of engagement and whether we can make those rules of engagement work.  It might be that we should take up Dr. Docquir's suggestion for some form of social media council, or a rebranded NACOS, whereby we bring the necessary management from the operators to that council and have a discussion on what should and should not happen and how they are performing, and bring that into law or regulation of some manner.  The question of the best route is one the committee may struggle with, but certainly on its face, having some form of individual complaints mechanism, with the correct parameters, is something we need to examine seriously.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021070700002#F00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ronan Lupton"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625612400,"counter":737,"content":"<p>On the question of penalisation and whether this is for tech giants, our membership comprises all company sizes.

The Deputy is multitasking, as always.  Fair play to him.<\/p> <p>  I thank our guests for their contributions.  Members' questions have been interesting and thought-provoking.  I have two sets of questions, the first of which are for Ms Fitzpatrick and Mr. Lupton.  I wish to tease out the idea of the individual complaints mechanism.  As Deputy Munster correctly noted, many witnesses who have appeared before the committee and advocate groups, particularly children's rights advocates, have made repeated calls for the establishment of an individual complaints mechanism.  Having spoken these groups, I have to agree with their argument, at least on the face of it.  Nevertheless, we have to discuss further the practicalities of it and what resources would be needed.  I understand this has been successfully established in Australia and it seems to be working.  If it can be done there, I am sure there is some way we can do it here.  How could such a mechanism be resourced?  Ms Fitzpatrick might touch on the type of volume that applies to individual complaints.  Mr. Lupton mentioned that setting up such a mechanism would be challenging but surely there could be an imaginative or creative way around that, given that children's rights activists are calling for it.<\/p> <p>  Freedom of expression is something we all advocate for.  What are Dr. Docquir's views on the existing mechanisms for the removal of content?  Does Article 19 believe that some content removal has been in breach of freedom of expression rights?  Do social media companies sometimes go too far or not far enough?  I refer in particular to what we have seen over the past 12 months in the context of Covid-19 and vaccination programmes.  Some very influential Instagram and Facebook account holders, who may have several thousand followers, have gained support but they may be putting out misinformation on the vaccination programme, using terms such as \"experimental\" and other harmful terminology, and on the pandemic itself, suggesting it is a hoax.  That is difficult for me to entertain, given the significant influence and number of followers these individuals have.  Where is the balance there?  Where do we go too far and where have we not gone far enough?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021070700002#F00400","speaker":"1545"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625612400,"counter":740,"content":"<p>Ultimately, the key response to the individual complaints mechanism relates to the rules of engagement.  My preference is that any regulator be an advocate for the complainant, but the key query relates to how many complaints come and how they are filtered.  That is the real challenge here.  We have experience, as I said, with the Data Protection Commissioner and ComReg, where consumer complaints lines - call centres, almost - had to be set up to deal with the volume coming through.  While a mechanism to allow complaints to be made is called for, the first port of call must be the social media company, to complain about the content with which the issue arises and make it take action to take down the content within the scope of the law, as it will then be aware of the deleterious content, whether it is misinformation or defamation, criminal or otherwise.<\/p><p>One would then take the steps to report but the question is whether society or the citizen knows the steps to take ant the answer is probably not.  We cannot have a situation where people are told to run off to the digital safety czar and make their complaint, only for the digital safety czar to say it does not meet the threshold because it is freedom of expression-type content.  An example would be a case before the courts recently involving Salesian College.  Vulgar abuse is not defamation; it is simply vulgar abuse.  You may not like it but it is, unfortunately, a feature of freedom of expression.  The idea in that case was to try to unmask the person making the vulgar statements.  That did not go ahead and the case has been withdrawn but it was before the courts and there is a written judgment in terms of what occurred.  If we take that model, you would normally complain to Facebook first to say &quot;I have somebody abusing me.  We do not know who they are.  Do something about it&quot;.  If it fails to do this and to take steps, you should perhaps get a log from that particular platform provider and send it to the social media czar or commission and ask it to advocate on your behalf, rather than simply going to the social media commissioner or information society commissioner and saying &quot;I have this complaint.  You go deal with it.  You find out what my problem is and take the initiative.&quot;  I think this would be a disaster.  However, if there are rules of engagement and the platforms buy in to it, be it through a code of conduct or some form of legislative narrative that tells them they must engage in this manner, ultimately, it will be cleaner and we will be able to resource it properly and come to some meeting of minds without recourse to the courts to try to take the content down and deal with it in a manner that is proper.  <br\/><br\/>I take the Acting Chairman's point about the misinformation-disinformation dynamic.  As I mentioned earlier, unfortunately or fortunately, depending on what side you are looking at, freedom of expression is codified in the Constitution and, unfortunately, people treat that sometimes as a<i>carte blanche<\/i>mechanism to spread misinformation about vaccines, efficacy and all sorts of nonsense and they get away with it.  That is a deficiency on the Statute Book that needs to be addressed separately to this Bill.  I am not saying it should not be in here.  Perhaps in or around heads 49A, 49B and 49C, there may be room for codifying what should not come out.  Going back to Senator Malcolm Byrne's question about how one defines the harm that take place in respect of that, it is very different because, ultimately, a regulator would take care of a doctor or lawyer who was misbehaving or doing something he or she should not do and have a regulatory sanction.  However, when you are dealing with something like this, it is an unfortunate fact of life both in the off-line and online world that people say things that fundamentally are factually and scientifically incorrect and we simply have to deal with them.  The Australian model may go too far in terms of how it does things.  It is not dealing with the same level of European law and the dimension of rights, which Ms Fitzpatrick mentioned a second ago will be a ready-to-wear set of legislative principles under the Digital Safety Act, which will affect all 27 member states.  Of course, we know that Britain has done its own thing anyway and is barking in some aspects.  That is my contribution.  I will happily pick up on any further questions that come from that thread.  I am conscious of time so I will head over to Ms Fitzpatrick.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021070700002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ronan Lupton","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625612400,"counter":742,"content":"<p>Mr. Lupton has covered a lot of the key points really well.

We are going to start off with a media commission that, hopefully, will have great resources but will probably have some limit on those resources.  We should really focus those on the areas of most harm and risk if we do a risk-based assessment on complaints and focus on those that have the most impact and cause the most harm.  We have seen the volume of complaints to the Data Protection Commission.

There are three things relating to content moderation by platforms from a free speech perspective and a human rights standards perspective.  The first thing is transparency.  There has been progress.  Transparency reports have been developed and we know more about what is taking place but there is a general consensus that they could be improved, for example, on disaggregating data per country in order that we know exactly how many content moderation problems exist on each platform in Ireland.  The second problem is due process.  This involves making sure people are informed of the reasons why their content has been moderated and giving them a chance to have a fair conversation with the platform and a remedy to contest the takedown decision.  The final thing is making sure that freedom of expression and other fundamental rights are part of the debate on whether the specific piece of content should be allowed to circulate on the platform.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the question about disinformation, of course, I acknowledge that some seriously problematic content is circulated online.  There is no doubt about that.  However, the key thing here is to remember that content moderation is not binary or at least is no longer binary.  There are many options and ways of dealing with content.  Content can be demonetised, which can be a very strong incentive for people to stop sharing stupid or harmful content.  It can be downranked or flagged.  There are ways to display a message that points to authoritative sources of information on, for example, health and the pandemic.  Something like a social media council would be an appropriate forum for the discussion and fine-tuning of those non-binary approaches to content moderation in order that stakeholders could all share their views on what is needed, platforms could explain what is possible technically and some sort of societal agreement could be reached on the best approach to content moderation for each of the categories of problematic content.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021070700002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Pierre Fran&ccedil;ois Docquir"},{"type":"speech","time":1625612400,"counter":745,"content":"<p>Could Dr. Docquir elaborate on demonetising content?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021070700002#G00500","speaker":"1545"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625612400,"counter":746,"content":"<p>It is the idea that people share content because they profit from selling advertising.

Does Ms Fitzpatrick also see it having a role in fostering and supporting the development of the content creation sector in Ireland?  This links to how the content levy will be used.<\/p><p>How could that happen most effectively?<\/p><p> Any of our guests can reply to my next query on algorithmic decision-making.  I have been asking many questions about the role of the commission in deciding the code and enforcing transparency in algorithmic decision-making.  It relates to the challenge of balancing freedom of expression with the right to a good name and the takedown powers of the new regulator.  In what circumstances can a regulator order a social media company to take down particular material?  In Germany, this issue arose around Holocaust denial in particular.  German authorities can tell social media companies, particularly those of a certain size, to take material down quickly.  I wish to cite an example that Dr. Docquir might not be aware of, but others will.  There was a recent situation involving Presentation College Carlow where a series of statements started to be made online about the school.  They were subsequently proven false but they were damaging to the reputation of the school, in particular its male teachers.  Very quickly, the story exploded all over social media.  The school has won a judgment from the Press Council but that is only part of the steps necessary.

The people who can be damaged most by algorithmic decision-making online are children.  As adults, we disclose certain information on our devices, whether knowingly or not, and algorithms then take effect.  We know that they are a fact of life on the Internet but those who will be troubled most are those who do not understand what they are doing on the Internet.  The question is whether the legislation is able to develop a situation in which we can have some form of regulatory or code of conduct guidance on algorithmic decision-making in respect of minors.  The Data Protection Act looks at targeting and advertising, and there are actions happening in that regard that are fundamentally good.  Ultimately, however, it is a global question.  It is something that irritates many people.  If people are not happy with their algorithms, should they run off to the digital safety commissioner and say that the social media companies' algorithms are showing them content they do not want to see?  That is the type of complaint that an individual complaints mechanism would fall over and die on.  If people understood - it is a citizen information exercise - how the technology works, it makes life a little easier.  We are all subjected to it.  I am not saying that it is not a pain to have algorithmic decision-making happening but we need to focus on who is most likely to be most hurt by it, namely, minors.  They can be exposed online to dietary issues, alcohol sales, gambling, etc.  The question arises as to who is responsible for setting the parameters on the devices they are given and who is giving them the devices.  Invariably, the answer is their parents or they have done it themselves and not told the parent in the context of the vast sums of money they have extracted from their parents by saying that they need the latest and greatest in technology, but that is another day's work.<br\/><br\/>The Senator's question on freedom of expression was a good one, if he does not mind me saying so.  Freedom of expression online is codified, but we also have the Defamation Act.  Under it, if a defence is reasonably likely to succeed - that is an open situation - the reality is that someone will not get an injunction from the courts.  A court will look at the case presented to it and see whether there is a possible defence that is reasonably likely to succeed.  If there is - a clever lawyer will have put one forward - then someone will not get an injunction, meaning that he or she will then have to take costly and lengthy defamation proceedings to resolve the issue.  While I do not want to get into the details of the Carlow example, it was a serious situation.  One can find businesses and institutions that do good work being subjected to crank complaints.  I am not saying that happened in the Carlow context but those bodies can be subjected to complaints where people are exercising freedom of expression but doing so in the wrong.  Trying to vindicate the right to a good name as businesses or individuals becomes an expensive and lengthy process and they have to go to court to do it.<br\/><br\/>Can this legislation fix that?  There is an effort to do so in or around heads 49A to 49C in terms of providing recourse to a regulator to take data and information down, but what will the parameters be?  We should be careful not to have censorship by the Executive without democratic legitimacy.  Reverting to my point on misinformation and disinformation, we should seek to put into legislation clear guidelines for the regulator on when it would be appropriate to take down information.  There should be takedowns - there are no two ways about it - but it is a question of when doing so is appropriate.  We do not want a regulator going rogue and telling platform providers or others to take something down, that it is bold and, although they have not really assessed it, it is <i>prima facie<\/i>not correct or appropriate.  We cannot have that.  We would die as Ireland Inc. commercially, never mind anything else.<br\/><br\/>There are protections in the Constitution to deal with this issue.  As the committee can probably tell from the way I am able to address this question, it is an area that I practice in, but the issue is vexed and problematic and there is room on the Statute Book for separate legislation in the criminal context, for example, through enhancing the incitement to hatred legislation or new legislation that a concerned Senator might introduce as a Private Members' Bill to shore it up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021070700002#H00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ronan Lupton"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625612400,"counter":755,"content":"<p>I will make two points on algorithms.

One of the definitions of harmful content refers to material containing or comprising a defamatory statement.  There are different cultures and sometimes what is accepted in one culture is not accepted in another.  One such famous instance involved cartoons.  I will not mention the subject of them.  There are also comedians.  Generally, comedians operate on the basis of someone being the butt of the joke.  That is the way it works.

The Defamation Act is stand-alone legislation, and only the courts can determine whether something is defamatory.  That is the reality of it.  We will therefore not have a situation in which a regulator will be able to determine whether something tends to injure the reputation of an individual or a company in the minds of ordinary and reasonable members of society, which is what the test is.  I think that will be an issue and it might be challenged before the courts as to where it should sit.  There is an interplay between Article 40.6.1&deg;.i of the Constitution, dealing with freedom of expression, and the Article 40 rights, which imply the protection of and right to a good name and the State vindicating that right.  That interplay is very much hardwired into society here, and there needs to be very careful thought not only from the committee's reporting position but also when this Bill goes further in terms of amendments and how it will operate in that regard.  A court is the only proper place to determine this, unless it is very clear that a really bad defamation has occurred.  This is where most of the problems arise.  The platform says it has not seen the content and says, &quot;You are only telling us about it now.&quot;  Therefore, we go back and check and the platform agrees to take it down, or it does not, but it does not make an assessment of it in terms of its defamatory nature or otherwise.  The courts do that.  I know Dr. McIntyre has highlighted that in his submission from Digital Rights Ireland, DRI.<br\/><br\/>As for online safety, there have been voluntary codes operating through the auspices of the <i>hotline.ie<\/i>service and so forth.  They have been very high-level and light as far as it goes.  I was involved in those and I know how they operate.  A lot of the content reports do not result in much but the odd time you get a very serious situation going where Interpol must get involved or the INHOPE network has to get involved in the reporting of online criminal content relating to children.  I think the online safety codes will bring the necessary parties to the table.  There will always be difficulties.  If a new operator comes to town tomorrow morning and says, &quot;We are just going to go Wild West here and are not going to comply with anything and we are global&quot;, that will be extremely difficult.  Members have to ask themselves whether these codes are really practical and whether we can do anything to stop facilitating those services in Ireland.  The answer is &quot;No&quot;.  It is an open platform.  The Internet is pervasive.  It is not a platform but is all around us in terms of connectivity.  From that point of view, careful consideration needs to be given to how the codes will operate and what detail will go into them.  It might well be that when the commission looks at them, there will be a consultation process of some description that will take account of the views of those who will be affected by them, namely the consumer, the child and the platforms, in order that we have a kind of middle ground that can operate the codes as they are.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021070700002#J00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ronan Lupton"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625612400,"counter":764,"content":"<p>I think there was a question about humour and satire and the intersection between international or European human rights law and local values and local harms.

We recognise now that the factors for investment in Ireland will substantially change based on OECD-level changes happening on the tax front.  We have seen that among the top three reasons to invest in places, regulation is really coming to the fore.  We see that even in Ireland.  Looking at the biopharma sector, which is where my original background is, the companies present here are really well regulated.  The Irish biopharma regulator is internationally well recognised and, as a result, attracts a lot of investment into the country because it is a strong but a fair regulator and is really respected internationally.

I am CEO of the National Space Centre Limited, NSC, a private Irish company operating in the satellite and space sector in Ireland for the past ten years.  We operate Ireland's only carrier grade teleport at Elfordstown Earthstation in Midleton, County Cork.  We are an Enterprise Ireland client company.  The company delivers ground station infrastructure and services for many of Europe's biggest satellite operators as well as many new US space companies.  We host many on-site ranging stations, satellite positioning services and launch vehicle telemetry and control systems.  Services provided by our clients include both geosynchronous satellite broadband and low Earth orbit satellite broadband services.  I will go into those in more detail shortly.  The NSC has provided communications systems and services to both the Army and the Naval Service and is currently tendering for the multiple tender the Defence Forces are evaluating.  I have more than 20 years' personal experience in the satellite and broadband industry in Ireland, which gives me an in-depth understanding of broadband infrastructure and how it is impacting the current market.<\/p><p> The national broadband plan which is the Government's initiative to deliver high-speed services to all premises in Ireland and which is currently being rolled out in phases, is a monumental undertaking.  When complete, it will see the majority of premises served by commercial broadband or broadband with State intervention in areas where private companies do not invest.  Despite this coupling, there will remain outlying segments that pose delivery challenges.  These challenges are caused by the fact that it is cost prohibitive to deliver fibre-based infrastructure to remote regions.  This is due to low population densities, ribbon development and legacy issues inherited from deregulation.  In short, and as always, there will remain a last-mile segment that is inefficient to serve via standard fibre networks, whether commercially or through State intervention.  Delivering access to broadband to these outliers requires a multifaceted solution of which satellite is a critical part.  I wish to outline to the committee how satellite can assist the Government in delivering its broadband obligations and how NSC can contribute to the delivery of this solution, and the additional bonuses that can be leveraged for the State through the use of satellite networks.<\/p><p> Satellite broadband can deliver broadband anywhere.  Whether in the middle of the ocean or on top of a mountain, it can deliver speeds of up to 200 Mbps download, with the only requirement being that there is a power connection to power the system.  The difference between a satellite broadband system and a fibre-based broadband system in the context of the national broadband plan delivery is the price difference, which results in a feeling of inequality with which the public affected is not happy.  Since the fibre network cost is subsidised and not passed on to the consumer, the consumer cost of fibre broadband appears lower than a satellite solution.  With satellite solutions, equipment takes the place of infrastructure, but it is not subsidised.  The challenge to the Government is to put all consumers on an equal footing.  This can be easily addressed via a grant subsidy in place of infrastructural investment for outlying premises.<\/p><p> Regarding geosynchronous orbit, GEO, versus low-Earth orbit, LEO, satellites, NSC partners with a number of companies that offer both types of solution.  I will go into them briefly to give the committee an idea of the approximate costs of a suitable technology.  GEO satellite services have been available since circa 2000.  A geosynchronous satellite sits at approximately 35,000 km above Earth at the equator and provides broadband to the end user via an associated network with a 600 millisecond, ms, delay, known as satellite latency.  This is an important part of the issue because the delay makes such satellites a last resort to modern consumers, given that they do not fulfil the demands of gaming and management systems and also fall short on voice telecoms such as Zoom, which have become a critical part of our broadband infrastructure requirements.<\/p><p> LEO satellite broadband services are brand new to the market and operate without any latency issue.  LEO satellites move in an orbit much closer to Earth - approximately 1,000 km - and provide broadband via a network of satellites and ground stations, achieving speeds of up to 200 Mbps.  More LEO services are due on the market from OneWeb, Telesat, Amazon and other providers, but SpaceX's Starlink platform was the first to the market and is currently in beta phase and awaiting licensing.  Its estimated retail cost is approximately &euro;500 for the equipment and &euro;99 per month for the service.<\/p><p> NSC offers co-location, management and consultancy services and is in a position to advise and assist in the delivery of satellite services to bridge the broadband gap and make high-speed broadband available to every premises in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021070700002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Rory Fitzpatrick","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625612400,"counter":775,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Fitzpatrick.

Poynting Antennas and Novatel, which together have thousands of happy customers, believe that fixed wireless access is the true answer to overcoming the digital divide in Ireland.  We believe it to be the most cost-effective way of providing all of Ireland's population, regardless of where they live, an equal opportunity to learn, work and be closer to information and their loved ones.  Since fixed wireless access is capable of such achievements, it must be perceived as a vehicle for economic growth and one that will help close the gap on digital inequality.  This pandemic has proven that people were, and many still are, in need of faster and more reliable Internet.  Fixed wireless access is the fastest way to do that.<br\/><br\/>Fixed wireless access is a technology that is used to provide broadband connectivity without the need to install wires.  It relies solely on broadly available cellular technologies like 4G or 5G.  It is fairly simple for anyone to get connected.  First, a person gets a SIM card with a data plan from a provider that provides service in his or her area of choice.  According to the websites of the three providers in Ireland, this should be fairly easy because all of them claim that they cover 99% of the population.  Second, get a cellular router, for example, 4G or 5G, and an external antenna.  The external antenna is crucial to the performance of the system.  Third, set up the router and install the antenna on a rooftop.  If someone has any doubt about how to do that, a better option is to rely on a certified installing company like Novatel or any of its partners.  Once everything is set, that person can enjoy his or her new Internet connection, which will be more stable, more reliable and more consistent.<br\/><br\/>Fixed wireless access is not only good for rural or remote areas, even though that is the topic and why we are meeting today.  I do not have enough time to go through all of the use cases, but it can also be used to meet temporary demand for broadband in urban areas as backup or main access to the Internet, the Internet of Things, IoT, projects or in any kind of moving vehicle, be it an ambulance, police car, boat or so on.  How is it better than any of the alternatives on the market, especially in connecting rural and regional locations like the ones we are discussing?  First, it involves a lower cost on deployment.  Cellular networks are already broadly available.  The last mile of wired access accounts for most of the deployment costs of alternatives due to civil works.  Satellite is also pretty expensive to set up.  Second, unlimited data plans start from &euro;25 per month, which would already be cheaper than a fibre or satellite connection.  Third, the overall cost of the hardware needed to set up the user's side - a very good domestic router, a very good antenna and the install - places it on par with fibre-optic plans when divided by 24 months.  When all of the costs and subsidies that go into fibre-optics and the cost of deploying satellite services are taken into consideration, the total cost of ownership with fixed wireless access is the cheapest.<br\/><br\/>Another important aspect is that fixed wireless access can be deployed quickly.  It has a faster time to market, given that the infrastructure is already in place.  This has been shown during the pandemic.  It also provides freedom of choice.  All three providers in Ireland provide areas with services already, and it is a flexible technology.  It caters for a number of situations and, when the time comes, the antenna does not need to be replaced.  Neither does the cabling - the install, <i>per se<\/i>- or the SIM card.  Only the router needs to be replaced.<br\/><br\/>It also provides high speeds.  With 4G broadly available and 5G picking up pace, cellular can provide fibre-like speeds now.  For 4G, this is typically 50 Mbps to 40 Mbps of download and 30 Mbps of upload, with 30 ms of latency.  It is a technology that has redundancy built in as a feature.  After I connect my cellular router and put my antenna outside, if the mast that serves my router goes down but there is a second mast that provides coverage to the same area, I will still be able to go online.<br\/><br\/>It is a proven technology.  A few years ago, the Norwegian Government was facing the same challenge that Ireland is facing today.  It brought committees like this one together and ended up choosing fixed wireless access.  Poynting became the provider of antennae and, working with Telenor, the mobile network operator, MNO, in Norway, we have installed more than 30,000 antennae.  TDC, an MNO in Denmark, also offers this system to its clients.  We have installed more than 20,000 antennae in Denmark.  In the UK, we have zero agreements with MNOs or other providers, yet we have sold more than 50,000 antennae for fixed wireless access installs throughout the country.<br\/><br\/>Last but not least, and if we give it a thought, it is the greener choice.  A cellular router consumes more or less the same energy - 10 W at peak - as a fibre one, but the fibre option has many more civil works attached and, hence, a larger and heavier environmental footprint.<\/p><p>If we need to compare it with satellite options, research shows that standard satellite hardware has an average consumption of 70 W while newer systems, such as Starlink, range from 100 W on average to 150 W on peak.  If we consider that, according to the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, in 2018 more than 65% of Ireland's energy was coming from natural gas, coal or oil, meaning polluting sources of energy, we can see how much of a difference this will make to our environment.  Fibre and satellite also have their pros and cons.  We truly believe that fixed wireless access and providing broadband resorting to cellular technology outweighs the advantages when making a comparison.<\/p><p> This is nothing new globally, as the committee has seen, but it is nothing new to Ireland as well.  We have some case studies that Novatel has been conducting in Ireland in recent months.  For example, outside of Dublin, not far from Sandyford, which is a big enterprise centre in Dublin, there was a couple who could not get good, proper Internet and they were relying on a digital subscriber line, DSL, link with 3 Mbps download and 2 Mbps upload.  It is impossible to have a Zoom call on such a link.  After Novatel deployed a cellular router and a pointing antenna, we improved the performance tenfold.  If we go outside Dublin to Cork, we find the same, namely, a DSL with 2.225 Mbps download and 1.2 Mbps upload.  With only a router and an antenna - a proper install - we again improved the performance tenfold.  In other regions, day in and day out we have been able to outperform DSL or line-of-sight, LOS, technologies - LOS is a different radio technology for a private network - not only for private individuals but for businesses as well.  A slide in our presentation shows a Ford dealership garage that has changed from a DSL to a Poynting system as well.<\/p><p> Until now, I was only talking about going from DSL or LOS to 4G, but you can also see it when it comes to 5G.  This was done in the Netherlands, where the initial test results with a normal 4G router were allowing 4 Mbps of download and 2 Mbps of upload.  Once we changed to a 5G router, we multiplied these by a considerable number.  This was all from our side.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021070700002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Hugo Carvalho","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625612400,"counter":780,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Carvalho.

Mr. name is Declan Campbell.  I am the managing director of Digiweb.  I am joined by my colleague, Mr. Brendan McGahon, who heads up Digiweb's operations.<\/p> <p>  Digiweb is headquartered in Dundalk, County Louth.  We are a 100% Irish-owned broadband provider.  We are a proud member of Guaranteed Irish and we are the top-rated Internet service provider on Trustpilot.  We are passionate about providing excellent customer service along with state-of-the-art broadband technology to all of our customers.  Digiweb Group employs more than 150 highly-skilled individuals in its Dundalk, Blanchardstown and Limerick locations.<\/p> <p>  Digiweb has been providing broadband services in Ireland for almost 25 years.  We have used a variety of different technologies, from satellite to fixed wireless, DSL and, more recently, fibre-to-the-home, FTTH, broadband through providers such as SIRO, Open Eir and National Broadband Ireland, NBI.  We are a retail provider for NBI and we are adding NBI customers on a weekly basis as the service is rolled out and becomes available in their areas.<\/p> <p>  There is no doubt that FTTH broadband is the gold standard in connectivity.  We are supportive of the Government's drive to roll out FTTH broadband to rural Ireland.  That said, the national broadband plan is an ambitious five- to seven-year plan.  We believe that satellite broadband can play a role in providing a stop-gap solution to homes and businesses throughout rural Ireland that will not be passed for fibre broadband until the later end of the national broadband roll-out.<\/p> <p>  Digiweb has nearly 25 years' experience in managing satellite broadband networks in Ireland and in other European locations.  We believe that Digiweb's satellite broadband industry knowledge and international contacts can help the Government.  Like all technology, satellite broadband has improved in recent years and the industry has been transformed, both by new purpose-built high-speed satellites and hardware and software developments at ground level.  Satellite broadband offers many advantages.  It is available nearly everywhere in the country - all you have to do is see the sky above you.  It is quick to deploy.  It takes approximately two hours to install.  It will offer broadband level speeds of up to 100 Mbps.  We believe it is a cost-effective solution.  As we move forward, new technologies are allowing us to pinpoint capacity to specific areas where the demand is high.<\/p> <p>  Previously, a satellite would have covered all of Europe.  We can now, with the technologies that are available, focus that satellite footprint or coverage area into the south east or the south west.  It is going from an entire European footprint down to that type of local level.  As for the future of satellite, over the next 18 months or so, two planned GEO satellite launches will transform satellite capacity and availability over Europe.  These new satellites will feature steerable beam technology meaning that bandwidth and coverage can be focused on areas where capacity requirements are strong.  Dedicated capacity on these satellites can now be pre-booked.<\/p> <p>  One of the two GEO satellites I am referring to is owned by an EU company, Eutelsat.  It is due to launch at the end of this year.  It will offer a combined capacity of 500 Gbps.  To put that in context, 500 Gbps of capacity is the same as all of the capacity available today on the GEO satellite broadband services over Europe.  One satellite due to be launched at the end of this year will provide the same capacity that is available to all of the GEO satellites that are up there at present.  The second satellite being deployed is from an American company, Viasat.  It looks like the latter is planning to trump Eutelsat because it is offering 1,000 Gbps as the total capacity on its satellite, which is due to launch in mid-2022.  Both of these future generation satellites will offer the end user speeds of more than 100 Mbps.  The dish that will be deployed on their premises will be approximately 74 cm in size - similar to the size of a Sky television dish.<\/p> <p>  While there is no doubt that full FTTH technology is the gold standard in terms of broadband connectivity and Ireland's five- to seven-year national broadband plan is ambitious, some homes and businesses within the intervention area will not be passed by fibre broadband for several years to come.  The pandemic has shown that those citizens living on the wrong side of the digital divide have suffered in terms of access to education and their access to high-speed fibre.<\/p> <p>  Satellite broadband services have delivered Internet access to more than 10,000 premises in Ireland over the years.  While it is historically known as the option of last resort, it provides these homes and businesses with a much-needed service as opposed to no service at all.  In the next 18 months, satellite broadband will take another leap forward in terms of capacity and the benefits it can offer.  We believe that those end users in the intervention areas who will not gain access to fibre broadband in the near future would benefit from installing a temporary satellite broadband service.<\/p><p>Given that these future generation satellites will focus additional capacity on those countries in Europe where demand is high, we believe Ireland needs to act now to secure its share of that capacity before other European countries take it for their own needs.  There are several ways the Government could assist here to provide many end users with a modern satellite broadband service for a modest cost and on a temporary basis.  Digiweb would welcome the opportunity to discuss this further because we are keen to help advance Ireland's new national digital strategy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021070700002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Declan Campbell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625612400,"counter":783,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Campbell.  We move now to members' questions.  The first slot is for Fine Gael, which I will take.  I do not know if our guests have had the opportunity to look at our previous interactions, particularly with NBI but also with Eir.  The issue of the intervention areas is coming up for us in constituencies, especially in rural ones but also in those with some urban areas.  Mr. Campbell referenced it already.  I want to take up that specific topic.  Mr. Campbell suggested that satellite technology could offer something here.  The one issue that has come up is that in terms of the current roll-out with NBI, there may be areas where people could be looking over a ditch and seeing where Eir has got to up to now and yet NBI may not come their way for two to five years.  I will begin with Mr. Campbell and then go to Mr. Carvalho and Mr. Fitzpatrick to hear how they see this.  We have raised the matter with NBI and it is looking at ways it can interact with Eir and others on those gap intervention areas.  Technically, how good would it be with respect to speed capacities for end users?  How long would it take to be up and running?  What would be the cost?  How would it compare with fibre broadband?  This is a very specific question because one of the key reasons we have the witnesses in today is to address those gap intervention areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021070700002#D00200","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625612400,"counter":784,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.  There are satellite broadband services available today but we are focusing on the fact that in a very short period, around the next 12 months, satellite technology is going to take a step forward.  The speeds that are going to be available to the end users are going to be greater than those available today.  I will give the Chairman two answers, namely, what is available today and what will be available in approximately 12 months' time.  If I recall correctly, he asked what sort of speeds are available now.  Satellite technology today will offer the end user speeds of about 50 Mbps.  The time it takes to deploy that is the time required for an installation engineer to go out and fix a satellite dish on the side of somebody's premises.  Typically, the operation takes about two hours to complete.<br\/><br\/>On the cost, today we have satellite services available for less than &euro;100 for installation and the monthly fee is probably &euro;45 or &euro;50.  Thus, it is relatively comparable to a low-end DSL service you would get in terms of price and probably trumps it where speed is concerned.  However, there is an issue with those satellite services.  If the end user wants to visit,<i>rte.ie<\/i>, for example, the signal goes from the dish on the side of his or her premises, up to the satellite in orbit and back down to Mr. Fitzpatrick's teleport or ground station.  It receives that signal as <i>rte.ie<\/i>, it sends it back up to the satellite and back down to the customer's premises.  Naturally, that takes a little bit too long for certain applications.  That said, people can watch movies, browse the Internet, use YouTube, and so on with the technologies available today.<br\/><br\/>The technologies which should be available in the next 12 months are going to take a step forward from there.  These are classed as geostationary satellites.  They will still have the same latency issue but the speeds will increase.  Customers will now be able to use up to 100 Mbps.  It will still take a couple of hours to deploy the dish on a customer's premises.  The costs will be reasonably similar.  We are talking about a set-up fee of probably less than &euro;200 and a monthly fee of approximately &euro;50.  Those services will not compare favourably with fibre broadband to the home as is being rolled out by the national broadband plan.  That is the gold standard.  However, these services will compare with services available to these premises at the moment, be that a mobile solution or a DSL-type solution that is a copper service to the customer's home.

That is what we actually achieve in the Netherlands.  That is not a manufactured number, it is from real tests by system integrators, that is, a person installing an antenna and a router.  It is 250 Mpbs for download and 100 Mpbs for upload.

A 4G router typically has a small antenna.  If you wish to continue with those, it is 15 minutes.

It is an area in which I was involved 20 years ago, as was Digiweb.  If you look at the sector across the board, the big problem is ribbon development.  We have never got away from it.  It is a structural problem built into the society that makes it very expensive to get a fibre or any service to the person who lives on a headland such as Galley Head or wherever.  Because of the way we have operated our planning and how we have allowed people to build, we cannot get away from that.<\/p> <p>  On the wireless side and services, as Mr. Campbell stated , Digiweb is already delivering this into the market.  It is one of the better telecoms companies in Ireland doing that.  The problem is that there is always a small group on the edge of the network that you cannot deal with.  That is just to expensive.  Earlier, I mentioned the Starlink system.  This is a game changer.  I had a Starlink system installed in my house in January.  I live in a weird place in that I am located between all of the exchanges in the south of Cork city.  I live just outside the city boundary in Carrigaline, but my house lies between Douglas, Carrigaline and Passage and each exchange is too far away from me to get broadband.  As a result, I have had huge issues with broadband.  I live close to the city in a blue area.  I bought the Starlink system in January.  I took it out of the box, connected it and switched it on.  I am getting speeds of between 100 Mbps and 200 Mbps.  The big deal about the Starlink system is the latency.  It is a game changer.  It will be available once the licence is secured.  The product is available and it works.  It is not 100% at the moment because only 1% of the fleet is up.  Approximately 1,600 of the potential 12,000 satellites are up.  The latency issue that has been the bane of satellite forever and made it a problem for end users and consumers is gone.  I am getting 26 ms latency.  Mr. Campbell and his colleagues will know that the real sweet area of satellite is in television because it can beam out to tons of people.  In the longer term, I suspect that we will end up with a layered network whereby local wireless, fibre and satellite will integrate into a single platform which the consumer will purchase from whoever provides it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021070700002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Rory Fitzpatrick"},{"type":"speech","time":1625612400,"counter":800,"content":"<p>I have two questions for Mr. Fitzpatrick.

When consumers come to the conclusion the only service available to them is a  satellite service, they tend to question when the NBI service will be available and whether they should spend &euro;200 upfront now or there is the possibility that the NBI service will not be rolled out in six months' time.

If we were to go down that route, we would have an opportunity to tie in some of RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s broadcasting capacity in terms of Saorsat that is going out from Madrid.  We have an opportunity to cater for the Defence Forces who are underprovided because they have to tender in Europe on piecemeal contracts.  There is a much bigger opportunity here for the State to unify this.  We are small country.  We do not have a very big budget in this area.  We certainly do not have the money to be putting up loads of satellites, especially not when there are guys putting 60 of them out every Thursday.  This is an opportunity here.  <\/p> <p>  The LEO service will be huge.  If we consider what is coming into the market, Starlink and SpaceX are out in the lead but right behind them are Telesat, OneWeb, Amazon's Kuiper project and Apple is also talking about this; those are only the Californian guys.  This is before we look at some European ventures that might come in.  We are also looking at the Japanese, the Indians and the Russians.  We could end up with 20 or 30 service providers with low orbit satellite provision.  They will all help our end user consumer but they will not help the State on the difficult problems it has.  The State should have some involvement in the communications infrastructure.  Obviously, I would have because I have a teleport but this would also make sense for Mr. Campbell as it protects local business and the needs of the local market rather than the needs of the global market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021070700002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Rory Fitzpatrick"},{"type":"speech","time":1625612400,"counter":818,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Fitzpatrick for that response.

I have a few brief questions.  My first question is for Mr. Carvalho.  I am interested in the fixed wireless option given that everyone has a mobile phone in Ireland.  Very few do not have one and some even have two.  They are to be found in every household.  In terms of the 4G and 5G signal, Mr. Carvalho was correct in saying there is pretty good coverage around the country, yet there are parts where there is poor coverage.  I can think of several such areas in my county.  When one travels beyond Lissycasey and goes out to west Clare there is an area spanning a distance of three or four miles where the signal drops entirely.  That does not occur intermittently, it happens every day.  In such scenarios, whether it be Clare or anywhere else in the country, where the signal is low, poor or non-existent, is it pointless having a fixed wireless service?  Is there such a thing as a capacity drain?  Forgive me, as I am not an expert in this area but Mr. Carvalho is.  If everyone is working off the 4G or 5G networks, or whatever network is available in the locality for their mobile phones, and if there is a high uptake of people buying a 4G enabled modem, are they competing for that bandwidth?<\/p><p>Is triangulation a problem?  If it is particularly spaced out in the rural areas, will there be issues with the signal dropping off?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021070700002#F01100","speaker":"1519","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625612400,"counter":825,"content":"<p>In the context of dead or low-signal areas, fixed-line broadband acts as a solution for that.  The solution is directional antennae.  Basically, you get an antenna and point it in the direction of where the base stations are located.  I ask the members to think of it as being like the following.  If I play some music in my office and I want people to hear it 100 m away, I need to get a better loudspeaker.  That is what we do with antennae.  We get better loudspeakers so that the tower can hear us better and we can hear the tower better.  It is bidirectional.  As we have said, in dead zones where there is zero signal, even if we have a high gain, and antennae have different gains, it is about how well the loudspeaker can talk or hear.  There might be places where there is zero signal, but it will be rare.<\/p> <p>  In terms of competing for bandwidth, the Deputy is right.  Each cell has a limited capacity.  The capacity is the number of users who can connect to it or the throughput that the cell can distribute.  In terms of the number of users, you see it, for example, when you go to a stadium or a concert and you try to make a phone call at half time.  Everyone is trying to send WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram messages at the same time.  We call it a bottleneck.  Everyone is trying to go through the same space and there are too many users.  It also happens with cells in remote areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021070700002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Hugo Carvalho"},{"type":"speech","time":1625612400,"counter":826,"content":"<p>I particularly want to hone in on that last point.  It is one that I have raised a few times at committee meetings in recent months.  A co-location policy was introduced in Ireland nine or ten years ago, through which there was to be a decent roll-out of mobile phone masts nationwide to ensure that signal would be maximised.  However, that principle has been abandoned by the sector and the big companies in the past number of years.  If you go into an urban centre, there is a concentration of mobile phone masts on around the local Garda station, the cathedral, the school roof and the church roof.  The triangulation is huge and there is a strong signal.  The companies do not want to share space because it is more lucrative to build their own masts and lease them out.  If you go four or five miles outside an urban centre, the technology is simply not there.  It should be a major concern for the committee that the old principle in the planning legislation for co-location has been abandoned to the detriment to some parts of rural Ireland.  We still see a flood of applications for masts in urban centres.  There is a happy medium.  It is called a nationwide network.  Some of the companies are still shying away from that.<\/p> <p>  I will move on.  As Mr. Campbell was speaking, I made two notes on comments he made that captured my interest.  He said that full fibre broadband is the ultimate.  We all agree on that.  It is what the country aspires to.  One particular concern is that Mr. Campbell stated that people are holding back on paying the &euro;200 installation charge because they are uncertain as to when their community or household will get fixed line broadband.  Therein lies a major problem.  I hope Mr. Campbell will respond to that.  We have been told that the roll-out of the national broadband plan will take seven years.  If representatives of the national broadband plan appear before the committee in the coming months, I imagine that they will tell us that the roll-out is behind schedule because of the Covid-19 pandemic and whatnot.  The roll-out will take approximately seven years.  Some people are very fortunate.  They look up the national broadband map, hone in on their house or Eircode postcode and know that broadband will be installed in their area in three, four or six months.  They can live with that.  When people know something is coming, they accept it and plan around it.  For those who might be getting their fixed line broadband in years five, six or seven of the roll-out, they do not know when it will happen, and Mr. Campbell has articulated that here today.  I propose that the committee recommends that based on what Mr. Campbell has said, there should be State intervention on a scaled basis - scaled subsidisiation - whereby if residents are to get broadband in years five, six or seven of the roll-out, they should get 100% subsidisation, which should be scaled back according to each year of the roll-out.  I ask Mr. Campbell for his views on what I have said as an addendum to the point he made earlier.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021070700002#G00300","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625612400,"counter":827,"content":"<p>That is a decent suggestion.

I hope he will forgive me for going a little off topic.  Mr. Fitzpatrick is from the National Space Centre and he is most welcome.  As I understand it, Ireland has been affiliated with the European Space Agency, ESA, since 1975.  We embraced it early on.  At that stage, we probably did not have much of a notion, as a country, as to where we were going in terms of space exploration.  Since 2019, we have had a national space strategy.  We play our role in Europe and contribute to it.  I thank Mr. Fitzpatrick for what he is doing.  He and is colleagues are lone wolves.  They are at the table for Ireland and yet there are some giants in terms of space exploration.  Another mission was undertaken last month.  Not everything in space is about putting people on the moon or satellites.  There is a huge amount being done.  Mr. Fitzpatrick has told us loud and clear about the benefit of satellites and how they are benefiting people in rural Ireland day in, day out.<\/p> <p>  At the moment, the European space infrastructure is concentrated in the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, Spain and French Guyana.  A someone who is involved with the ESA and attends its meetings, what are Mr. Fitzpatrick's thoughts on Ireland having a role in terms of space infrastructure on the ground?  In particular, I want to put the proposal to him of using the runway at Shannon Airport, which, at 3.2 km, is one of the longest in Europe.  It has a favourable orientation.  There are 6,500 km of ocean between Ireland and the US.  There are deepwater channel ports along the Shannon Estuary.  Space exploration is not for Ireland alone to pursue, because it is a colossal thing, but there are many reasons, at a European level, we should be nudging and putting forward a suggestion of Shannon or, indeed, somewhere else in Ireland, being used time and again.  Space missions are launched from Cape Canaveral and, increasingly, Russia.  Europe is trying to join the space race, which is continuing.  Ireland can play a major role in that regard.  There is significant hangarage in Shannon, which has capacity beyond being an airport.  I ask Mr. Fitzpatrick for this thoughts on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021070700002#G00500","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speech","time":1625612400,"counter":829,"content":"<p>I ask Mr. Fitzpatrick to summarise.

It is very difficult because the budget we put in is a very small one compared to the other countries and much of the infrastructure funding that comes out is big ticket stuff.  It is worth hundreds of millions of euro.  There are big numbers involved.  Therefore, it is a difficult area.

It is difficult to roll that out beyond the seven years NBI is talking about but there are efficiencies that can take place.  If the neighbours of those homes the Deputy talked about have a service, then it should be possible, and much quicker than heading off to a new house on the side of a mountain, to get the service into those sorts of gap houses that are not getting it.  Again, I go back to a point I made earlier, namely, that there are technologies available for individuals in those positions, such as the pointing option where a neighbour is asked to share his or her service, but that is not ideal and is not what people want.  People do not want to approach a neighbour to ask if they can share broadband service until such time as theirs improves.  NBI is best-placed to answer that question, as is Open Eir with its FTTH roll-out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021070700002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Declan Campbell"},{"type":"speech","time":1625612400,"counter":837,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Campbell for his answers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021070700002#H00500","speaker":"1517"},{"type":"speech","time":1625612400,"counter":838,"content":"<p>Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and Senator Dooley are next.

The conversations we have on the broadband roll-out is usually when constituents contact us because they just do not have a sufficient level of access.  That is usually where we come from in respect of the matter.  My understanding of the national broadband plan, which I will put on the record, in the context of the Covid pandemic delay, is that it is believed the plan will be sorted in the first six months of next year.  That is the most recent information I got from NBI, but it needs to have its plan for acceleration by the end of this year.  In reality, we are talking about people who are planned for in years six and seven but for whom capacity could be put into years four and five so they can be dealt with there and then.  That will obviously require a lot of due diligence to be done and an awful lot of capacity to be in place, not only for NBI but to deal with the likes of Eir and ESB as regards infrastructure.  That is absolutely necessary.<\/p> <p>  Another matter we will need to deal with is the roll-out of 4G and 5G by mobile phone operators.  In dealing with that particular issue, we may consider mobile phone operators individually or by means of the likes of Telecommunications Industry Ireland, which will provide greater capacity in the context of the solutions offered by Novatel, Poynting Europe and so on.<\/p> <p>  As already stated, the big issue is putting a plan in place for an interim solution.  One of the problems with regard NBI in the context of the national broadband plan is that it does not like to outline a plan beyond 18 or 24 months in case there are problems into the future.  The fact is, however, that we need to state clearly to people how far away we are and that there are alternatives in place.  A mobile and broadband task force is meant to be in operation.  I do not know if the witnesses have had dealings with it.  The point is that this task force should be dealing with the Government in respect of all of these issues.<\/p> <p>  Many of the questions I was going to ask have been already been deal with.  I will mention a number of other issues, however.  On LEO satellites, and Starlink specifically, it is similar to what Deputy Cathal Crowe said about whether we are going to have difficulties with coverage.  All of these solutions work on the basis that one person rings up looking for a solution, whether it is satellite or fixed wireless, and that is fine.  If entire areas are suddenly encouraged to say that they are not going to be part of the national broadband plan for four or five years and a huge number of the people who live in these areas look at a particular solution, there are going to be problems with capacity.  At what point will Starlink be up and running and fit to provide for a town or village for which national broadband provision may be a number of years down the line?  I ask Mr. Campbell what exactly are we talking about?  We are probably talking about the Eutelsat and Viasat having the ability to deliver in that regard.  Are there are any mitigations at all in the context of latency, which is an issue for anyone who is gaming or using Zoom at present?<\/p> <p>  My initial dealing with Novatel related to a particular issue it had but it later offered a solution that worked for certain people.  These were people who were able to run businesses, etc., in areas where there was not any sort of decent mobile phone connectivity, 3G or 4G.  In fairness, Mr. Carvalho dealt with the issue in the context of the loudspeaker analogy.  Can we deal with those questions?

We just provide them with a ground segment and run a ground station support for them.  Representatives from Starlink would need to come in and talk to the committee about this.

We have enough for a little bit, but we do not have enough to have our own system.  We are piggy-backing all the time.  My suggestion is that we would take a load of these different services and put them together in order to deliver an overall service.  Starlink certainly delivers in respect of the issue we have in remote areas right now.  However, most of the country is already covered with services.  I live in a black spot and I cannot get any coverage.  Digiweb is there and other providers - I think, Huawei - are offering 3G there.  We do have service there.  If I had a choice, I would prefer a fibre service.  I do have some service, however.  Most of the country has some service, but there is a small bit that is extremely problematic.

Therefore, the time it takes is much shorter.  The time it takes at the speed of light for a signal to go to a GEO satellite is approximately 600 ms, which is just over half a second.

I thank the Chair for letting me speak.  I wanted to come back on the earlier question of what the Government needs to do about fixed wireless access.  This was mentioned in passing earlier.  The infrastructure is already partly there, but it is missing in some areas.  I would also suggest involving the telecommunications operators because they play a crucial role in providing infrastructure.<\/p><p>As Ms Cullen O'Reilly was saying, we provide basically the customer's premises-side equipment, but there is also the infrastructure.  The infrastructure is crucial.  Luckily, it is there but it can be improved.  That is the role of the operators, such as Vodafone, Three and the like.  There is a role to motivate them a little more.  What I see in Germany, where I am a user of a mobile phone contract as well as a fibre-optic contract, is that the costs for the end user in terms of mobile contracts for data are much higher than for fibre.  One could ask if that is really fair because the roll-out of mobile data is more or less the same cost at the end of the day.<\/p><p> As regards capacity, that is connected to the base station capacity, as Mr. Carvalho mentioned.  The antennae can improve the capacity, which means that with antennae mounted on each house one can serve more customers as more information can be transferred in a shorter time.  That is one thing we should perhaps examine.  I happen also to own a place in Poland.  I am using fixed wireless broadband access there.  I have three times the speed of what my local fibre can offer, so I am much happier with fixed wireless access.  I can move it around, I am flexible and I have it set up in five minutes.  These are elements which can be considered.  Also, as I said earlier, I would definitely speak to the operators because they form a crucial part of the total fixed wireless access concept.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021070700002#J01700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tjeerd Huitema","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625612400,"counter":860,"content":"<p>To follow up on that, we already discussed the need to deal with the mobile operators, whether that is through Telecommunications Industry Ireland or the operators individually.

I do not want to get into the technical aspects of this.  We all have a reasonable understanding about this, but we depend on experts to guide us.  What I wanted from this endeavour was an understanding as to whether there is a solution that could fill the gap between now and year seven, and I suspect it will be longer.  When I was the Fianna F&aacute;il Opposition spokesman, I was very critical of this contract.  I saw the scale of the ambition as being, perhaps, too great.  While we all want fibre to the home, it is creating some problems in terms of its roll-out and delivery.  However, fingers crossed, NBI has the contract.  I opposed that at the time.  I believed it was a job for the ESB or a body with the type of presence on the ground that could take on such a project.  The fact that the ESB and Eir pulled out of the contract said a great deal.<\/p> <p>  That is all history.  We are now left with a situation where many homes and premises are in contact with all of us each day, and I dealt with two this morning, wondering how they can get the service.  The intervention of the contributors today is helpful in that it provides us with the information that there is a mix of technologies available.  Some will work in some locations and some will not, but there is a mix that will probably get to that 530,000 to 540,000 premises.  Again, not all those premises necessarily want broadband, but there is consistently a group that does.  What I want to understand is where we move from here or how we can plot a course.  I will recommend to the committee that we invite officials from the Department, based on the evidence the witnesses have provided.  We then have to fashion a response from the committee's point of view on how to pull the information the witnesses have given us together to design some type of further intervention by the State.<\/p> <p>  I like the idea Mr. Campbell discussed regarding a voucher or some type of subvention.  There might be some issues with that which we have to tease out as well.  What we do not want is somebody getting a voucher to try a satellite or a fixed wireless solution that does not work for him or her, and the person being no further on.  We would have to find some way around that.  It is clear from the questions, however, that have been answered, and the witnesses have gone through all the questions so there is no point repeating them, that there are solutions available and that is important.  At a minimum, any solution would have to provide for Zoom.  When Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and I started talking about this some time ago, I do not know about the Deputy but I certainly had not heard about Zoom to the same extent.  Unfortunately, we have come to live with it now.  Those are the things that are very important.  I am very interested in the new satellite technology.  It sounds really good.  The latency was always going to be a problem.  If that can be eliminated, one is right in the ballpark.<\/p> <p>  The sum of &euro;100 per month with a &euro;500 installation fee might be a little pricey.  The installation fee would not be the problem.  Many of the people I talk to would happily pony up &euro;500 to get the kit in, but the &euro;100 per month might be a problem.  With flexibility now and people working from home and not having to commute, there is potential to offset the cost of the commute against the cost of a service like that.  Where &euro;100 might have been prohibitive at one stage, people are spending more than that driving to and from work.  There is an exciting dynamic and there is an opportunity.  I thank the witnesses for their presentations and their assistance.  Chairman, our job now is perhaps greater than we thought.  Quite frankly, there are opportunities on which we have to engage with the Department, and we will work on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021070700002#K00400","speaker":"1655"},{"type":"speech","time":1625612400,"counter":863,"content":"<p>I wish to check on one thing in that context.

I remember being the chair of the Southern and Eastern Regional Assembly in 2014, which covered Clare to Fingal.  At that time, Alex White was the Minister.  We once had a room of 53 councillors where it was so obvious and palpable that half of the councillors had nothing to say about broadband and the other half were enormously exercised about the fact they did not have it.  Those from urban areas of Dublin and some of its hinterland in north Wicklow, Kildare and Meath were absolutely silent and had nothing to say.  Those from other places were hugely exercised about the fact they did not have broadband of any description that was useful.  People were driving to hotels to pick up their emails from their laptops in the car parks.  It seems that in certain parts of the country nothing has improved all that much in the past seven years.  This is what frightens me for all those people who do not have broadband.  They have been promised it for so long that it just does not seem like it is coming.<\/p> <p>  My other concern is from a State perspective.  Broadband needs to be treated in the same way as we treat running water and electricity.  Every house should have it and should have as good a quality service as every other house.  Equally, there are parts of the country that are almost inaccessible or where it is very difficult to provide the service, although I hear from the witnesses that satellite and various types of wireless are coming on stream.  Twenty years ago, when houses were being built they were being wired with category 5 cabling so they could have computer technology.  Three or four years later, it was scrapped because in the areas where it was possible, everyone had wireless broadband.  There were wireless routers in the houses and every device could pick it up.  My concern is that we will spend a fortune giving everybody fibre and in five years' time, we will discover we did not need to do so, in the same way as we do not use phone boxes or phone cards the way we used to.  As a state investing in technology by the time it gets to the places it is needed it may be out of date.

At the time the State and European Union funded antennae that were connected to the routers.  This was rolled out for a couple of years.  We can imagine how far the infrastructure has come in the past ten or 11 years.  I see it in real time.  The level of 4G coverage throughout Ireland today cannot be compared with what it was two years ago.  Continuous strides are being made.<\/p> <p>  Fixed wireless access taps into this existing infrastructure.  It does give the flexibility.  For example, I spoke to a customer yesterday.  This is a real life example.  He and his family go to their summer home at weekends but because of remote working they are spending more time there.  They have an antenna in their home and they have a router they take with them to the summer home where they also have an antenna.  They have one service that they are able to move from Cork city to west Cork and they can work in both locations uncompromised.  Fixed wireless access has this freedom and flexibility.<\/p><p>As Mr. Carvalho stated, it can be a long-term solution as 4G and, in particular, 5G roll out.  It will be a significant part of the future of telecommunications and will continue getting stronger and better.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021070700002#L01500","nonspeaker":"Ms Niamh Cullen O'Reilly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625612400,"counter":886,"content":"<p>I have a question to which Ms Cullen O'Reilly or others might respond.

That sector is one of the key employers in our area.  It is vital that we be seen to be keeping pace with the rest of Europe.  Even if it takes time to deliver and it costs a great deal of money, the cost of not doing it could be much greater.  Some of our partners in Europe would be quick to steal the headquarters of these companies and get them to move to Frankfurt, Milan or Paris if they could.

Earlier, Mr. Carvalho mentioned Norway.  Norway is a far larger country than Ireland and has many remote and rural areas where people live very far out.  Putting fibre-optic cable in the ground in Norway would not always pay off, so its Government chose a solid mix between fibre and satellite, but it also took a major step forward in choosing fixed wireless as a structural means of providing Internet to homes, businesses and what not that were far away from city areas.  As far as we have seen, that roll-out has been successful, with 30,000 antennae, 30,000 routers and so on connecting homes and businesses within one and a half years, more or less during the Covid period.  Fixed wireless can solve Ireland's challenges in connecting the 500,000 houses and businesses in question.  It has a quick roll-out.  It would not mean that Ireland would have to stop investing in fibre, but it is a very good alternative.  Starlink is coming on line and mobile operators - the Ericssons and Huaweis of the world - will speed up their endeavours to develop technologies with faster speeds and lower latencies than 5G offers, thereby boosting this technology.<\/p> <p>  I do not know whether fibre can do all that.  Where I am, I have copper in the ground and I do not believe that I will be able to wait for fibre to come to this area.  It will be too expensive and does not pay off.  The deployment of fixed wireless would take no time and could be done easily.  It could make a good contribution to helping the good companies in Ireland to avoid missing out because they are not connected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021070700002#M00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tjeerd Huitema"},{"type":"speech","time":1625612400,"counter":893,"content":"<p>Does Mr. Campbell wish to contribute?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021070700002#M00900","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625612400,"counter":894,"content":"<p>The Senator used an analogy and asked whether fibre would, like the PCR test, be the gold standard in five years' time.

They were being promised broadband over the next couple of years by the then Minister, former Deputy Alex White, who has been a long time out of politics by this stage, but many of their areas still do not have a service.

Mr. Huitema stated that the Government needed to speak with providers about deploying more masts, but that is down the line.  This is zero subsidised by the Government.  We just need to get the message across to people about using an antenna with a 4G router.  People will see a boost in their connectivity straight away.  Sitting down with the providers, having them deploy more towers and telling them that, whenever they sell their routers, they need to sell good antennae to get the most out of them is a different discussion.

This has been a very informative session for us.  We have held various meetings on broadband.  NBI and Eir have appeared before us.  Our next port of call will be based on the members' recommendations. The mobile phone and broadband task force has been in existence since 2016.<\/p><p>We will be looking to bring the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, in.  Senator Dooley made that suggestion.  Our first order of business should be to bring the Minister in to see exactly what the mobile task force is doing.  We will probably look to engage with the task force as well and get it front and centre.  First, there is an educational space there in terms of what are the alternative options as an interim solution.  Second, I think we need to look at the body of work to be done.  If it is not within the terms of reference, we need to get them amended to look at the roll-out of the national broadband plan, and how interim solutions, if required - and it looks like they will be - will be structured.<\/p><p> I suppose I would make one qualification.  If interim solutions are being given to members of the public, particularly in the gap intervention areas, they can in no way be seen as being the final solution.  If they are given satellite and other forms, such as fixed wireless connections, they have to be given the option of going for fibre broadband like everyone else.  That is what the national broadband plan is about.<\/p><p> The committee looks forward to further engagement with the witnesses.  Our deliberations today reaffirm our view that alternatives have a serious role to play.  In these times, we are using the analogy of the PCR test in terms of the fixed fibre and the antigen test in terms of all the other methods.  Both have a key role to play.  With people working remotely, this matter has become even more urgent.  We will be engaging with both the Minister and the mobile phone and broadband task force.<\/p><p> I take Mr. Carvalho's point about the providers but we need to get a full handle on what the up-to-date position is.  With the witnesses' indulgence, we will probably look to interact with them in the future.  I thank all of our guests for taking the time to attend.  I am sorry about the short notice, but it has been a hugely productive meeting.  What we want to do for the people out there who are contacting us on a daily basis in our role as public representatives is get them high-speed broadband, in whatever form, as quickly as possible and then get them the final solution that is fibre broadband.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021070700002#M02300","speaker":"1593","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1625612400,"counter":909,"content":"<p>The joint committee adjourned at 2.32 p.m. until 4 p.m. on Tuesday, 13 July 2021.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
