In addition, to difficulties in procuring insurance, there is a further issue where service providers are facing dramatically increasing insurance costs.  This is also evident in the performing arts sector.<\/p>  <p>  There is a particular impact on arts organisations involved in performance activities that take place in excess of 1.5 metres above the ground which include some arts organisations that engage in aerial and street performance.  There are a small number of such companies spread across the State.  <\/p>  <p>  The Government is aware of the issues facing cultural festivals and venues and is particularly concerned about the affordability and availability of insurance.  The pricing of insurance products is however, a commercial matter for insurance companies.   The reality is that neither the Department nor its agencies, has any control over the costs of insurance products.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance.   Government cannot therefore direct insurance companies to cover certain types of risk, such as those in the cultural sector.<\/p>  <p>  In 2016, the Government established a Cost of Insurance Working Group, which is chaired by Michael D&rsquo;Arcy, T.D. Minister of State at the Department of Finance with special responsibility for insurance issues. <\/p>  <p>  I am advised by the Department of Finance, that the working Group is focusing on implementing the recommendations of two reports that it prepared and published.  These reports examined the factors contributing to the increasing cost of insurance in order to identify what short, medium and long term measures could be introduced to help reduce the cost of insurance for consumers and businesses.   <\/p>  <p>  The Working Group, as part of its remit, is also examining the issues encountered by the arts performance organisations. Officials from my Department have attended a meeting between Minister Darcy's Office and representative organisations for arts grouping affected by rising insurance costs.  My Department will co-operate with the Department of Finance with any actions which will assist in the implementation of recommendations to mitigate the insurance issues.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121200050#WRA01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Commemorative Events","counter":16,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121200050#WRA01500"},{"type":"question","counter":17,"qnumday":16,"qnumall":"[51907\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121200050#WRA01600","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the reason there has been no announcement of the planned State and State-sponsored Decade of Centenaries 2013-2023 commemorative events for 2020.","asker":"1305","askee":"1243"},{"type":"speech","counter":18,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to ensuring that the State's approach to remembering this very complex period in our history, and all of those who lost their lives during those years, will be based on the respectful, sensitive, appropriate and authentic approach that has become the hallmark of the Decade of Centenaries commemorative programme.  <\/p>  <p>  We have entered the most challenging and sensitive phase of the Decade of Centenaries and the Government's commemoration planning continues to be informed by the guidance of the Expert Advisory Group on Centenary Commemorations, and consultation with the All-Party Consultation Group on Commemorations.<\/p>  <p>  One of the cornerstones of the State's approach to commemorations over the coming years will be to continue to further reconciliation on the island of Ireland and between Ireland and Britain. <\/p>  <p>  I am consulting widely with stakeholders and partners, including other Government Departments, the National Cultural Institutions and local authorities to best inform and finalise the State programme for 2020 early in the New Year. <\/p>  <p>  To date, local authorities and other core stakeholders have responded very effectively to the themes of the State commemorative programme by developing inclusive, appropriate and citizen-focused initiatives, to encourage people of all ages to explore significant aspects of the political, historical, social and cultural context of that period.

Following a Cabinet decision in October 2015, my Department introduced legislation to amend the National Archives Act, 1986 to give the Minister power, by order, to reduce the 30 year period to 20 years on a phased basis , subject to the agreement of the Taoiseach, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the relevant Minister in each case.  The National Archives (Amendment) Act was signed into law in July 2018. <\/p>  <p>  The new Act introduced a provision that allows records to be transferred when they are over 20 years old in certain circumstances.   It is anticipated that the 2018 Act will be commenced next year which will allow for a partial move to a 20-year rule.  This partial move will allow for the gradual build-up of the necessary resources to operate a full 20-year rule over the coming years.

This approach is different to that adopted by the UK. <\/p>  <p>  Officials from my Department in conjunction with other Departments are examining the classes of records that are more than 20 years old but less than 30 years which might be released as the first tranche under the \"20-year\" rule.

Ireland&rsquo;s most recent report in 2019 included a comprehensive assessment of the range, population status, habitat and threats for the Irish hare. The report can be downloaded at . <\/p><p>The 2019 Article 17 report states that the hare is found throughout the country from coastal habitats to upland heath and bog. The hare is widespread and common in Ireland with a broad habitat niche and its overall conservation status at that time was assessed as favourable. <\/p><p>In addition, my Department also commissioned a new survey of the status of hare&rsquo;s population in Ireland which took place using camera traps, over the winter of 2018\/2019. It is intended that this survey report will published shortly. <\/p><p>The RHD2 virus was discovered in a number of rabbits and hares in the wild around the country during the summer and appears to be widespread in Ireland. The virus is known to be highly contagious and easily spread and environmental contamination presents significant difficulties in terms of any biosecurity responses. <\/p><p>The scientific advice available to me at that time indicated that the catching of hares in nets, their transportation in boxes and their keeping in confined areas like coursing hare parks can all be considered to increase the risk of disease spread.  In these circumstances, given my responsibility in relation to the conservation status of the Irish hare,  I decided to suspend the licences issued to the Irish Coursing Club on 9 August to capture and tag hares for the 2019\/20 hare coursing- until a clearer understanding of the extent, spread and implications of the RHD2 virus emerges.  <\/p><p>Since these initial incidents, a request for public involvement has led to more than 75 reports of dead rabbits and hares across the country.Each report has been followed up vigilantly by the local National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) rangers. RHD2 has been confirmed in five hares found in Dublin and Wexford and 29 rabbits found in counties Carlow, Clare, Cork, Dublin, Kildare, Kerry, Leitrim, Meath, Offaly, Tipperary, Wexford and Wicklow. Since the suspension of Irish Coursing Club licences on 9 August, discussions have been ongoing between the NPWS of my Department, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Irish Coursing Club on the impact of this virus. <\/p><p>I recently issued revised licences last month to allow the netting and tagging of hares but there are specific restrictions and conditions explicitly attached to the issue of those licences. The capturing of hares and coursing activity is prohibited in areas within a 25-kilometre radius of where wild rabbits or hares have tested positive for the virus. New zones will be added on an ongoing basis if further positive tests arise and, in these new zones, the capturing of hares will have to cease immediately and coursing will only be possible with already captured hares, where the hares are certified in writing by a veterinary surgeon as being healthy, as such hares will only be released on foot of such certification. This has already impacted on some coursing events. In tandem with the granting of revised licences  I have required a number of field studies to be undertaken at some coursing clubs, which will involve veterinary and virology expertise and input. <\/p><p>These studies, which are currently underway, are being carried out to supplement existing knowledge of the prevalence and nature of RHD2, are undertaken with co-operation between the NPWS of my Department, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM) and the Irish Coursing Club.  The field studies involve the microchipping and swabbing of all captured hares and the testing of swabs in DAFM laboratories for RHD2.

The exact methodology and approach to this mapping exercise is also being finalised. <\/p>  <p>  Officials in my Department have recently written to selected local authorities with a view to establishing local interest groups to examine the potential for night time cultural events.  The matter was the subject of a meeting between my Department and Dublin City Council on 4 December.<\/p>  <p>  The main goal of these local groups will be to produce a report on what supports and impediments are currently impacting on opportunities for creative and cultural activity at night, both positive and challenging.  The report will also propose practical locally-based initiatives to improve night-time culture. This report will then feed into a National Forum which is envisaged to comprise relevant Government Departments and Agencies.  It is intended that this National Forum will meet upon receipt of local reports to consider matters arising for referral to the relevant Government Department or agency.  <\/p>  <p>  On foot of these engagements, consideration will be given to the development of Ireland&rsquo;s first Night-Time Cultural Policy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121200050#WRA05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Biodiversity Plan","counter":58,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121200050#WRA05700"},{"type":"question","counter":59,"qnumday":30,"qnumall":"[52067\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121200050#WRA05800","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"her plans to promote biodiversity conservation and restoration to stop the current trajectory of biodiversity loss; her plans to ensure 30% of  the territory of the State consists of natural areas by 2030 and for 30% of degraded ecosystems to be restored; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1243"},{"type":"speech","counter":60,"content":"<p>I refer the Deputy to my previous extensive answers in this House on this matter and to the two day debate on biodiversity related issues in this House last July. My Department is responsible for the implementation of a range of legislation and policy relating to biodiversity and nature in Ireland and is the National Focal Point for the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), an overarching international agreement underpinning the global biodiversity framework. In this context, my Department is the lead authority for the National Biodiversity Action Plan.<\/p><p>The current National Biodiversity Action Plan, Ireland&rsquo;s 3rd, runs from 2017 to 2021 and captures the objectives, targets and actions for biodiversity to be undertaken by a wide range of government, civil society and private sectors to achieve Ireland&rsquo;s Vision for Biodiversity. <\/p><p>My Department is currently preparing an interim review of the Plan and is in the process of gathering data from other Departments, agencies and stakeholders to inform that review. <\/p><p>Over the course of the last year I have listened very carefully to the debate on biodiversity loss and the threats to nature. Actions for biodiversity in 2019 have included the National Biodiversity Conference in Dublin, which I hosted; the development of the <i>Seeds for Nature<\/i>initiative; the wide ranging public consultation on the Heritage Ireland 2030 Plan; as well as the extensive engagement across Government on Climate Action. These measures were instrumental in my securing an overall 15% budget increase in the Heritage sector in Budget 2020. <\/p><p>Total funding for our Built and Natural Heritage sector in 2020 will amount to &euro;62.5m, up from &euro;54m last year &ndash; an increase of over &euro;8m. This funding includes &euro;7m in funding to embark on an accelerated programme of peatlands restoration and conservation works. This programme will result in 1,800 hectares of restored peatland in 2020, generating 100 jobs in the Midlands. It is part of a multi-annual programme which aims will ultimately lead to the storage of 28 million tonnes of carbon dioxide.<\/p><p>Restoration and rehabilitation of raised bogs will provide multiple additional ecosystem services such as water and air quality improvements, flood mitigation, enhancing biodiversity, opportunities for tourism development, and contribute to the social and economic well being of local communities.<\/p><p>Additional funding is also being provided to accelerate key nature conservation and biodiversity programmes under the National Parks and Wildlife Service, including the expansion of the NPWS Farm plan scheme to protect biodiversity and assist farmers with lands designated as Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas in their role as custodians of nature.<\/p><p>At a local level, my Department continues to provide grant funding for local authority projects that promote actions contained in the National Biodiversity Action Plan (NBAP) 2017-2021. This funding is aimed at enhancing biodiversity awareness, education and action through local authority led projects and initiatives.  <\/p><p>The 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the CBD (COP 15) is to be held in Kunming, China, from 19 October to 1 November 2020. The aim of COP15 will be to update the Convention&rsquo;s strategic plan and adopt a post-2020 global biodiversity framework. The post-2020 biodiversity framework is still under consideration and final targets remain subject to ongoing discussion and agreement among the Parties. <\/p><p>The Environment, Public Health and Food Safety Committee of the EU Parliament approved a resolution setting out their proposals for the 30% target for the Parliament&rsquo;s position for CBD-COP15. The Committee has called for legally binding targets at global and EU level to increase ambition and ensure that post-2020 action on global biodiversity will be effective. Specifically, they want 30 % of the EU territory to consist of natural areas by 2030 and 30 % of degraded ecosystems to be restored.<\/p><p>However, the negotiating position for the EU and its Member States, including Ireland, at COP15 has not yet been finalised. Further discussions will take place in the run-up to COP15 and my Department will fully participate in these to ensure that Ireland's interests are considered and represented in the final positions adopted in China next year. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121200050#WRA05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Peatlands Strategy","counter":61,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121200050#WRA06000"},{"type":"question","counter":62,"qnumday":31,"qnumall":"[51971\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121200050#WRA06100","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if she will consider the establishment of a peatlands national park and nature reserve; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1339","askee":"1243"},{"type":"speech","counter":63,"content":"<p>The National Peatlands Strategy provides a long term framework within which all of the peatlands within the State can be managed responsibly in order to optimise their social, environmental and economic contribution to the well-being of this and future generations.

My Department and I will continue to work rigorously with all of my Government colleagues towards delivering on the commitment to increase Government spending in the arts and culture sector on a trajectory that will see funding doubled by 2025.In this context, I am already delivering additional supports to the arts and culture sector, building on the &euro;1.2 billion earmarked for culture, heritage and the Irish language under Project Ireland 2040, thus leading to increased activity and employment across all sectors under the remit of my Department. <\/p><p>Last summer Minister Regina O'Doherty and I announced the extension of the Social Welfare Scheme for Self-Employed Artists on Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance on a permanent basis to other self-employed professional artists such as those working in theatre and music. <\/p><p>My Department has also worked to address conditions and employment rights in the performing arts and screen industry in conjunction with the relevant agencies under its remit. Central to this is the Arts Council policies on the remuneration of artists which strives to ensure that organisations in receipt of Arts Council funding offer fair and equitable remuneration to artists.<\/p><p>In addition, on 10 July last, I announced new, significant measures aimed at increasing funding for public art and artists. Following completion by my Department of a review of the Percent for Art scheme, which allocates up to one percent of public capital projects to the commissioning of new works of art, changes are being introduced from 1 January next to the scheme&rsquo;s bands and limits.  This will result in increased funding being made available to the creative community and will ensure that the investment in public art projects will be closer to one percent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121200050#WRA07800","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Arts Funding","counter":80,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121200050#WRA07900"},{"type":"question","counter":81,"qnumday":38,"qnumall":"[52150\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121200050#WRA08000","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the funding available for promoting and translating Irish literature abroad; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1243"},{"type":"speech","counter":82,"content":"<p>The remit of Culture Ireland, a division of my Department, is to promote and advance Irish arts worldwide thus strengthening Ireland&rsquo;s cultural profile and global reputation and increasing career opportunities for Irish artists globally.

However, neither Minister of State D&rsquo;Arcy nor I have had any dedicated meetings with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, or childcare providers or their representative bodies, on the specific issue raised in the Deputy&rsquo;s question.  I would also add that since the start of 2018 my Department has not received any representations from relevant childcare organisations or childcare providers. This would seem to indicate that there were not any significant problems in relation to the general availability or cost of insurance within the childcare sector during this period.  In this regard, it should be noted in other sectors where there have been problems with insurance costs and availability of cover, there has been significant engagement with Minister of State D&rsquo;Arcy and my Department on such matters.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, I have recently become aware, through media coverage, that some childcare providers may face difficulties in obtaining insurance, as a result of the apparent withdrawal of a particular insurer operating in that sector.  This may, in particular impact those providers that have open insurance claims against them, for example, and are unable to secure an alternative provider.  This is a worrying development and is not too dissimilar to the withdrawal of other operators in the leisure sector earlier this year.  From Minister of State D&rsquo;Arcy&rsquo;s dealings with some of these insurers, including his meetings in London in September, it is likely that the overall unstable claims environment in Ireland as well as uncertainty created by Brexit have been factors in the decision of the company in question. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware however, there are significant constraints on what the Government can do to immediately resolve issues around the cost and availability of insurance.  In this regard, neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, have any influence over the pricing of insurance products, and neither can we compel any insurer operating in the Irish market to provide cover to any sector of the market, as this is a commercial matter for insurers.  A further constraint is the fact that for constitutional reasons, the Government cannot direct the courts as to the award levels that should be applied.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding these constraints, reducing the high cost of insurance generally and making Ireland more attractive to new entrants has been a priority for the Government.  The Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG) was established in July 2016 and undertook an examination of the factors contributing to the increasing cost of insurance in order to identify what short, medium and long-term measures could be introduced to help reduce the cost of insurance for consumers, businesses and the voluntary and arts sectors.  The CIWG has produced two reports the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance and the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance.  <\/p>  <p>  Many reforms have been made already including amendments to the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004, the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act, and the establishment of National Claims Information Database in the Central Bank of Ireland. However it is clear that the single biggest challenge that still needs to be addressed and which is having the most impact in the general public liability area is the level of awards that exist in Ireland, for relatively minor injuries, as compared to other jurisdictions.  In this regard, the key recommendation arising from both of the CIWG&rsquo;s reports was the establishment of the Personal Injuries Commission (PIC) and the publication of its two reports.  The PIC conducted a benchmarking of award levels between Ireland and other jurisdictions for the first time and this has been very helpful in identifying the scale of the problem that is faced.  This research showed that award levels for soft tissue injuries in Ireland were 4.4 times higher than in England and Wales. The PIC recommended that a Judicial Council be established and that it should compile guidelines for appropriate general damages for various types of personal injury.  In carrying out this exercise, the PIC believes that the Judiciary will take account of the jurisprudence of the Court of Appeal, the results of its benchmarking exercise, etc.  On foot of this recommendation, the Government with the support of all parties in the Oireachtas prioritised the passing of the Judicial Council Act 2019.  This Act provides for the establishment of a Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee upon the formal establishment of the Judicial Council.  This Committee is tasked with introducing new guidelines to replace the Book of Quantum. <\/p>  <p>  Work to establish the Judicial Council is well underway.  With regard to the Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee and the subsequent publication of its new guidelines to recalibrate award levels and replace the Book of Quantum, it is a matter for the Judiciary to put in motion the necessary process to expedite these.  The first important step in this process was the recent announcement by the Chief Justice of the names of the seven &ldquo;members designate&rdquo; of the Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee (PIGC), which will be chaired by Ms Justice Mary Irvine of the Supreme Court.  This is a significant step forward as I believe it is a recognition of the prioritisation that the Judiciary are giving to this issue. <\/p>  <p>  I am hopeful that the creation of personal injury damage guidelines by the Judiciary can result in the lowering of award levels.  Were this to happen, I would expect a lowering of the costs of insurance generally.  I would also expect that insurers operating in Ireland would widen the areas of risk they will cover, as I believe that cherry picking only the most profitable areas of insurance, which appears to be happening at the moment, does not serve anyone&rsquo;s overall economic interest over the medium to long term.  I note the comments made by the Interim Insurance Ireland CEO Gerry Hassett recently that if award levels come down so will premiums.  I believe that this is a very reassuring commitment and it is one the Government intends holding the insurance industry to.

fees paid by an individual for a third level education course, subject to the terms and conditions set out in that section. The relief is granted at the standard rate of income tax (currently 20%), where an individual pays qualifying fees for an approved course, whether on his or her own behalf, or on behalf of another individual. Fees which are met from any other source, from a grant or scholarship for example, are not allowable.  In addition, examination fees, administration fees and registration fees do not qualify for relief. <\/p>  <p>  The maximum amount of fees that can qualify for the relief is &euro;7,000 per course.  However, an amount must be disregarded from each claim, whether the claim is in respect of one or more students. &ldquo;Qualifying fees&rdquo; for the purposes of the relief mean tuition fees in respect of an approved course, at an approved college, reduced by the amount of the \"student contribution\". The disregarded \"student contribution\" amount is currently &euro;3,000 in the case of a full-time course and &euro;1,500 in the case of a part-time course, and it applies to all third level courses.  This means the first &euro;3,000 or &euro;1,500, as appropriate, of all fees claimed by an individual taxpayer does not attract tax relief. As a claim may relate to one or more students, generally claimants will get full tax relief on the tuition fees for each of the second and subsequent students in their claim. <\/p>  <p>  I am informed by Revenue that it is not possible to identify the number of courses per claimant, or the breakdown between full and part time courses, from the available data in relation to the disregard for third-level tuition fees. It is therefore not possible to provide an estimate of the tax cost associated with the proposed abolition of the disregard amount, as outlined by the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121200052#WRC01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Tax","counter":166,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121200052#WRC01600"},{"type":"question","counter":167,"qnumday":72,"qnumall":"[52546\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121200052#WRC01700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"when the refund of RPT will be made in the case of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":168,"content":"<p>This matter was previously addressed in reply to Question No. 41543 on 10 October 2019.

With this information, the Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level.<\/p>  <p>  Information on school enrolments and Child Benefit data allows the Department to map where children are living or attending school and this information provides a degree of certainty in projecting demand in an area in future years.  <\/p>  <p>  Major new residential developments in a school planning area have the potential to alter demand (and timing of demand) in an area. In that regard, as part of the demographic exercises, the Department engages with each of the local authorities to obtain up-to-date information on significant new residential development.  This is necessary to ensure that schools infrastructure planning is aligned with the demographic changes in an area.<\/p>  <p>  The pace of completion of planned housing and occupancy of houses is by its nature less predictable and can vary. Accordingly, while the Department takes into account planned additional residential development, the timing of completion of such development can be subject to change depending on local circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, in April 2018 the Government announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the next four years (2019 to 2022). This announcement follows nationwide, demographic exercises carried out by my Department into the future need for primary and post-primary schools across the country.<\/p>  <p>  From time to time for operational or other reasons the patron of a new school due to open in a certain year may choose to defer the opening.<\/p>  <p>  Of the 18 new schools (primary and post-primary) to be established in 2019, two of the primary schools were deferred by the patron as follows:<\/p>  <p>  A new 8 classroom primary school to serve the Swords\/North school planning area - the patron of the new school advised that there were no enrolments for September 2019 and that the opening of the school has been deferred to September 2020. The patron indicated significant parental interest in relation to enrolments for 2020.<\/p>  <p>  A new 8 classroom primary school to serve the Dunshaughlin school planning area - the patron of the new school advised that there are currently no enrolments for the 2019\/20 school year and that the opening of the school has been deferred from September 2019.  The patron body expects enrolments from a new local housing development which has been delayed in the area and they have received significant interest for September 2020 enrolments for the new school.<\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to liaise with the patrons of these schools. In addition, in the context of further strengthening the demographic analysis process, the Department intends to have additional engagement with patron bodies in relation to their local knowledge on school place requirements.<\/p>  <p>  A patronage process is run after it has been decided, based on demographic analysis, that a new school is required.  This patronage process is open to all patron bodies and prospective patrons. Parental preferences for each patron, from parents of children who reside in the school planning areas concerned, together with the extent of diversity currently available in these areas, are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of this process. <\/p>  <p>  The Online Patronage Process System (OPPS) has been developed by my Department to provide objective information to parents and guardians which will allow them to make an informed choice in expressing a preference for their preferred model of patronage for their child&rsquo;s education.   <\/p>  <p>  The patronage process for new schools is overseen by an external independent advisory group, the New Schools Establishment Group (NSEG). Following their consideration of my Department&rsquo;s assessment reports, the NSEG will submit a report with recommendations to me for consideration and final decision.

In line with the Department&rsquo;s policy however, all schools are expected and encouraged to provide all pupils, to the greatest extent possible and in a meaningful way, with opportunities to participate in Irish language and cultural activities at a level appropriate to their learning needs.<\/p>  <p>  Apart from the circulars, The Department of Education and Skills has provided guidelines and FAQs on exemptions from the study of Irish on our website, which will provide further information to parents and schools who may have questions regarding exemptions from the study of Irish. These can be accessed here: www.education.ie\/en\/Parents\/Information\/Irish-Exemption\/.  <\/p>  <p>  Any student who does not meet the criteria for an exemption from the study of Irish should be provided with a differentiated approach to language learning and any other supports in accordance with Guidelines for supporting pupils with Special Educational Needs in Mainstream Schools and with Special Educational Needs: A continuum of Support.

I am informed that these Garda&iacute; are supported by 39 Garda staff, which again represents a significant increase of 11 Garda staff since the end of 2015.  This increase in Garda staff numbers supports the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative to operational policing duties, where their training and expertise can be used to best effect.

The CSO produces these statistics using data including data recorded on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s PULSE system. <\/p><p>In light of quality issues in relation to PULSE data, the CSO took the decision in early 2017 to postpone further publication of recorded crime statistics.  While the CSO resumed publication of recorded crime statistics, it has done so in a new category entitled &lsquo;Under Reservation&rsquo;. <\/p><p>The CSO has confirmed that this classification has been applied to reflect the fact that there are data quality issues in the underlying sources used to compile the statistics.  The CSO has further indicated that this approach of differentiating statistics based on quality concerns associated with the underlying data, is consistent with other jurisdictions. <\/p><p>The CSO is engaging with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to set out the criteria for the lifting of the reservation. These criteria will address quality concerns across a broader range of issues. They will address issues such as data governance, training, crime data recording procedures and the auditing and monitoring of data quality.<\/p><p>Last week I noted the publication of a new statistical release by the CSO on Recorded Crime Detection 2018, the data of which is categorised as &lsquo;under reservation&rsquo;. I welcome the fact that improvements in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in particular in terms of data governance including upgrade of the Pulse system had facilitated preparation and publication of this report by the CSO. The report provides a snapshot of the extent to which crimes reported to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2018 have been detected.  Detection is understood in this context as identification and sanction of at least one suspected offender; or, in a very limited set of circumstances, a verified exception whereby an offender is not directly sanctioned because, for example, the DPP decides that prosecution is not in the public interest or the suspected offender dies prior to any prosecution.<\/p><p>In publishing this report, the CSO explicitly confirmed that the report constituted a 'significant break' in the previous series for measuring crime detection rates in Ireland. This means that detection rates set out in the CSO report issued for 2018 are not comparable with figures published in earlier years.  <\/p><p>The report is available at the following link: <\/p><p> <\/p><p>It is important to note that the most recent CSO report was made possible by progress in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which has improved the quality and consistency of recording of crime data. This establishes a reliable baseline against which operational decisions can be considered by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and further progress can be ensured and measured.  As the Deputy may be aware, the Policing Authority is responsible for overseeing the performance of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of its functions relating to policing services, and accordingly has the primary oversight role in relation to these matters, including any issues arising from the historical inaccuracies in the recording of detections on PULSE.  The welcome clarity which the CSO has brought to this issue through this new and more reliable assessment of detections will be of assistance to the Authority in that independent oversight task and will also be of assistance to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as it continues to improve the policing services it provides nationwide.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121200054#WRE03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Expenditure","counter":308,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121200054#WRE03700"},{"type":"question","counter":309,"qnumday":121,"qnumall":"[52501\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121200054#WRE03800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the estimated cost in 2021 of increasing the number of sworn garda&iacute; to 15,000 by the end of 2021; and the estimated extra cost in each of the years 2022 to 2025 to maintain that level of strength.","asker":"1237","askee":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":310,"qnumday":122,"qnumall":"[52502\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121200054#WRE03900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the estimated extra cost in 2021 of increasing the number of civilians working within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 4,000 by the end of 2021; and the estimated extra cost in each of the years 2022 to 2025 of maintaining that number.","asker":"1237","askee":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":311,"qnumday":123,"qnumall":"[52503\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121200054#WRE04000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the estimated extra cost in 2021 of increasing the number of the Garda Reserve to 2,000 by the end of 2021; and the estimated extra cost in each of the years 2022 to 2025 of maintaining that number.","asker":"1237","askee":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":312,"qnumday":124,"qnumall":"[52504\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121200054#WRE04100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the estimated extra cost in 2021 of increasing the number of sworn garda&iacute; to 15,000 by the end of 2021; the estimated extra cost in 2022 to increase it to 15,200; the estimated extra cost in 2023 to increase it to 15,400; the estimated extra cost to increase it to 15,600 in 2024; and the estimated extra cost to increase it to 16,000 in 2025.","asker":"1237","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":313,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 121 to 124, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>Under section 43(1) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, the Garda Commissioner is the Accounting Officer for the Garda vote.

Applicants can now also seek a once-off grant of up to &euro;5,000 for minor maintenance costs.<\/p><p>I must emphasise that grant funding can be considered only for CCTV systems which meet the legal requirements for CCTV, in other words CCTV systems which have been approved by the relevant Joint Policing Committee, the relevant Local Authority (also acting as Data Controller) and which have received the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner.<\/p><p>If the Deputy is aware of groups wishing to avail of the scheme, further details are available to download from my Department's website - www.justice.ie and support and guidance is available to help interested groups through a dedicated email address fundsadmin-comm-based-cctv@justice.ie.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121200054#WRE05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Deportation Orders Re-examination","counter":320,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121200054#WRE05200"},{"type":"question","counter":321,"qnumday":127,"qnumall":"[52528\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121200054#WRE05300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if a review of the decision to deport will be undertaken in the case of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":322,"content":"<p>I must inform the Deputy that, under section 47(5) of the International Protection Act 2015 (<i>the 2015 Act)<\/i>, I refused to give the person concerned a refugee or subsidiary protection declaration.

data is collated by the HSE, the questions have been referred to the HSE for attention and direct reply to the Deputy.  This reply was taken as a composite with 52252\/19, 52253\/19 and 52254\/19. <\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health takes the management of patient safety very seriously. In November 2015, the Government approved a major programme of patient safety reforms which included the establishment of a National Patient Safety Office (NPSO) in the Department of Health. The NPSO was established in December 2016 to oversee a programme of patient safety measures. The programme of patient safety centres on initiatives such as the establishment of a national patient advocacy service, the introduction of a patient safety surveillance system, the measurement of patient experience and extending the clinical effectiveness agenda.<\/p>  <p>  The Department is currently progressing a number of pieces of legislation which seek to enhance the safety and quality of the provision of health care services. This includes the Patient Safety (Licensing) Bill which will ensure that providers of health services operate at core standards which are applied in a consistent and systematic way. Under this legislation public and private hospitals and providers of high-risk healthcare activities taking place outside a hospital setting will require a license to operate. <\/p>  <p>  The Patient Safety  (Notifiable Patient Safety Incidents) Bill 2019 was approved by Government on 3 December for publication. This Bill provides for the extension of the remit of the Health Information and Quality Authority, to private hospitals. HIQA will be able to set standards for the operation of private hospitals, monitor compliance and undertake inspections of the services.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, on 25 October 2017, I launched the National Standards on the Conduct of Reviews of Patient Safety Incidents. These standards, developed jointly by HIQA and the Mental Health Commission, set out a new approach to the way health providers respond to, review and investigate incidents in order to determine as quickly as possible what may have transpired, and why, to ensure that they can immediately implement any improvements necessary to prevent a re-occurrence.  The HSE in turn developed the Incident Management Framework (2018) to support implementation of these standards. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121200057#WRH04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Primary Care Centres","counter":493,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121200057#WRH05000"},{"type":"question","counter":494,"qnumday":186,"qnumall":"[52255\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121200057#WRH05100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the examination undertaken of the use of incentives to support investment by general practitioners, dentists and other professionals in primary care centres, technology and service developments","asker":"1436","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":495,"content":"<p>I understand that my colleague the Minister for Finance will respond to you on the use of tax instruments to support investment by health professionals. <\/p><p>At this time, no other incentives are offered to health professionals to encourage investment in Primary Care Centres (PCCs). <\/p><p>Under the Primary Care Centre Infrastructure Programme, there are currently 128 centres operational throughout the country which is an indication of the very significant progress made so far.

The HSE, therefore, reports monthly progress on savings under the three main ranges of actions rather than the specific proposed types of savings as set out in the Service Plan.<\/p><p>In relation to the cost reduction\/improved income generation actions\/initiatives the HSE has reported performance to September 2019 as follows. <table>    <tr>       <th>Service Area<\/th>       <th>Profile   to Sept&rsquo;19<\/th>       <th>Actual   to Sept&rsquo;19<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Acute Hospitals<\/td>       <td>&euro;40m<\/td>       <td>&euro;35m<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Community Operations<\/td>       <td>&euro;30m<\/td>       <td>&euro;30m<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>National Divisions<\/td>       <td>&euro;11m<\/td>       <td>&euro;25m<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Other including PCRS<\/td>       <td>&euro;16m<\/td>       <td>&euro;5m<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Total<\/td>       <td>&euro;97m<\/td>       <td>&euro;95m<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121200058#WRJ03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","counter":536,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121200058#WRJ03500"},{"type":"question","counter":537,"qnumday":200,"qnumall":"[52269\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121200058#WRJ03600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the progress made to date in the implementation of the 45 recommendations of the trauma steering group in tabular form.","asker":"1436","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":538,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to you directly as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121200058#WRJ03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cancer Screening Programmes","counter":539,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121200058#WRJ03800"},{"type":"question","counter":540,"qnumday":201,"qnumall":"[52270\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121200058#WRJ03900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the progress made to date in the implementation of the recommendations of the Scally report in tabular form.","asker":"1436","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":541,"content":"<p>Following publication of the Final Report of the Scoping Inquiry into the CervicalCheck Screening Programme in September 2018, a comprehensive Implementation Plan was developed to support implementation of all recommendations made by the Scoping Inquiry.

Key to this is expanding the role of drug and alcohol liaison midwives across all maternity networks. <\/p><p>Pregnant women who use drugs (mainly opioids or methadone) have complex medical and social needs and are at increased risk of having babies with low birth weight (and the likelihood that the babies will require neonatal intensive care).

The midwives work in special clinics in the hospitals and link in with community addiction services. They support pregnant opioid-dependent women throughout their pregnancy and for six weeks post-natal. An assessment of the drug midwife service found that it built effective working relationships between drug-dependent pregnant women, obstetric services and drug treatment services. <\/p><p>In line with action 20 in the national drugs strategy, the Department is supporting the HSE to expand the provision of drug and alcohol liaison midwives in community addiction services and maternity networks across the country.

The Act specifies criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines.<\/p>  <p>  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions. The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess a drug's clinical and cost effectiveness as a health intervention.<\/p>  <p>  As a country, we invest heavily in medicines, to the tune of almost &euro;2 billion annually. In 2019 to date, the HSE has approved 31 new medicines and 5 new indications for existing medicines for reimbursement in the public healthcare system. The approvals to date represent an additional investment by the HSE over five years of approximately &euro;220m in providing access to new and innovative treatment for Irish patients. It is expected that over 3,000 patients will benefit from access to these new medicines over the next 5 years.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the significant progress on drug costs achieved from price reductions under the pricing framework agreed with industry and commercial negotiations conducted by the HSE, the Health Service is still facing very significant challenges in relation to the affordability of medicines.  The industry continues to develop very expensive products, particularly in the high-tech medicines area and the costs involved are a challenge for health systems even in countries with much greater resources than Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has received 2 applications for pricing and reimbursement of ocrelizumab (Ocrevus).  Application 1 is for use of Ocrelizumab for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing forms of Multiple Sclerosis (RMS) with active disease defined by clinical or imaging features. Following a number of rounds of commercial negotiations, an agreement was reached in relation to the commercial terms which will apply to this indication. The HSE intends to progress ocrelizumab for the RMS indication, which has been approved for funding from October 2019, on a patient-specific basis for this indication.<\/p>  <p>  Application 2 is for the use of ocrelizumab for the treatment of adult patients with early primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) in terms of disease duration and level of disability, and with imaging features characteristic of inflammatory activity. On 4 October 2018 the NCPE completed its assessment for this indication. They did not recommend that ocrelizumab be reimbursed for this indication.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE and the manufacturer have had a number of rounds of commercial negotiations in relation to this indication. Commercial discussions have concluded and the medicine has been reviewed by the HSE Drugs Group.  The HSE Senior Leadership Team have received the Drugs Group recommendation. The HSE's final decision on reimbursement will take into consideration the criteria contained in the 2013 Health Act.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has also received an application for reimbursement of Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol\/Cannabidiol, THC\/CBD (Sativex) which is indicated as treatment for symptom improvement in adult patients with moderate to severe spasticity due to multiple sclerosis who have not responded adequately to other anti-spasticity medication and who demonstrate clinically significant improvement in spasticity related symptoms during an initial trial of therapy.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE commissioned a full HTA with respect to this indication in April 2018. On 12 August 2019, the NCPE received the applicant's submission and the HTA is currently underway.<\/p>  <p>  The Government wants new and innovative medicines to be available to our citizens as quickly as possible but this can only be achieved if medicines are priced by the pharmaceutical industry in a viable and sustainable manner.<\/p>  <p>  In an effort to identify workable solutions to the challenges which we face, I proposed a dialogue with Industry to explore ways in which new medicines might be more easily introduced in Ireland.  This invitation was built on the premise that any innovative approaches that may be tabled must be compatible with the statutory provisions which are in place and must also recognise the context of finite Exchequer resources.  It was in this context that an Open Policy Forum took place in 2018 between the Department of Health, the Department of Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and the Irish Healthcare Pharmaceutical Association (IPHA) in 2018 and an Open Dialogue meeting took place in 2019 between the Department of Health, the HSE and IPHA in relation to new medicines.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121200061#WRM04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Discharges","counter":696,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121200061#WRM04800"},{"type":"question","counter":697,"qnumday":265,"qnumall":"[52419\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121200061#WRM04900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 318 of 26 November 2019, the national total of delayed discharges by month to date 2019.","asker":"1302","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":698,"content":"<p>Delayed transfers of care (previously referred to as delayed discharges) occur when patients have been deemed clinically fit for discharge from an acute bed but their discharge is delayed because they are waiting for some form of ongoing support or care following their discharge. There are many reasons for this, such as a patient undertaking the application process for NHSS, awaiting assessment for a home support package, homelessness, ward of court application, and the availability of resources.<\/p>  <p>  When possible, the HSE will use transitional care to accommodate the patient during the period between discharge and the finalisation of new care arrangements, but there can often be a delay, especially in cases where the patient and family are coming to terms with the new circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  This year, services are being stretched more than ever, with demand consistently outstripping supply, and we have seen an increase the number of delayed transfers of care. While the HSE maximises the use of resources, prioritising those requiring discharge from acute hospitals, there is a growing demand for egress support. In response, and in the context of planning and preparing for the challenges of the winter period, the Department and the HSE have been considering a comprehensive approach to the current high-level of DTOCs. However, recognising the urgency of the situation, approval was provided to the HSE to begin actions immediately to the value of &euro;5m in 2019.  As part of these measures the HSE released a significant number of funding approvals within NHSS in September, and provided additional home care and transitional care beds.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the HSE Winter Plan was launched on Thursday 14 November. The aim of the Winter Plan is to ensure that service providers are prepared for the additional external pressures associated with the winter period, including the prolonged holiday period, severe winter weather, seasonal influenza, and the spread of norovirus and other healthcare associated infections.<\/p>  <p>  Nine Winter Action Teams, each aligned to a Community Healthcare Organisation and associated acute hospitals and Hospital Groups, have prepared Integrated Winter Plans. These plans focus on demand management and reduction, staffing availability, timely access to the most appropriate care pathway for patients, and appropriate timely discharge from acute hospitals.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE Winter Plan is supported by an additional &euro;26m in winter funding nationally.

These relate to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the associated Kyoto Protocol and Paris Agreement.  <\/p><p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) prepares inventories of past, and projections of future, greenhouse gas emissions for Ireland on an annual basis and also reports on Ireland's compliance with its EU climate targets. According to Ireland&rsquo;s National Inventory Report 2019, Ireland&rsquo;s LULUCF sector was a net source of emissions in the period 1990-2017. This is largely due to grasslands and wetlands, which are major sources of emissions due to drainage of organic soils. Forest Land and Harvested Wood Products are the main carbon sinks in the LULUCF sector.<\/p><p>The EPA does not publish LULUCF emissions projections in its annual projections report as these sources are not currently in the scope of Ireland&rsquo;s non-ETS targets for 2020 under the EU Effort Sharing Decision. However, from 2021 onwards these emissions will be integrated into the EU framework for compliance with national emissions targets. It is, therefore, essential that Ireland has robust policies in place to manage emissions and enhance removals from relevant LULUCF sectoral categories.<\/p><p>The Climate Action Plan, published in June, includes 34 individual actions to facilitate the development and implementation of policies to manage emissions and enhance removals from the Agriculture, Forestry and Land Use sectors. These include:<\/p><p>- increasing afforestation rates from their current levels to an average of 8,000 ha per year;<\/p><p>- undertaking further research to assess the potential to sequester, store and reduce emissions of carbon through the management, restoration and rehabilitation of peatlands;<\/p><p>- realising the emissions reduction potential of at least 40,000 ha of grasslands on drained organic soils; and<\/p><p>- creating additional incentives to adopt carbon-positive, post-production management options on Bord na M&oacute;na lands, commercial and private peat extraction sites.<\/p><p>The Plan sets out for the first time how Ireland will reach its 2030 targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and put Ireland on the right trajectory towards net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. The Plan sets out, in Chapter 3, the expected emissions abatement contribution from existing commitments under Project Ireland 2040 and from LULUCF measures. The Plan includes the necessary targets and measures, supported by detailed actions and roadmaps, to close the identified remaining gap of 58.4 MtCO2eq in the non-ETS sector.

The Scheme is subject to state aid approval from the EU Commission.    The Climate Action Plan targets the delivery of indicative volumes of up to 1.5 GW of grid scale solar by 2030.

The Draft Childminding Action Plan aims to bring all childminders within the scope of public funding, supports, and regulations. Up to now most childminders have been exempt from regulation and therefore would be excluded from public funding such as the National Childcare Scheme. Central to the Draft Childminding Action Plan is a proposal to develop new Regulations that are specific to childminders and that are proportionate and appropriate to the home and family setting in which childminders work.<\/p>  <p>  The Draft Action Plan is firmly based on the recommendations of the Working Group on Reforms and Supports for the Childminding Sector, which I established in 2016 and which submitted its report to me last year. The Working Group was chaired by a representative of childminders, indicating my commitment to putting childminders front and centre of decisions on their future and the future of the service they offer children and families. <\/p>  <p>The public consultation process on the Draft Childminding Action Plan began on 29th   August 2019 and ran until November. The process involved several elements: a call for submissions which had 14 responses, an online survey which had 467 responses, 32 Focus Group meetings with childminders at county level (with 205 childminders participating in total) and an Open Policy Debate (with 55 participants). <\/p>  <p>  The findings of the consultation process are currently being analysed. Once the analysis is complete, the Childminding Action Plan will be finalised and then published, in the early part of 2020, once approved by Government. <\/p>  <p>  The final plan will require both primary and secondary legislation. Amendments to primary legislation will be required in order to allow childminders to register with Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, as early years services. Secondary legislation will be required in the form of new Regulations that are specific and appropriate to childminders.<\/p>  <p>  The Draft Childminding Action Plan proposes a phased approach to reform. It proposes that amendments to primary legislation and development of new, childminder-specific Regulations will be developed during Phase 1 of the Action Plan. The Draft Action Plan suggests that it is likely to take two to three years before new Regulations come into force.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121200064#WRP04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foster Care Expenditure","counter":876,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121200064#WRP04900"},{"type":"question","counter":877,"qnumday":325,"qnumall":"[52320\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121200064#WRP05000","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the amount of funding allocated to an association (details supplied) in each of the past four years; the mechanisms in place to ensure value for money for the taxpayer; if she is satisfied with the governance of the organisation; the number of senior managers who have left the organisation; if a company covers Tusla and the association for all of their insurance requirements; if the cover extends to each foster carer; if the insurance issue relative to foster carers is resolved; if the changes in the structure at regional level involving volunteers and other management structure changes have been approved; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1248","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":878,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his question.

The Department issued two corporate credit cards in June 2018; one to the Minister's Office and the second for use by the Department's Finance Unit. Total expenditure on the cards amounted to &euro;7,777.12 in 2018 and &euro;19,621.92 to date in 2019. No interest expense has accrued to date as the account has been cleared on a monthly basis.<\/p>  <p>  Robust internal financial control procedures are in place in the Department to ensure that expenditure on departmental credit cards is strictly limited to official expenditure in accordance with a departmental credit card policy. Approval is required  from the relevant budget holder prior to incurring expenditure. Credit card statements are closely monitored to ensure that cards are used for official purposes only and that any expense is necessarily incurred in the performance of official duties. Receipts are retained and matched against individual credit card transactions following receipt of the monthly statement.

This was followed by a major public consultation exercise.<\/p><p>Three years later, in 2010, Minister Hanafin launched the National Pensions Framework which, following a Government decision, set out the agenda of changes in the State Pension Age in 2014, 2021 and 2028. <\/p><p>This strategy was enacted via legislation introduced by then Minister Burton and passed in 2011 which provides for an increase in the State pension age in three separate stages.  In 2014, the State pension age was standardised at 66.  This will be increased to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028.  The Roadmap for Pensions Reform 2018-2023 has stated that future changes in State pension age after 2035 will be based on research into life expectancy.  This is in keeping with similar measures introduced by most EU and OECD countries. <\/p><p>This sustainability is vital, if the current workers, who fund State pension payments through their PRSI, are to receive a pension themselves when they reach retirement age.  It is the only feasible solution which does not involve reducing pension rates to pensioners (which would result in an increase in the rate of poverty among older people), or reducing other significant areas of Government expenditure (such as other payments made by my Department). <\/p><p>It is estimated that the gross cost to the State Pension (Contributory) of postponing the increase in State Pension Age would be approximately &euro;430m per annum, but the net cost is closer to &euro;217.5 million per annum, and is expected to increase.  The estimates factor in secondary costs such as foregone PRSI receipts and additional Household Benefit payments.<\/p><p>Therefore the additional estimated net cost to the SIF of a decision to retain State Pension Age at 66 for the period 2021 - 2025 would be around &euro;1.1 Billion.<\/p><p>We further estimate that an increase of &euro;5 per week to recipients of the SPC and the SPNC would cost c. &euro;160 million in 2021. <\/p><p>Given the long timeframe and prospective demographic changes it is very difficult to estimate the cumulative cost of further &euro;5 annual increases over the period 2021 - 2025 for SPC and SPNC recipients but would certainly be in the order of &euro;3 Billion.<\/p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121200066#WRR01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Domiciliary Care Allowance Applications","counter":964,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121200066#WRR01900"},{"type":"question","counter":965,"qnumday":355,"qnumall":"[52547\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121200066#WRR02000","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the position regarding an application for a domiciliary care allowance in the case of a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":966,"content":"<p>The lady concerned is in receipt of Domiciliary Care Allowance (DCA) for two children, one since 2015 and one since 2017; there is no other application for DCA pending at this time.<\/p><p>The child who is in payment since 2015 was amongst a number of DCA cases randomly selected earlier this year for a review of their continued entitlement to the payment.

In multi-unit developments, the &quot;person having control&quot; is generally the Owner Management Company.  <\/p><p>Under the Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011, (which is under the remit of the Minister for Justice and Equality), the owner management company must establish a scheme for annual service charges and a sinking fund for spending on refurbishment, improvement or maintenance of a non-recurring nature of the multi-unit development. <\/p><p>In the interest of supporting owners and residents living in developments where concerns regarding non-compliance with fire safety requirements arise, it was agreed that a review be undertaken by an independent fire expert to develop a framework for general application.  In August 2017, the  Framework for Enhancing Fire Safety in Dwellings was published, which is intended to be used as a guide by the owners and occupants of dwellings where fire safety deficiencies have been identified, or are a cause for concern. The Framework will also be of assistance to professional advisors, both in developing strategies to improve fire safety and in developing strategies to enable continued occupation in advance of undertaking the necessary works to ensure compliance with the relevant Building Regulations.

The allocation of funding to Screen Ireland in 2020 will be\u00a0 over &euro;21m. <\/p>  <p>  Screen Ireland works in conjunction with the enterprise agencies to support the development of the film sector to make a substantial contribution to inward investment.\u00a0 It promotes Ireland as a location for international production by providing advice and support for international companies seeking to locate production activity here, organising inward and outward trade missions on an annual basis and working in partnership with EU counterparts on co-productions. Earlier this year, in the course of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s trade mission to LA, Screen Ireland announced its intention to establish a presence in Los Angeles<\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s &lsquo;Global Ireland 2025&rsquo; initiative, which was launched last year, lists film as a high-impact way of promoting Ireland on the global stage.\u00a0 Under the initiative &lsquo;Bringing our Culture and Heritage to the Wider World&rsquo; also committed to boosting Screen Ireland&rsquo;s presence in Los Angeles and Screen Ireland will establish a new base in Los Angeles in 2020.\u00a0 Strengthening the base in Los Angeles will allow for the building and managing of relationships with major US studios and content producers, communication of the opportunities available in Ireland, and identifying upcoming, portable productions that could locate in Ireland. \u00a0It also delivers on an aim in the Audiovisual Action Plan for Screen Ireland to provide a stronger presence in key markets such as Los Angeles. <\/p>  <p>  The Audiovisual Action Plan is an industry-wide, long-term plan, under the Creative Ireland Programme and part of Government policy to support the audiovisual industry. In April 2018, I joined with the Taoiseach and Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, in launching my Department&rsquo;s capital investment plan: 'Investing in our Culture, Language and Heritage 2018 &ndash; 2027&rsquo;. This plan incorporated an amount of &euro;200m to be invested in media production and the audiovisual industry over the next 10 years and represented a first step in the Government&rsquo;s ambitions to enable Ireland to become a global hub for the production of film, TV drama and animation. The investment will be delivered through Screen Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Other Government supports to the sector include international film co-production treaties, an annual international programme of Irish film festivals, through engaging high-profile talent to project a positive image of Ireland and reflect Ireland as a creative place and the Section 481 tax relief,. Earlier this year, I was pleased to welcome EU Commission approval in respect of two aspects of Ireland's tax credit: the extension of the Section 481 credit until 2024 provides certainty for film production companies on the future availability of the credit, ensuring the continued growth of our film industry. It is a key recommendation in the Audiovisual Action Plan. A further key measure under the Plan saw the introduction of the Regional Film Development Uplift which offers an additional tapered tax credit over a period of 4 years. This is an important step in support of this Government&rsquo;s ambition to make Ireland a global hub for the production of Film, TV Drama and Animation in supporting creative talent in Ireland and helping to develop a vibrant creative audio-visual sector throughout the country. <\/p>  <p>  I\u00a0will continue to work to\u00a0support the development and expansion of the film and television production sector. In that regard\u00a0my Department will continue both to work\u00a0with Screen Ireland to ensure that Ireland is maximised as a location for both indigenous and international film production and to work with colleagues across Government and the industry on the\u00a0implementation of the Audiovisual Action Plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121200067#WRS03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Arts Promotion","counter":1037,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121200067#WRS03200"},{"type":"question","counter":1038,"qnumday":379,"qnumall":"[52450\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121200067#WRS03300","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the extent to which she has been able to assist directly or through other bodies the arts at local level; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1243"},{"type":"question","counter":1039,"qnumday":380,"qnumall":"[52451\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121200067#WRS03400","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the degree to which she continues to have ongoing contact with local community groups with a view to promoting interest in the arts in its various forms at local level; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1243"},{"type":"question","counter":1040,"qnumday":383,"qnumall":"[52454\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121200067#WRS03500","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the extent to which she has contact with the arts section of Kildare County Council with a view to promotion of the arts in the county; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1243"},{"type":"speech","counter":1041,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 379, 380 and 383 together.<\/p><p>Under Budget 2020, total funding for the arts and culture sector in 2020 will increase by over 2% from &euro;189m to almost &euro;193m.\u00a0 <\/p><p>Primary support for the Arts is delivered through the Arts Council.

The report measured the economic value of the Irish audiovisual industry, and proposed policy changes to support its future growth.\u00a0 The report showed that the Irish audiovisual sector generated &euro;1.05 billion in gross value added in 2016 and supported employment of 16,930 full-time equivalents of which 10,560 was direct employment.\u00a0\u00a0 The largest contribution to employment came from the film, TV, and animation sub-sector, which generated 11,960 full-time equivalent jobs (FTEs) of employment of which just over 7,000 was direct employment such as cast and crew.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The audiovisual sector supports thousands of jobs of Ireland and there is significant potential for further growth in the years ahead.\u00a0 I recently published the First Progress Report on Implementation of the Audiovisual Action Plan. <\/p>  <p>  This Government highly values the cultural, creative and economic potential of Ireland&rsquo;s audiovisual industry and the report sets out the initiatives undertaken to date to make Ireland a global hub for TV drama, film and animation. Key achievements since the plan&rsquo;s launch in June 2018 include: the extension of Section 481 Film tax relief until 2024, along with changes to improve the administration of the relief; the introduction of the Regional Film Development Uplift, which offers additional tax reliefs to incentivise film production in the regions; increased funding for Screen Ireland which has increased to over &euro;21m for 2020 and will support increased investment in feature film and TV drama. These initiatives, together with a renewed emphasis on training and skills development in the audiovisual industry will continue to contribute to the growth of jobs in the sector. <\/p>  <p>  The remit of Culture Ireland, a division of my Department, is to promote and advance Irish arts worldwide thus strengthening Ireland&rsquo;s cultural profile and global reputation.\u00a0 Strategic priorities include providing support for the international presentation of Irish artists and arts organisations, developing new and diverse international audiences and markets for Irish arts, and linking culture into the Government&rsquo;s international promotion strategy in tandem with other relevant Government Agencies.

The existing National Parks are managed from a conservation perspective, and attract in excess of 4 million visitors annually. Given the resources available for capital investment within our National Parks and Nature Reserves, I am ever mindful of the need to focus on the core responsibilities relating to the management of the existing Parks and Reserves lands and have no plans at present to increase the number of National Parks in the country.<\/p><p>As far as our marine heritage is concerned, it is protected by such designations as Special Areas of Conservation (SAC) and Special Protection Areas (SPA). It is worth noting that roughly 53% of SACs is land, the remainder being marine or large lakes. Ireland&rsquo;s SPA Network encompasses over 570,000 hectares of marine and terrestrial habitats. The marine areas include some of the productive intertidal zones of our bays and estuaries that provide vital food resources for several wintering wader species including Dunlin, Knot and Bar-tailed Godwit. Marine waters adjacent to the breeding seabird colonies and other important areas for seaducks, divers and grebes are also included in the network. <\/p><p>As part of my Department&rsquo;s continuing commitment and contribution to protecting our heritage and improving our tourism and recreation product, we have been exploring ways to optimise the sustainable potential of heritage sites under our control in a way that is compatible with conservation objectives. <\/p><p>In this context, it should be noted that in late 2016 my Department negotiated the extension of Wicklow Mountains National Park by purchasing almost 4,900 acres of Dublin Uplands at Glenasmole in 2016 at a cost of &euro;800,000. The purchase underpins the Government&rsquo;s on-going commitment to the preservation of our natural heritage for future generations of citizens and visitors alike to enjoy.<\/p><p>In 2017 the entire Wild Nephin area was consolidated into the ownership of the National Parks and Wildlife Service. This creates a State &ndash; Owned wilderness project of over 11,000 hectares and aims to provide increased nature conservation benefits and biodiversity as well as  enhanced recreational and social benefits through the &lsquo;re-wilding&rsquo; of the forest which adjoins the National Park. Thanks to the acquisition, we will be returning the area to a natural wilderness state.<\/p><p>My Department, in conjunction with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, launched a strategic partnership in 2017 with a view to growing tourism revenues in the rural areas where the parks are located and increasing Ireland&rsquo;s appeal as a recreation destination.  One of the outputs from the partnership with F&aacute;ilte was &ldquo;<i>Experiencing the Wild Heart of Ireland<\/i>&rdquo; &ndash;  an interpretative masterplan for the development of our National Parks and Reserves, which was published last year and sets out a road map for investment at these important nature conservation, public amenity and tourism sites and underpins the objectives of Project 2040 as well as Heritage 2030.  <\/p><p>The investment in our National Parks will create memorable and meaningful experiences of Ireland&rsquo;s landscapes, wildlife and culture. This will be done though sensitive design and the development of authentic experiences, providing better access to nature and an increased understanding of society&rsquo;s conservation responsibilities, as well as supporting significant investment in recreational facilities, including upgrading and development of the trails network, increased visitor facilities and improved signage and branding. These will be designed and delivered with a strong emphasis on conservation and allow us to protect and preserve our most fragile environments and, by investing in our culture, language and heritage, provide a well-being benefit for all.  In this regard, a provision of some &euro;5million in funding, for 32 individual projects across the network of NPWS sites, was announced earlier this year as part of the Rural Regeneration Development Fund. <\/p><p>A whole host of proposals are currently under consideration for Heritage 2030, including increased investment in our heritage, improved access, and better quality of information, guidance and advice as a resource for stakeholders, visitors, researchers and general public. As a result, in the context of protecting marine biodiversity, we will certainly keep under consideration further maritime designations. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121200068#WRT01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"}]
