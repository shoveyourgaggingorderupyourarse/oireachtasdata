I am very grateful for this opportunity.  I will begin with some general points and background.  We know about our own past when it comes to protecting and guarding children and how much it leaves to be desired.  We had all of the events in industrial schools, mother and baby homes, Magdalen laundries and foster homes.  However, Ireland has come a long way in ensuring the safety of children and we have seen the progress that has been made on child welfare and protection.  Even though there is still room for improvement in Ireland we can only imagine what it must be like for children in those countries where they do not have protection and do not have child welfare or safeguards.  The Bill is about trying to protect children who are easy prey for sexual predators in countries where the authorities cannot or will not protect them from those convicted of sexual abuse in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child recognises a child as being a person under the age of 18.  Child abuse is also about trafficking, which is the third biggest illegal industry after arms and drugs and accounts for billions of dollars annually.  Statistics indicate that 2 million children are lured or abducted into sexual exploitation, which is modern-day slavery.  A report by Ending Child Prostitution and Trafficking, ECPAT, International states child sex tourism has drastically increased.  It is a real incongruity that we speak about children and sex tourism in the same sentence.  One of the main reasons is that the increase in global travel has created more opportunities for abuse.  The offenders are generally white, western middle-aged men of some means.  There are also women offenders and we also have situational offenders.  The promotion of tourism for economic growth in these poorer countries brings more and more westerners to places with little or no regulation or policing but more and more children available for sex.  We know the countries involved are India and counties in south-east Asia, Latin America, the Caribbean and Africa.<\/p> <p>  There have been many high-profile cases but I will mention one that I have already mentioned when speaking on this issue.  This is the case of a seven year old child who was sold to a former US marine.  The former marine was eventually extradited from south-east Asia and is serving a very extensive prison sentence in the United States.  We also have records of the sale of virgin girls and organised sex rings.  There is evidence of organisations offering sex tours with stops at bars and restaurants that are fronts for child prostitution.<\/p> <p>  The impetus for the Bill came from meetings with Irish priest, Fr. Shay Cullen, who is directly involved in rescuing children from the sex tourism industry in the Philippines and supporting children affected by it.  We all know the physical, emotional and psychological consequences for children.  There have been cases of suicide, attempted suicide, depression, addiction and sexually transmitted illnesses.  At a press conference I was at with Fr. Cullen he spoke of what has been happening through the dark web and the rise in child pornography.  To join a photo sharing paedophile club on the dark web, applicants must submit pictures of children being abused.  Some clubs insist on the applicant showing himself perpetrating the abuse.  To get the images, men travel to countries where there are ample opportunities to photograph and video such abuse.  The images then give them a pass to access further unlimited images.  This requirement to provide pictures is fuelling travel to poor countries.  We know that cybersex is on the increase.  Fr. Cullen spoke about five and six year olds being abused in this way over the Internet.  The abuse is carried out to order and customers around the world pay per view through money transfer companies.<\/p> <p>  I will give another example from Australia.  In 2017, it emerged that 700 to 800 Australian male convicted child sex offenders were travelling annually to countries in south-east Asia, such as the Philippines, Cambodia and Thailand.  Following this revelation, the Australian Government passed the Passports Legislation Amendment (Overseas Travel by Child Sex Offenders) Act 2017.  It was introduced in the Australian Parliament on 14 June 2017, passed both Houses on 20 June and received assent on 26 June.  It allows a competent authority of the Australian Government to request its Minister for Foreign Affairs to refuse to issue, cancel or order the surrender of a person's Australian passport if his or her name is on a child protection offender register.  This is to prevent reportable offenders from travelling overseas to sexually exploit or abuse vulnerable children.<\/p> <p>  This is a tricky situation for which to legislate because of the constitutional right to travel.  Although it is wonderful to have this right to travel, it was never intended to grant a right to travel to a person to abuse children in other countries when that person has been convicted of child sexual abuse in his or her own country.  The purpose is to regulate and restrict where appropriate sex offenders from travelling abroad in the interests of the common good and to protect persons outside the State from serious harm.  It seeks to do this by increasing the powers of judges.  It is not an outright ban on travelling.  It relates to those convicted of child abuse, whether a physical act of abuse of children or using child pornography films, child abuse images or recordings on phones.  It recognises the constitutional right to travel but also the need to protect children abroad.  The restriction provisions will be decided on a case by case basis by a judge who can weigh up the issues.  There is a lot of constitutional protection.  The convicted person is heard and represented and the judge can hear whether the offender has been genuinely engaging with a recognised rehabilitation programme.  It will be the judge who will strike the balance between the Constitution and the protection of children outside Ireland from those convicted of child abuse in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  I suggest it is not so much about punishing the sex offender with regard to travel as protecting children.  When we look at the facts of the growing child sex tourism to holiday destinations such as Poland, the Philippines and other places, I must question the current freedom of sex offenders to travel to these places.  There is also the frame of mind of the offenders when they return to Ireland from a place that is normalising the abuse and exploitation of children.<\/p> <p>  There are just two sections in the Bill.  It has a narrow remit for obvious reasons.  It is focused on giving powers to judges.  It empowers them on the evidence of child abuse to impose conditions and travel limitations at the time of sentencing or later, when the judge is satisfied there is or is not a risk of offending abroad.<\/p><p>For example, a convicted sex offender may have leave to travel to England for a few days for a funeral or family event, but not to a country where there is known child abuse.<\/p><p> It is a small step, but it would be a clear signal that Ireland - we would be the first country in Europe to do so - does not want its child offenders to be in a position to offend in other countries where child abuse is happening with impunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018112800002#D00200","speaker":"1291","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543395600,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

I propose to highlight some key issues relating to our work with sex offenders, which may assist the committee.  We will be more than happy to answer questions and engage in further discussion on any matter as the committee sees fit.<\/p> <p>  The Probation Service is an agency of the Department of Justice and Equality and the two primary areas of work undertaken by it are offender assessment and offender supervision.  Regarding sex offenders specifically, since the publication of the discussion document of the working group on the integrated management of high risk sex offenders by the then Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in 2009, integrated, interagency and multidisciplinary services have been developed significantly.  Our focus is now on effective risk management, incorporating assessment, supervision, support and the monitoring of sex offenders to reduce the risk of reoffending and the harm that any further offending would cause.  The Probation Service is managing 264 sex offenders in the community.<\/p> <p>  The courts, prior to sentencing, frequently request a probation officer's pre-sanction assessment report on offenders who have pleaded guilty to, or been found guilty of, a sexual offence.  The assessment report identifies issues relevant to the risk assessment and risk management of the offender.  Many convictions for sexual offences attract an immediate custodial sanction.  These sanctions may also include an appropriate community sanction element, with supervision conditions, post custody.<\/p> <p>  To improve the co-ordinated, interagency management of sex offenders, the sex offender risk assessment and management, SORAM, system was developed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Probation Service for the joint assessment and management of the risk posed within the community by convicted sex offenders.  The model itself allows for enhanced working relationships between the personnel in relevant agencies, a structured approach to risk management, a co-ordinated intervention with the offender, higher levels of monitoring, higher levels of appropriate information exchange, more accurate risk assessment, and enhanced child and public safety.<\/p> <p>  The Probation Service welcomes the proposed new section 14A in the principal Act, or head 9 in the general scheme, that places on a statutory basis the assessment and management of risk posed by sex offenders.  It will further strengthen the current SORAM arrangements and make obligatory the sharing of risk-relevant information between the relevant players.<\/p> <p>  Multi-agency approaches to managing the risks posed by sex offenders are essential.  The Probation Service, in partnership with a number of non-governmental organisations and supported through the Department of Justice and Equality, provides a range of additional support services to assist further in the management of risk posed by this category of offenders and their reintegration into society.  We have outlined some of those in our submission.<\/p> <p>  Placing the victim at the forefront of our work is critical, and developing a victim perspective in the offender is paramount.  While our expertise is directed primarily towards offender rehabilitation as a means of reducing victimisation, we recognise that focusing in this way on the offender can lead victims to feel that their safety, rights, needs and interests may not be prioritised.  This should not be the case.  Survivors' advocacy groups work closely with us on initiatives, such as Circles of Support and Accountability, CoSA, and our therapeutic group work programmes.  Other restorative justice approaches include victim-offender mediation.  We facilitate such approaches where appropriate, but only after careful, and often lengthy, preparation.<\/p> <p>  Public protection is the key principle underpinning the management of sex offenders sentenced to prison and under the supervision of the Probation Service.  Therapeutic interventions in prison are in place, including individual and group counselling and offence-focused work from the Irish Prison Service's psychology service, in partnership with the Probation Service.  Within the community, the SORAM arrangements provide for an integrated, multi-agency approach to this work.  Both statutory and non-statutory partners collaborate in this endeavour.<\/p> <p>  It is hoped that changes to the legislation, as proposed, will lead to further developments in responding effectively to sexual aggression and violence.  Such refinements to the Sex Offenders Act 2001 will, among other things, strengthen the ability of statutory agencies to manage sex offenders by placing SORAM on a statutory basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018112800002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Vivian Geiran"},{"type":"speech","time":1543395600,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Geiran.

I am the assistant chief constable with responsibility for the crime operations department, which covers our organised crime, serious crime, public protection, intelligence, and specialist operations branches.  I am relatively new to the post, having just taken it up in September.  With me are Detective Chief Superintendent Paula Hilman, who is the head of the PSNI's public protection unit, and Detective Superintendent Ryan Henderson.<\/p> <p>  It is important to put on the record an apology.  Mr. Alan Smyth from the Northern Ireland Prison Service, NIPS, and chair of the strategic management board, which is under our public protection arrangements, would have liked to have attended.  Unfortunately, he cannot.  The board encompasses some of the multi-agency work that we do.<\/p> <p>  The Criminal Justice (Northern Ireland) Order 2008 established the statutory basis for public protection.  These arrangements are known as the public protection arrangements Northern Ireland, PPANI.  In England, Wales and Scotland, similar arrangements are known as multi-agency public protection arrangements, MAPPA.  The arrangements involve agencies working together and sharing information to better protect the public in a co-ordinated manner.  However, the legislation does not form a corporate body to deliver these.  The relevant criminal justice agencies, such as the police, NIPS, probation service, the health and social care trusts and others, deliver on their own statutory responsibilities and obligations relating to public protection in a joined-up and co-operative way.  It is important to note that the public protection arrangements do not replace existing child protection procedures.<\/p> <p>  The PPANI are governed by a strategic management board, which comprises senior managers from all lead agencies and two lay advisers.  The board is chaired alternately, on a rotational basis, by the PSNI, the Probation Board for Northern Ireland, PBNI, and the NIPS.  Currently, it is chaired by NIPS, with responsibility transferring to the PSNI and Detective Chief Superintendent Hilman in April 2019.<\/p> <p>  There are a number of eligibility criteria for inclusion within the public protection arrangements.<\/p><p>It includes persons who are subject to the notification requirements of part 2 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 or who have been convicted of a sexual offence or sexually motivated offence and are not subject to the notification requirements of part 2 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 but about whom an agency has current significant concerns.  It includes persons who have from 6 October 2008 been convicted of a violent offence, including homicide against a child or vulnerable adult or who have a previous conviction for a violent offence against a child or vulnerable adult and about whom an agency has current significant concerns.  It includes persons who have from 1 April 2010 been convicted of a violent offence, including homicide in domestic or family circumstances or who have a previous conviction for a violent offence in domestic or family circumstances and about whom an agency has significant concerns.  From 1 July 2013, new referrals into PPANI of violence in a domestic or family circumstance must have a minimum conviction of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, AOABH.  It also includes persons who have from 1 September 2011 been convicted under certain circumstances of a violent offence, including homicide, and received an enhanced sentence and where the offence has been aggravated by hostility, and about whom an agency has significant concern.  Persons subject to a risk of sexual harm order, RSHO are also included.<\/p><p> Within the PPANI arrangements offenders are categorised as category 1, 2 or 3.  Persons in category 3 are deemed to pose the highest level of risk of harm.  Where an offender is assessed as meeting the criteria for category 3, management of the case is allocated to the co-located public protection team, PPT.  The PPT consists of line managers and practitioners from the PSNI, PBNI and the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust.  The aim of the PPT is to provide for a consistent level of management of risk for those offenders in the community who represent the greatest cause for concern.  The different disciplines within PPT allow for the delivery of a tailored risk management plan alongside an individual intervention and support plan aimed at developing the offender&rsquo;s internal controls.<\/p><p> Each year PPANI is required to produce an annual report outlining the work undertaken by the relevant agencies involved in public protection.  It has recently published an analytical profile of offenders subject to PPANI arrangements.  The policy and working arrangements for public protection in Northern Ireland are contained within the comprehensive PPANI manual of guidance.<\/p><p> Turning to the aspects of the proposed legislation highlighted within the invitation for today, I thought it would be helpful to highlight some pertinent points.  With regard to notification requirements, in Northern Ireland the Sexual Offences Act 2003, as amended, requires all PPANI eligible offenders to notify within three days of being informed of their requirement to do so.  The three days starts at midnight on the day they were informed.  To notify they must attend at a police station.  They are required to notify a number of matters, including an address at which they will be living, details of any absences of more than three days from that address, travel arrangements and accommodation arrangements during their absence, and proposed travel arrangements outside the United Kingdom.  They are also required to provide fingerprints and permit a photograph to be taken to confirm their identity. These requirements work well in practice.<\/p><p> Offenders are encouraged to disclose details of their offending where appropriate and allow this disclosure to be verified.  If an offender refuses, or the disclosure cannot be verified, then existing agency powers will be used, such as child protection protocols utilised by social services colleagues.  If no power exists, then a PPANI disclosure form will be commenced.  In such cases the PSNI Chief Constable is responsible for making the decision regarding disclosure.<\/p><p> The Justice Act 2015 also introduced the child protection disclosure arrangements.  Under these arrangements a person may apply for conviction information where there are concerns regarding a named person and named children.  If the criteria are met, then disclosure is made to the person best placed to safeguard the child.  We believe these arrangements work well in practice.<\/p><p> There is no specific legislative provision for the electronic monitoring of sex offenders pre or post conviction in Northern Ireland.  There are, however, general powers relating to electronic monitoring applicable to all offenders.  The basis for electronic monitoring of offenders in general is found within the Criminal Justice (Northern Ireland) Order 2008.  The legislation provides the power to impose a curfew or electronic requirement where a condition of bail is granted by a court, where a condition of a licence is specified in article 35(b) of the order, and where it is a requirement of a probation order or youth conference plan.<\/p><p> Foreign travel orders are set out in the Sexual Offences Act 2003, as amended.  Where there are concerns that a specific child, or children in general are at risk of serious sexual harm from an offender, we can apply to court for a foreign travel order which prohibits the offender from travelling to the specified country or any country outside the UK.  The offender will be required to surrender his or her passport.  The offender must be a qualifying offender, which in the main is an offender who has committed a sexual offence against a child or offences relating to indecent images or material relating to a child.  To meet the threshold for a foreign travel order there must be grounds to believe that the offender travelling to a certain country poses a risk to children.<\/p><p> It is our understanding that there are no current plans for legislative change in Northern Ireland in terms of the management of sex offenders.  If any such changes were planned, consultation and implementation would be progressed through the multi-agency public protection arrangements and the strategic management board which will be chaired by Detective Chief Superintendent Hilman from April of next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018112800002#E00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Barbara Gray","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1543395600,"counter":24,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for inviting a representative from the Rape Crisis Ireland Network to speak here today.  We are very grateful for the opportunity.  We have two major areas of concern when it comes to sex offenders.  We must do all we can, even if it amounts to little, to help ensure that the risk from sex offenders in the community is reduced as far as possible and that those responsible for their monitoring, support and supervision have the range of powers necessary to enable them to do their job.  The second concern is perhaps more nebulous, but it is very important.  We are concerned to do as much as possible to ensure that victims of convicted sex offenders do not feel vulnerable or powerless once the person responsible for the offence committed against them is released into the community.  We have to ensure that those victims know that things are being done.  Perhaps in certain cases more can be done.<\/p> <p>  We very much welcome these two pieces of legislation.  The general scheme seems to be very comprehensive.  I will go through a few of the heads to highlight some of our recommendations and to provide the rationale for them.  On head No. 5, notification requirements, we welcome the broadening of powers.  Over the years we have heard much from various members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na about the vagueness of the current Act on the exact detail of how reporting should take place and what happens in special situations, for example, where a person is homeless, disabled or detained outside the jurisdiction.<\/p><p>Over the years we have heard much from members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na about the vagueness of the Act with regard to the exact detail of how reporting should take place and what happens in special situations where somebody is homeless, disabled or detained outside the jurisdiction.  There is much clarity, which we welcome.  The committee might consider including an extra requirement of notification so a sex offender would have to provide any address at which he regularly resides and stays as well as his main home address when he goes to notify a particular member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  <\/p><p> We have also singled out head 9.  I echo what the representatives of the Probation Service said.  It is good that the process of risk assessment and risk management has been finally put on a statutory basis.  It is very important there is effective liaison with local NGOs that support victims, not just rape crisis centres but others.  Why is that important?  It is important to our clients.  It is important they are well informed and informed by the responsible officials about what is being done to supervise and monitor sex offenders in the community.  It is also important that, heaven forfend, they have concerns in the future about the behaviour of a particular individual they know what to do with those concerns.  The general principle is to try to counter the culture of fear, the feeling that one is helpless and the idea that while it is not right for people to take the law into their own hands, it is understood why they did it.  We have to counter that in the interests of good risk management.  With regard to the way it is drafted, with great respect to the drafters, the risk management role, which is important and which goes on for a long time, should be stressed in the language a bit more.  Perhaps they should be called risk assessment and management teams.  We also suggest there is a mechanism for receiving information from third parties.  Sometimes people come into possession of information and think it is really scary and are not sure what to do with it.  It would be great if there was a place they could go with it.  <\/p><p> With regard to head 10, disclosure of information, a number of brakes are put on the process of disclosure where there is a risk of vigilante activity as a result of the disclosure.  Another thing that should be included on the list - I am sure it is at the forefront of the minds of the garda&iacute; in question but it is no harm to include it - is a brake on disclosure where there is a risk to a present or potential future investigation or prosecution.  It would be devastating for survivors if a possible prosecution were jeopardised by misuse of information which had been disclosed in this manner.  Consideration should be given to a sanction for misuse of information.<\/p><p> I will come onto the Bill in a minute but with regard to the general scheme and head 18 on prohibition orders, it is very welcome there is a proposal to introduce orders preventing people who have been convicted of a sex offence from working with children or vulnerable persons.  I have two comments about that.  The first is a general one.  Should these orders not be coextensive with notification requirements so that as long as a person is a sex offender he or she should be precluded absolutely from working with children or vulnerable persons?  I am also concerned about the way it is drafted.  As it is drafted, I am concerned about situations in which somebody is convicted of a sex offence for which the maximum penalty is not life, for example in the case of sexual assault and a maximum sentence of ten years.  If a person gets a high sentence, for example eight years, because the person is a repeat offender or was found guilty of an extremely serious assault, with remission that person will be out in six years.  The remaining possible term of the prohibition order cannot go beyond the overall maximum of ten years.  Therefore, the person will be precluded from working with children for only four years.  It is almost as if that person gets a reward for behaving worse.  It cannot be the intention of the legislation.  With great respect, I suggest the simplest way to fix it is just to make prohibition orders similar to notification requirements so that one is subject to them as long as one is subject to notification requirements.  <\/p><p> I will make one final small point on the general scheme about the discharge of orders.  It has come to our attention several times that people who have been the victims of sex offenders get very upset when these offenders apply, for instance, to no longer be subject to notification requirements.  There are several places in the general scheme as in the current legislation where there are discharge provisions.  I have no objection to people applying for discharge but I think it is right in any of these applications that somebody would get the opportunity to be heard as a victim of sexual violence.  It should be in there.  <\/p><p> We welcome Deputy O'Sullivan's Bill in principle.  It is a terrific idea.  I note with great interest what is happening in Northern Ireland.  Surely if it happening in Northern Ireland it ought to happen here.  I have a small concern.  Perhaps I am wrong to have this concern but nevertheless I have it.  I wonder if it should not be framed in a more tight fashion so there is a clear threshold as there is under the proposed section 26C on prohibition orders and as it is framed in the Northern Irish foreign travel orders that there should be a threshold that has to be overcome before such an order can be made.  I say this being mindful of the right to travel in the Constitution.  My thinking is it might be wise to insulate this provision as far as we can from attack on the grounds that it is unconstitutional or oppressive because it would be great to have it.  It would be a terrific addition to the armoury that we already have.  I thank the committee for its patience.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018112800002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Caroline Counihan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543395600,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Counihan.

I very much welcome the opportunity to be able to discuss the changes proposed under the Sex Offenders (Amendment) Bill and the Private Members' Bill.  I will focus on three of the proposed amendments today.  The first is on the Private Members' Bill, the purpose of which is to regulate and restrict sex offenders from travelling abroad in order to protect persons from serious harm outside of the State.<\/p><p>The proposals echo similar provisions available elsewhere, including the UK, the US and Australia, which have in some way sought to ban or restrict the travel of sex offenders abroad.  The rationale for such provisions is that individuals who have offended against a child pose an extremely high risk of re-offending and that these laws will stop them from doing so.  Perceptions of dangerousness are overestimated to some extent and studies in Ireland and elsewhere have shown that recidivism among sex offenders is low.  The effectiveness of such laws are also in doubt.  In 2016, a global study on sexual exploitation of children in travel and tourism found that sexual exploitation of children in such circumstances is a mainly domestic and intra-regional crime and that situational and domestic offenders account for most cases of such abuse, rather than international preferential offenders.  While some abusers are paedophiles, most are not.Most are situational offenders, namely, those with no prior history of sexual offending against a child.  While child sexual abuse and exploitation is, and should be, an important policy concern for lawmakers, it does little good to enact laws and impose requirements such as travel bans or restrictions when there is no evidence to suggest that such laws are effective in reducing the risk to those they aim to protect.<br\/><br\/>It is necessary to consider rights such as the right to travel, the right to liberty and the right to privacy and family life under both the Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights, ECHR.  Constitutional and-or human rights violations may be found as a result of arbitrary, unnecessary and disproportionate interference with such rights.  In particular, these provisions could give rise to an unjustifiable interference with privacy and family life under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and, perhaps, with earning a livelihood where the individual has to travel for work or to enjoy family life, for example, in a cross-jurisdictional context.  If restrictions rather than a ban are to be placed upon travel, it needs to be made clear how these will be imposed and implemented so that they will not be considered to be arbitrary and unnecessary.  Any restrictions imposed will require increasing the quality, quantity and regularity of the information shared with other jurisdictions on child sex offenders in order to effectively oversee the movement of offenders who travel abroad.  At a practical level this may be difficult to achieve because it becomes a resources issue.  Overall, I would suggest that the circumstances which would give rise to these restrictions need to be clearer; an evidence-based risk should exist and the restriction or ban must be deemed to be proportionate and necessary in all the circumstances.  This could be expressly incorporated into the wording of the provisions.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>My second point is on Head 10 of the main Bill, which deals with community disclosure.  I welcome legislative clarity relating to the disclosure of information to the public, as well as the controlled disclosure approach being proposed.  Generally speaking, disclosure laws are enacted with the objective of preventing recidivistic sex crimes. Such laws may garner strong support in the belief that knowing where sex offenders are will make us safer.  However, the effectiveness of disclosure in this regard has been called into question by countless studies.  Empirical research has not uncovered any demonstrable effect on future sexual offending.  Moreover, rather than reduce fear, disclosure in some circumstances can heighten the fear and anxiety of persons who have received such information.  There is a need for follow-up support in such circumstances.<br\/><br\/>The wording of the proposed provision seems to suggest that the issue of disclosure rests with the Garda and is thus proactive rather than reactive.  I would like clarification on whether the provision intends to be reactive in the sense of permitting applications from parents, guardians or third parties.  While the proposal is not confined to the protection of children insofar as it aims to protect any person, it is worth noting that equivalent provisions in the UK provide that disclosure will only be made to the person-persons best placed to protect the child or vulnerable adult rather than to the public at large.  I would strongly suggest consideration be given to the inclusion of such wording in the context of this provision as well, where it involves protection of a child.  Moreover the provisions does not make any mention of confidentiality of the information once a disclosure has been made.  This is notable, considering that under Head 9, confidentiality is expressly required in relation to information sharing, albeit in a different context.  Confidentiality should apply, in particular with regard to data protection laws.  This should be incorporated into the proposed amendment.  Overall, the provision should expressly provide that disclosure will only be made in exceptional circumstances where considered necessary and proportionate to do so. <br\/><br\/>My final point relates to Heads 13 and 19, which provide for electronic monitoring of sex offenders, either as part of a sex offenders order or as a condition of post-release supervision.  The rationale of such a measure appears to be to monitor compliance or identify risky behaviour.  While measures such as electronic monitoring may provide reassurance and are argued to have a deterrent effect, such a measure also raises legal and ethical concerns.  Any scheme which proposes to introduce tagging of those who have already served their sentence raises the issue of additional punishment, possibly in breach of the constitutional principle of proportionality.  Tagging is far more intrusive than signing on at a Garda station and it has a greater impact upon privacy and freedom of movement rights.  A way of reconciling such constitutional concerns could be to incorporate the measure as part of a remission scheme whereby early release may be granted in conjunction with tagging.  Alternatively, the courts could be required to take electronic monitoring into consideration when sentencing and thus ensure proportionality in the combined overall sentence.  The effectiveness of this measure, in terms of deterrence or preventing recidivism, is empirically unproven.  Evidence that it reduces recidivism is scant and experience in other countries on a more general level and in regard to monitoring of high risk sex offenders has demonstrated that it has significant limitations in this regard.  There is limited evidence available in the US and in some jurisdictions in Europe to support the contention that the tagging of high risk sex offenders may be useful in terms of ensuring compliance with registration requirements but such measures have no perceived effect on recidivism.  Where monitoring reveals a new crime, this tends to be in relation to a breach of registration requirements rather than sexual re-offending.  The research shows that electronic monitoring is not cost effective and, moreover, that knowledge about offenders' whereabouts will not necessarily effect change in underlying criminal behaviour.  The support for electronic monitoring has been described by some as a &quot;belief in a technology-focused approach as a 'silver bullet' to solving crime and other social problems&quot; but that this provides a &quot;misleading assurance of safety.&quot;  Electronic monitoring is a short-term solution and while it may address some immediate concerns in relation to individual high risk sex offenders, it does not provide the means for effectively dealing with sexual offending behaviour in the long term.  The best available evidence suggests that monitoring is more effective when it is carefully targeted and integrated with other forms of supports and risk management.  Given the lack of research in this area with regard to the effectiveness of tagging and its impact upon the monitored person and his or her family, there is a strong argument to be made that there should be an inbuilt evaluation of the impact and effectiveness of this initiative if introduced. <br\/><br\/>There are significant gaps in our knowledge of whether these and other sex offender laws have any effect in terms of reducing sexual offending or reoffending behaviour.  Sex offenders are most certainly not a homogeneous group.  They vary considerably in terms of their characteristics and level of risk.  What is sorely needed are empirically derived risk assessment procedures that will help us to target and more effectively manage those at highest risk of sexual re-offending.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018112800002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Margaret Fitzgerald-O'Reilly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543395600,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Fitzgerald-'O'Reilly for her thoughtful contribution to the committee's deliberations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018112800002#H00200","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1543395600,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I thank all of the delegates for being here today and for the considerable amount of effort they put into their submissions.

It is worth noting in that context military personnel who are resident in a jurisdiction for a time or people who travel for the purpose of enjoyment.  They may feel they are not subject to the same laws because there is such a prevalence of child abuse in those circumstances.  It is about how we can best protect children from those types of offenders.

It is difficult to police.  Are we wrong to table these now in a piecemeal approach?  Are we giving the illusion that such legislation gives a protection it in fact does not?  Would society not be better served by having that broader discussion of the supports that are necessary to try to find out why people commit these crimes and how we can address that?  Is the legislation, in that sense, premature and unhelpful?  On its own, what will it achieve?  That might be a bit dramatic, but I throw it out there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018112800002#K00300","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1543395600,"counter":58,"content":"<p>To whom would Deputy Clare Daly like to direct that question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018112800002#K00400","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1543395600,"counter":59,"content":"<p>Anybody, really.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018112800002#K00500","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1543395600,"counter":60,"content":"<p>We think the placing of sex offender risk assessment and management, SORAM, on a statutory basis is very important.

I understand the overall sentiment expressed by Deputy Clare Daly, however, because there must be a question of how best to protect the public and whether these laws provide the means for effectively protecting people from sexual offending or sexual re-offending.  To answer that, we must look at the evidence produced in other jurisdictions.  I am going to take the US as an extreme example.  It is obviously a very different context and jurisdiction to Ireland but it has had notification rules in existence since the 1940s.  Megan's law, the notable public disclosure law, passed its 20th anniversary in 2016.  Studies conducted into the effectiveness of these sex offender registration and notification, SORN, laws demonstrate that there is no appreciable impact as a deterrent or reducing recidivism.  There is no appreciable difference in recidivism rates in different empirical studies done in different jurisdictions between groups that are subject to these registration requirements and groups that are not.  We must have regard to that.  Consequently, in respect of effectiveness in helping to address the broader and long-term issue of sexual offending behaviour, it is right that we question whether things like notification and disclosure laws will help.  <\/p> <p>  To some extent, in relation to issues of disclosure for example, the approach of controlled disclosure is to be advocated.  I would certainly hate to see us move towards a widespread access, and I do not think that is being suggested at all, because it has been demonstrated to be profoundly unhelpful and counterproductive.  <\/p> <p>  Sometimes the question is what propels people to sexual offending behaviour, when a more pertinent question might be what helps convicted sex offenders to stop sex offending; not just why they offend, but why did they stop offending.  Again, we have to look at evidence available in other jurisdictions, as well as in the Irish context, that suggests it is through reintegration, reconnecting with society by reconnecting or maintaining family ties and through rehabilitation and engagement with those services and supports that help prevent recidivistic behaviour in the future.  Preventing people from reoffending is ultimately what will be of benefit to our society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018112800002#K00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Margaret Fitzgerald-O'Reilly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1543395600,"counter":63,"content":"<p>The prevent strategy is very important and the PSNI takes an approach with the two strategies of prevent and pursue running parallel to each other rather than looking at them in isolation.

They would have either a probation officer or a Garda case manager dealing with them and they would not be part of the SORAM process.<\/p> <p>  We use two risk assessments in particular.  There is a static risk assessment called the risk matrix 2000, RM2000, which is based on historical information and that enables us to have a baseline categorisation in terms of low, medium, high or very high risk of reoffending over a longer period of time.<\/p> <p>  Then we go into what we call the stable and acute risk assessment.  Going back to Deputy O'Callaghan's point about the causation, that risk assessment is much more intensive and it takes place with the offender over a series of interviews.  It looks at a whole range of issues such as the offender's capacity for relationships, their hostility towards women for example, whether they are impulsive in nature and whether they have good problem solving skills.  It then looks at the issue of sex and whether their sex drive and preoccupation with sex is a factor underlining their offending, whether they use sex as a coping mechanism and whether they have deviant sexual preferences.<\/p> <p>  That information is garnered and we use collateral information as well.  We look at the book of evidence from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, we work with the family of the offender where possible and if they have been in prison we liaise with our psychology colleagues in the Irish Prison Service and our integrated sentence managers and that enables us to build up a full picture.  It is based on a relationship as our colleagues said so the better the relationship that we have with the offender, the greater the quality of information we have and that gives us the ability to target particular areas.  An assessment is not just there to give a label and a category but the benefit of it is to figure out what the case management plan should be and what are the areas that we need to target which will ensure there is no reoffending in the future and that there are no victims.<\/p> <p>  We do that with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and with our colleagues in the local authorities and in Tusla.  We are all trained together and indeed some of our colleagues recently went up to Northern Ireland to train some of the Police Authority for Northern Ireland, PANI, people in the RM2000.  There is a lot of co-operation between us but it would not be in isolation.  Frequently and on an ongoing basis, it would be a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and a probation officer who jointly meet with the offender and as much as possible it is a collaborative effort with the offender to move forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018112800002#L01600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Dack"},{"type":"speech","time":1543395600,"counter":80,"content":"<p>Does Mr. Henderson wish to come back in?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018112800002#L01700","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1543395600,"counter":81,"content":"<p>There were other questions asked.

There are several issues inherent in the actual wording of the proposed revision that need to be cognisant of the implications for constitutional and human rights challenges.  Currently, the wording of the provisions are not strong enough to live up to any potential future challenges on the grounds of the right to travel, the right to liberty in the context of freedom of movement and to privacy rights in particular.  One has to look at the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights on deprivations and restrictions placed upon freedom of movement and the circumstances in which oppressive or unnecessary restrictions on somebody&rsquo;s freedom of movement have been deemed to be a violation of Article 5 of the European convention.  We need to establish terminology which allows us to incorporate that issue of necessity and proportionality within the meaning of the restriction or the prohibition on travel abroad.<\/p><p>This would prevent it from being open to challenge on grounds of arbitrariness.<\/p><p> Following on from that point, what we mean by \"restriction\" is not clear.  In the Bill's present form, it is assumed that the judge will decide whether the person will be allowed to travel.  That is unsatisfactory, as it renders the situation unclear and arbitrary.  Some aspect of it should be based upon evidence adduced, for example, a specifically identifiable risk that has come to the authorities' attention via the report of a probation officer or something to that effect.  There must be necessity and proportionality under our Constitution and the European convention.  The purpose of the travel also needs to be considered, which could require a change in the wording of the current provision.  If we incorporated certain requirements that a court must take into consideration, it could lend credit to the assertion that the restriction is necessary rather than arbitrary, take into account the fact that people sometimes need to travel, for example, in order to procure work or as part of their jobs, and would not impinge on their right to earn a livelihood.  It would also allow people to enjoy family rights under our Constitution and Article 8.  The wording needs to be examined in this context and we need to be clear about what we mean by \"restriction\".<\/p><p> The overarching - I hate to use the word \"problem\" - concept that we need to consider is the resources issue.  If we are discussing restrictions on certain destinations or within a certain timeframe, there needs to be a way of implementing that effectively.  To some extent, this would involve supervision.  Is the Garda, the Probation Service or the court supposed to supervise?  Would the court have to make subsequent orders or judgments against the individual in the event of his or her falling out of line with the restrictions?  It also might involve authorities in another jurisdiction having to supervise our citizens, which leads to a resources issue, a question of communication, which is important, and other practical issues that may be difficult to resolve.  We need to be cognisant of these matters if this provision is to be framed in statute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018112800002#N00900","nonspeaker":"Dr. Margaret Fitzgerald-O'Reilly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543395600,"counter":107,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Fitzgerald-O'Reilly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018112800002#O00200","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1543395600,"counter":108,"content":"<p>Am I right in understanding that the foreign travel order has not been used in two years?

There is some limited research available both in Europe and the United States on the electronic tagging of high-risk sex offenders.  There is research done on the tagging of high-risk offenders but it is specifically in the context of high-risk sex offenders that we are considering this prospect.  That involves a very different type of research and very different empirical data.<\/p> <p>  Most of the research has tended to come from the United States.  It has a very different context and is a very different jurisdiction but the basic principle is the same insofar as it permits electronic tagging of those who are considered to be a risk.  The categorisation of risk can vary considerably in accordance with jurisdiction.  The objective is to monitor, control and deter from sexual recidivism.  All the research, whether it is in favour of keeping tabs on high-risk sex offenders or not, acknowledges categorically that there is no difference or a limited difference in recidivism rates between those who are electronically tagged and those who are not.  There is no impact in terms of deterrence or reducing recidivism.  Two points may be of value in this regard.  One is in the context of a very carefully strategised post-release risk-assessment strategy on helping the offender to reintegrate into the community.  It specifically relates to offenders who are subject to supervision.  There is some evidence to suggest that electronic tagging can be helpful as one part of a more holistic, coherent re-entry strategy.  It is in the short term, and there is some evidence to suggest it might be more useful for first-time offenders than repeat offenders.<\/p> <p>  The other issue concerns where monitoring revealed a new crime.  Even if there is a suggestion that this was good, it tended to reveal crime in respect of breaches of registration orders.  That, in itself, may hold value but in terms of the broader long-term goal of preventing sexual recidivism, there was no appreciable impact.  While there is some limited impact and usefulness in terms of ensuring compliance or identifying non-compliance with registration requirements, which can be very positive and good, there is no appreciable value in terms of deterrence and preventing recidivism.<\/p> <p>  The last thing the research tells us is that electronic monitoring is very costly.  There is consensus that it is not cost-effective if compared with the objectives.  If the objective is preventing recidivism, or preventing somebody from having to be sent back to prison, there is no cost-neutralisation value to monitoring the person via GPS or some other method.  The research concludes that it has to be questioned as to whether we want to provide this type of monitoring considering its lack of effectiveness, as is empirically proven, and the fact that it is so costly to implement.  That is the consensus on the research.  We need to be mindful of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018112800002#P00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Margaret Fitzgerald-O'Reilly"},{"type":"speech","time":1543395600,"counter":124,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Fitzgerald-O'Reilly.

I understand it can be helpful where the criminal behaviour or the non-compliance with the order in question is associated with a particular geographic location.  It is all very fine if the electronic monitoring system tells one so and so is no longer going to this place, that place or the other place but one should not be lulled into a sense of false security; it might be that the offender is now committing offences in an unmonitored zone.  It has been said so often this morning that there is no silver bullet.

That has been proved in other jurisdictions.  When it is integrated with a supervision package it can be at its most effective.  The legislation is advocating the possibility, as part of a post-release supervision order, that somebody would be electronically tagged for a period of six months.

There can be value in that.  It is very much about monitoring that and it needs to be part of a planned package.  As Ms Counihan stated, there could be instances of a person in custody who will be coming out on a post-release supervision order and certain risk factors were noticed while the person was in custody.  We see a value in electronic tagging in those instances to encourage reintegration for the period of six months and tighter monitoring.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018112800002#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Ita Burke"},{"type":"speech","time":1543395600,"counter":131,"content":"<p>I do not think the representatives of the PSNI wanted to add anything to that point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018112800002#Q00400","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1543395600,"counter":132,"content":"<p>No.  We outlined in our statement our general powers with regard to offenders; there is nothing specific with regard to sexual offending.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018112800002#Q00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ryan Henderson"},{"type":"speech","time":1543395600,"counter":133,"content":"<p>That was my reading of it too.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018112800002#Q00600","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1543395600,"counter":134,"content":"<p>I have two final questions.

It is about an issue that presents occasionally.  It is very likely it was covered earlier and, if so, that is fine.  In circumstances where someone with a high profile committed sexual offences and there is media commentary, it sometimes becomes an issue of controversy based on a phantom in communities or inaccurate rumours.  It is an issue that presents itself every so often.  A big part of the solution needs to be around education and perhaps more responsible conduct by the media.  It is not immediately obvious to me, although it might be to others, what the right environment is for somebody coming out of prison who is known to have committed certain offences.  If people move into external communities that they are not familiar with and the public becomes aware it creates controversy, difficulty and a threat to the welfare of offenders.  If offenders return to their home communities, it is possible the victims are in the area and they could come into contact or a confrontation could arise.  I do not ask the question from the position of having a preconceived notion.  When these controversies arise I am not entirely sure where the ideal location or setting is for people when they have been released for prison.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018112800002#Q00900","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1543395600,"counter":137,"content":"<p>I will take the final question first.  What is the ideal location?  The short answer is there is no ideal location.  At the same time, the vast majority of sex offenders, if not all, who go to jail come out again.  They come out no matter what they have done and they will have undoubtedly received a proportionate sentence.  The sentence is the sentence and the best way we can try to ensure they do not go on to reoffend is through having the appropriate controls and monitoring in place and by trying to ensure there is a level of reintegration in their communities.  The issue that arises from time to time and which impacts on our work, although thankfully only in a small number of cases, is the media sometimes publicise high profile cases and argue that people have a right to know that somebody very dangerous might be living in their area.  The individual has a right to make the best effort at resettlement in collaboration with the various agencies.  As Ms Burke and Mr. Dack mentioned earlier, a small number of serious high-profile and high-risk offenders receive the highest level of attention on release from the police, the Probation Service and the various other services.  People should be assured that when an offender at the highest level is released back into the community we are all doing our best to ensure the person is monitored and controlled but also helped to reintegrate so they do not reoffend.  There is not an ideal scenario or location but unless we all work together to try to ensure the appropriate reintegration of the individual, we are taking backward steps.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018112800002#Q01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Vivian Geiran"},{"type":"speech","time":1543395600,"counter":138,"content":"<p>Perhaps Mr. Dack and someone from the PSNI will add to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018112800002#Q01100","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1543395600,"counter":139,"content":"<p>If we flip risk assessment on its head, it is about what positive protective factors we can put in place.  We know prosocial influences are a positive factor.  We know that social acceptance rather than rejection is a positive factor.  In the Probation Service we work with an NGO to provide circles of support and accountability, COSA.  Volunteers are recruited, trained and supported to work with isolated sex offenders to provide a social network and social support while at the same time monitoring behaviour.  An inner circle, the core member of which is the sex offender, works closely with an outer circle that consists of professionals such as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Probation Service and Tusla.  It is a recognition that social isolation is a risk factor.  Social acceptance in some form is a protective factor.  Recent research that looked at the desistance of child sex offenders in Manchester indicated employment is one of the biggest protective factors in desistance from future offending.  It is contrary to social isolation and becoming totally disregarded in communities.  We are not saying the ideal place for offenders to return to is their own communities because quite frequently that is where the offending took place and the perpetrator is known to the victims, their families or communities.<\/p><p>It is difficult for them to go back into that area.  We work with our colleagues in local authorities to try to come up with housing solutions.  We then try to put wraparound services in place to develop those positive factors and prevent social isolation, which leads to greater risk.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018112800002#Q01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Dack","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1543395600,"counter":141,"content":"<p>I wish to build on what colleagues have said.

That is a good protection to know about and it goes some way towards allaying the fears of victims when perpetrators come back into communities.  It is very reassuring to hear that the probation service, in tandem with local authorities, does everything possible to offer sex offenders housing solutions elsewhere.

It is notable that sex offenders, once released, are at a higher risk of homelessness, which is one of the recidivistic factors that often come into play.  There is another problem.  Even though such harassment orders are of course a positive step, they might in some way distance offenders from reconnecting with their families.  Forming those family ties can be an important way of overcoming the stigmatic narrative of the previous sexual offending.  Again, this is for people who want to overcome that previous behaviour and be reintegrated.  It is about encouraging the maintenance of those relationships, where appropriate, in order to facilitate reintegration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018112800002#R00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Margaret Fitzgerald-O'Reilly"},{"type":"speech","time":1543395600,"counter":145,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses and Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire.
