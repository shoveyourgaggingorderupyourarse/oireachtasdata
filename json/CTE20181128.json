I will also touch on the 2019 work programme.<\/p> <p>  President Juncker delivered his 2018 state of the Union address to the European Parliament in Strasbourg in September.  He presented his priorities for the year ahead and outlined his vision for how the European Union can continue to build a \"more united, stronger and more democratic Union\".  In his speech he indicated that while, economically speaking, things are going well, much remains to be done.  Europe's economy has grown for 21 consecutive quarters; 12 million new jobs have been created since 2014; more people are working in the EU today than ever before, which is also true in Ireland; and the European Fund for Strategic Investments, also known as the \"Juncker fund\", has triggered &euro;336 billion worth of public and private investment.  In fact, at this stage that figure is up to &euro;400 billion.  The EU has trade agreements with 70 countries around the world, covering 40% of the world's GDP.  These agreements help us to export not alone our goods and services, but also Europe's high standards for food safety, workers' rights, the environment and consumer rights.  The European Union accounts for one fifth of the world's economy.  With regard to trade agreements, the European Commission yesterday presented a study showing that EU trade with third countries accounts for approximately 36 million jobs, 690,000 of which are in Ireland.  It is more surprising that the 690,000 jobs in Ireland create another 390,000 jobs in other member states.<\/p><p>They are jobs created thanks to trade with third countries.<br\/><br\/>In his speech President Juncker stated, &quot;United, as a Union, Europe is a force to be reckoned with.&quot;  However, against the backdrop of an ever more uncertain world, while emphasising that he wanted to champion multilateralism, he also stressed the need for it to become more sovereign so as to be able to play a role in shaping global affairs.  He said:<\/p><blockquote>The geopolitical situation makes this Europe's hour: the time for European sovereignty has come.  It is time Europe took its destiny into its own hands.<br \/><br \/>This belief that &quot;united we stand taller&quot; is the very essence of what it means to be part of the European Union.  Sharing sovereignty &ndash; when and where needed &ndash; makes each of our nation states stronger.<\/blockquote><p>Regarding our proposals, President Juncker's speech was accompanied by the adoption of 18 concrete initiatives by the European Commission on migration and borders, security, free and secure elections, the European Union's partnership with Africa and the Union as a global actor.  <br\/><br\/>On security, we proposed new rules to get terrorist content off the web; measures to secure free and fair European elections; a reinforced European public prosecutor's office to fight cross-border terrorism; and initiatives to invest in cybersecurity.  <br\/><br\/>On migration and border reform, we proposed a reinforced European Union agency for asylum; a fully equipped European border and coast guard service; stronger rules for the return of illegal entrants; and a route towards legal migration.  <br\/><br\/>Regarding Africa, we proposed a new Africa-Europe alliance for sustainable investment and jobs, with a focus on investment and business partnerships, rather than on aid, as would have been the case in the past.  <br\/><br\/>Regarding Common Foreign and Security Policy, we proposed improving the efficiency of the decision-making process.  The European Commission considers that it is no longer acceptable that we need unanimity merely to issue a statement on some foreign issues.  <br\/><br\/>We also proposed putting an end to seasonal clock changes, basically taking away the decision and giving it back to member states.  <br\/><br\/>We proposed stronger anti-money laundering supervision for a stable banking and financial sector.  <br\/><br\/>These proposals are intended to help to deliver positive results for citizens by the time of the European Council's summit in Sibiu on 9 May 2019 and ahead of the 2019 European elections.  Based on this, the European Commission will continue to work hard for the remainder for 2018 and throughout 2019.  There are three goals on which we must focus: delivering what we have promised to deliver; overcoming the challenges that are holding us back; and giving the European Union a perspective for the future.<br\/><br\/>The European Commission has delivered all of the legislative proposals it committed to making in the ten priorities set out by President Juncker in 2014.  Together with the European Parliament and the Council, it has found agreement on 50% of the proposals, while a further 20% are well advanced in the legislative process.  However, 30% need a lot more work.  It is essential that we deliver on our joint commitments by the time of the European elections in 2019.  To ensure the European Parliament and the Council can focus fully on what is on the table, the Commission is only making a very limited number of new proposals.<br\/><br\/>We also need to face up to several important outstanding challenges with which we need to deal collectively and decisively.  The challenges are in the field of migration, reinforcing EMU, tensions in the global trading system, the rule of law in some member states and, last but not least, finding agreement with the United Kingdom to ensure its orderly withdrawal from the European Union.  Regarding the latter, President Juncker repeated the message that the European Commission, the European Parliament and all 26 member states would always show loyalty and solidarity with Ireland when it came to the issue of the Irish Border.  This message has been reiterated many times since, not least in the withdrawal agreement endorsed by the European Council on Sunday last.  President Juncker also noted that the United Kingdom would always be a very close neighbour and partner and never an ordinary third country.<br\/><br\/>We want to give a perspective for the future and, therefore, need to prepare for the Sibiu summit in May 2019.  The summit will take place six weeks after Brexit and two weeks before the European elections.  It will be a crucial moment for EU leaders to provide renewed confidence in the future of the Union of 27.  The summit in Sibiu will be the moment when we will have to offer all Europeans a strong perspective for the future.<br\/><br\/>We have tabled a proposal for the Multi-annual Financial Framework for the period 2021 to 2027, but we also have proposals for strengthening the international role of the euro and the decision-making tools for Common Foreign and Security Policy.  President Juncker has called on the European Parliament and the Council to adopt the proposals presented by the European Commission in the past four years in the light of the European elections that will be taking place in six months' time, but he has also said we are all responsible for the Europe of today and, therefore, must all take responsibility for the Europe of tomorrow.  He has stressed that Europe must be an active player and an architect of tomorrow's world.<br\/><br\/>In line with the direction set out in the State of the Union speech of September and the letter of intent sent to the European Parliament and the Council, the European Commission adopted its work programme for 2019 on 23 October.  As the committee will be aware, every year the Commission adopts a work programme in which it sets out the list of actions it will take in the year ahead.  The work programme informs the public and co-legislators of the Commission's political commitments to present new initiatives, withdraw pending proposals and review existing EU legislation.  In its work programme for 2019 the Commission follows the three main priorities to which I have alluded.  They are: reaching swift agreement on the legislative proposals presented; adopting a limited number of new initiatives to address outstanding challenges; and presenting several initiatives with a future perspective for a Union of 27.  The 2019 work programme focuses on only 15 new initiatives and an additional ten new REFIT evaluations to review existing legislation and ensure it is still fit for purpose.  To ensure a focus on delivery, the Commission's work programme also lists 45 pending priority proposals for adoption by the Parliament and the Council before the European elections.  The Commission also suggests withdrawing or repealing 17 pending proposals or existing laws.<br\/><br\/>Our priority in the year ahead will be to get the green light on as many outstanding proposals as possible.  Most of them are of importance to Ireland such as those in the field of trade.  For instance, we want to ratify the EU-Japan partnership agreement.  We want to conclude the agreements with Singapore and Vietnam and modernise the agreement with Mexico.  We want to make rapid progress in negotiations with New Zealand and Australia and champion the multilateral trading system.  Others which, equally, are of great importance to Ireland are more in the field of completing the digital Single Market which is considered to be of importance here, adopting the circular economy package or addressing the social dimension of the European Union and even adopting the proposals on fair taxation in the digital economy.<br\/><br\/>On the next steps to be taken, the European Commission's work programme was adopted in October.  It will be our agenda for the next 12 months.  The December European Council should discuss the Commission's proposals for the Multi-annual Financial Framework.  The March 2019 European Council should discuss EMU issues and trade.  I always use the word &quot;should&quot; because foreseen agendas tend to be hijacked by events, but this is the plan.  The European Parliament and the Council should decide on as many legislative proposals as possible before the Parliament's term comes to an end in advance of the European elections in May 2019.  This should be followed by the informal European Council on 9 May in Sibiu in Romania where the EU Heads of State and Government will gather for the first time after the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union and also for the last time before the European elections of 2019.  As said, it will be the moment to offer all Europeans a strong perspective for the future.  The European Parliament elections will take place from 23 to 26 May.  Following the elections, at the June European Council, the 27 member states should adopt a new strategic agenda for the period 2019 to 2024 which will guide the work of the European Union for the next five years.  The June European Council should also decide on a number of high level appointments following the European Parliament elections, including the next European Commission President, the next European Council President and the next High Representative and Vice President for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy.<br\/><br\/>Clearly, 2019 will be a year of change.  However, it will also be the year when the Juncker Commission will come to the end of its five-year mandate and hopes to show that it has focused consistently on the challenges which can only be addressed by collective European action.<\/p><p>Our 2019 work programme contains no surprises.  We have made all the proposals needed but now they must be agreed by the co-legislators and their benefits implemented in practice by the member states.  We will look to the future with initiatives to ensure that tomorrow's Union of 27 has an optimistic vision for a fair and sustainable future for all Europeans. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018112800002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Kiely","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543413600,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank our representative for coming before the committee at this very important time.  It is no harm to mark the success of the European Union and its successfully-concluded negotiations with the UK in respect of Brexit.  None of us would be supportive of Brexit but it was not in our control.  Michel Barnier, Guy Verhofstadt and Frans Timmermans displayed great vigour and dedication to the job in hand.  They stuck with it and were supported by all the member states and we have a lesson to learn from that.  Europe is going to go in the direction in which we, the European people, want it to go.  If it should emerge that neonationalism, towards which there is some tendency at present, becomes the order of the day, I would be pessimistic about where we might be heading.<\/p> <p>  If we want reassurance about this, a good thing to do would be to take out our history books and carefully read about the era from 1929 or 1930 to 1945 or 1946.  Recently, I read some of the records of that era and they were appalling.  Man's inhumanity to man was just appalling.  The European Union, which followed as a result of that, brought member states together in a way that reminded them not to go in that direction again.  With the passage of time, a restlessness takes over and people begin to look at the horizon and feel their strength again.  They think about the things they can do and start to believe their association with others is holding them back, and that is not a good sign.<\/p> <p>  Insofar as we can ascertain right now, the structures are in place to continue and the commitment must prevail.  We would hope to see the UK back in the Union again because the Union is lesser for being without the UK.  I will not quote John Donne, but the EU needs a country the size of the UK, and Europe is weaker for its absence.  It may well be that everybody harks back to the good old days but we have to ask which good old days we are talking about.  There is great hope for the future, provided the Union prevails and people do not take their eye off the ball and go off in a different direction.  In particular, we should encourage each member state to bring to the Union something that is positive and no member state should feel it is outside the Union.  We are all Europeans   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018112800002#C00200","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1543413600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kiely for his clear and factual presentation.  It is useful to us to know what is planned in the year ahead.  There are reasons to be optimistic over the future of the European Union.  Brexit was a shock to the system but many citizens have come to realise the benefits of the European Union, both here in Ireland and in other EU member states.  People have become conscious of what the European Union stands for as a result of the shock Brexit vote.  However, there are threats and Mr. Kiely mentioned one of them in his presentation, namely, migration.  Migration is one of the big issues the European Union must now face.  In that regard, I welcome the commitment by the Commission and the European Council in respect of Africa and external investment.  A new Africa-Europe alliance for sustainable investment and jobs has been announced along with a more efficient financial architecture for investment outside the EU.  It is important to develop relationships with Africa, ultimately for its benefit but also to stem the flow of migration to the European Union.  It should aim to ensure that failed nation states become sustainable again and grow and prosper economically.  Migration has impacted on the politics of Europe and we have seen the rise of far-right parties, alongside a decline in liberal and democratic values in some states, and we must be conscious of this.<\/p> <p>  I note the \"onwards and upwards\" comments of President Juncker and I worry about ongoing talk of further integration.  We do not need integration just for the sake of it and there have been soundings from the Franco-German axis in this regard.  We need to be very careful about it and any further integration needs to be clearly justified to the citizens and must have practical benefits.  Is there talk of treaty change in this context?  Can all the reforms and plans be accommodated within the existing treaties?  As we know in this country, referendums are a tricky business and any change has to have public support and be clearly justified. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018112800002#C00300","speaker":"1360"},{"type":"speech","time":1543413600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kiely for making himself available to us again.  The European project has been the greatest success in modern history but also, in some ways, the greatest failure.  The success is in the way every aspect of Irish life has developed and changed in the 45 or so years in which we have been members.  The benefit to this country has been phenomenal.  The failure is that it has become a bureaucratic animal that is somewhat detached from citizens on the ground.  The work of Mr. Timmermans on subsidiarity might change that over time and I hope it does because one of the great strengths of the European Union is our diversity.  We recognise that no two countries are the same and I hope that continues to be the case.  There is no way to make a single culture throughout Europe so we must respect the cultures of all our neighbours and friends in Europe.<\/p> <p>  I would like to see a Europe that gets closer to the citizens in the post-2019 election era.<\/p><p>There is a greater need for engagement at the lowest possible level, the level of the citizen.  That may put a lot of pressure on the delegates' office in the forthcoming elections.  That is where Europe wants to go anyhow.  While we have enjoyed the benefits of Europe, we have very quickly forgotten where they are coming from.  When we are constantly getting goodies from the table and nobody is telling us how they are being paid for or brought about, we need a much better understanding among citizens.  Students going through university are very aware of the benefits of being members of the European Union but that does not necessarily mean everyone is.  The farming community is aware but I sometimes wonder whether farmers regard themselves as members of the Union where the Common Agricultural Policy is concerned and really do not put a lot of thought into it beyond that context.  I do not know the position on that.<\/p><p> I hope we will not see any treaty change in light of Brexit.  God forbid that we would bring that down on top of ourselves.<\/p><p> With regard to the point made on security, there is no doubt but that there is a threat to the security of Europe.  There is a long-held view in Ireland that this is a neutral country.  That, of course, is not true.  We are militarily non-aligned, which is vastly different from being neutral.  I cannot envisage our status within Europe changing, however, notwithstanding the fact that we have agreed to become part of PESCO.  We can take from PESCO the elements we want.  I become a little concerned when I hear President Juncker and others talking about the establishment of some form of European defence force.  That will not sit well with the Irish.<\/p><p> The issue of migration is a bigger issue than Brexit.  Brexit will come and go, and commerce will survive.  The migration issue is a different one.  I am interested in hearing the representatives' thoughts on the fact that we have moved migration from the Mediterranean back to Libya.  What sort of monitoring is taking place in Libya of the asylum seekers, refugees or economic migrants?  What supervision is there of their treatment by Europe?  Europe has clearly blocked the road in.  We have provided incentives to the north Africans, including those on the coast of north Africa, to find alternatives to people losing their lives in the Mediterranean.  If this is locking them into some sort of internship and if they are being treated badly, however, it would be terrible.  Have the delegates any information on that?<\/p><p> I am delighted we are talking about investing in jobs in Africa.  That is the only way to keep people there.  Let us be honest that the migration from central Africa is all economic.  Unless we provide incentives for people to stay at home, the migration will continue.  Who could blame the migrants?<\/p><p> Mr. Kiely will be well aware that we claim 70 million Irish people worldwide.  That is all down to migration from this country.  This is an important point.  I am interested to know whether we are managing the inward migration.<\/p><p> With respect to Brexit specifically, we had a lot of discussion at COSAC on the expansion of Frontex.  Version 2 or version 2.1 of Frontex is on the way.  It will see some 10,000 personnel employed in border management.  Although some of my colleagues will disagree with me, I have never held the position that there will be an open border in Ireland in a post-Brexit world.  There will be free movement, or movement as free as it possibly could be.  Do the witnesses envisage Frontex being brought into this country?  While we might want to cross the Border with goods and services and while we might want people travelling over and back to work, I wonder how long the Europeans would tolerate migration through the Irish open border.  Will there be a Frontex presence here?<\/p><p> That concludes what I have to say.  I thank the witnesses once again for attending.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018112800002#C00400","speaker":"1390","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543413600,"counter":14,"content":"<p>With regard to what Deputy Haughey and Senator Craughwell said, any question of a further referendum would be very dangerous at this stage, bearing in mind that the wisdom of the Irish people was to vote down the Lisbon treaty.  That treaty created Article 50.  We were a very wise people in the first days.  I do not know how Britain could exit had we not voted for the Lisbon treaty the second time round.  That is another day's work.<\/p> <p>  With regard to migration, we must bear in mind our responsibilities.  No country has suffered more from emigration than Ireland.  We have to be very aware of that.  I am not sure the Government is adopting the right approach to providing facilities.  We are aware of the circumstances in Moville, County Donegal, in Wicklow town, where there is a lot of opposition, and in Shannon Key West Hotel in Roosky, a small village with roughly 500 residents that is to take 100 more.  The facilities in Roosky are not in place.  The residents are very much aware of the difficulties facing the Syrians, Iraqis and Libyans and are very supportive but the town needs to be provided with proper facilities for migrants.  They are living in bad conditions.  They are not allowed to cook their own food.  This is not a good model.  The Mosney model is better.  Mosney was a tourist camp.  It was well built and people were housed in separate buildings.  The Government should consider a better arrangement, bearing in mind that we have committed to bringing 3,500 migrants into Ireland in the next few years.  The circumstances of the migrants in Ballaghaderreen are not the best.  There are medical conditions and problems internally.  I am not in any way criticising.  The Government is doing its best in the circumstances but it should examine the conditions, maybe in conjunction with the public.  Smaller villages are really not suitable.  There is no outlet for the migrants.  They are contained in the facility all day and have nowhere to go and nothing to do.  It is not a good model.  It is not necessarily Mr. Kiely's responsibility but it is a European issue.  I am sure Europe will provide support regarding migration policy throughout the European Union.  I hope so.  I am sure it is part of the support services in the European Union.  We would be in a very good position to provide good facilities for migrants in this country, or better facilities than we are currently providing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018112800002#D00200","speaker":"1393"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1543413600,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I thank all the members for their comments.  I will make a general comment on all of them.  Populism and nationalism are unhealthy.  I do not like calling the phenomenon nationalism because we are all nationalistic in some way or another.  I refer to a kind of negative nationalism, a nationalism that stands on the back of migrants, foreigners and people who are different.  There is no question that there is a problem.  It is a problem that is being whipped up by interested parties inside and outside the European Union.  There is a lot of evidence of money coming in from outside the Union with a view to weakening it.  I do not know the extent to which this trend will continue.  For the moment, however, it is growing rather than declining.  It is an issue that will have to be dealt with.  It is an issue that will certainly come into play in the European Parliament elections.  The extent to which anti-European parties will be elected to the Parliament remains to be seen.  It could have an influence on how the European Union goes forward.  Ultimately, the populist parties or populist propagandists do not need to be tackled on their own ground.  Those who are pro-Europe and in favour of the ideas and values of Europe should promote those ideas and values rather than fighting a battle with the populists on their territory.<\/p> <p>  With regard to Brexit, our President and everyone has made it very clear that there are no winners.  It is only a question of minimising the damage.  One of the commissioners or the President commented last weekend on how much effort has been put into a damage-limitation negotiation.  In any negotiations we engage in, we aim for a win&ndash;win outcome.  Brexit involves a lose&ndash;lose scenario.  It is only a question of how much.<\/p><p>Linking back to the comments on populism, migration is still a big political issue but when one looks at the figures, although I do not want to say that migration has been solved, in the past 12 months the number of migrants coming into Europe was something of the order of 55,000 or 60,000.  It would be a big crowd in Croke Park but against the EU's current population of 500 million people it is not unmanageable.  It is nothing in comparison with the 1 million who came in in 2015.  Management of the migration issue is improving all of the time.  The members talked about money for dealing with it.  There has been a huge increase in the amount of funding from the EU to deal with migration on every front, both internal and external.  Monitoring is taking place in Libya.  I am not sure of the extent to which the EU's representatives are involved in that monitoring, but we are certainly in there with other international bodies.  <\/p><p> On the question about treaty change, there is nothing on the table at the moment.  Nothing that the Commission has proposed would necessitate treaty change.  For example, there are a number of proposals on the table which require unanimity.  It could be done by qualified majority voting, but a vote and unanimous agreement of the member states would be required to move towards qualified majority voting.<\/p><p> There is a lot of talk about a European army.  Who knows what is going to happen way down the road?  For the moment, the Commission's proposals and the discussions are about more co-ordination.  For example, the combined defence expenditure of individual member states equates to something like 40% of what the US spends on its defence yet we have only 10% of its capability purely because everybody is working to their own standards.  There is no compatibility between the systems in the different member states.  A lot of what is happening at the moment is aimed at research on a defence capability which would be more suitable to Europe's needs than what is available.   It is also aimed at having compatibility between the defence systems of different members states so that they can work together.<\/p><p> There is an awful lot said about European bureaucracy but I am not totally convinced about it.  An awful lot of the bureaucracy happens between Brussels, the member state, and the citizen.  The Commission has often had to intervene to deal with bureaucracy, particularly on the Common Agricultural Policy although I am sure it happens elsewhere.  Some members states tend to be overzealous in their application of the rules.  I agree 100% that we must get closer to the citizen but there are 500 million citizens. That is not going to be done by the Commission, the Parliament or the Council; it has to be done at local level.  <\/p><p> No one mentioned a democratic deficit but it keeps coming up all of the time.  There is no democratic deficit in the Council because a weighted qualified majority is required and a straight majority does not deliver anything.  There is also the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions, and many structures involving non-governmental organisations.  There is a great amount of tapping into citizens' concerns and interests at that level, but getting closer to citizens has to be done at national and local level by people, primarily politicians.  As President Juncker has said many times, Europe is you and me; it is not the people in Brussels.  <\/p><p> I mentioned treaty change and referenda.  There is nothing on the table which would necessitate that, but that does not mean that some of the ideas floating around from different individuals, including presidents etc., might not necessitate a treaty change.  We are a long way away from that however.

Every farmer and forestry worker in Ireland knows their animals are bitten by ticks and become sick with a variety of bacteria.  The sick animals suffer from tick-borne diseases such as Lyme disease, Borrelia, Anaplasma, Rickettsial infections and Babesia, which causes red water disease in cattle.  Do committee members think these ticks might be biting humans as well?  The HSE's Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, website describes Lyme disease, a tick-borne infection, as a rare disease in humans in Ireland, with ten cases reported annually, and it estimates there are 100 cases nationally.  However, a study from the blood bank in 1991 showed 9.75% of blood donors were positive for the Lyme disease antibody.  This is not ten cases a year.  An antibody means exposure or active infection.  This means almost 10% of over 4 million people, which is 400,000, have had a tick bite.  It is not a rare disease.<\/p> <p>  How does the HSE's estimate of ten to 20 cases a year compare to 400,000 exposures or active infections?  In addition to Lyme disease, people also become ill from other infections, such as Anaplasma and Babesia.  There is no recognition of these diseases or the co-infections on the HPSC website.  Several years ago, I did a study of people with sudden illness who were then diagnosed with chronic fatigue.  A total of 25% of the patients, mostly from rural communities, were Anaplasma positive.  I treated them with antibiotics and they got better.  I would rather have a longer course of antibiotics and be cured of chronic fatigue than have a lifelong diagnosis of chronic fatigue.  Many believe there are huge underestimations of the true burden of tick-borne diseases in Ireland.  Thousands of annual cases are more likely than ten or 100.<\/p> <p>  Let us consider these scenarios, which I deal with every day.  A person goes for a hike in Wicklow and gets bitten by a tick but he or she does not see the tick bite.  Three days later the person develops a fever, numbness and tingling all over.  Another hiker gets a summer flu and aches and pains all over.  A farmer develops migratory arthritis and strange neurological symptoms.  These people see a rheumatologist and are diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis but nobody thinks of Lyme disease.  I had an example from Letterkenny last week.  Lyme disease should be higher on our list.  Some people have a rash and some do not.  They may or may not remember a tick bite.  The HPSC website states people should remember a tick or a rash but 80% of people do not.<\/p> <p>  Where do people sick from tick bites go?  They go to their GPs.  I hear all the time that those who remember the tick bite are told by their GPs that there are no ticks in Ireland, ticks do not spread Lyme disease in Ireland and people only get Lyme disease in Connecticut as that is where it was first diagnosed.  They are asked whether they have travelled to America.  They are also told they have ringworm or cellulitis.<\/p> <p>  Even though tick borne infections are common in Ireland, many GPs and specialists are missing the diagnosis.  They do not consider Lyme disease as a possible diagnosis and when they do consider it they wait for a positive test.  The trouble is the antibody test for Lyme disease only picks up 50% of cases.  It should be a clinical diagnosis.  Somebody with a tick bite and a rash who is unwell should be treated.  The doctor should not wait for the antibody test.  However, doctors do wait for the anitbody test, which is only 50% sensitive.  If it is negative they tell people they do not require treatment because it is not Lyme disease.  Lyme disease requires a clinical diagnosis supported by testing.  None of the consultants or GPs seems to understand this.  Other strains of Lyme disease are missed as are co-infections.  Often, the test does not come back positive in patients with active Lyme disease.<\/p> <p>  Without a positive test result, people cannot get treatment.  Persons who can afford it go to Germany to get special tests and special treatment.  The reality is we need treatment and diagnostic tests in Ireland for everyone and not just for those who can travel abroad.  People state the German laboratories are not accredited but this is wrong.  This is a rumour that is spreading in Ireland.  Sadly, many patients who get a tick bite and a rash get the German test and bring it back but are told by their consultants and GPs that they will not accept it.<\/p> <p>  The recommended treatment on the HPSC website for Lyme disease is two weeks of antibiotics but many people do not get better after two weeks of antibiotics.  They are still sick.  They are then told it is post-infectious and to live with it.  Many studies have shown that people get better with longer courses of treatment.  What is the harm of a longer course of antibiotics?  We treat every infectious disease in the world based on our clinical response but not Lyme disease.  Treatment is stopped after two weeks and if the person is still unwell he or she is told it is post-infectious.  It is a challenge for patients, let alone for clinicians to prescribe when there are guidelines and one is criticised if one does not adhere to them rigorously.<\/p> <p>  What happens if Lyme disease is not treated?  Multiple peer reviewed publications by the Infectious Diseases Society of America, which has 15,000 specialists, state the infection is over after two weeks but many other studies show longer courses of treatment benefit patients.  These studies are ignored.  A draft of the HPSC Lyme disease guidelines that I reviewed recently stated that even without treatment the infection spontaneously goes away.  It does not.  In a study by Dr. Stricker, an infectious disease specialist, 75% of Lyme disease sufferers had arthritis, 15% had neurological diseases and 2% to 10% had cardiac disease, as it affects the heart, two years after being left untreated.  None of these studies is included in the HPSC Irish guidance.<\/p><p>During the revision of the international classifications of diseases, ICD-11, the World Health Organization, WHO, developed new categories of Lyme disease that identified five life-threatening complications, including many late stage and chronic conditions; severe complications related to the brain, that is, neurological Lyme disease; and congenital Lyme disese, that is, Lyme disease that spreads from mother to child.  The guidelines have been released in the past six months.  None is included in the HSE's document or that of the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC.<\/p><p> In contrast, the status of Lyme disease policy, opinions and the stakeholder process in Ireland is very outdated.  The Government has been fully engaged in the ICD-11 revision process with the WHO, the results of which were released in July.  However, the Infectious Diseases Society of Ireland, the HSE and the HPSC continue to present outdated views on Lyme disease.  They claim it is a rare disease, one that is easy to diagnose, treat and cure, and do not recognise persistent chronic Lyme disease.  Most of the patients I see have persistent chronic Lyme disease.  They respond to antibiotics and can be cured. <\/p><p> The HPSC is rewriting its Lyme disease guidelines.  However, its process only includes the opinions of consultant doctors who do not believe in persistent infection, advocate maintaining the unreliable testing strategy and repudiate the longer courses of treatment on which patients are getting better.  These are internationally accepted guidelines, but they are planning on adopting the guidelines of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, NICE, of which the United Kingdom has carried out a review.  The Irish bodies are rubber-stamping everything that has been done.  They are maintaining that Lyme disease is easy to diagnose, that there is no such thing as chronic Lyme disease and that a short course of antibiotics will make people better.  They have excluded most of the international peer-reviewed publications and do not accept the WHO guidelines.  Why are we copying inaccurate guidelines, rather than independently reviewing all of the evidence?  <\/p><p> I recently announced the opening of a Lyme disease resource centre supported by private donor funding.  I work at the Mater hospital and Lyme disease patient groups have helped to determine the services of the centre, the two main objectives of which are education and research.  Its activities will include public education, for example, signage, to inform people that they should be aware of ticks, as most people are not, and how to prevent bites.  The centre will also train GPs, the first practitioners to see patients and they are missing it all the time.  We intend to train GPs to better consider Lyme disease in their differential diagnosis when they see a bull's eye rash, rather than calling it as shingles, ringworm or cellulitis.  These diagnoses have been made in cases I have seen in the last couple of weeks.  The centre will also raise funds for research into these infections.  We need to better understand the animals, humans and ticks in Ireland.  A complex interaction takes place once a person has these infections.  It is a debilitating inflammatory condition which people call an autoimmune phenomenon.  However, it is an infectious disease that triggers inflammation and autoimmunity.  It is not a post-infectious condition but an ongoing one. <\/p><p> The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, and the European Union have announced increasing rates of Lyme disease infections.  They are now stating there are 850,000 cases in the European Union and 400,000 in America.  They have upgraded their previous estimates by between 10% and 100%.  We need education, prevention, better diagnosis and treatment for patients.  Our mission is better health for those whom we serve.  <\/p><p> What does Ireland need to do to address tick-borne diseases?  The cost of undiagnosed, untreated and undertreated tick-borne diseases is not known.  The costs incurred in America are estimated to be huge.  The cost of diagnoses of chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia and lifelong disability is huge compared to that of catching Lyme disease early and providing treatment upfront.  Patient groups and politicians have taken the lead in identifying the lack of diagnosis and care experienced by Lyme disease sufferers in Ireland.  Those persons who have resources can travel abroad and access the more sensitive tests and treatment options offered by private care providers.  What about people in County Donegal who cannot afford to take the bus to Dublin for treatment, let alone pay &euro;5,000 for treatment in Germany?  There are huge social inequalities. <\/p><p> There is a clear disconnect between what doctors and the Health Service Executive are doing in Ireland and the advances proposed by the Irish in EU forums in Belgium and WHO forums.  We need to come on board with them.  The HSE and the Minister of Health need to disband the current committees that appear to be rubber-stamping current opinions which are outdated.  They appear to be unaware of new developments announced worldwide in the treatment of tick-borne infections.  Clinicians must treat those who suffer from tick-borne diseases with dignity and support their right to care.  Chronic Lyme disease infection, with all of its complications, is devastating millions of lives across the globe, including thousands in Ireland.  It is unprofessional for a doctor who cannot find the cause of an illness to resort to telling the patient that he or she is depressed or suffers from a psychosomatic illness.  However, this is an experience common to patients of whom I take care before I see them.  There is huge stigma and ignorance about Lyme disease.  Kind and compassionate medical care requires clinicians who understand the limitations of their knowledge and testing strategies and believe their patients when they say they are indeed ill but the healthcare provider cannot identify a source.  Rather than dismiss the patient&rsquo;s experience, it is better to acknowledge that he or she is sick, even if the reasons are not well understood.  Clinicians need to work with the patient to find the cause of the illness and work with him or her to make him or her better.  Better tick-borne diseases education and support for GPs on the front line are required in order that the cost of debilitation and disability can be reduced.  The immediate investment of moneys in the public hospital system to establish a public clinic for those who cannot afford private care is required.  All patients in Ireland with these conditions deserve reliable testing and individualised treatment.  A funded campaign to educate patients on prevention and early identification is recommended.<\/p><p> We are a nation of compassionate people who enjoy many recreational activities provided by this beautiful island, but watch out for ticks.  Many of us love to hike, garden, play football or rugby and simply enjoy the natural beauty of this land.  Many depend on the land for their livelihood.  Many members of the population travel frequently to tick-endemic areas and bring these illnesses back with them.  These factors put most of us at risk of contracting tick-borne diseases, but they are also incentives for Ireland to become a leader in the science and medicine of tick-borne diseases.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018112800002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. John Lambert","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543395600,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Lambert.

We have 2,700 members, North and South, in urban and rural areas.  The membership has grown by something like ten people a day in the past few months.  In the 24-hour period after the documentary \"Living With Lyme Disease\" was aired, 150 people contacted us.  That was the level of demand for the three voluntary administration workers and on the Tick Talk Ireland Facebook page.  Other individual patients and local patient groups were contacted.  One particularly active volunteer in the north west left her house on the following day to go to Penneys.  It took her four hours to get there because people were stopping her to say their children or neighbours were sick or that they knew someone with the condition.  They asked her if the sickness could be Lyme disease and, if so, what they could do.  They described receiving negative test results and trying various approaches.  Some said their doctors would not believe them, or that they did believe them but did not think they could actually care for them because of the guidelines.  In some cases, passers-by described consultants laughing at them.  They wanted to know what they should do and where they should go.  That is what a voluntary group dealt with in one 24-hour period and patients who are sick are dealing with in trying to help other patients.<\/p> <p>  We will have a lot of reasons to be proud next year when the organisation will be ten years old.  We are going to have a big celebration.  We will look back at the individuals who have made it possible, the work that has been done, the level of awareness created and the people who have been helped.  Then we will reflect on other things that have happened in that ten-year period.  I refer to the huge advances made in science and the amount of peer-reviewed, validated research available.  We do not know everything there is to know about Lyme disease and other tick-borne illnesses, but we know a lot more than we did ten years ago.  There is so much new knowledge available, while there have been many advances in clinical practice.  What have the Department of Health, the HSE and the Health Protection Surveillance Centre done?  The answer is nothing.  They have stuck rigidly to guidelines which are contested and have been removed from the CDC website because they do not meet the strict scientific criteria applied, yet we are clinging blindly and rigidly to them, insisting that the Earth is flat and that if we keep saying it is, it will somehow become flat.  What happens when these bodies are blind to the science and new developments?  The answer is that people suffer.  People have lost their livelihood.  They have had to sell farms and wind up businesses.  They have gone bankrupt.  Marriages have broken up.  Children have missed school or never been able to go back.  Mothers have been threatened by social services that their children will be taken away because they insist that they are ill, that it is not a psychological but a physical illness that can be cured.<\/p><p>All that has happened in the past ten years.  Luckily, other people have managed to access treatment here in Ireland, through Dr. Lambert.  I am one, I am a public patient, there are very few of us left and we have managed to get better.  Other people, like my colleague, Mr. Symes, travelled abroad and got treatment for himself and his son and is back to farming.  Ms Nicci St. George Smith, who is present, also got treatment.  She went the herbal route because there is no one way to deal with this and she is in recovery.  We are trying to make our voices heard for the people who have not been able to access treatment.<\/p><p> Apart from those 2,700 members of Tick Talk, how many people do not use social media, did not see the documentary, do not know how to contact us or reach out and believe what they were told by the general practitioner, GP, or the consultant?  How many believe the diagnosis of fibromyalgia or chronic fatigue, that they \"have to learn to live with it\", are on symptom-modifying drugs and painkillers, and lead small lives when there is absolutely no need for it because antibiotic or herbal treatment can make them better?  Maybe not everyone makes a full recovery depending how sick they were, which co-infections they got, how much damage it has done to their nervous systems and so on.  We meet resistance, as Dr. Lambert has said.  People insist it is rare when they do not know because they have not done studies.  They insist it is easy to treat when there are countless studies that say that is not the case.  They tell us they cannot give antibiotic treatment because it is dangerous.  They give antibiotic treatment for tuberculosis.  If one's spleen is removed, one remains on antibiotic treatment for the rest of one's life and the sky does not fall in.  I have been on long-term antibiotic treatment and I have got better, week on week, month on month.  I am not quite there but I am here today and two years ago I was in bed.  I am monitored closely, my bloods are taken, my liver is doing fine, I am tolerating the antibiotics, I have made the lifestyle changes I need.  I am taking the supplements and protecting my gut health because I am getting proper care.  I am doing it right and I am getting better.  Why cannot everybody have this opportunity?  Why is it just because I was lucky enough to live in Dublin and was able to access the public system or others were lucky enough that their communities rowed in behind them and fundraised &euro;25,000 or &euro;30,000 for them to travel to the US, to Germany, to other places to get the treatment they should have here?<\/p><p> We are still met with the refusal by the Department of Health, the Health Service Executive, HSE, and the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC.  A new report is coming out.  One of the last times Tick Talk appeared before this committee the committee recommended the setting up of a sub-committee on Lyme borreliosis.  The sub-committee was set up.  The so-called experts were all gathered in the room, Tick Talk nominated a patient representative, and in three years it has done very little.  I have seen the draft report &ndash; I do not know if other people in the room have &ndash; it is completely lacking in vision and ambition.  It has kept as narrowly as possible to the terms of reference.  It has not even satisfied those terms.  For three years, every time one of our members has gone to their local Deputy and asked for a parliamentary question to be submitted we are told there can be no comment on this because the report is coming.  The report exists in draft form now.  I wonder why we waited three years and how many people have got sick in the past three years who could have got an early diagnosis and treatment and got their lives back by now but instead have been allowed to develop a chronic, lifelong debilitating illness.  We are talking about clinging to contested guidelines that we do not support, that came out of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, IDSA, which is even beginning to say the test is not accurate and that perhaps relying on it is sub-optimal.  Have we shifted?  Are we looking at doing that?  We claim we follow these guidelines and best practice.  We claim everything we do here is based on the evidence yet when the very people who designed the guidelines are beginning to question them, we still say what we are doing is right.  <\/p><p> Since the cross-party action group was set up last year there have been significant developments.  The political support we get is heartening and has allowed us make some progress.  We had meetings with the HSE and the Department of Health.  We were received very politely, we were listened to, we were not quite patted on the head but it was close because this is quite a gendered issue too.  As with many autoimmune issues, more women than men are affected.  That all comes into play as well.  We presented our analysis, which I believe has been circulated to the committee and we have hard copies for everyone in the audience of what they say, how the research refutes them and what we would like them to do.  We were told more or less that there might be common ground on prevention, maybe we could get a few posters up in the national park but when it comes to matters such as testing, the proper diagnosis, the treatment of chronic Lyme, we have to listen to the experts.<\/p><p> We asked the Department and HSE at the meeting and we are asking the committee today, to help us make people step back from these fixed positions and read all of the science, not just the science that confirms what they already believe but all of the science that is available and that has been accepted by the World Health Organization and come up with fresh guidelines based on that.  Let us not follow the UK blindly and replicate the guidelines it has come up with.  There are improvements in them in respect of prevention and the acute cases when people have been recently bitten.  All it did, however, was tinker round the edges and did not grasp how serious this is, how much has to be done and it certainly did nothing for people with chronic Lyme.  The reason I had chronic Lyme for ten years was that I was undiagnosed, misdiagnosed and denied adequate treatment.  There was no reason for me to lose ten years of my life.  There is no reason for thousands of other people across Ireland to lose years off their lives.  We are talking about treatment protocols that work and about antibiotics.  For us to follow the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, NICE, guidelines blindly and for someone from Tick Talk to be back here in another ten years telling the committee that more and more people have been bitten, got sick, lost their farms and become bankrupt would be a scandal because there is something we can do about this.<\/p><p> Another suggestion in the draft HPSC report is that one of the recommendations is that a new sub-committee will be set up to develop new guidelines.  Will the very people who misdiagnosed me and other patients and who denied us treatment be the ones sitting around the room devising these new guidelines?  Is the committee going to say that it suddenly trusts the people who for the past ten or 15 years have ignored the science, refused to read the new research, refused to keep up with evolving clinical practice to come with effective guidelines for the Irish health system?  No.  The reason we are in this mess is that these people would not read the science or keep up with evolving medical practice and have stuck to the idea that science never changes, medical practice never evolves, there is no new knowledge.  There has to be a fresh group of people in the room, people who have a background in treating patients with Lyme disease and making them well if we are to have meaningful guidelines and a meaningful change of practice.  This is where we need the committee's help.  We need to bring political pressure to bear because the medical community at consultant level has shown itself to be incapable of change.  Maybe as a patient and lay person I am being unfair.  There are lots of good GPs who want to help their patients but they are scared to because they do not have the backing of a consultant.  Will they be in trouble if they prescribe antibiotics for more than two or three weeks?  I will ask Mr. Symes to read a text he received yesterday which backs this up.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018112800002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Kerry Lawless","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543395600,"counter":33,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Lawless for her opening statement.  I will move on to the committee members.  Mr. Symes will have an opportunity to come in.  Lyme disease is a recognised infectious disease.  There is a difference between an acute illness and a chronic one.  I will give Ms Lawless and Dr. Lambert an opportunity to answer the question.  The issue concerns not diagnosing the acute phase and allowing the chronic phase to develop to the extent that it becomes difficult to diagnose because it has so many different facets.  It has neurological, rheumatological and fatigue aspects.  It has so many aspects.  There is a recognition that Lyme disease exists as an infectious disease.

Yes, Lyme disease is in the medical textbooks and everybody accepts it is a disease but there seems to be a belief that it is something that happens outside Ireland, is very rare and could not possibly be Lyme disease, so there is that fundamental issue.

The belief was that it just spontaneously goes away or, if it is treated for a couple of weeks and the patient is still sick, it is post infectious because the patient was given antibiotics.  The new WHO guidelines have changed all of that, but at present, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, NICE, guidelines in the UK have not acknowledged this new acknowledgement that there is such a thing as chronic persistent Lyme disease that needs longer treatment with antibiotics.  The challenges are that early diagnosis is missed and those who go on to develop chronic disease are told it is post infectious and that there is no such thing as chronic Lyme disease.  That was the opinion until now, including in the Irish guidelines, and in its new guidelines, Ireland is saying the same thing.

It is rare that we have a debate about whether something actually exists.

It is accepted here that a person can get an infection from Lyme disease.  We will get the statements later that fully accept that.  They say about 300 cases present each year.  They skip over the chronic, or long-term, bit.  They do not differentiate, and I think we will get into that in the second session, but my understanding is that the medical community and the State recognise Lyme disease.  It is a reportable incidence.  About 300 such incidences are reported each year.

She could not go to work, which is why she had involvement with a union official rather than a clinician.

If somebody such as a farmer from Malin Head is sick with a multi-system disease and the test result is positive, it is probably Lyme disease.  What is needed is not an antibody test but a clinical diagnosis.  Antibody tests are poor.  It does not matter whether it is a German or an Irish test and the result is positive or negative, it could mean an infection or a prior infection.  We need to educate people in how to take a good history, examine a patient and interpret test results.  That is really important and the first issue.<\/p> <p>  There are more than ten or 100 patients with Lyme disease.  We are underestimating the number of tick-borne infections.  Vets treat thousands of animals with these infections all over Ireland and the world.  It is clear that humans are being bitten by the same ticks and contracting the same diseases.  <\/p> <p>  The next question was about following international best practice in guidelines.  In France there is a pioneer by the name of Dr. Christian Perronne.  He is one doctor who went against the Infectious Diseases Society of America, IDSA, and all of its clinicians.  He has fought for five years and, against the wishes of many of his clinician friends, he has got the Irish Government to agree to the French plan.  I refer to establishing treatment centres, using a clinical diagnosis and treating patients based on the response to therapy.  We have a national outpatient antibiotic programme.  We treat people with antibiotics, sometimes for two weeks, sometimes for four weeks, eight weeks and, in some cases, six months.  The people who are probably coming here after this do this all of the time.  We do not treat different infectious diseases for one time-set.  Being prescriptive is not good for patients.  The French guidelines recommend that we treat patients for as long as it takes to make them better.  That is probably the best standard.  There is a French national website which was put together by Dr. Perronne.  <\/p> <p>  On how much people have to pay if they travel outside the country, sometimes the cost is &euro;1,000 or &euro;2,000 just for testing.  If a person then travels to Germany or America, he or she will pay between &euro;5,000 and &euro;10,000 for short-term therapy.  People will actually spend &euro;30,000.  I know people who have spent between &euro;80,000 and &euro;100,000.  I refer to the former Kerry football player Anthony Morris who went to the Jemsek Speciality Clinic in Washington D.C. where, apparently, he paid $90,000.

However, for us the bigger factor is the lack of ambition and vision in the report.  It will not move things on.  To be honest, if it was a good report, the three-year wait would have been worth it, but the fact is that there is no ambition or vision.  <\/p> <p>  The other question the Deputy asked was would we be in a position to roll out GP training tomorrow.  Dr. Lambert already provides training for GPs.  My own GP was trained by him.  There is also a system in place in the United Kingdom.  It is not perfect, but the Deputy asked if we could start something tomorrow.  There is a model and a champion in the United Kingdom in the treatment of Lyme disease.  There is an ongoing project, with online resources.  There are also workshops provided.  There is to be open access.  In taking the best of that system and the best of what Dr. Lambert is doing, we could start to roll something out.

The disadvantage we have is that, other than the Chairman, none of us is a qualified medical practitioner.  We have to rely on the advice given to us by medical practitioners.  One of the documents I have is from the Infectious Diseases Society of Ireland which was signed by 28 consultants.  It has made a presentation to us.<\/p><p>I will quote one or two issues the Infectious Diseases Society of Ireland, IDSI, raised on which the witnesses might comment.  I reiterate that we, as members, are at a disadvantage because the document has been signed by 28 different people.  It states that in 2016, The Swiss Infectious Disease Society and the Swiss Society for Neurology combined to produce evidence-based guidelines for the management of post- treatment Lyme disease syndrome.  That report states &quot;Growing and unequivocal evidence confirms that prolonged or repeated antibiotic therapy for PTLDS is not beneficial, but potentially harmful&rdquo;.  That is one of the issues.<br\/><br\/>The document continued:<\/p><blockquote>Chronic Lyme disease is usually a diagnosis that a patient with chronic symptoms of pain, fatigue, and difficulty in thinking, acquires in the absence of another explanation for their symptoms.  There are many patients with a variety of real and troubling chronic symptoms including fatigue, weakness, myalgias, arthralgias and neurocognitive symptoms who believe they have a &lsquo;chronic&rsquo; form of Lyme disease.  Although these patients are truly unwell, and some significantly disabled, symptoms are non-specific and overlap significantly with those of other medically unexplained symptom complexes such as chronic fatigue syndrome or fibromyalgia.  There is no evidence to support occult Lyme infection as the cause of these symptoms.  Most will have multiple serial negative Lyme antibody tests in the setting of very long-term symptoms.  There is no convincing evidence to suggest that Lyme disease represents either a marker of immunodeficiency or leads to impaired immunity.<\/blockquote><p>Basically, there is an acceptance that patients have symptoms but not all of these symptoms could be categorised as Lyme disease.<br\/><br\/>The Infectious Diseases Society of Ireland has given us a report that has been approved by 28 consultants.  The report seems to differ from the presentations that have been made here this morning.  We, as members of the committee, are not medical experts and it is very difficult for us to reach a conclusion when we receive contradictory evidence.  I ask the witnesses to comment on the matter. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018112800002#K02200","speaker":"1409","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1543395600,"counter":85,"content":"<p>I am a member of IDSI but I have never seen this report.

It is not post-treatment but ongoing infection.  Hundreds of articles have been submitted to the WHO, and reviewed for them, that show Lyme persists even after people get two or four weeks of antibiotic treatment.  There are animal studies and rhesus monkey studies where one treats them intravenously with antibiotics for two months and then sacrifices them at the end but one can still grow Lyme.  This is not post-treatment but ongoing infection.  Unfortunately, none of those studies have been included in the IDSI documents.<\/p> <p>  I agree with the Senator that the IDSI has come up with an opinion that has been signed off by 28 clinicians in Ireland.  Why does one have an opposing international organisation, like the WHO, that has had all of this science put together and presented to it and which came up with a different conclusion?  The Senator is right that it is very confusing for the committee when one group says one thing and another group saying something else.  We are not saying that every case of fibromyalgia is caused by Lyme disease.  I would think that a person in Donegal who has fibromyalgia but was previously well yet now suffers flu and fever should entertain the diagnosis of Lyme.  I am just telling members that we are missing lots of cases of Lyme disease. <\/p> <p>  I have never seen the report cited by the Senator.  I would love to read and review the report.

I am a patient who is in remission.  I was bitten in 2000 and had a bullseye rash.  I was tested and diagnosed with Lyme disease and given doxycycline for ten days.  I took the antibiotics and never thought about it again, but I continued to have low grade pain and health issues until I developed Parkinson's disease like symptoms and, in my late 20s and early 30s, Alzheimer's disease like symptoms.  I was unable to read, found speaking very difficult, found it very difficult to walk, had no energy and was in constant pain all over my spine and body.  I was an aid worker and made documentaries, but I could no longer work.  It was then brought to my attention that I might still have an infection.  I was the biggest sceptic and cynic and thought it was crazy talk and ridiculous, that the infection did not exist and could not remain in my system.  It was the last idea on the list of possibilities, but I went to be retested and tested positive.  After 15 years the infection was still in in my body.  I went for treatment and made a full recovery.  I have gone back to work and I am currently making a documentary on Lyme disease in a global context.  We are talking to people involved in the latest research on Lyme disease, Borrelia, tick borne co-infections and vector borne infections.

First, my colleagues and I wish to acknowledge that Lyme disease has been the subject of significant attention in recent years.  The matter has been regularly highlighted in the Oireachtas by means of Leaders' Questions, parliamentary questions and Topical Issue debates and has previously been discussed by this committee.  I thank the committee for inviting us to discuss the issue.  I am joined by my colleagues: Dr. Paul McKeown, Dr. Cillian De Gascun, Professor Karina Butler, and Dr. Gerard Sheehan.<\/p> <p>  Lyme disease, also known as Lyme borreliosis, is an infection caused by a bacteria called Borrelia burgdorferi.  It is transmitted to humans by bites from ticks infected with the bacteria and is the most common tick-borne infection in the US, Canada, and Europe.  Lyme disease infection is generally mild, affecting only the skin.  The most common noticeable evidence of infection is a rash called erythema migrans.  This is seen in up to 90% of patients.  Occasionally, there may be more serious symptoms involving the nervous system, the joints, the heart or other tissues.<\/p> <p>  Lyme disease was made statutorily notifiable in Ireland by the Infectious Diseases (Amendment) Regulations 2011.  The notifiable entity is the more severe neurological form of Lyme disease, Lyme neuroborreliosis.  The choice of Lyme neuroborreliosis as the notifiable entity was based on scientific advice from the European Centre for Disease Control and followed wide consultation with experts across EU member states.  Since first becoming notifiable, between eight and 21 cases of Lyme neuroborreliosis have been notified each year in Ireland.  One of the major advantages of using Lyme neuroborreliosis as the notifiable entity is that the relationship of the proportion of neuroborreliosis cases to other cases of Lyme disease is well described and relatively stable; nervous system involvement arises in between 10% and 15% of Lyme infections.  We can estimate, therefore, that there could be up to 300 total cases of Lyme disease in Ireland each year.<\/p> <p>  One of the reasons for making a disease notifiable is that it helps to raise awareness of that disease, and awareness of Lyme disease has been steadily increasing since it was made notifiable.  For example, a recent scientific paper reported that, over the five years from 2011, the number of requests for Lyme testing in the west of Ireland increased by almost 80%.  However, despite this increase in testing, no significant increase in the number of positive tests was detected.<\/p> <p>  Lyme disease is diagnosed by medical history and physical examination.  The infection is confirmed by a standard two-stage set of blood tests.  A 2016 survey reported that all laboratories offering this testing in Ireland are appropriately accredited and are testing in accordance with best international practice.  Lyme disease is normally treated using common antibiotics.  My colleague, Professor Butler, will make a more in-depth statement regarding the diagnosis and treatment of Lyme disease but the vast majority of clinicians in Ireland base their treatment approach on the guidelines produced by the Infectious Diseases Society of America, IDSA.  In addition, a consensus statement on the clinical management of Lyme disease, which endorses the IDSA guidance, has been issued jointly from the scientific advisory committee of the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, the Infectious Diseases Society of Ireland, the Irish Society of Clinical Microbiologists, the Irish Institute of Clinical Neuroscience, and the Irish College of General Practitioners.<\/p> <p>  The best protection against Lyme disease is to prevent tick bites when walking in grassy, bushy or woodland areas, particularly between May and October.<\/p><p>Both the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, and Tick Talk Ireland provide guidance on protection against the contraction of Lyme disease and the HPSC runs a Lyme disease awareness campaign each year.  A Lyme disease subcommittee established at the HPSC aims to examine best practice in prevention and surveillance of Lyme disease and to produce a report to identify the best strategies for the prevention of the disease in Ireland.  The HPSC delayed the publication of its report to incorporate the findings of an extensive systematic review of the evidence on Lyme disease published earlier this year by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the UK.  The HPSC report is now due to be published early in the new year.<\/p><p> I am happy to hand over to my colleague, Professor Butler, who will address the committee in more detail about Lyme disease.  The panel of witnesses will then answer any queries members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018112800002#Q00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ronan Glynn","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1543395600,"counter":226,"content":"<p>I am a consultant paediatrician and infectious disease specialist and have been diagnosing and treating patients with infectious diseases for more than 30 years.  I speak on behalf of the Infectious Diseases Society of Ireland, IDSI, and am joined on the panel by Dr. Gerard Sheehan.  In the Public Gallery are Dr. Catherine Fleming from Galway and Professor Colm Bergin, Professor Patrick Mallon and Dr. Ceppi Merry from Dublin.  The IDSI submission has been co-authored and approved by 22 infectious disease specialists representing each of the Dublin and regional centres, affiliated universities and the RCSI.  An overwhelming consensus of expert opinion supports the written submission.  As doctors, we care for patients of all ages who have or are suspected to have an infectious disease.  We seek to ensure that all patients under our care, including those who have or believe they may have Lyme disease, receive the highest quality of evidence-based medical care.  We have no other agenda.<br\/><br\/>Lyme disease is a significant infection which, if untreated, may progress to cause serious illness.  However, early Lyme disease is a clinical diagnosis which does not require laboratory testing and can be cured by a relatively short course of antibiotics.  Early Lyme infection does not always return a positive result in laboratory testing.  However, the reliability of testing increases over time such that one would expect those who have had symptoms for months or years due to Lyme disease to test positive.  In Ireland, samples are tested according to best international standards and the absence of a positive test is not a barrier to treatment.  If clinical suspicion is high, physicians can and do prescribe an appropriate three or four-week duration antibiotic treatment either orally or intravenously depending on the clinical symptoms.  Treatment in Ireland is based on international evidence-based guidelines drawn from several sources, including European guidelines and those of the IDSI.  None of those guidelines recommend prolonged courses of antibiotics to treat Lyme disease.<br\/><br\/>A small minority of patients experience persistent symptoms following appropriate and adequate treatment for Lyme infection.  However, prolonged courses of antibiotics have not been shown to benefit these patients.  There is no evidence of benefit, but there is evidence of potential harm.  Some patients have chronic disabling symptoms that are not readily explained medically although the symptoms are undeniable and can have a profound effect on quality of life.  Chronic Lyme infection may be proposed as the cause of such symptoms in spite of negative Lyme antibody tests and the patient having been afforded appropriate treatment.  However, there is no evidence to support the concept of chronic or persisting Lyme infection that is resistant to standard courses of antibiotic therapy.  Such diagnoses are frequently based on tests that are not accredited for clinical diagnosis and are carried out in overseas laboratories.  One of the major problems with such testing is that in an effort to achieve better sensitivity, that is, that a test will detect all possible cases, there is a profound loss of specificity.  That means that the tests may produce false positives indicating that persons without Lyme disease have been infected with the disease.<br\/><br\/>We sympathise with patients and families who are affected by chronic symptoms that significantly impact on their quality of life.  Our sincere goal is that all patients can have the best possible treatment outcome.  Prolonged antibiotic therapy does not benefit these patients.  Conversely, as I stated, it is associated with increased risk of serious unintentional harm.  We take very seriously the tenet of our profession: <i>primum non nocere<\/i>; first, do no harm.  It is a potent reminder that every medical and pharmacological decision carries the potential for harm.  Decisions regarding patient care should be based on validated scientific evidence.  Modern medicine is an evidence-based science and best outcomes are achieved when that underpins medical practice.<br\/><br\/>The IDSI is concerned that the use of tests not accredited as clinical diagnostic tests for Lyme disease may result in overdiagnosis of the disease and, often, other infections.  Additionally, in the worst cases the misleading results are associated with the potential for misdirected referral and inappropriate treatment.  Opportunities may be missed for thorough medical assessment to detect or exclude significant alternative pathology as the cause of the symptoms.  We recognise that there are research gaps in terms of the epidemiology, diagnostics and treatment of vector-borne diseases.<br\/><br\/>We appreciate that all present today and those involved in this issue undoubtedly seek the best outcomes for those affected.  However, we must acknowledge the real problem of the overdiagnosis of Lyme disease based on unaccredited tests carried out overseas.  Diagnosis and treatment of Lyme disease must be evidence-based.  Deployment of limited resources towards unvalidated treatments will necessarily deprive or curtail resources spent in other areas.  As doctors, my specialist colleagues and I are concerned to learn of patients travelling overseas for prolonged courses of intravenous antibiotics, often coupled with an array of nutritional supplements and treatments at significant cost and personal hazard but with no proven benefit.  There is no evidence of benefit to such treatments but there is potential for harm.  In our submission, we have sought to present accurately the current situation with regard to Lyme disease, its diagnosis and treatment.  We have no agenda other than to provide evidence-based, high-quality care for our patients.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018112800002#R00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Karina Butler"},{"type":"speech","time":1543395600,"counter":227,"content":"<p>I am unsure whether the witness heard the evidence presented to the committee earlier this morning.

My colleague, Dr. De Gascun of the National Virus Reference Laboratory, may wish to contribute on that point.  A US task force submission indicates that patients whose early Lyme disease was not diagnosed and who had very significant resultant chronic symptoms such as cardiac or other problems tested strongly positive in the standard two-step testing.<\/p> <p>  There is no doubt that a minority of persons diagnosed with and treated for Lyme disease will experience persistence of symptoms, but there is no evidence that that represents persistent infection.  In fact, randomised control studies have examined whether re-treatment with prolonged antibiotic therapies or adopting a holistic approach with other treatments would make any difference for such patients.  Although some patients got better, the proportion to do so was the same among those who received the treatment strategy as among those who did not.

I am a consultant in public health medicine.  In addition to concurring with Professor Butler, I would like to add some background information that might be useful.  In the United Kingdom and Ireland, serosurveys have been undertaken over the years.  In other words, blood has been taken from large groups of people and tested for the presence of past exposure to the borrelia bug, which we will call Lyme borreliosis.  The testers have generally done this by using blood donor blood.  There is a pool of blood taken from thousands of people that is tested for the presence or absence of Lyme disease.  The first of the tests was undertaken in the New Forest in Hampshire.  The New Forest is a well-known area that generates a lot of Lyme cases each year.  It was found that the background positivity rate - in other words, the proportion of people in the New Forest area - was approximately 22%.  The blood of approximately 600 subjects was tested.  Therefore, something shy of one person in four had a positive blood test.  I actually worked in the hospital that undertook the study.  The consultant there was very used to harking back to us.  We, a group of doctors, came in together and we were immediately enrolled in a study.  I had a blood sample taken and I was positive for Lyme disease.  The consultant said I had got it from the New Forest but since I had started work in the hospital only on the previous Monday, I believe I did not get it there.  I was almost certainly bitten by a tick on one of many happy holidays as a child in Achill.<\/p> <p>  During Professor Butler's introduction, she made the very important point that the diagnosis will be based upon clinical features and the presence of a positive blood test.  Irish figures suggest that, around Portumna, 8% to 10% of the background population have a positive Lyme test.  In other parts of the west, the proportion is much lower.  This shows it is a very localised phenomenon.  We know the area where one is most likely to come into contact with and be infected by ticks is publicly accessible parkland.  Around the west and south of Ireland, there are a number of areas that have concentrations of ticks that are infected.  When somebody goes for a Lyme blood test or any other type of test, it is important to ensure the results are taken in conjunction with the clinical picture of what he or she is exhibiting.  A positive test on its own can be misleading.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018112800002#S01100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Paul McKeown"},{"type":"speech","time":1543395600,"counter":241,"content":"<p>Had Dr. McKeown symptoms?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018112800002#S01200","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1543395600,"counter":242,"content":"<p>If I was bitten as a youngster in Keem I do not remember, but I know my mother used to bathe us and rub the ticks off.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018112800002#S01300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Paul McKeown"},{"type":"speech","time":1543395600,"counter":243,"content":"<p>It is reasonable to assume that Dr. McKeown was not symptomatic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018112800002#S01400","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1543395600,"counter":244,"content":"<p>I probably was not.

It is much harder to explain to patients why one does not do this.  Long courses of antibiotics are associated with the potential for harm and, as Dr. Gerard Sheehan said, even with courses to treat a bone infection, for which we have to do prescribe them, there is the hazard of secondary infections such as clostridium difficile and colitis.  There are hazards associated with antibiotics resistance and related to allergic reactions to antibiotics.

Doctors want to ensure the patients who come to see them will receive the correct diagnosis.  As for counting cases of Lyme disease and treating them, it is the same as everything else - one has to start with the correct diagnosis.  I agree that raising awareness is crucial in the context of the treatment of Lyme disease.  In 2011 the disease was made notifiable, but since about 2009 my organisation has had material on the website, designed to make Lyme disease comprehensible and tell people how to prevent it - by preventing tick bites and removing ticks after spending days in tick infested areas or areas where there are likely to be ticks.  This is information that should be available and we have been pressing to get it out, but getting information out to entire populations can sometimes be difficult.  In Ireland tick bites occur at a particular time of year and it is much more likely that one will be bitten by a tick between the end of March and November.  This information needs to be made available to people.  We hold a Lyme disease awareness week, which has become a Lyme disease awareness day, for that purpose.  At the beginning of the tick-biting season in March, April or early May we raise issues and point to posters and flyers.  We refer people to the frequently asked questions section on our website.  The information is supplemented by media interviews which I conduct every year.  Our Lyme disease sub-committee recommends that we make much greater use of social media and has suggested that, during the summer and after Lyme jisease awareness day, we send alerts fortnightly to our large Twitter following.  Raising awareness at this level is crucial and a major part of the work of the sub-committee which is involved in determining how much information is being given and how much more is needed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018112800002#U01400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Paul McKeown"},{"type":"speech","time":1543395600,"counter":291,"content":"<p>When one has a blood test done, the sample is sent off and a lot of things are tested for.

Generally speaking, for any test that is provided a doctor has to have a pre-test suspicion.  Certainly from the perspective of the National Virus Reference Laboratory, NVRL, our testing numbers date from the start of 2015 and we have performed over 21,000 tests for Lyme disease.  That figure increased by approximately 50% between 2015 and 2017.  We would infer that there is an increased awareness of Lyme disease and more testing for it.  Despite the increased testing being performed, the number of positive test results has not increased significantly.  In fact, it has probably decreased slightly which might suggest that more people who are not infected are being tested.<\/p> <p>  At the NVRL, we perform an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, ELISA, an antibody test that looks for immunoglobulin G, IgG.  Generally speaking, as we heard earlier, in the early stages of infection with erythema migrans the sensitivity of that assay is low.  That is well established and it is the reason we do not rely on it for the treatment of erythema migrans or early disease.  However, we also know that in the late stage of the disease it is almost universally positive in patients who have had infection for more than, say, three to six months.  The chances of patients presenting with a long-term illness of a year or two years or maybe more being falsely negative on the ELISA that we use are very slim.<\/p> <p>  We have referred approximately 1,200 of the 21,000 tests done since 2015 to the rare and imported pathogens laboratory in Public Health England in Porton Down, which is our reference laboratory.  It engages in a two-stage process, performing a second enzyme immune assay and the western blot or the current equivalent, the immunoblot to which the Deputy alluded.<\/p> <p>  There is access to testing in Ireland.  I operate a laboratory which receives more than 300,000 samples a year and we perform over 900,000 tests a year.  If there were a better test available, I would want to perform it.  I went into medicine to provide care for patients.  We review our testing repertoire across all pathogens for which we test.  We look for emerging pathogens and developments in the area in which we should be testing. <\/p> <p>  To touch on the previous point, there is no indication that there are better tests out there that we are not using.  Our concern in the context of testing is that people are travelling overseas to use unaccredited tests which have not made it to market.  Research to develop diagnostic testing for Lyme borreliosis has been taking place probably since the 1980s.  The US Centers for Disease Control, CDC, made recommendations in the mid-1990s regarding the two-tiered approach and that has not been surpassed.  If there were a better approach out there, pharma would be in like a shot.  Equally, if there were better tests I would introduce them.  The concern for us is that people are using tests that are not validated.  I am not suggesting any testing approach is perfect, which is why we work with our clinical colleagues.  If they have a high index of suspicion and my test is negative, we would refer it on and perform additional testing.  There is no barrier to testing in our laboratory and I can certainly speak for the other laboratories around the country. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018112800002#V00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Cillian De Gascun"},{"type":"speech","time":1543395600,"counter":294,"content":"<p>It was suggested in the discussion this morning that the medical profession in general is sceptical of the results achieved overseas in terms of treatment and diagnosis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018112800002#V00300","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1543395600,"counter":295,"content":"<p>In terms of diagnosis we are sceptical because they are unaccredited tests and the data from those tests have not been published in the literature.

I have inquired about it but the person involved is on holiday.  The previous survey was two to three years ago.  Tick surveys are useful whenever the concentration of ticks in a given habitat can be determined.  It is also useful to know the proportion of those ticks that are positive.  Generally, it is anything from 5% to 25%.  The important point is that there is a danger that this would make us complacent and we would believe ourselves to be safe in a given area because only 2% of the ticks there are infected and there are not that many of them.  A basic universal precautions approach should apply.  We know that the kinds of areas where ticks are to be found are very well described.  They are woodland or parkland.  Ticks clamber up fronds of grass and hang on to them with their back legs ready to jump at any passing mammal, including humans.  We know from surveys across Europe that 90% of adults bitten by ticks are bitten on their hands, arms, legs or feet and that approximately 40% to 50% of children bitten are bitten around their hairlines and in their necks, particularly the soft tissues there.  We would therefore much prefer universal advice to the effect that these are the kinds of areas where one can expect there to be more ticks and that these basic precautions should be taken when examining oneself.  One is most likely to find a tick on one's arms or legs, but everywhere should be examined.  Therefore, while such surveys are useful, I would not base any strong policy on them.  I would want to ensure that everyone had the necessary information to minimise the chances of being bitten by a tick.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018112800002#W00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Paul McKeown"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1543395600,"counter":314,"content":"<p>To answer the Vice Chairman's question, the most recent publication was in 2017 and was based on tick surveys in 2016.

I have discussed the issue with Dr. Lambert, who has been a colleague of mine for many years, and I have looked at his research in this area.  I have suggested to him that where questions are unanswered and it is reasonable to hypothesise, we should do so.  If we do not have an answer to a question but suspect what it might be, we should design a study to test the hypothesis.  That has not yet been done.  What has been reported are anecdotal case series reports of patients whose symptoms have been improved with treatment.  However, as I explained earlier, perhaps before Deputy MacSharry entered the room, one must consider whether something is causal or temporarily related.  To determine that, one needs well conducted and controlled scientifically and ethically reviewed research.  We await the results of such studies.  Studies meeting those parameters which have examined prolonged antibiotic therapy for patients with these symptoms who are seronegative have not indicated benefit for the patients.<\/p> <p>  The key fact is that there are patients who have a range of symptoms for which we, as doctors, do not have ready explanations.  When I began my training, such symptoms were attributed to chronic brucellosis, which was mentioned and for which people received prolonged courses of antibiotics in the absence of diagnosis.  They have also been attributed to chronic fatigue syndrome, glandular fever virus and vaccinations.  There are still such patients and the only way we will get to the bottom of their illness is through well conducted and controlled research.  When such research has been carried out to investigate whether Lyme is the explanation for such symptoms, it has not found any evidence that that is the case.  The problem is that patients and their families who desperately want to get better are driven to seek solutions.  They are being fed the misinformation that there is an answer to their problems and that it they take the antibiotics and many other treatments, they will have a better life.  Some such patients will get better but that will not result from the course of treatment but, rather, come about because it is the time for that to happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018112800002#Y01200","nonspeaker":"Professor Karina Butler"},{"type":"speech","time":1543395600,"counter":434,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.

The implication is that some people are practicing what other physicians believe to be based on inaccurate medicine.  Those present are saying that long-term antibiotic use could be damaging and others take a different view.  I say there were 100 publications but the witnesses said this is not the case.  Professor Butler stated that Dr. Cameron was censured, and he was, but it was not for that matter.  It would be fair to point that out for the record and it would be misleading for us to leave the committee with the impression that it was based on his findings on long-term treatment with antibiotics.  I am not querying anyone's competence and especially not that of Senator Colm Burke, and I know that he did not intend to question mine.<\/p><p>I have a concern regarding the division of discourse, particularly in the context of the 12 people from the Department versus Dr. Lambert.  Numerous people have contacted the joint committee and we set up an<i>ad hoc <\/i>cross-party action group online because Members from all parties and none were being approached by individuals who stated that they had Lyme disease.  There are two people in this room who have gone abroad for treatment and who recovered.  Perhaps Professor Butler is correct in stating that it is all in their minds, but perhaps she is not.<br\/><br\/>This country has paid a heavy price for choosing to dismiss or not listen to dissenting voices.  There are two tests, namely, the western blot test and the ELISA test.  The Infectious Diseases Society of America has stated that the latter test is sub-optimal .  The only thing that is agreed is that there is no definitive test.  What is the problem with clinical diagnosis?  If the symptoms fit, what is the problem with applying the range of treatments?  Dr. Sheehan may favour one and Dr. Lambert may favour another but the proof of the pudding is that patients are being helped.  I am not a physician but I have met people affected by this disease.  One of them is present.  He was previously in a wheelchair and now he is not.  I am concerned regarding the number of physicians from various hospitals and bodies who have turned out today to rubbish the patient experience, on one hand, and Dr. Lambert's view, on the other.  The fact that we are choosing, in the words of Professor Butler, to view the patient experience as something to be taken with a pinch of salt is regrettable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018112800002#AA04000","speaker":"1346","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543395600,"counter":533,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy MacSharry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018112800002#BB00200","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1543395600,"counter":534,"content":"<p>I will address the point regarding representation.

I am very grateful for this opportunity.  I will begin with some general points and background.  We know about our own past when it comes to protecting and guarding children and how much it leaves to be desired.  We had all of the events in industrial schools, mother and baby homes, Magdalen laundries and foster homes.  However, Ireland has come a long way in ensuring the safety of children and we have seen the progress that has been made on child welfare and protection.  Even though there is still room for improvement in Ireland we can only imagine what it must be like for children in those countries where they do not have protection and do not have child welfare or safeguards.  The Bill is about trying to protect children who are easy prey for sexual predators in countries where the authorities cannot or will not protect them from those convicted of sexual abuse in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child recognises a child as being a person under the age of 18.  Child abuse is also about trafficking, which is the third biggest illegal industry after arms and drugs and accounts for billions of dollars annually.  Statistics indicate that 2 million children are lured or abducted into sexual exploitation, which is modern-day slavery.  A report by Ending Child Prostitution and Trafficking, ECPAT, International states child sex tourism has drastically increased.  It is a real incongruity that we speak about children and sex tourism in the same sentence.  One of the main reasons is that the increase in global travel has created more opportunities for abuse.  The offenders are generally white, western middle-aged men of some means.  There are also women offenders and we also have situational offenders.  The promotion of tourism for economic growth in these poorer countries brings more and more westerners to places with little or no regulation or policing but more and more children available for sex.  We know the countries involved are India and counties in south-east Asia, Latin America, the Caribbean and Africa.<\/p> <p>  There have been many high-profile cases but I will mention one that I have already mentioned when speaking on this issue.  This is the case of a seven year old child who was sold to a former US marine.  The former marine was eventually extradited from south-east Asia and is serving a very extensive prison sentence in the United States.  We also have records of the sale of virgin girls and organised sex rings.  There is evidence of organisations offering sex tours with stops at bars and restaurants that are fronts for child prostitution.<\/p> <p>  The impetus for the Bill came from meetings with Irish priest, Fr. Shay Cullen, who is directly involved in rescuing children from the sex tourism industry in the Philippines and supporting children affected by it.  We all know the physical, emotional and psychological consequences for children.  There have been cases of suicide, attempted suicide, depression, addiction and sexually transmitted illnesses.  At a press conference I was at with Fr. Cullen he spoke of what has been happening through the dark web and the rise in child pornography.  To join a photo sharing paedophile club on the dark web, applicants must submit pictures of children being abused.  Some clubs insist on the applicant showing himself perpetrating the abuse.  To get the images, men travel to countries where there are ample opportunities to photograph and video such abuse.  The images then give them a pass to access further unlimited images.  This requirement to provide pictures is fuelling travel to poor countries.  We know that cybersex is on the increase.  Fr. Cullen spoke about five and six year olds being abused in this way over the Internet.  The abuse is carried out to order and customers around the world pay per view through money transfer companies.<\/p> <p>  I will give another example from Australia.  In 2017, it emerged that 700 to 800 Australian male convicted child sex offenders were travelling annually to countries in south-east Asia, such as the Philippines, Cambodia and Thailand.  Following this revelation, the Australian Government passed the Passports Legislation Amendment (Overseas Travel by Child Sex Offenders) Act 2017.  It was introduced in the Australian Parliament on 14 June 2017, passed both Houses on 20 June and received assent on 26 June.  It allows a competent authority of the Australian Government to request its Minister for Foreign Affairs to refuse to issue, cancel or order the surrender of a person's Australian passport if his or her name is on a child protection offender register.  This is to prevent reportable offenders from travelling overseas to sexually exploit or abuse vulnerable children.<\/p> <p>  This is a tricky situation for which to legislate because of the constitutional right to travel.  Although it is wonderful to have this right to travel, it was never intended to grant a right to travel to a person to abuse children in other countries when that person has been convicted of child sexual abuse in his or her own country.  The purpose is to regulate and restrict where appropriate sex offenders from travelling abroad in the interests of the common good and to protect persons outside the State from serious harm.  It seeks to do this by increasing the powers of judges.  It is not an outright ban on travelling.  It relates to those convicted of child abuse, whether a physical act of abuse of children or using child pornography films, child abuse images or recordings on phones.  It recognises the constitutional right to travel but also the need to protect children abroad.  The restriction provisions will be decided on a case by case basis by a judge who can weigh up the issues.  There is a lot of constitutional protection.  The convicted person is heard and represented and the judge can hear whether the offender has been genuinely engaging with a recognised rehabilitation programme.  It will be the judge who will strike the balance between the Constitution and the protection of children outside Ireland from those convicted of child abuse in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  I suggest it is not so much about punishing the sex offender with regard to travel as protecting children.  When we look at the facts of the growing child sex tourism to holiday destinations such as Poland, the Philippines and other places, I must question the current freedom of sex offenders to travel to these places.  There is also the frame of mind of the offenders when they return to Ireland from a place that is normalising the abuse and exploitation of children.<\/p> <p>  There are just two sections in the Bill.  It has a narrow remit for obvious reasons.  It is focused on giving powers to judges.  It empowers them on the evidence of child abuse to impose conditions and travel limitations at the time of sentencing or later, when the judge is satisfied there is or is not a risk of offending abroad.<\/p><p>For example, a convicted sex offender may have leave to travel to England for a few days for a funeral or family event, but not to a country where there is known child abuse.<\/p><p> It is a small step, but it would be a clear signal that Ireland - we would be the first country in Europe to do so - does not want its child offenders to be in a position to offend in other countries where child abuse is happening with impunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018112800002#D00200","speaker":"1291","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543395600,"counter":563,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

I propose to highlight some key issues relating to our work with sex offenders, which may assist the committee.  We will be more than happy to answer questions and engage in further discussion on any matter as the committee sees fit.<\/p> <p>  The Probation Service is an agency of the Department of Justice and Equality and the two primary areas of work undertaken by it are offender assessment and offender supervision.  Regarding sex offenders specifically, since the publication of the discussion document of the working group on the integrated management of high risk sex offenders by the then Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in 2009, integrated, interagency and multidisciplinary services have been developed significantly.  Our focus is now on effective risk management, incorporating assessment, supervision, support and the monitoring of sex offenders to reduce the risk of reoffending and the harm that any further offending would cause.  The Probation Service is managing 264 sex offenders in the community.<\/p> <p>  The courts, prior to sentencing, frequently request a probation officer's pre-sanction assessment report on offenders who have pleaded guilty to, or been found guilty of, a sexual offence.  The assessment report identifies issues relevant to the risk assessment and risk management of the offender.  Many convictions for sexual offences attract an immediate custodial sanction.  These sanctions may also include an appropriate community sanction element, with supervision conditions, post custody.<\/p> <p>  To improve the co-ordinated, interagency management of sex offenders, the sex offender risk assessment and management, SORAM, system was developed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Probation Service for the joint assessment and management of the risk posed within the community by convicted sex offenders.  The model itself allows for enhanced working relationships between the personnel in relevant agencies, a structured approach to risk management, a co-ordinated intervention with the offender, higher levels of monitoring, higher levels of appropriate information exchange, more accurate risk assessment, and enhanced child and public safety.<\/p> <p>  The Probation Service welcomes the proposed new section 14A in the principal Act, or head 9 in the general scheme, that places on a statutory basis the assessment and management of risk posed by sex offenders.  It will further strengthen the current SORAM arrangements and make obligatory the sharing of risk-relevant information between the relevant players.<\/p> <p>  Multi-agency approaches to managing the risks posed by sex offenders are essential.  The Probation Service, in partnership with a number of non-governmental organisations and supported through the Department of Justice and Equality, provides a range of additional support services to assist further in the management of risk posed by this category of offenders and their reintegration into society.  We have outlined some of those in our submission.<\/p> <p>  Placing the victim at the forefront of our work is critical, and developing a victim perspective in the offender is paramount.  While our expertise is directed primarily towards offender rehabilitation as a means of reducing victimisation, we recognise that focusing in this way on the offender can lead victims to feel that their safety, rights, needs and interests may not be prioritised.  This should not be the case.  Survivors' advocacy groups work closely with us on initiatives, such as Circles of Support and Accountability, CoSA, and our therapeutic group work programmes.  Other restorative justice approaches include victim-offender mediation.  We facilitate such approaches where appropriate, but only after careful, and often lengthy, preparation.<\/p> <p>  Public protection is the key principle underpinning the management of sex offenders sentenced to prison and under the supervision of the Probation Service.  Therapeutic interventions in prison are in place, including individual and group counselling and offence-focused work from the Irish Prison Service's psychology service, in partnership with the Probation Service.  Within the community, the SORAM arrangements provide for an integrated, multi-agency approach to this work.  Both statutory and non-statutory partners collaborate in this endeavour.<\/p> <p>  It is hoped that changes to the legislation, as proposed, will lead to further developments in responding effectively to sexual aggression and violence.  Such refinements to the Sex Offenders Act 2001 will, among other things, strengthen the ability of statutory agencies to manage sex offenders by placing SORAM on a statutory basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018112800002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Vivian Geiran"},{"type":"speech","time":1543395600,"counter":565,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Geiran.

I am the assistant chief constable with responsibility for the crime operations department, which covers our organised crime, serious crime, public protection, intelligence, and specialist operations branches.  I am relatively new to the post, having just taken it up in September.  With me are Detective Chief Superintendent Paula Hilman, who is the head of the PSNI's public protection unit, and Detective Superintendent Ryan Henderson.<\/p> <p>  It is important to put on the record an apology.  Mr. Alan Smyth from the Northern Ireland Prison Service, NIPS, and chair of the strategic management board, which is under our public protection arrangements, would have liked to have attended.  Unfortunately, he cannot.  The board encompasses some of the multi-agency work that we do.<\/p> <p>  The Criminal Justice (Northern Ireland) Order 2008 established the statutory basis for public protection.  These arrangements are known as the public protection arrangements Northern Ireland, PPANI.  In England, Wales and Scotland, similar arrangements are known as multi-agency public protection arrangements, MAPPA.  The arrangements involve agencies working together and sharing information to better protect the public in a co-ordinated manner.  However, the legislation does not form a corporate body to deliver these.  The relevant criminal justice agencies, such as the police, NIPS, probation service, the health and social care trusts and others, deliver on their own statutory responsibilities and obligations relating to public protection in a joined-up and co-operative way.  It is important to note that the public protection arrangements do not replace existing child protection procedures.<\/p> <p>  The PPANI are governed by a strategic management board, which comprises senior managers from all lead agencies and two lay advisers.  The board is chaired alternately, on a rotational basis, by the PSNI, the Probation Board for Northern Ireland, PBNI, and the NIPS.  Currently, it is chaired by NIPS, with responsibility transferring to the PSNI and Detective Chief Superintendent Hilman in April 2019.<\/p> <p>  There are a number of eligibility criteria for inclusion within the public protection arrangements.<\/p><p>It includes persons who are subject to the notification requirements of part 2 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 or who have been convicted of a sexual offence or sexually motivated offence and are not subject to the notification requirements of part 2 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 but about whom an agency has current significant concerns.  It includes persons who have from 6 October 2008 been convicted of a violent offence, including homicide against a child or vulnerable adult or who have a previous conviction for a violent offence against a child or vulnerable adult and about whom an agency has current significant concerns.  It includes persons who have from 1 April 2010 been convicted of a violent offence, including homicide in domestic or family circumstances or who have a previous conviction for a violent offence in domestic or family circumstances and about whom an agency has significant concerns.  From 1 July 2013, new referrals into PPANI of violence in a domestic or family circumstance must have a minimum conviction of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, AOABH.  It also includes persons who have from 1 September 2011 been convicted under certain circumstances of a violent offence, including homicide, and received an enhanced sentence and where the offence has been aggravated by hostility, and about whom an agency has significant concern.  Persons subject to a risk of sexual harm order, RSHO are also included.<\/p><p> Within the PPANI arrangements offenders are categorised as category 1, 2 or 3.  Persons in category 3 are deemed to pose the highest level of risk of harm.  Where an offender is assessed as meeting the criteria for category 3, management of the case is allocated to the co-located public protection team, PPT.  The PPT consists of line managers and practitioners from the PSNI, PBNI and the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust.  The aim of the PPT is to provide for a consistent level of management of risk for those offenders in the community who represent the greatest cause for concern.  The different disciplines within PPT allow for the delivery of a tailored risk management plan alongside an individual intervention and support plan aimed at developing the offender&rsquo;s internal controls.<\/p><p> Each year PPANI is required to produce an annual report outlining the work undertaken by the relevant agencies involved in public protection.  It has recently published an analytical profile of offenders subject to PPANI arrangements.  The policy and working arrangements for public protection in Northern Ireland are contained within the comprehensive PPANI manual of guidance.<\/p><p> Turning to the aspects of the proposed legislation highlighted within the invitation for today, I thought it would be helpful to highlight some pertinent points.  With regard to notification requirements, in Northern Ireland the Sexual Offences Act 2003, as amended, requires all PPANI eligible offenders to notify within three days of being informed of their requirement to do so.  The three days starts at midnight on the day they were informed.  To notify they must attend at a police station.  They are required to notify a number of matters, including an address at which they will be living, details of any absences of more than three days from that address, travel arrangements and accommodation arrangements during their absence, and proposed travel arrangements outside the United Kingdom.  They are also required to provide fingerprints and permit a photograph to be taken to confirm their identity. These requirements work well in practice.<\/p><p> Offenders are encouraged to disclose details of their offending where appropriate and allow this disclosure to be verified.  If an offender refuses, or the disclosure cannot be verified, then existing agency powers will be used, such as child protection protocols utilised by social services colleagues.  If no power exists, then a PPANI disclosure form will be commenced.  In such cases the PSNI Chief Constable is responsible for making the decision regarding disclosure.<\/p><p> The Justice Act 2015 also introduced the child protection disclosure arrangements.  Under these arrangements a person may apply for conviction information where there are concerns regarding a named person and named children.  If the criteria are met, then disclosure is made to the person best placed to safeguard the child.  We believe these arrangements work well in practice.<\/p><p> There is no specific legislative provision for the electronic monitoring of sex offenders pre or post conviction in Northern Ireland.  There are, however, general powers relating to electronic monitoring applicable to all offenders.  The basis for electronic monitoring of offenders in general is found within the Criminal Justice (Northern Ireland) Order 2008.  The legislation provides the power to impose a curfew or electronic requirement where a condition of bail is granted by a court, where a condition of a licence is specified in article 35(b) of the order, and where it is a requirement of a probation order or youth conference plan.<\/p><p> Foreign travel orders are set out in the Sexual Offences Act 2003, as amended.  Where there are concerns that a specific child, or children in general are at risk of serious sexual harm from an offender, we can apply to court for a foreign travel order which prohibits the offender from travelling to the specified country or any country outside the UK.  The offender will be required to surrender his or her passport.  The offender must be a qualifying offender, which in the main is an offender who has committed a sexual offence against a child or offences relating to indecent images or material relating to a child.  To meet the threshold for a foreign travel order there must be grounds to believe that the offender travelling to a certain country poses a risk to children.<\/p><p> It is our understanding that there are no current plans for legislative change in Northern Ireland in terms of the management of sex offenders.  If any such changes were planned, consultation and implementation would be progressed through the multi-agency public protection arrangements and the strategic management board which will be chaired by Detective Chief Superintendent Hilman from April of next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018112800002#E00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Barbara Gray","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1543395600,"counter":570,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for inviting a representative from the Rape Crisis Ireland Network to speak here today.  We are very grateful for the opportunity.  We have two major areas of concern when it comes to sex offenders.  We must do all we can, even if it amounts to little, to help ensure that the risk from sex offenders in the community is reduced as far as possible and that those responsible for their monitoring, support and supervision have the range of powers necessary to enable them to do their job.  The second concern is perhaps more nebulous, but it is very important.  We are concerned to do as much as possible to ensure that victims of convicted sex offenders do not feel vulnerable or powerless once the person responsible for the offence committed against them is released into the community.  We have to ensure that those victims know that things are being done.  Perhaps in certain cases more can be done.<\/p> <p>  We very much welcome these two pieces of legislation.  The general scheme seems to be very comprehensive.  I will go through a few of the heads to highlight some of our recommendations and to provide the rationale for them.  On head No. 5, notification requirements, we welcome the broadening of powers.  Over the years we have heard much from various members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na about the vagueness of the current Act on the exact detail of how reporting should take place and what happens in special situations, for example, where a person is homeless, disabled or detained outside the jurisdiction.<\/p><p>Over the years we have heard much from members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na about the vagueness of the Act with regard to the exact detail of how reporting should take place and what happens in special situations where somebody is homeless, disabled or detained outside the jurisdiction.  There is much clarity, which we welcome.  The committee might consider including an extra requirement of notification so a sex offender would have to provide any address at which he regularly resides and stays as well as his main home address when he goes to notify a particular member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  <\/p><p> We have also singled out head 9.  I echo what the representatives of the Probation Service said.  It is good that the process of risk assessment and risk management has been finally put on a statutory basis.  It is very important there is effective liaison with local NGOs that support victims, not just rape crisis centres but others.  Why is that important?  It is important to our clients.  It is important they are well informed and informed by the responsible officials about what is being done to supervise and monitor sex offenders in the community.  It is also important that, heaven forfend, they have concerns in the future about the behaviour of a particular individual they know what to do with those concerns.  The general principle is to try to counter the culture of fear, the feeling that one is helpless and the idea that while it is not right for people to take the law into their own hands, it is understood why they did it.  We have to counter that in the interests of good risk management.  With regard to the way it is drafted, with great respect to the drafters, the risk management role, which is important and which goes on for a long time, should be stressed in the language a bit more.  Perhaps they should be called risk assessment and management teams.  We also suggest there is a mechanism for receiving information from third parties.  Sometimes people come into possession of information and think it is really scary and are not sure what to do with it.  It would be great if there was a place they could go with it.  <\/p><p> With regard to head 10, disclosure of information, a number of brakes are put on the process of disclosure where there is a risk of vigilante activity as a result of the disclosure.  Another thing that should be included on the list - I am sure it is at the forefront of the minds of the garda&iacute; in question but it is no harm to include it - is a brake on disclosure where there is a risk to a present or potential future investigation or prosecution.  It would be devastating for survivors if a possible prosecution were jeopardised by misuse of information which had been disclosed in this manner.  Consideration should be given to a sanction for misuse of information.<\/p><p> I will come onto the Bill in a minute but with regard to the general scheme and head 18 on prohibition orders, it is very welcome there is a proposal to introduce orders preventing people who have been convicted of a sex offence from working with children or vulnerable persons.  I have two comments about that.  The first is a general one.  Should these orders not be coextensive with notification requirements so that as long as a person is a sex offender he or she should be precluded absolutely from working with children or vulnerable persons?  I am also concerned about the way it is drafted.  As it is drafted, I am concerned about situations in which somebody is convicted of a sex offence for which the maximum penalty is not life, for example in the case of sexual assault and a maximum sentence of ten years.  If a person gets a high sentence, for example eight years, because the person is a repeat offender or was found guilty of an extremely serious assault, with remission that person will be out in six years.  The remaining possible term of the prohibition order cannot go beyond the overall maximum of ten years.  Therefore, the person will be precluded from working with children for only four years.  It is almost as if that person gets a reward for behaving worse.  It cannot be the intention of the legislation.  With great respect, I suggest the simplest way to fix it is just to make prohibition orders similar to notification requirements so that one is subject to them as long as one is subject to notification requirements.  <\/p><p> I will make one final small point on the general scheme about the discharge of orders.  It has come to our attention several times that people who have been the victims of sex offenders get very upset when these offenders apply, for instance, to no longer be subject to notification requirements.  There are several places in the general scheme as in the current legislation where there are discharge provisions.  I have no objection to people applying for discharge but I think it is right in any of these applications that somebody would get the opportunity to be heard as a victim of sexual violence.  It should be in there.  <\/p><p> We welcome Deputy O'Sullivan's Bill in principle.  It is a terrific idea.  I note with great interest what is happening in Northern Ireland.  Surely if it happening in Northern Ireland it ought to happen here.  I have a small concern.  Perhaps I am wrong to have this concern but nevertheless I have it.  I wonder if it should not be framed in a more tight fashion so there is a clear threshold as there is under the proposed section 26C on prohibition orders and as it is framed in the Northern Irish foreign travel orders that there should be a threshold that has to be overcome before such an order can be made.  I say this being mindful of the right to travel in the Constitution.  My thinking is it might be wise to insulate this provision as far as we can from attack on the grounds that it is unconstitutional or oppressive because it would be great to have it.  It would be a terrific addition to the armoury that we already have.  I thank the committee for its patience.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018112800002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Caroline Counihan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543395600,"counter":572,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Counihan.

I very much welcome the opportunity to be able to discuss the changes proposed under the Sex Offenders (Amendment) Bill and the Private Members' Bill.  I will focus on three of the proposed amendments today.  The first is on the Private Members' Bill, the purpose of which is to regulate and restrict sex offenders from travelling abroad in order to protect persons from serious harm outside of the State.<\/p><p>The proposals echo similar provisions available elsewhere, including the UK, the US and Australia, which have in some way sought to ban or restrict the travel of sex offenders abroad.  The rationale for such provisions is that individuals who have offended against a child pose an extremely high risk of re-offending and that these laws will stop them from doing so.  Perceptions of dangerousness are overestimated to some extent and studies in Ireland and elsewhere have shown that recidivism among sex offenders is low.  The effectiveness of such laws are also in doubt.  In 2016, a global study on sexual exploitation of children in travel and tourism found that sexual exploitation of children in such circumstances is a mainly domestic and intra-regional crime and that situational and domestic offenders account for most cases of such abuse, rather than international preferential offenders.  While some abusers are paedophiles, most are not.Most are situational offenders, namely, those with no prior history of sexual offending against a child.  While child sexual abuse and exploitation is, and should be, an important policy concern for lawmakers, it does little good to enact laws and impose requirements such as travel bans or restrictions when there is no evidence to suggest that such laws are effective in reducing the risk to those they aim to protect.<br\/><br\/>It is necessary to consider rights such as the right to travel, the right to liberty and the right to privacy and family life under both the Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights, ECHR.  Constitutional and-or human rights violations may be found as a result of arbitrary, unnecessary and disproportionate interference with such rights.  In particular, these provisions could give rise to an unjustifiable interference with privacy and family life under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and, perhaps, with earning a livelihood where the individual has to travel for work or to enjoy family life, for example, in a cross-jurisdictional context.  If restrictions rather than a ban are to be placed upon travel, it needs to be made clear how these will be imposed and implemented so that they will not be considered to be arbitrary and unnecessary.  Any restrictions imposed will require increasing the quality, quantity and regularity of the information shared with other jurisdictions on child sex offenders in order to effectively oversee the movement of offenders who travel abroad.  At a practical level this may be difficult to achieve because it becomes a resources issue.  Overall, I would suggest that the circumstances which would give rise to these restrictions need to be clearer; an evidence-based risk should exist and the restriction or ban must be deemed to be proportionate and necessary in all the circumstances.  This could be expressly incorporated into the wording of the provisions.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>My second point is on Head 10 of the main Bill, which deals with community disclosure.  I welcome legislative clarity relating to the disclosure of information to the public, as well as the controlled disclosure approach being proposed.  Generally speaking, disclosure laws are enacted with the objective of preventing recidivistic sex crimes. Such laws may garner strong support in the belief that knowing where sex offenders are will make us safer.  However, the effectiveness of disclosure in this regard has been called into question by countless studies.  Empirical research has not uncovered any demonstrable effect on future sexual offending.  Moreover, rather than reduce fear, disclosure in some circumstances can heighten the fear and anxiety of persons who have received such information.  There is a need for follow-up support in such circumstances.<br\/><br\/>The wording of the proposed provision seems to suggest that the issue of disclosure rests with the Garda and is thus proactive rather than reactive.  I would like clarification on whether the provision intends to be reactive in the sense of permitting applications from parents, guardians or third parties.  While the proposal is not confined to the protection of children insofar as it aims to protect any person, it is worth noting that equivalent provisions in the UK provide that disclosure will only be made to the person-persons best placed to protect the child or vulnerable adult rather than to the public at large.  I would strongly suggest consideration be given to the inclusion of such wording in the context of this provision as well, where it involves protection of a child.  Moreover the provisions does not make any mention of confidentiality of the information once a disclosure has been made.  This is notable, considering that under Head 9, confidentiality is expressly required in relation to information sharing, albeit in a different context.  Confidentiality should apply, in particular with regard to data protection laws.  This should be incorporated into the proposed amendment.  Overall, the provision should expressly provide that disclosure will only be made in exceptional circumstances where considered necessary and proportionate to do so. <br\/><br\/>My final point relates to Heads 13 and 19, which provide for electronic monitoring of sex offenders, either as part of a sex offenders order or as a condition of post-release supervision.  The rationale of such a measure appears to be to monitor compliance or identify risky behaviour.  While measures such as electronic monitoring may provide reassurance and are argued to have a deterrent effect, such a measure also raises legal and ethical concerns.  Any scheme which proposes to introduce tagging of those who have already served their sentence raises the issue of additional punishment, possibly in breach of the constitutional principle of proportionality.  Tagging is far more intrusive than signing on at a Garda station and it has a greater impact upon privacy and freedom of movement rights.  A way of reconciling such constitutional concerns could be to incorporate the measure as part of a remission scheme whereby early release may be granted in conjunction with tagging.  Alternatively, the courts could be required to take electronic monitoring into consideration when sentencing and thus ensure proportionality in the combined overall sentence.  The effectiveness of this measure, in terms of deterrence or preventing recidivism, is empirically unproven.  Evidence that it reduces recidivism is scant and experience in other countries on a more general level and in regard to monitoring of high risk sex offenders has demonstrated that it has significant limitations in this regard.  There is limited evidence available in the US and in some jurisdictions in Europe to support the contention that the tagging of high risk sex offenders may be useful in terms of ensuring compliance with registration requirements but such measures have no perceived effect on recidivism.  Where monitoring reveals a new crime, this tends to be in relation to a breach of registration requirements rather than sexual re-offending.  The research shows that electronic monitoring is not cost effective and, moreover, that knowledge about offenders' whereabouts will not necessarily effect change in underlying criminal behaviour.  The support for electronic monitoring has been described by some as a &quot;belief in a technology-focused approach as a 'silver bullet' to solving crime and other social problems&quot; but that this provides a &quot;misleading assurance of safety.&quot;  Electronic monitoring is a short-term solution and while it may address some immediate concerns in relation to individual high risk sex offenders, it does not provide the means for effectively dealing with sexual offending behaviour in the long term.  The best available evidence suggests that monitoring is more effective when it is carefully targeted and integrated with other forms of supports and risk management.  Given the lack of research in this area with regard to the effectiveness of tagging and its impact upon the monitored person and his or her family, there is a strong argument to be made that there should be an inbuilt evaluation of the impact and effectiveness of this initiative if introduced. <br\/><br\/>There are significant gaps in our knowledge of whether these and other sex offender laws have any effect in terms of reducing sexual offending or reoffending behaviour.  Sex offenders are most certainly not a homogeneous group.  They vary considerably in terms of their characteristics and level of risk.  What is sorely needed are empirically derived risk assessment procedures that will help us to target and more effectively manage those at highest risk of sexual re-offending.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018112800002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Margaret Fitzgerald-O'Reilly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543395600,"counter":575,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Fitzgerald-'O'Reilly for her thoughtful contribution to the committee's deliberations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018112800002#H00200","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1543395600,"counter":576,"content":"<p>I thank all of the delegates for being here today and for the considerable amount of effort they put into their submissions.

I understand the overall sentiment expressed by Deputy Clare Daly, however, because there must be a question of how best to protect the public and whether these laws provide the means for effectively protecting people from sexual offending or sexual re-offending.  To answer that, we must look at the evidence produced in other jurisdictions.  I am going to take the US as an extreme example.  It is obviously a very different context and jurisdiction to Ireland but it has had notification rules in existence since the 1940s.  Megan's law, the notable public disclosure law, passed its 20th anniversary in 2016.  Studies conducted into the effectiveness of these sex offender registration and notification, SORN, laws demonstrate that there is no appreciable impact as a deterrent or reducing recidivism.  There is no appreciable difference in recidivism rates in different empirical studies done in different jurisdictions between groups that are subject to these registration requirements and groups that are not.  We must have regard to that.  Consequently, in respect of effectiveness in helping to address the broader and long-term issue of sexual offending behaviour, it is right that we question whether things like notification and disclosure laws will help.  <\/p> <p>  To some extent, in relation to issues of disclosure for example, the approach of controlled disclosure is to be advocated.  I would certainly hate to see us move towards a widespread access, and I do not think that is being suggested at all, because it has been demonstrated to be profoundly unhelpful and counterproductive.  <\/p> <p>  Sometimes the question is what propels people to sexual offending behaviour, when a more pertinent question might be what helps convicted sex offenders to stop sex offending; not just why they offend, but why did they stop offending.  Again, we have to look at evidence available in other jurisdictions, as well as in the Irish context, that suggests it is through reintegration, reconnecting with society by reconnecting or maintaining family ties and through rehabilitation and engagement with those services and supports that help prevent recidivistic behaviour in the future.  Preventing people from reoffending is ultimately what will be of benefit to our society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018112800002#K00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Margaret Fitzgerald-O'Reilly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1543395600,"counter":609,"content":"<p>The prevent strategy is very important and the PSNI takes an approach with the two strategies of prevent and pursue running parallel to each other rather than looking at them in isolation.

They would have either a probation officer or a Garda case manager dealing with them and they would not be part of the SORAM process.<\/p> <p>  We use two risk assessments in particular.  There is a static risk assessment called the risk matrix 2000, RM2000, which is based on historical information and that enables us to have a baseline categorisation in terms of low, medium, high or very high risk of reoffending over a longer period of time.<\/p> <p>  Then we go into what we call the stable and acute risk assessment.  Going back to Deputy O'Callaghan's point about the causation, that risk assessment is much more intensive and it takes place with the offender over a series of interviews.  It looks at a whole range of issues such as the offender's capacity for relationships, their hostility towards women for example, whether they are impulsive in nature and whether they have good problem solving skills.  It then looks at the issue of sex and whether their sex drive and preoccupation with sex is a factor underlining their offending, whether they use sex as a coping mechanism and whether they have deviant sexual preferences.<\/p> <p>  That information is garnered and we use collateral information as well.  We look at the book of evidence from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, we work with the family of the offender where possible and if they have been in prison we liaise with our psychology colleagues in the Irish Prison Service and our integrated sentence managers and that enables us to build up a full picture.  It is based on a relationship as our colleagues said so the better the relationship that we have with the offender, the greater the quality of information we have and that gives us the ability to target particular areas.  An assessment is not just there to give a label and a category but the benefit of it is to figure out what the case management plan should be and what are the areas that we need to target which will ensure there is no reoffending in the future and that there are no victims.<\/p> <p>  We do that with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and with our colleagues in the local authorities and in Tusla.  We are all trained together and indeed some of our colleagues recently went up to Northern Ireland to train some of the Police Authority for Northern Ireland, PANI, people in the RM2000.  There is a lot of co-operation between us but it would not be in isolation.  Frequently and on an ongoing basis, it would be a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and a probation officer who jointly meet with the offender and as much as possible it is a collaborative effort with the offender to move forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018112800002#L01600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Dack"},{"type":"speech","time":1543395600,"counter":626,"content":"<p>Does Mr. Henderson wish to come back in?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018112800002#L01700","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1543395600,"counter":627,"content":"<p>There were other questions asked.

There are several issues inherent in the actual wording of the proposed revision that need to be cognisant of the implications for constitutional and human rights challenges.  Currently, the wording of the provisions are not strong enough to live up to any potential future challenges on the grounds of the right to travel, the right to liberty in the context of freedom of movement and to privacy rights in particular.  One has to look at the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights on deprivations and restrictions placed upon freedom of movement and the circumstances in which oppressive or unnecessary restrictions on somebody&rsquo;s freedom of movement have been deemed to be a violation of Article 5 of the European convention.  We need to establish terminology which allows us to incorporate that issue of necessity and proportionality within the meaning of the restriction or the prohibition on travel abroad.<\/p><p>This would prevent it from being open to challenge on grounds of arbitrariness.<\/p><p> Following on from that point, what we mean by \"restriction\" is not clear.  In the Bill's present form, it is assumed that the judge will decide whether the person will be allowed to travel.  That is unsatisfactory, as it renders the situation unclear and arbitrary.  Some aspect of it should be based upon evidence adduced, for example, a specifically identifiable risk that has come to the authorities' attention via the report of a probation officer or something to that effect.  There must be necessity and proportionality under our Constitution and the European convention.  The purpose of the travel also needs to be considered, which could require a change in the wording of the current provision.  If we incorporated certain requirements that a court must take into consideration, it could lend credit to the assertion that the restriction is necessary rather than arbitrary, take into account the fact that people sometimes need to travel, for example, in order to procure work or as part of their jobs, and would not impinge on their right to earn a livelihood.  It would also allow people to enjoy family rights under our Constitution and Article 8.  The wording needs to be examined in this context and we need to be clear about what we mean by \"restriction\".<\/p><p> The overarching - I hate to use the word \"problem\" - concept that we need to consider is the resources issue.  If we are discussing restrictions on certain destinations or within a certain timeframe, there needs to be a way of implementing that effectively.  To some extent, this would involve supervision.  Is the Garda, the Probation Service or the court supposed to supervise?  Would the court have to make subsequent orders or judgments against the individual in the event of his or her falling out of line with the restrictions?  It also might involve authorities in another jurisdiction having to supervise our citizens, which leads to a resources issue, a question of communication, which is important, and other practical issues that may be difficult to resolve.  We need to be cognisant of these matters if this provision is to be framed in statute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018112800002#N00900","nonspeaker":"Dr. Margaret Fitzgerald-O'Reilly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543395600,"counter":653,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Fitzgerald-O'Reilly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018112800002#O00200","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1543395600,"counter":654,"content":"<p>Am I right in understanding that the foreign travel order has not been used in two years?

What does the research that exists tell us?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018112800002#P00400","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1543395600,"counter":669,"content":"<p>The Deputy is absolutely correct.  There is some limited research available both in Europe and the United States on the electronic tagging of high-risk sex offenders.  There is research done on the tagging of high-risk offenders but it is specifically in the context of high-risk sex offenders that we are considering this prospect.  That involves a very different type of research and very different empirical data.<\/p> <p>  Most of the research has tended to come from the United States.  It has a very different context and is a very different jurisdiction but the basic principle is the same insofar as it permits electronic tagging of those who are considered to be a risk.  The categorisation of risk can vary considerably in accordance with jurisdiction.  The objective is to monitor, control and deter from sexual recidivism.  All the research, whether it is in favour of keeping tabs on high-risk sex offenders or not, acknowledges categorically that there is no difference or a limited difference in recidivism rates between those who are electronically tagged and those who are not.  There is no impact in terms of deterrence or reducing recidivism.  Two points may be of value in this regard.  One is in the context of a very carefully strategised post-release risk-assessment strategy on helping the offender to reintegrate into the community.  It specifically relates to offenders who are subject to supervision.  There is some evidence to suggest that electronic tagging can be helpful as one part of a more holistic, coherent re-entry strategy.  It is in the short term, and there is some evidence to suggest it might be more useful for first-time offenders than repeat offenders.<\/p> <p>  The other issue concerns where monitoring revealed a new crime.  Even if there is a suggestion that this was good, it tended to reveal crime in respect of breaches of registration orders.  That, in itself, may hold value but in terms of the broader long-term goal of preventing sexual recidivism, there was no appreciable impact.  While there is some limited impact and usefulness in terms of ensuring compliance or identifying non-compliance with registration requirements, which can be very positive and good, there is no appreciable value in terms of deterrence and preventing recidivism.<\/p> <p>  The last thing the research tells us is that electronic monitoring is very costly.  There is consensus that it is not cost-effective if compared with the objectives.  If the objective is preventing recidivism, or preventing somebody from having to be sent back to prison, there is no cost-neutralisation value to monitoring the person via GPS or some other method.  The research concludes that it has to be questioned as to whether we want to provide this type of monitoring considering its lack of effectiveness, as is empirically proven, and the fact that it is so costly to implement.  That is the consensus on the research.  We need to be mindful of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018112800002#P00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Margaret Fitzgerald-O'Reilly"},{"type":"speech","time":1543395600,"counter":670,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Fitzgerald-O'Reilly.

I understand it can be helpful where the criminal behaviour or the non-compliance with the order in question is associated with a particular geographic location.  It is all very fine if the electronic monitoring system tells one so and so is no longer going to this place, that place or the other place but one should not be lulled into a sense of false security; it might be that the offender is now committing offences in an unmonitored zone.  It has been said so often this morning that there is no silver bullet.

Very often it is not the bail conditions that are the problem; rather, it is the ability of the Garda to deal with somebody who is not complying with them.  The same applies to conditions on release from prison following a conviction.  I refer to where electronic tagging is used but where the State does not have the resources to pursue somebody whose electronic tag indicates he is going to places he is not meant to be or is not showing up at the Garda station or wherever else he is required to be.

We feel that introducing electronic monitoring as part of a risk management strategy as a planned programme of intervention would be the most effective way of doing that.  That has been proved in other jurisdictions.  When it is integrated with a supervision package it can be at its most effective.  The legislation is advocating the possibility, as part of a post-release supervision order, that somebody would be electronically tagged for a period of six months.  We in the Probation Service see a value in exclusions in some instances.  If we knew the person's risk behaviour was associated with children, we see the value in having an exclusion zone around playgrounds or in keeping somebody away from a victim.  There can be value in that.  It is very much about monitoring that and it needs to be part of a planned package.  As Ms Counihan stated, there could be instances of a person in custody who will be coming out on a post-release supervision order and certain risk factors were noticed while the person was in custody.

It is about an issue that presents occasionally.  It is very likely it was covered earlier and, if so, that is fine.  In circumstances where someone with a high profile committed sexual offences and there is media commentary, it sometimes becomes an issue of controversy based on a phantom in communities or inaccurate rumours.  It is an issue that presents itself every so often.  A big part of the solution needs to be around education and perhaps more responsible conduct by the media.  It is not immediately obvious to me, although it might be to others, what the right environment is for somebody coming out of prison who is known to have committed certain offences.  If people move into external communities that they are not familiar with and the public becomes aware it creates controversy, difficulty and a threat to the welfare of offenders.  If offenders return to their home communities, it is possible the victims are in the area and they could come into contact or a confrontation could arise.  I do not ask the question from the position of having a preconceived notion.  When these controversies arise I am not entirely sure where the ideal location or setting is for people when they have been released for prison.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018112800002#Q00900","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1543395600,"counter":683,"content":"<p>I will take the final question first.  What is the ideal location?  The short answer is there is no ideal location.  At the same time, the vast majority of sex offenders, if not all, who go to jail come out again.  They come out no matter what they have done and they will have undoubtedly received a proportionate sentence.  The sentence is the sentence and the best way we can try to ensure they do not go on to reoffend is through having the appropriate controls and monitoring in place and by trying to ensure there is a level of reintegration in their communities.  The issue that arises from time to time and which impacts on our work, although thankfully only in a small number of cases, is the media sometimes publicise high profile cases and argue that people have a right to know that somebody very dangerous might be living in their area.  The individual has a right to make the best effort at resettlement in collaboration with the various agencies.  As Ms Burke and Mr. Dack mentioned earlier, a small number of serious high-profile and high-risk offenders receive the highest level of attention on release from the police, the Probation Service and the various other services.  People should be assured that when an offender at the highest level is released back into the community we are all doing our best to ensure the person is monitored and controlled but also helped to reintegrate so they do not reoffend.  There is not an ideal scenario or location but unless we all work together to try to ensure the appropriate reintegration of the individual, we are taking backward steps.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018112800002#Q01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Vivian Geiran"},{"type":"speech","time":1543395600,"counter":684,"content":"<p>Perhaps Mr. Dack and someone from the PSNI will add to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018112800002#Q01100","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1543395600,"counter":685,"content":"<p>If we flip risk assessment on its head, it is about what positive protective factors we can put in place.

Volunteers are recruited, trained and supported to work with isolated sex offenders to provide a social network and social support while at the same time monitoring behaviour.  An inner circle, the core member of which is the sex offender, works closely with an outer circle that consists of professionals such as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Probation Service and Tusla.  It is a recognition that social isolation is a risk factor.  Social acceptance in some form is a protective factor.

However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  It is proposed that any submissions, opening statements or other documents supplied by the witnesses to the committee be published on the committee website.  <\/p><p>On 23 May 2018, the committee held a public meeting on the question of flooding at Ballycar on the Galway-Limerick railway and investment in heavy rail.  The committee has also engaged with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the National Transport Authority.  Six months later, we resume our hearing and we have invited the same organisation back to update the committee on progress in mitigating the flood risk at Ballycar.<\/p><p>The first railway in Ireland and the first suburban railway in the world was opened in 1834 and is still in use today, 184 year later.  That is the Dublin to D&uacute;n Laoghaire line.  It seems that we need to take a very long view when considering investment in heavy rail, which is capital expenditure with a long-term payback.  Members of this committee have spoken of the closure of railway lines in the Border regions including Donegal, Monaghan and Cavan, the Derry route, which gave a fast connection between Derry and Dublin, and the Sligo-Leitrim railway, some of which were closed because of the policy of the then Government of Northern Ireland.  This made the remaining sections of the railway line in the South non-viable.  Members also spoke of the closure of the west Cork railway, which makes it difficult to travel from west Cork to Dublin and back in one day.<\/p><p>It is not all bad news, however.  Many railway lines were closed only to be reopened years later.  The Harcourt Street line was closed in 1958; a member of this committee travelled on one of the last trains on that line.  Part of the line with a cross-city link to the Broadstone line, which closed to passengers in 1936, is now one of the busiest in the country.  The lines from Cork to Midleton and Dublin to Dunboyne, the Phoenix Park tunnel and the Galway-Limerick line were all reopened in recent years.  However, the Galway-Limerick line is regularly closed due to groundwater flooding at Ballycar.  These line closures are all too frequent and cast doubt on the viability of further investment in the western rail corridor.  This means the certainty of supply that rail passengers expect is simply not there.  I hope the organisations here today will indicate their willingness to work together to mitigate this flood risk at Ballycar.<\/p><p>The flood mitigation measures, which could reduce the flood risk to an acceptable level, would be to lower the water level by draining Ballycar Lough to the sea via Lough Gash, to raise the railway, or a combination of the two.  The committee would also like to receive an update on heavy rail investment plans.  The Geological Survey of Ireland, GSI, is the lead agency for groundwater flooding, which occurs in karst, or limestone, areas.  I look forward to hearing what progress is being made with the study on this flooding which occurs in the west of Ireland, in south Galway, areas of Mayo, Roscommon and the neighbouring counties and, in particular, in Ballycar, County Clare.<\/p><p> I call Mr. Koen Verbruggen to make his opening statement on behalf of the Geological Survey of Ireland, GSI.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018112800002#E00100","speaker":"1273","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1543402800,"counter":698,"content":"<p>I have sent the committee an update on the statement we provided in May.  I will not read through the full statement but will focus on the main update.<\/p> <p>  As the Chairman noted, we have taken a lead on groundwater flooding because of our work on the groundwater programme which prior to this had focused on groundwater pollution and protection issues.  We are working a great deal with the EPA and Irish Water.<\/p> <p>  In 2016, A Programme for a Partnership Government, under the area of climate change and flooding, contained an objective on turlough systems, namely, that the Government &ldquo;will provide resources to the OPW to commission studies into individual problematic (prone to flooding) Turlough systems, if requested by a local authority or another relevant State agency.&rdquo;  That is what our programme has been designed to do.<\/p> <p>  The GSI has progressed this to the point of near completion of the first phase.  In the first quarter of 2019, GSI will deliver groundwater flood maps to the OPW as required under second implementation cycle of the EU Floods Directive.  That has involved instrumenting up to 60 of these turloughs.  We have had data loggers and have also developed a methodology for studying them which uses the European Space Agency's Copernicus Programme data which enables us to look back at the historical record and create stage maps to display how they have responded.  They are quite complex as they behave quite differently to river flooding which is much more flashy and responds indirectly to groundwater.<\/p> <p>  On the monitoring side, we now have realtime data from more than 12 of these turloughs and from the flood mapping.  The mapping for the whole country will be complete by the first quarter of 2019.<\/p> <p>  On the flooding at Ballycar, the turlough is included in the GSI's flood mapping operations using the Copernicus Programme data which we demonstrated to the committee on the last occasion with slides.  The turlough, as well as some other flood prone areas along the western railway corridor, is being monitored using Copernicus satellite imagery.  This monitoring technique is still being developed but preliminary data for Ballycar turlough is available to the OPW and Irish Rail.<\/p> <p>  We have been invited to take part in the technical subcommittee meetings regarding the flooding and will attend the next meeting on 17 December in Ennis when we will provide an update and ensure that the data is being used.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018112800002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Koen Verbruggen"},{"type":"speech","time":1543402800,"counter":699,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Verbruggen for his very informative presentation, his engagement in the process and for taking the issue very seriously.

At the end of the day, it is good to see a joint statement from the group and that a number of the group may be starting work together.  In the context of whether there will be a requirement for planning, when will RPS be finished?  In fairness to the OPW and the Minister of State, Deputy Moran, have been pro-active in trying to solve problems.  Will the cost-benefit analysis that bogs down so many schemes be a problem?  What I am trying to get to the nub of the issue here, and Mr. Meade said he is taking responsibility.  If it means raising the line, will that be done with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann's funds or where will this funding be coming from?

There have not been services for five or six weeks at a time.  Any service, including the DART, is the subject of occasional problems.  There are leaves on the line, all sorts of things break down, physical accidents occur and so on.  We all know that any transport system has the odd one-day stoppage.  It is an inconvenience but it does not affect passenger trends.  Has Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann done any quantification of the effect of stoppages on passenger trends?  In other words, do people return in the same numbers after the long stoppages or does Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann lose passengers in the long term?  Does it take time to build up confidence in the system when these long outages take place?<\/p> <p>  My second question relates to National Parks and Wildlife Service.  Mr. Meade indicates that the RPS study will be done in six months.  Will that include proofing with the various agencies who will have to have an input, particularly the National Parks and Wildlife Service, so that when we get the report it is a question of funding?  Alternatively, will it be a question of going around the agencies to find other ecological problems with the proposed solutions and so on?  That should form part of the study.  I would rather wait nine months to get an answer that is comprehensive to all the agencies and is ready for application for funding.<\/p> <p>  It is amazing how humans can make life awfully complicated.  We all pay tax into a central fund called the Exchequer.  I cannot understand how we have created so many streams.  The sources of funding are like the Nile Delta.  It all starts at one point and it all goes to one place, that is, the people.  There are a million little rivers, rivulets and islands for all the funding to go through.  It goes to this one and to that one.  I will put a simple proposal to our guests.  We should look for funding from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  That is what it is there for.  All these bidding wars are manna from heaven for consultants.  Ultimately, all the money will come from us, the taxpayers, through the Exchequer.  Perhaps the committee could suggest to the Government that it should take the simple course.  If this needs to be funded it should be done through one agency that can provide the money overnight so that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann can get on with the job.<\/p> <p>  I wish to comment on the investment in the wider context of this railway line.  This reminds me of the argument about the piers on Inis M&oacute;r.  A small island of 1,000 people has one of the busiest ports in the country.  Was it justified?  The answer is that we either build a pier or we do not.  It costs whatever it costs.  The Atlantic does not know how many people are on the island, it just knows how to send in waves.  An all-weather pier that would do the job would require a certain configuration.  We have had some fantastic storms since and nothing has moved in the harbour, thanks be to God.  There could be extreme weather events anywhere in the system.  The same problem that was mentioned by our guests exists at Bray Head in Wicklow.  It is a constant problem there.  Protecting from a one-in-1,000 or one-in-10,000 storm situation will take whatever it takes and we should not be shy about spending money.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is lucky that it works on land.  Things would be very different if it had to operate in the ocean.<\/p> <p>  I would not like to see us spend the money and not have the service.  That relates to another issue in Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann's port.  I am always a little puzzled by this \"intercity\" tag.  I mentioned this to our guests previously.  We keep talking about the trains from Dublin to Galway, from Dublin to Sligo and from Limerick to Galway as intercity.  I would hazard a guess that the customers on some of those lines are like passengers travelling from Greystones to Dublin.  A large number of them are commuters.  The big growth is accounted for by commuters because a commuter tends to commute ten times a week, five times in each direction.  The intercity traveller, as we conventionally understood matters, went to a city perhaps once every three weeks or once a month.  Comparing one with the other, we find a 20:1 ratio in some cases.<\/p> <p>  A doubling of the track from Athenry to Galway was mentioned.

The cost in rural Ireland is always the big issue.  The questions are how much it is going to cost and whether we can afford it in rural Ireland.  The answer to that is that if a heap of people travel on the line, which we can achieve by pursuing other infrastructural developments in tandem, the line will be well-used and will perform much better in a cost-benefit analysis.

We are in the process of developing the scheme.  As members may be aware, it is a broader scheme.  The original scheme involved raising the railway line.  There were questions around whether that would solve the problem completely.  The general consensus was that it would alleviate but not completely eradicate the issue.  RPS is now looking at a broader scheme which will potentially have a far better impact, keeping the railway line in that catchment area open for longer.  Due to the fact that it is a larger scheme, we logically conclude that it will be more expensive.  Having said that, we have not seen the final scheme.  The technical viability of the scheme is one thing, the cost is something else.  Those two things can be determined reasonably quickly and are quite clear.  Issues arise when the benefits are considered.  Mention has been made of the rail link's importance to the region, the spatial strategy and all of that.  I do not wish to dictate how this is looked at, but it is important that all benefits, tangible and intangible, are looked at very carefully.  The gap between the costs and the benefits will have to be taken in to consideration.  That is the answer to Deputy Fitzmaurice's question.  We have to look seriously at the cost and the benefits.

As we all know, without going into the history of what and why, the shortest flooding was seven weeks and it has been for up to 15 or 16 weeks in some cases.  The numbers trend on the line is up, which is positive.  People are migrating towards public transport and we see this.  When the line is closed, we put on bus services and alternative options are sought by the travelling public.  When the line reopens in April or May it could take until autumn before the numbers come back fully because people do not change overnight.  It could be having an impact on the overall numbers because people must keep changing.  This was the point being made.  If we trend it over several years, the numbers are rising.  Were there no disruption to the line, it is a fair assessment that the numbers might rise even further because it would be people's normal mode of travel.

The benefits of the programme are national and network-wide, giving more capacity for more services on all lines through improved infrastructure and a fleet expansion of almost 50%.<\/p> <p>  Rather than reiterate the scope of that investment, I will advise the committee of developments in the meantime and how these will benefit the national heavy rail services we provide.  Most importantly, the continuing improvement in our funding situation means that we may approach the steady-state funding scenario targeted under the national development plan for 2021 two years ahead of schedule in 2019.  This means we will be properly funded to maintain our network and fleet, protecting what are vital national infrastructure assets.<\/p> <p>  We will introduce an additional Dublin to Sligo service in each direction on weekdays from Monday, 10 December, which we hope will mark the beginning of a period of intercity frequency expansion.  Further service expansion on the Sligo and Westport lines would be desirable, to hourly services between Dublin and Sligo and two-hourly services between Dublin and Westport.  Fleet investment under the national development plan will free up some of our intercity fleet being used in the Dublin commuter area to assist in service expansion.  However, further study would be required on infrastructure requirements to facilitate such frequent services.<\/p> <p>  On the Rosslare to Dublin line, there may be scope for additional daytime services to be modelled within the constraints of the existing intensively operated DART service.  Strategically, we are also working with local authorities on the route to address the medium to long-term strategies required to protect the line from coastal erosion, with 45% of the route in a coastal or estuarine environment.<\/p> <p>  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann also has an ambition to increase frequency of Galway to Dublin services to hourly, and the Galway transport strategy of the National Transport Authority and the Galway local authorities targets that rail services will be increased in frequency, subject to passenger demand and usage.  This would encompass enhanced frequency of Galway to Athenry commuter services.  Double-tracking would facilitate this, with an interim measure of a passing loop and second platform at Oranmore to give a commuter frequency of up to every 15 minutes.<\/p> <p>  This leads me to other service enhancements possible in our other regional cities.  The National Transport Authority is also preparing a draft Cork transport study, which will include additional stations to be provided in tandem with development, and other measures to enhance frequency of services.  We have been working closely with Waterford City and County Council on the plans for the Waterford north quays, which incorporate a relocation of Plunkett Station as part of an integrated transport hub.  We are progressing signalling and station layout designs to accommodate increased service frequency, and look forward to being part of an exciting development for the city and the region and public transport services for both.<\/p> <p>  At Limerick, the transportation hub is targeted for completion, with rail services from Galway, Ennis, Limerick Junction and Dublin feeding into this.  We are assisting the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in the preparation of a feasibility report and business study on the development of the Athenry to Claremorris line.  We are working to terms of reference established by the Department.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has advertised for, and will appoint, a consultant to undertake a financial and economic appraisal.  This appointment will be made, and the appraisal will commence, by early January.  The study will take 20 weeks.  Thereafter, this will be subject to a peer review by the Department to complete the overall study.<\/p> <p>  Work on our new national control centre has commenced.  This will see a new operations control and customer information centre established in Heuston Station to cover the entire network, and through modern technology will ensure we have a control centre equipped to enhance service performance and cater for the expansions in services planned over the coming decade and beyond.<\/p> <p>  We are also preparing plans for a comprehensive renewal of track on the Cork to Dublin route over the coming years.  The objectives of the track relaying programme is to renew up to 220 miles of track so as to provide a reliable and sustainable track infrastructure to allow optimisation of the line speeds with an associated reduction in journey times where possible.  This will further enhance Cork, Kerry, Limerick and west of Ireland services.  A summary of the main benefits of this track relaying programme are more reliable track infrastructure, with an optimisation of line speeds to 100 mph to facilitate reductions in journey times; replacement of aged infrastructure with a minimum life cycle of 30 years; future-proofing for anticipated increased utilisation of the route in the short, medium and longer terms; and improved, sustainable and reliable infrastructure for our customers on a key commuter and intercity route.<\/p> <p>  This approach will provide a model for further asset renewal and journey time improvement around our network.  This is a summary of our plans for the intercity and regional cities network, separate to the critical requirements in the greater Dublin area commuter belt.

I am a Deputy for the constituency of Leitrim-Sligo and welcomed the announcement that more services were being added between Dublin and Sligo route from 10 December.  The biggest issue I can see is with line infrastructure.  What investment is to be made in Sligo in the coming years?  One of my biggest complaints is the lack of carriages.  It is a major issue.  There is a lack of carriages every weekend and on most days of the week.  The condition of some carriages is poor and would not be acceptable on the Dublin-Cork or Dublin-Belfast routes.  The Sligo-Dublin service is the poor relation, which I do not think is acceptable.  Mr. Meade has said the national development plan is ahead of schedule.  Given the amount of money that has been invested in Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, it is vitally important that serious consideration be given to the area I represent and the commuters who use the line.  They are entitled to a rail service which is as good as that provided in any other part of the country, but they are not receiving it.  Some commuters have to stand between Dublin and Carrick-on-Shannon, Longford and sometimes all the way to Sligo.  The same is true in the opposite direction, which is not acceptable or good enough in this day and age.  I am not a member of the committee, but I was told that Mr. Meade would be appearing before it this morning.  I have read his report.  It is vitally important that he realise he has an obligation and a responsibility to the people who use the train service on the railway line between Sligo and Dublin, including on a daily basis.  The number of services on the line has increased, but we are receiving a second rate service, which is not acceptable.  It takes three hours to travel from Sligo to Dublin.  Is there any plan for investment?  Mr. Meade has spoken about upgrading railway lines and increasing the speeds achievable in other areas, which would reduce journey times.  Are there plans to do so at our end of the country?  The carriages used on the line have been called \"reject carriages\".  I have been a public representative for the area for many years, with Deputy Martin Kenny and other Members of the Oireachtas who are very annoyed, as are local councillors.  The problem has been highlighted on numerous occasions and Mr. Meade and his officials have been made aware of it.

I cannot get my head around the fact that the Government is not proceeding with it.  It is to connect Dublin Airport to the main rail system.  It would allow mainline trains using the tunnel to go north, south, east and west.  It would also allow for a connection to the entire rail system, including the DART.  Will the witness give us a short brief on the reason we are not doing that?  It seems to be a no-brainer in terms of a project that would cost hundreds of millions of euro as against billions of euro for a much longer project, namely, metro north, which I am not against?  Why are we not connecting the entire rail system?  When we arrive in any airport abroad the first thing we do is look to see if there is a train into the city centre and if there is, we go to the train station where very good services are provided.<\/p> <p>  On the west of Ireland service to Galway, I understand what Mr. Meade is saying about trains to Galway leaving on an hourly basis.  An all-day service into the late evening is needed but to go back to my hobby horse, the commuters want to get into town some time between 8 a.m. and 9.30 a.m., therefore, the trains need to arrive at a much increased frequency at that time.  The requirement is more spread out in the evening, with a train leaving from 4.30 p.m. and 7 p.m.  People do not always leave town after work so the requirement is more spread out late into the evening, therefore, late evening trains are required, as we have in Dublin up to 11.30 p.m.<\/p> <p>  First, we cannot magic resources out of thin air so has Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann studied the potential of using existing resources to facilitate more trains at busy commuter times in and out of Galway?  In terms of an obvious one, based on the population of the town we know there is a disproportionate number of commuters from Athenry to Galway.  It seems to me that is based on frequency.  Should more trains run, for example, from Limerick to Athenry where the commuter would change trains and, five minutes later, board the commuter Dublin to Galway train?  It seems it is an urgent requirement to get much more frequent trains into Galway.  That would breed success, the success would breed investment and so on.<\/p> <p>  Second, in terms of the other obvious question that arises, Mr. Meade mentioned the passing loop.  That would be a good start, although his timing is optimistic.  It is a 20-minute journey to Athenry.  If that is divided by two, it is ten minutes.  That means there would be 20-minute intervals but even that would be better than 40 minutes.  That one small piece of the network would free up things.  Is it being considered as a priority?  Mr. Meade referred to a passing loop somewhere around Oranmore.<\/p> <p>  The other question is about the Limerick and Galway ends of that railway line.  Has consideration been given to commuter trains that would have urban stops?  Galway is a rapidly growing city.  I understand a large number of people travel from Oranmore to Galway.  That is growing rapidly and the only constraint is the frequency of the trains.  Has there been any talk of Ballyloughane serving Galway Mayo Institute of Technology, GMIT, or whatever?  Has there been any talk of an equivalent across the river, near the university in Limerick?  It also goes very near Thomond Park and the institute of technology, IT.  Rather than bringing everybody into the city centre and out again, has there been a discussion whereby they could get off near the IT and get a commuter bus to the IT or to Thomond Park?<\/p> <p>  There is a new fashion in regard to transport.  People do not always use their cars or the train.  Most of us are multi-modal now.  We love taking the train when it is convenient.  How much work has been done around that area?<\/p> <p>  That leads to an inevitable conclusion.  I believe that will be successful.  It will open the Claremorris line.  I know Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann want to do that but it will open despite those who have been naysayers in that regard for a long time.  I believe commuter rail is the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018112800002#L00200","speaker":"1312"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1543402800,"counter":758,"content":"<p>To reply to Deputy McLoughlin, there is no question that the trains are crowded across the network.

They have been growing at between 6% and 7% per year, and some segmental areas have been growing much faster than that.<\/p> <p>  We do not want to start teaching history lessons to each other but it must be remembered that we have come out of ten years of no investment.

We have a plan in-house that we have taken to the NTA, which is has signed off on, to add more carriages to the intercity trains to which we keep referring.  That is a slicker process for us.

I accept that.  We have to be honest with the travelling public and tell them that it will get worse before it gets better because more people are migrating to public transport.  In many cases it is the quickest way to get between two key locations.  Our patronage is growing.  The morning peak for us, particularly in the greater Dublin area, is very busy.  We are telling people openly and honestly that we have a plan.  We are working with the NTA and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, which are putting in place the funding, but there is a lead time on that.<\/p><p>The national development plan, NDP, programme was announced only early this year or late last year and it is only in the past couple of weeks that we have gone through the process and they have given us the green light to start procuring the intermediate cars.  There is a longer-term plan to put a framework order in place for 600 new vehicles over a ten-year time period.  This would all add capacity as we go.  I have to be clear with the Chairman and the committee, however, that it will get a little bit worse before it gets better in that regard because we just do not have the capacity at present.<\/p><p> On the issue of speeds and times, now that we have reached a fully funded state it is our intention to continue to upgrade the infrastructure.  That is what we have done on other routes.  The Cork line is not getting priority; it just happens to have the oldest infrastructure.  The Sligo, Galway and Kerry lines were all relaid in the mid-noughties and it is all new track compared with the much older track on the southern half of the Cork line.  This is why the relaying programme is going that way; it is all based on the condition of the asset not on the frequency of the line.<\/p><p> We will work through a plan for all the branch lines to reduce the journey times.  Our long-term target is to bring the Cork services to two hours and 15 minutes in duration for all services.  Currently they are two hours and 30 minutes or two hours 35 minutes in duration.  The target also is to bring the duration of the Galway services to two hours and those of the likes of the Westport and Sligo services nearer two hours and 30 minutes than the current three hours.  That will be done through improving works on the track and increasing line speeds.  The two go hand in hand.  If the condition of the asset, on which the train runs, improves and we can run at faster speeds, then we will run at faster speeds.  Sometimes they can trade off.  If we want to bring a key business train out of Sligo, Cork or Limerick for example, the more the train stops the more it is slowed down.  When stops are added the train is slowed down.  We have offered services as more frequent over time.  The Maynooth line is very busy from Maynooth inwards and it is about having the slots to get everyone into the city centre in Dublin.  The plan is very much to keep moving with the programme and to keep reducing journey times.<\/p><p> As for the refurbishment of stations, we started a programme last year to go through all of our stations.  We had stopped doing this during the bad years.  We were able to live without keeping up some elements there but we did keep up with the safety aspects.  We have started a programme and we have put more money into station refurbishment, which we term \"business facilities\" this year and last year.  We are investing more in that area and the programme will run for the next several years.<\/p><p> Reference was made to the review on the western rail corridor.  Consultants are appointed - they start in January - to work on a 20-week programme, which will then go to the Department for a peer review.

We looked at that and we have modelled it.  We can do a 15-minute service by putting a loop in Oranmore and a second platform.  We believe that this has to be done in stages.  Nobody is going to give us the funding to build a completely new railway with four or five stations at each end, but I have taken this proposal to the NTA, which is looking at the funding.  If the NTA agrees that it is a good proposal it would be the first step in significantly improving the services for Galway.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the proposed Galway ring road, it will help the Connemara people going around Galway and anybody going out west but Galway city centre would still be congested.  A train being able to come right into Eyre Square is the right thing to do.  That plan is still with the NTA and we will support it very strongly.  We believe that it would also be right to double-track the whole line because that would allow us to keep on the train, but the first step will be to do the piece in the middle at Oranmore, where one can cross trains every 15 minutes.

We can look at the changing commuter patterns but if we take out one element then we might be delaying a Dublin train, for example, or taking out another train going in the other direction that may be giving a service all the way into Limerick.

We heard lots about the south of the country, about the transport hub, and about Waterford, Cork and Limerick.  I am delighted for those areas that are so well facilitated with rail transport.  Will Mr. Meade elaborate on or disclose some of the plans he has for north of the Galway to Dublin line?  I am aware that Sligo was mentioned, and I appreciate how animated and passionate Deputy McLoughlin was about that particular line.  I have a keen interest in the lines and existing lines to Navan and on to Kingscourt.  We have some very heavy industry in that region such as Kingspan and Gyproc, and other industries, including indigenous industry, in east Cavan and south Monaghan.  This potential and capacity to grow could be expanded if open freight rail was facilitated.  Perhaps Mr. Meade could talk to us about the plans for a rail line to Navan, it second phase and the progressive reopening of the existing lines to Kingscourt in east Cavan.<\/p> <p>  The constituency is very much behind the curve in transport infrastructure.  We have the M3 that stops abruptly at the Cavan-Meath border and we have no motorway into Cavan town.  The N2 has still not been upgraded to motorway status.  Even though we have a rail line, we have no functioning rail line.  I would make the case that a freight or heavy rail line should be the first phase to Navan and then on to Kingscourt.  This would be hugely significant for the area.  From travelling to Dublin I can see that unfortunately our motorways are now clogged up again with cars and vans, perhaps with five lads in a van, and we are back to that boom situation again where people may have to travel to work in Dublin.  The region is in single digit figures with regard to the number of IDA Ireland visits to the area and we are repeatedly told by IDA Ireland that their lack of visits and ability to bring the big companies to counties such as Cavan and Monaghan is always about the lack of infrastructure.  I am sure that the big companies that consider Cavan and Monaghan look for broadband, motorways and rail.

The trains, particularly at weekends, are packed.  The congestion on those lines is a significant problem for many, particularly students going back to college etc.  I was happy to read that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is talking about upgrading that service to an hourly service.  Is there a timescale in that respect?  Mr. Meade suggested the service would be two-hourly from Westport and every hour from Sligo.<\/p> <p>  In regard to freight rail, I am conscious that there are directives in preparation in Europe on freight transport, particularly road haulage, and pressure arising from the point of view of CO2 emissions etc.  Having spoken to somebody in the road haulage sector, I am aware it is something about which they are quite concerned.  The European perspective is that more freight needs to go by rail, which has a lower carbon footprint.  Are there any such plans?  Looking from the outside, it seems as though the passenger carrying network is already chock-a-block and if there is to be expansion in the area of freight, it will become difficult to meet the requirement.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the other sectors, all of the west needs to get a grip as to what we are going to do.

What can we do in respect of that?  Are there plans in that regard?  Are we seriously considering that?  Ultimately, if we step back from it - we spoke earlier in the meeting in private session about economic development - it is the part of the world that has the most potential because it is the least developed.  I would be happy to see that Irish Rail was considering making applications for European funding to upgrade tracks to bring us to a stage where we can compete with the rest of the country in that respect.

The board has given us the task of determining the potential for freight, what should we be targeting in the future and how should we get there, as well as examining what the capital cost of doing that would be and what capital infrastructure would be needed.  It is work in progress for us.  There are no real plans beyond that.<\/p> <p>  The Taoiseach spoke only a couple of weeks ago about the Atlantic corridor almost needing to grow at double the rate of Dublin if we are to be sustainable, as Deputy Martin Kenny mentioned.  All we want to do, with increased services with hourly services into the regions, is to assist that and to make all that connectivity work.  It is very much our plan to continue the infrastructure investment programme and to continue, as I referenced earlier to other Deputies, reducing journeying times and improving the fleet.  That is the first step for us.  That is the big issue at present.  We need more carrying capacity and to reduce journey times but it aligns with the aspiration to develop the Atlantic corridor.<\/p> <p>  We are looking at Brexit.  The Dublin-Belfast Enterprise service is important to us.  That service is probably symbolic, as much as anything else, of what has happened in our country for decades.  A hard Brexit would be traumatic for the service as all the drivers would lose their licences, the safety certifications for Northern Ireland Railways to operate in the Republic would be an issue and the fleet itself would be an issue.  We have a working party, together with Translink, of which Northern Ireland Railways is a subset, examining how we would manage a hard Brexit.  We are working on the basis of a worst-case scenario.  If there is a step back from that, all the better.  We have a team examining how we would manage next April if there was a hard Brexit.

I appreciate the opportunity to outline my simple proposal for a Bill which would put a fixed date in place for commemoration of the Famine.  The proposals at the heart of the Bill are to have a commemoration day which would occur on the second Sunday of May, that the commemoration would include civil, military and ceremonial elements and an interfaith service and that there would be a central venue for commemoration which would be the designated by the Taoiseach or the Government.  I am bringing this forward to put a definitive date into the calendar and to put a definitive structure around the commemoration.  I appreciate and acknowledge in advance that in recent years, much work has been done by the national Famine commemoration committee and there have been some excellent events commemorating the Famine but we have had a situation over a period of time where we have had no real certainty as to the date.  It has moved around the calendar from the earlier part of the year to the autumn.  What has really driven me with this Bill is that for something that is so central to the history of our country, that is part of what makes us Irish and that had such an impact on creating the country and the island in which we live, we should treat it with the respect it deserves and part of that respect is to have that fixed date.<\/p> <p>  By having a fixed date, the Bill would enable the development of a much greater process around the commemoration.

I am the assistant secretary in charge of the corporate affairs division of the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  I am accompanied by my colleague, Mr. John Healy, head of the corporate governance unit, which among other things provides secretariat support to the national Famine commemoration committee, NFCC.  The committee is chaired by the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Josepha Madigan.  Also in attendance is Professor Tommy Cooke, a long-standing member of the national Famine commemoration committee.<\/p> <p>  On behalf of the Minister, I thank the committee for its interest in this matter and for the opportunity to present the view of the Department on this Bill.  As the committee will be aware, the national Famine commemoration was initiated in 2008, following a Government decision to commemorate the Great Famine with an annual memorial day.  The national Famine commemoration committee, chaired by the then Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, was established to consider the most appropriate arrangements for an annual national commemoration of the Great Famine.  The commemoration, which broadly speaking follows the format of the national day of commemoration, established by the Government in 1985, is part of the State&rsquo;s annual programme of commemorations.<\/p> <p>  These events include the 1916 Easter Rising commemoration, held on Easter Sunday, the annual 1916 Arbour Hill commemoration, which is not a fixed date but takes place between the dates of the first and last execution of the 1916 leaders, usually on the first Wednesday after 3 May, and the Daniel O&rsquo;Connell commemoration, which is held in Glasnevin Cemetery on the second Sunday of May each year, the Sunday closest to his death.  The national Famine commemoration is to be held on the third Sunday of May, or its eve, I will come back to that in a moment, by a decision of the Government in 2018.  The national day of commemoration is held on the Sunday closest to 11 July, which is the anniversary of the signing in 1921 of the truce in the War of Independence.  There is also an annual commemoration of the Somme organised by the Royal British Legion, Republic of Ireland branch.  It is held in the Irish National War Memorial Gardens in Islandbridge on the Sunday preceding the national day of commemoration.  <\/p> <p>  At present, each of these commemorations is undertaken on the basis of a Government decision and none are provided for in legislation.  To date, no Government has considered it necessary to propose the introduction of legislation in respect of State ceremonial events of this nature.  Since the adoption of the current format in 2009, the national Famine commemoration has retained a high degree of continuity in its format.  However, the artistic, cultural and other elements of the commemoration can and do vary from year to year at the behest of the local organisers.  From an early date, May has been identified as a preferred month for the holding of the commemoration due to the second Sunday in May being noted as Famine Sunday in many areas and the likelihood of good weather.  However, it should be noted that there is no specific date associated with the beginning, nadir or end of the Famine and also that there are Famine walks and commemorations in many communities on dates of local significance.<\/p> <p>  The commemoration has been held during May on six occasions since 2009.  It has also been necessary to hold the commemoration in September and October to accommodate the local community or due to other pressures such as the availability of the Taoiseach or President.  A key consideration in all years has been to ensure that the commemoration is held during school term to facilitate the involvement of schools.  The Deputy has referred to that.  At the request of the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, however, the Government on 30 April 2018 &ldquo;agreed to the designation of the third Sunday of May as the National Famine Commemoration Day with the arrangements for the holding a of State commemoration that is commensurate with the Great Famine&rsquo;s historical, social and cultural significance on this day or the preceding Saturday to be decided each year by the Minister for Culture, Heritage and Gaeltacht following consultation with the relevant local authority and host community&rdquo;.  That is because some host communities may prefer not to host an event on a Sunday.  <\/p> <p>  As a result of this decision, the 2019 commemoration will be held on the weekend of 18 and 19 May next year at a Connacht venue.  This decision has given effect to one of the primary objectives of the Bill, namely, the identification of a fixed date while preserving a degree of flexibility to vary the day of the ceremony to Saturday in recognition of local community concerns, as was the case for the 2015 commemoration held in Newry.  The national Famine commemoration is unique among State commemorations in that the venue changes from year to year.  The ceremony programme comprises two parts.  The first is a community event organised by the host community and local authority, with support from Department staff, which culminates in the keynote speech by the presiding officer, usually the President or Taoiseach.  This is followed by the formal State ceremonial event, which includes military honours and wreath laying ceremonies.<\/p> <p>  The community programme generally includes readings in the Irish and English languages, music by local musicians and choirs, participation by local school children and prayers for the victims of the Famine led by representatives of various faiths and a humanist reflection.  The precise form of each element of the programme may vary from year to year but is always subject to approval by the Minister to preserve the dignity of the event.  As I have stated, while the Minister welcomes the interest and intention of the Deputy in bringing forward this Bill, she is appreciative of the concerns of the NFCC that the enactment of the legislation could lead to a number of unintended consequences which may unintentionally hamper the ability of communities to host a national Famine commemoration in future years.  The issue of local communities hosting the national commemoration every year has been an important element because the impact of the Famine was felt in all corners of the country.   These concerns primarily arise regarding the proposals that the commemoration should include military ceremonial elements and an inter-faith service.<\/p> <p>  As members of the committee will be aware, the Great Famine was a human tragedy of immense proportions but was in no way a military event.  This renders it different to the other major State ceremonial events referred to earlier.  While the NFCC has considered this issue, the practice to date has been to continue with the standard approach to ceremonial events of including military elements.  No such elements, however, were included in the 2015 ceremony presided over by then Minister, Deputy Heather Humphreys, when a \"no flags and no uniforms\" policy was adopted.  Nevertheless, the commemoration was considered a great success.  In the event that a host community, either North or South, wished to adopt a similar approach at a future date with a view to emphasising the humanitarian nature of the tragedy, the imposition of a legislative requirement as proposed would require amending legislation even if the Government of the day was minded to accommodate an alternative approach to such ceremonies that did not encompass military involvement.<\/p> <p>  At any time, proposals that might inadvertently impact in a negative way on the capacity of any community on the island of Ireland to host an event of this nature would be a sensitive matter.  In current circumstances, these sensitivities are particularly acute and the Department asks that the committee reflect carefully on this issue.  The Department also points out that there is no legal definition of the term \"inter-faith service\".  As this is part of the community programme, we have seen a number of different approaches taken over the years.  Notwithstanding this, however, all of the major faiths in the country have been invited to participate in the commemoration, as has the humanist society.  The inclusion of a term such as this in legislation would require careful definition to avoid imposing a legislative requirement with which a Minister perhaps could not, with certainty, comply.  In addition, as Ireland becomes a more diverse country, including as a result of providing refuge to people fleeing often tragic events in their countries of origin, the Department would again request that the committee reflect carefully on the prudence of reducing flexibility for host communities on this issue.<\/p> <p>  In light of these concerns and the above mentioned possibility of wider implications for the wider State ceremonial calendar, the Minister asks that the committee, taking full account of the Government's decision of 30 April last year to give full consideration to the necessity of legislating for the Famine commemoration at this time.  I refer to those key concerns of moving the venue from location to location and also the issues on the military involvement, or the military ceremonial event, and the interfaith service.  I acknowledge what the Deputy said in his own contribution about being willing to look at elements of the Bill.  That was very helpful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018112800002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor Falvey"},{"type":"speech","time":1543411800,"counter":807,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Uasal Falvey.

The CCIFV is a family community-based group.  Over the years, it has had links and close partnerships and friendships throughout this island, the neighbouring island and globally.  The Bill being discussed today on Committee Stage is another piece of the jigsaw in the gigantic picture that is an Gorta M&oacute;r.  The Bill will give stability, certainty and an equal footing and recognition with Easter and July remembrance days, that have fixed days.  The Irish people, home and abroad, will know when the national Famine memorial day will take place when the Bill is passed.  It will also solve the annual headache for the Minister and the committee.<\/p> <p>  On St. Patrick's Day, Ireland and the world turns green.  It will do so on the third Sunday in May, when the national Famine commemoration day beds in and becomes more known.  The Bill will have a major part to play in this.  Ireland is unique.  We are the only country in the world with a Famine day in its national calendar.<\/p><p>Other countries would cherish the opportunity to have this day without the pain and loss.  They will follow in support, spirit and solidarity with Ireland on Famine day.  Famine and hunger are still a blight and constant foe for humanity today in a world of plenty.  The international overseas Famine memorial day can and should be held on the same day, the second or third Sunday in May, wherever green is worn, like St. Patrick's Day.<br\/><br\/>The Bill allows the Taoiseach to select the location for the national Famine commemoration day, as can be done for the international day.  There is not a blade of grass, a sod of earth, a village, town or city that has escaped the scars and wounds of an Gorta M&oacute;r; selecting a location will not be problem.  Likewise for the international day, the Irish Famine global family has left a large footprint and casts a long shadow on the planet, with over a 100 Famine memorials remembering those dark times, days and years in Irish history.<br\/><br\/>With Brexit confusion reigning, the unifying cement of the national Famine commemoration is relevant as it is an all-island event crossing the Border, for example in 2015 in Newry.  Members of the CCIFV were the harbingers for this happening in 2014 when we placed a marker at a paupers' and Famine mass grave at the old Newry workhouse, which today is the Daisy Hill hospital.  The mass grave, like numerous other mass graves on or close to workhouse sites around the country, holds the bodies of Catholics, Protestants, dissenters and non-believers.  One mass of humanity sleeping peacefully side by side: this is the universality of the great hunger.  The 2014 Newry commemoration was multi-denominational and cross-community.  The mayor of Newry officiated at the ceremony.<br\/><br\/>People at home and abroad are aware of the national Famine commemoration day and, like St. Patrick's Day, communities are holding an Gorta M&oacute;r events all over Ireland and overseas.  London and other UK locations have held commemorations for a number of years, as have communities in America, Canada, Australia and other places of which we are not aware.  The core of the national Famine commemoration day is remembrance of over 1 million innocent victims and another 2 million forced into exile.  The nuclear-like fallout is still felt today, more than 170 years on.  Ireland is the only country in the world whose population has not grown since the 19th century.  This is not a statistic any country would wish to hold.  The positives are the 70 million members of the Irish Famine global family who are proud to be Irish.  If a small percentage of the many who to trace their Irish family ancestry, heritage and history come to Ireland, the tourism potential, if harnessed and promoted, could yield limitless revenue for the country as well as forging closer links with their adopted countries.<br\/><br\/>There are eight Departments and NGOs on the national Famine commemoration committee, all of which can contribute to planting the seed for future growth and promotion of the national Famine commemoration day at home and abroad.  Education on the Famine in schools, although on the curriculum, is not compulsory.  The CCIFV has the Lumper schools project, which is on the Department's <i>scoilnet.ie<\/i>website this year for the first time although the project has been running for five years.  It is sponsored by Glens of Antrim Potatoes and is an all-island programme.  The Lumper is a living artefact and a Famine history teacher.<br\/><br\/>When tourists or indeed Irish people, especially schoolchildren, call into the National Museum of Ireland there is not a plaque on a wall to recognise or honour the loss of so many in this important part of our history that changed Ireland and the world forever.  An Gorta M&oacute;r gave the nation our national flag through the Young Irelanders' 1848 Famine rebellion led by William Smith O&rsquo;Brien at the Ballingarry Famine Warhouse, which is now a national monument.  That was the first time the Tricolour flew in battle.  It was the birth and creation of the Irish Republican Brotherhood, IRB, and the catalyst for the 1867 and 1916 rebellions that gave us our independence.  An Gorta M&oacute;r has been buried like the victims in omission, silence and denial in the National Museum of Ireland since the State's foundation and we are now coming up to the State's centenary.<br\/><br\/>The vision and opinions of the CCIFV are lengthy but need to be considered.  I will now share our condensed proposals for amendments to the National Famine Commemoration Day Bill 2017.  The rotation protocol around the four provinces is to be sacrosanct.  It is not to be broken as was done this year when the commemoration was kept in Munster for two years in succession at the expense of all the four provinces, to accommodate a Cabinet meeting - a first for a university to hold one - and to launch a book online.  The national Famine commemoration day is bigger than both of these.  <br\/><br\/>The international Famine commemoration day is to be held on the second or third Sunday in May in conjunction with the one at home.  This is to bring the Irish global Famine family into unity and inclusion.  We will all stand in remembrance of the victims and in celebration of the exiles and survivors on the same day, the second or third Sunday in May, Famine day.  On St. Patrick's Day, the Irish global family at home and abroad unites as one and the same should happen on the national Famine commemoration day.<br\/><br\/>The doubt and uncertainty attached to the timing of both the national and the international day since inauguration in 2008 will finally be consigned to history with the passing of this Bill.  It will bring clarity, certainty and stability for the Irish people and communities home and abroad who hold commemorations and the Taoiseach, Minister and the national Famine commemoration committee will be able to plan years in advance.  The Bill is an important part of the holistic story and history of an Gorta M&oacute;r.  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas don choiste.

This Bill has been around for a while - since 2017 - and that is one of the problems.  The Government made a decision subsequent to the introduction of the Bill.  I like to think the decision was probably partly made because the Bill was there.  My clear understanding and indication is that the Government allowed the Bill to go forward and that the Minister has absolutely no problem with my Bill.  The indications are the small ones, to answer the Senator's other question, of what I want to tighten up.  These issues were mentioned by the Department officials.  I have no problem with moving the day.  The Bill provides for the second Sunday but I have no problem with it being the third Sunday.  I have no problem with an amendment to the effect that instead of saying \"shall include civil and military\", the text would read \"can include\".  That would allow flexibility if the event was being hosted in a location where there would be a problem with a military involvement.<\/p><p>I have no problem with those types of changes but I am trying to achieve a strong, interdenominational, interfaith basis for this.  I am open to looking at what wording there could be to achieve this but I want to ensure that it happens.<\/p><p> A committee should work out, with the community, what flexibility there should be regarding what takes place on the day.  However, let us call a spade a spade.  It is not acceptable to have a randomly rotated date in order, as was stated, to suit the suits.  I do not believe there is a community in Ireland which could suggest to the Government that it hold St. Patrick's Day in July.  That is not an acceptable point.  I welcome the fact that the Government has decided to hold it on the third Sunday in May.  However, in the absence of this Bill, that decision could be adjusted easily by a new Government and a new Cabinet.<\/p><p> I was disappointed that the Department asked if we needed this at all and suggested that we leave matters as they stand.  As a result of what happened in the past, when we moved the date to suit the diaries of people who might have attended or a group which wanted to hold it, we need to underpin this by saying we will hold it on the third Sunday in May.  I am absolutely open to the idea of holding it on the eve of that day but I am not open to not going ahead with the Bill or allowing it to be adjusted again at a whim.  Without copper-fastening this point in the Bill, this that it exactly what can happen.<\/p><p> These are the small specific things I am willing to change.

When dealing with host communities and when we want to involve schools in what might be outdoor events, there is a narrow window when the schools are open and the weather might be good enough, which is why the time between May and September is suggested.  There may be a local consideration and some communities might have other stuff going on in May, and want to move it as a result.  I appreciate that Oireachtas Members may have a view as to whether that is a good idea.  The tendency has been to facilitate that, which means September.  I have not been involved in every event since 2008 but this tends to be the reason, rather than a particular person being unavailable.  Having said that, the Government was clearly convinced last April of the wisdom of settling on a date.  This is the basis on which all State ceremonial and commemorative events take place but, ultimately, it is a matter for the Oireachtas to decide as to what legislation it is going to provide.

I have had the pleasure of being on the national Famine commemoration committee for nine years.  It has been a great honour for me.  I have seen the commemoration evolve over those years.  There are three main thrusts of the national famine commemoration committee.  The first is to facilitate the national and international commemoration of the Famine.  The second is to reach out and try to engage the diaspora in whatever way we can.  The third is to increase awareness of hunger worldwide in whatever way we can.<\/p> <p>  There has been significant community involvement in the national element of the commemoration.  The event rotates to a different province each year.  In the past, various towns sent in applications and competed to host the event.  Each community addressed the event in different ways and that was a big part of the success of the commemoration within the community.<\/p> <p>  We have probably not been as successful with the other two parts, namely, reaching out to the diaspora and improving awareness of hunger issues worldwide.  However, we have moved some way towards resolving that with the development of a marvellous website by the Department in conjunction with University College Cork.  This is a research tool that allows us to look at the evolution of the Famine from 1841 to 1851 and the changes in demographics and various statistics over the period simply by moving a cursor across the screen.  The website can be further developed.  My vision for it, in conjunction with members of the national famine commemoration committee, is that we could engage the diaspora in innovative ways by developing the website as a repository.  People from around the world could submit their stories, photographs of artefacts or whatever else to a managed system.  The website is also being used by schools.  When we started to develop the website schools in Northern Ireland showed great interest in becoming involved.<\/p> <p>  The military element could be an issue when we are talking about the North.  We involved the North and its turn to host the commemoration will come around again.  The Protestant Famine communities in the North were equally affected as many Famine communities down South.<\/p> <p>  To be blunt, the interfaith service in some of the previous commemorations went on for too long and in some ways caused people to disengage from the reflective event that had been organised with music, poetry, enactments and so on.  It is hard to get back into that zone again.  For this reason, I would be worried about prescribing an interfaith service as part of the commemoration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018112800002#G01200","nonspeaker":"Professor Tommy Cooke"},{"type":"speech","time":1543411800,"counter":833,"content":"<p>I am interested in hearing the thoughts of the witnesses on the title of the commemoration.

The question that arises today is how best to have a Famine commemoration.  To my knowledge, there is no opposition to having a Famine commemoration, so I do not think there is any danger of a Government saying we would not have one.  A much more fundamental question arises in terms of whether one just does it or whether one provides for it in legislation.  There are upsides and downsides to having it in legislation.<\/p><p>I often complain European legislation can be awfully constraining and can have all sorts of unintended consequences.  There can be extreme interpretations by courts and so on that were never intended by the legislators.  The problem that arises when legislation is introduced at such a remove and then set in stone without getting the whole of Europe to change, is that it becomes immutable and impractical.  We are finding every day of the week, certainly west of the Shannon, that a great deal of European legislation has bizarre consequences.  When we pass legislation in the House and find there is an unintended consequence or an unforeseen circumstance there is nothing that can be done except introduce further legislation.  If the legislation is the result of Government decision and popular acclaim and flexibility is needed, one can go back at any time and make whatever change is needed.  <\/p><p> I welcome the Government made a decision about the date of 3 May.  I remember the debate when we started this because there was no obvious or specific date, as there had not been a rising.  The first commemoration was held in Skibbereen at the end of May.  The reason we did not set the date at that stage was very simple.  We were wondering if we had forgotten something or whether there would be a big row or something else going on at the time.  We could not think of anything.  It has been held on a date other than in May twice for various reasons.  <\/p><p> From the very beginning, the commemoration was supposed to be marked on a 32-county basis.  If the people of Belfast or Derry said they would like to have it in September, it would be a little insensitive for the Department to refuse.  Is there an advantage in setting a date in stone?  Is there a big risk involved in not doing so?  Would setting a date be a constraint?<\/p><p> I am in favour of including a military element for a very simply reason.  The military will not be about guns and so on until we get involved in a common European defence.  Until such time, our military is a force for peacekeeping and internal State security.  It represents the State in a very formal way.  When we discussed including a military element, the idea was to show that an independent Irish State recognised the citizens who died in the Famine.  However, this poses a difficulty across the Border and we have to be flexible in that regard.<\/p><p> I made a comment about the religious service which I probably should not have made across the floor because we are supposed to speak at all times through the Chair.  Gabh mo leithsc&eacute;al faoi sin.  I do not like the present arrangement for the presidential inauguration.  The inauguration of Douglas Hyde and some subsequent Presidents used to involve the President-elect attending a service in the church of their choice.  In the case of Douglas Hyde, it was in St. Patrick's Cathedral.  Anybody who did not want to go to the religious service skipped it.  It was a religious service to pray for the success of the Presidency and nothing to do with the State ceremony which is the inauguration.  It was a service, whether religious or humanist, which took place off site.  When it came to the inauguration proper, which always took place in St. Patrick's Hall in Dublin Castle, there was no religious element because there was a total separation of church and State.  We think we have moved forward but we have moved backwards by bringing the religious element into Dublin Castle and having 30 or 40 different religions.  The number of religions is growing every year and I have no problem with it.  I think it is great to have various groups making some kind of statement.  However, I agree with Professor Cooke.  After a while one sees people's eyelids dropping.  I do not think that should be in the Bill.  When we start stripping the Bill down to allow for contingencies, are we left with anything and do we really need the Bill?  That is a decision the committee will have to make.  We would need a Bill very urgently if the Government was even half thinking of dropping all of this.  However, there is a snowball's chance in hell of that happening.<\/p><p> A national commemoration will take place somewhere in Ireland, preferably on 3 May, and that date has been fixed by the Minister.  Whoever mentioned moving St. Patrick's Day has a point.  In many American cities, for practical reasons St. Patrick's Day is celebrated on the Sunday before or after 17 March, depending on the day it falls on, because the streets cannot all be closed to have a decent parade on 17 March.  The world is funny and very rarely black and white in terms of what a law does.  That is why we should always be sparing in law.<\/p><p> I have given my view on both the religious issue and the military issue.  I want the military included in all the national commemorations.  However, I now find we would have to write in more clauses providing that in the event of the commemoration having a Northern element or any other sensitivities like that, the military element must be left out.  I am wondering what will be in the Bill in the end.  This is the issue the committee will have to address.<\/p><p> I would like an absolute affirmation from the Department.  We had the international commemoration and I remember having it in Toronto and Grosse Isle.  Grosse Isle was absolutely extraordinary.  It is the island all the immigrants came through on their way to Canada.  It is an extraordinary place.  I was a little amused.  I must mention a monument built in cloch eibhir.  The stone used was transported 300 miles down the St. Lawrence River 60 years later to raise an extraordinary cross.  What is also interesting is that some of the people who arrived in Grosse Isle were so poor they had nothing.  Their involvement in raising the monument 60 years later shows the ability of the Irish to rise from nothing.  There was an inscription on the monument in Irish, English and French.  The Irish version was wrongly translated.  There is a secret code in the Irish version, \"Go Saoraigh Dia &Eacute;ire\", which people translated it as \"God save Ireland\".  That is not what it says because it means, \"May God free Ireland\".  Obviously the former Famine victims who raised the cross had great political aspirations but decided to keep that to themselves by having this inscription written in Irish and not in English or French.  I thought it was very curious.  It is a very stark message of their political dreams.  This goes back to what I said about the military ceremony.  It epitomises the aspirations of those people even in the most desperate of times that they would have control of their own destinies.  <\/p><p> We have a difficult choice to make.  It is not anything to do with the Famine commemoration.  A lecture was delivered abroad as part of the commemorations and the possibility of a lecture being delivered here was also discussed.  I am not sure if that lecture is still given.  I am glad to hear about the website.  It is absolutely fantastic.  The committee does a great job.  The people we have to suit are those in the communities.  It is the all-Ireland dimension that makes this a little trickier.  We should try, when the commemoration is held in Ulster, to ensure all nine counties are involved in the debate, not just the three counties here.<\/p><p> I thought it set a bad precedent and was bitterly disappointed when it was decided not to continue the rotation.  I was assured by the Department it was intended to return to that practice.<\/p><p>I do not care what bid UCC submitted; I still think it was a major mistake.  The Famine belongs to the people and the small places of Ireland, the likes of Murrisk and Skibbereen.  That is why we started in Skibbereen.  It belongs to the people in every part of the smallest rural communities, many of which were heavily populated at the time.  Some of them were hugely affected and have now been totally depopulated.  I hope the committee will resist the temptation to focus on the most powerful and biggest communities, towns and cities.  This is the one national commemoration that belongs to every community because every community was affected.  As I said, some of them are very rural.  We know, for example, about the Famine village on Achill Island.  There are good reasons to hold it there.  One of the things we found was that when we brought it to the more rural areas, the areas where the folk memories are still alive, which is always the case when a population is less mobile, the enthusiasm in organising at a local level compensated for any lack of population.  I have an open mind and believe we should keep an open mind until we debate the matter privately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018112800002#G01800","speaker":"1312","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1543411800,"counter":841,"content":"<p>I would like to correct the record.

With reference to the Department, it could be argued that community involvement is the reason there is an attempt to erase the record of the inaugural event at the Customs House in 2008.  On 21 May the Taoiseach said in the D&aacute;il that a community event was happening on that day.  He did not mention the CCIFV; he just referred to a community group.  In 2016 six weeks notice was given to the people of Ireland by the National Famine Commemoration Committee of the event to be held in Glasnevin Cemetery.  There was no community involvement.  Do we have to expunge that commemoration as only six weeks notice was given and the D&aacute;il was in recess?  The schools were only back one week, which is why they and the community were not involved at Glasnevin.  We either expunge it from the list of National Famine Commemoration events in terms of the criteria laid down by the Department or we start to set the record straight from now on.  As I said, if one goes to the primary source, the Taoiseach referred to it in the D&aacute;il and the event took place at the Customs House in 2008 and it was not a figment of my imagination because I was there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018112800002#J00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Blanch"},{"type":"speech","time":1543411800,"counter":846,"content":"<p>I think that is accepted.

There is a lot more agreement on this issue than we think, although one can look for disagreement.  The heart of the matter is that there should not be a competing set of priorities.  We must work together on the issue.  I accept that communities should be at the heart of the event.  I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v that it works better outside the major urban centres and in smaller communities.  Having attended several of the events, I certainly agree that it works far better in such an environment.<\/p> <p>  For me, it is about commemorating the most important event that formed modern Ireland and the island of Ireland and whether it is worth overriding considerations in fixing a date and not building flexibility around it.  I fully accept that we can envisage a scenario where some community will state it cannot do it on a particular date.  However, we owe it to the millions who died and the millions of families who lost members through emigration to set a date.  I do not buy the argument that in America they move the date of celebration of St. Patrick's Day.  That might be the case, but the Americans do not move the date of celebration of the 4th of July or Thanksgiving.  What a country decides to lock down in setting a sacred date says a lot about it.  That is what drove this.  In lots of ways, one would like to think it is not necessary to have this legislation, but, unfortunately, while we had a very good start with the work done by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and many others on the issue of Famine commemoration, this is just another small step and not over-prescriptive.  As I said, on the smaller, more technical points I am willing to work with the committee and other Members of the Houses to ensure we will have a Bill that will garner full support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018112800002#J00800","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speech","time":1543411800,"counter":848,"content":"<p>Basically, the Deputy is saying we will have it, which I do not think anybody is disputing.  He said the second Sunday presented a difficulty but that he was agreeable to the third, which is fine.  Then we have the military and interfaith service, about which there is no problem.  Then the Bill states the central venue for the commemoration \"shall be designated by the Taoiseach\".  The problem I have with that is that, technically, the Taoiseach could decide whatever date he or she wanted.  Even if we were to replace the Taoiseach with the Minister, it would still be problematic because it was designed at the beginning to involve an advisory committee.  In principle and practice, it was never envisaged that anything would be decided without the involvement of the advisory committee, with the Minister as chairperson.  When drafting the Bill, I suggest the advisory committee be included in order that the Taoiseach would designate a venue on its advice.  Technically, according to the Bill, we could destroy what is in place already.  We could take out the reference to the advisory committee and leave it to the Taoiseach of the day or the Minister to decide, if amended thus.  There is no mention of either the Taoiseach or the Minister having to seek the advice of the advisory committee, but that is actually the key element of how the decisions were made.  They were not made by an individual on a unilateral basis.  They were made by an advisory committee that was very broad ranging and included current day Famine interests, including Tr&oacute;caire, Gorta and so on, various experts, as well as officials from the relevant Departments.

That is welcome from the Department's perspective.  I had the privilege of accompanying the Minister of State, Deputy Patrick O'Donovan, on a trip to Melbourne in October to attend an international Famine commemoration event which was held in Williamstown, where some of the great great grandchildren of the orphan girls who travelled on the Earl Grey ships in the late 1840s up to 1850 laid wreaths at the memorial stone and a message from President Michael D. Higgins was read.  It was a much more moving and emotional event than I had anticipated.  An academic round table discussion followed which was facilitated by the chairs and professors of Irish studies in various universities.  It was a standing room only event which was also very emotional for all those who attended in discussing the Famine and also the more recent experiences of Irish emigrants in Australia.<\/p><p>It provided a forum for that which I think people had been seeking.<\/p><p> As for the locations for events, I can only say that the rotation, on the advice and in the view of the committee, as I understand it, is backed fully.  The departure this year was a once-off, and Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v has made his views known on this on a number of occasions.  The website to which Professor Cooke referred earlier tells this story about the impact of the Famine very clearly and graphically.  One can see the people in the worst classes of accommodation in rural areas engaged in agriculture, the absolute destruction of those communities and the way in which towns and communities which existed before the Famine were gone by 1851.  If it were of any interest to members of the committee, we could perhaps ask UCC to facilitate a demonstration at some stage.  To come back to the basic point, though, a Government decision is now in place on the holding of the event on a specified weekend.  The point has been made that this can move, and anything is possible.  Given the nature of Government decisions, however, Government does not vacate them very quickly because they then have less weight and magnitude as a result.  There is no intention to dilute any of the supports in place at present for commemoration of the Famine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018112800002#J01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor Falvey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543411800,"counter":855,"content":"<p>I will ask a few questions but first I thank, in particular Mr. Michael Blanch, who has been dogged in this, to the extent sometimes that the question is asked, \"What now?\"  It is brilliant when something comes from the grassroots up.  The logic is there.  I do not think anyone disputes Mr. Blanch's logic.  Time and again, when other things that we thought were too important came across our desks, Mr. Blanch was there to ring us up and remind us.<\/p> <p>  I have a question about the website.  Can a link be provided to the Lumper project that Mr. Blanch initiated?  A link is now on the website of the Department of Education and Skills, but could one be provided on the existing sites?  The link gives the history and explains how the planting and so on was done subsequently.  It is an area of history in which I am very interested.<\/p> <p>  I refer specifically to the commemorations.  I agree with this legislation.  There are two Private Members' Bills, and it is very strange that one man managed to get two Deputies in different parties to produce Bills on this at around the same time.  It is key that this date is fixed, and the only way of fixing dates thus far has been to tie them to a bank holiday.  I will not go down the route of this argument.  I have my own views and my own legislation on an independence day so I will not delay a Bill by adding to it and having this debate.  I will have my own debate on this in the future.  This legislation's proposal of a fixed date also serves the purpose of a national holiday, public holiday or bank holiday because it is fixed in time, whether it be the Friday, Saturday, Sunday or Monday.  The important thing is that we know on which week this will take place.  Furthermore, to prevent any confusion, the venue should be announced on the conclusion of the commemoration.  This would be useful because it would allow the communities to put in their bid and allow the committee to have its role and, if at all possible, to make an announcement.  If one is planning what is basically an international event, even though it is in Ireland, this is important.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the schools project or the community project, the only problem with the date is that one will not get secondary schools involved because on the third Saturday most secondary school pupils are doing their exams, and those who are not are facing into their junior certificate or leaving certificate courses.  I know some of them will get involved because this is on their curriculum.  If the project is in one's locality or in a small rural town, I can guarantee the witnesses people will be there because it could be the biggest event in one's lifetime if it is done properly, as it has been.  This highlights a problem we have, which is that history has been slowly removed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018112800002#K00200","speaker":"1235"},{"type":"speech","time":1543411800,"counter":856,"content":"<p>The Chairman is right there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018112800002#K00300","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speech","time":1543411800,"counter":857,"content":"<p>We will come back to that another day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018112800002#K00350","speaker":"1235"},{"type":"speech","time":1543411800,"counter":858,"content":"<p>I argued against that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018112800002#K00400","speaker":"1427"},{"type":"speech","time":1543411800,"counter":859,"content":"<p>I know, and we had the argument.

I am here to assist the joint committee in its consideration of the general scheme of the Taxi Regulation (Amendment) (Rickshaw) Bill 2018 as submitted recently to and approved by the Government for publication and drafting by the Parliamentary Counsel in the Office of the Attorney General.<\/p> <p>  The Minister is very pleased with the support the general scheme of the Bill has received so far and believes it will have positive impacts both for the rickshaw sector and general public alike.  As members know, a key role for him is developing robust legislation to underpin vehicles used for the carriage of passengers for reward.  As the committee is probably aware, under the Taxi Regulation Act 2013 which was passed into law in 2013, the National Transport Authority, NTA, is the independent regulator of the taxi, hackney and limousine sector.  Technically, they are known under the legislation as small public service vehicles, SPSVs.  The 2013 Act sets out new rules and arrangements for licences for small public service vehicles such as taxis.  As we all know, taxis and taxi drivers must be fully licensed.  As regulator, the NTA sets the standards and requirements for the sector which include rules for vehicle standards, the suitability of drivers and insurance requirements.  It could be said Ireland&rsquo;s regulation of taxis exemplifies best practice in public safety and consumer protection.<\/p> <p>  We are all aware that a wide range of public concerns have been raised about rickshaws.  The committee has discussed the dangers posed them on the streets and concerns have been expressed about the public safety issues that have been reported, particularly reckless driving and other unlawful behaviour.<\/p><p>While there have been connections made between rickshaws and drug dealing, it would be unfair to say this type of behaviour applies to all who currently work within the sector.  It is a concern, however, and it is not acceptable that it continues.<\/p><p>As the committee will remember, last year the NTA was tasked with conducting a public consultation on rickshaws.  The NTA&rsquo;s subsequent report showed that 95% of those surveyed wanted rickshaw operators to have appropriate liability insurance, 86% wanted rickshaw drivers to be Garda vetted, while 95% wanted rickshaw vehicles to be required to complete a roadworthiness inspection.<\/p><p> With this in mind, it is intended to give powers to the NTA to introduce a licensing regime for non-motorised rickshaws only.  The framework for this licensing regime will largely mirror that which is in place for taxis.  First and foremost, this will ensure that all drivers and vehicles are vetted and registered.  The NTA will be also able to set mandatory insurance requirements.  The Minister believes this option will greatly reduce risk and significantly improve passenger and public safety, and enhance customer experience.<\/p><p> The Department met with a number of stakeholders to discuss the shape and practicalities of the future regulatory approach for rickshaws, including representatives from a number of relevant local authorities and the NTA, and broad agreement was indicated with the regulatory direction proposed.  The Minister is appreciative of the input and assistance provided by stakeholders on the matter.<\/p><p> A few months ago, it was discussed with the committee that rickshaws can be either motorised, pedal powered or pedal assisted.  The Bill will provide for the licensing of certain non-motorised vehicles carrying passengers for reward.  In the case of rickshaws, this means that only pedal-powered and pedal-assisted rickshaws operating for the carriage of persons will be licensed.  Non-motorised rickshaws are capable of achieving speeds of up to only 25 km\/h.  As it is recognised that vehicles travelling at lower speeds can lead to lower risks, the Bill will allow only the slower, pedal-type rickshaws to be licensed.  It is anticipated that this approach should help to reduce risk.  It is proposed that the faster, motorised rickshaws will not be licensed or permitted to be used for the carriage of passengers for reward in Ireland.  Licensing slower rickshaws only will promote greater safety.  Furthermore, it is expected that the licensing of these greener rickshaws will help improve the ambiance of our city centres, bringing further benefits for tourism and local businesses, which was an issue raised by many of the committee members on the last occasion when the Minister appeared before them to discuss rickshaws.<\/p><p> The committee was previously informed about specific enforcement issues involving rickshaws.  With a motor attached, the rickshaw is a mechanically propelled vehicle and subject to certain road traffic laws like any car.  Detaching the motor transforms it into a pedal-powered vehicle which is regarded as a bicycle and which is treated very differently under road traffic law.  This is challenging for enforcement since it is difficult to be certain about the type of vehicle involved in advance of taking any enforcement action.<\/p><p>To address this, the heads of the Bill make provision for the detention of any rickshaw where an enforcement officer is of the opinion that it could be a motorised rickshaw carrying passengers for reward.  After detention, the authorities would be able to establish the vehicle type and prosecute if appropriate or, if no offence has been committed, return the vehicle to its owner.  The committee will agree that these measures will facilitate decisive enforcement.  Effective enforcement is central to the success of any licensing regime.<\/p><p> To provide for improved public safety and passenger experience, the draft heads include a number of licensing and enforcement provisions, addressing broad themes including vehicle checking and registration, driver vetting and registration, requirements for insurance and fair regulation.  As mentioned, these provisions are largely reflective of existing provisions for the regulation of taxis under the Taxi Regulation Act, which was passed by the Oireachtas and signed into law by the President five years ago.  As such, the Taxi Regulation Act 2013 constitutes modern legislation and is regarded as a helpful foundation as we move to introduce regulation for rickshaws, a sector also responsible for the carriage of passengers for reward.  The intention is that the NTA will be able to move quickly to introduce the new licensing regime and to address the concerns expressed.<\/p><p> For rickshaw drivers, this will mean they will need to apply for a licence to work as a driver in the sector.  As with taxi driver licences, the rickshaw driver licensing application will also involve applying for Garda vetting.  The rickshaw vehicle itself will need to be licensed and comply with any vehicle regulations set by the regulator.  The end result should be a regulatory regime for rickshaws that is as successful and robust as that which applies to the taxi sector.<\/p><p> As committee members will know, the Railway Safety (Amendment) Bill, discussed earlier this year, seeks to provide that railway safety critical workers will be subject to the same rules regarding alcohol limits and other intoxicants as &ldquo;specified persons&rdquo; under road traffic legislation.  This category in road traffic legislation includes professional drivers on the road, such as drivers of buses, taxis or road haulage vehicles.  The general scheme intends to ensure that licensed rickshaw drivers will be also recognised under statute as &ldquo;specified persons&rdquo; and that they will be subject to the same strict provisions for alcohol limits and other intoxicants as other professional drivers on the road.  I am sure the committee will agree including these provisions is important, since a stricter approach in respect of drugs and alcohol for rickshaw drivers will help to ensure increased safety for passengers and other road users.<\/p><p> The draft heads will also amend provisions under the Taxi Regulation Act 2013 which relate to fixed payment notices.  These are fines imposed by NTA enforcement officers on taxi drivers who commit certain offences.  Under the new provisions, rickshaw drivers will be also subject to such fines.  Furthermore, the amendments in the general scheme will modernise certain provisions for fixed payment notices to mirror the provisions set out under road traffic legislation for fixed charge notices as imposed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p> As I said, the intention of the draft general scheme is to improve public safety and enhance passenger experience for rickshaw drivers and rickshaw passengers.  The Minister welcomes the broad support he has received to date and it is hoped the Bill will progress through the Houses without delay.  I thank the Chairman for inviting me to make this presentation and look forward to hearing the views of the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018112800002#C01500","nonspeaker":"Ms Maev Nic Lochlainn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543411800,"counter":941,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to engage in this pre-legislative scrutiny and the fact that at long last a Bill is coming forward.  That is not intended as criticism of the officials, and I know that for a long time the Minister was considering an outright ban of rickshaws.  I welcome that he has rowed back on his opinion and he intends to regulate them instead.  Rickshaws offer an alternative mode of transport, not least in large urban areas which suffer from significant congestion.  Outside the 3Arena or any large sporting event, rickshaws are a welcome mode of transport to transport people from congested areas to the city centre or wherever.  It is from that perspective that I welcome the Minister's change of heart.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Munster and I tabled amendments to a road traffic Bill in December 2016 that would have had a similar effect to that which is proposed in the legislation, namely, giving the NTA powers to bring forward regulations.  While the Bill is welcome, therefore, we have wasted almost two years through the lack of regulation.  Again, that is not the officials' fault but rather it is that of the political masters of the day.<\/p><p>Is there scope within the Bill to the amend the Taxi Regulation Act 2013 to address the currently very restricted transfer of taxi licences?  Is there an opportunity to address the shortage of taxis in certain large urban areas in the Bill?<\/p><p> I welcome the fact that all drivers will be vetted, which is extremely important in regard to those offering a public service in carrying passengers.  People need to be confident that they are getting into a vehicle with a driver who has been vetted such that they can feel safe and secure.  <\/p><p> It is welcome that the vehicles will have to be roadworthy.  Which competent body will sign off on the roadworthiness of the vehicles?  Heavy goods vehicles and small buses must undergo the commercial vehicle roadworthiness test and private cars must undergo the national car test.  What body will sign off on the roadworthiness of rickshaws?<\/p><p> The insurance requirements are welcome.  Insurance is necessary to compensate a person injured in a collision, for example.  Has there been engagement with the insurance industry regarding the provision of insurance to rickshaw owners when the regulations are brought in?  I recently raised the issue of the exorbitant cost of insurance for taxi drivers.  The insurance policy of a constituent of mine in Longford-Westmeath increased fourfold in 12 months, which forced him to reduce the number of cars in his fleet.  What level of engagement has the Department had with the insurance industry in regard to the provision of insurance?<\/p><p> Will all types of rickshaws apart from motorised rickshaws be regulated?  Will battery-assisted rickshaws be permitted to carry passengers as a public service vehicle?<\/p><p> On the set-up cost of approximately &euro;500,000, will a registration fee be charged of rickshaw drivers?  Will that fee go towards the initial set-up costs?<\/p><p> Who will police the regulation of rickshaws?  Will enforcement officers be hired or will enforcement be left to already overstretched members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  Obviously, rickshaws are vehicles and the rules of the road in regard to alcohol and drugs should apply and that is welcome.<\/p><p> Ms Nic Lochlainn alluded to the railway safety (amendment) Bill which was discussed earlier this year by the committee.  I ask her to update the committee on the status of that Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018112800002#D00200","speaker":"1250","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543411800,"counter":943,"content":"<p>I will take questions from Deputy Munster, to be followed by Deputies Catherine Murphy and Ellis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018112800002#E00200","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1543411800,"counter":944,"content":"<p>I will share time with Deputy Ellis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018112800002#E00300","speaker":"1333"},{"type":"speech","time":1543411800,"counter":945,"content":"<p>That is fine.

It is somewhat disappointing that the Minister, Deputy Ross, is not here.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the regulations in regard to non-motorised rickshaws.  They are very similar to those that Deputy Troy and I suggested.  However, Ms Nic Lochlainn did not make clear in her opening statement why it will not be permissible for motorised rickshaws to be used as public service vehicles and the regulations will apply only to non-motorised rickshaws.  The statement outlines that slower vehicles are safer.  What is the implication of that logic for cars, motorbikes, taxis and other vehicles?  Is that the only reason for that decision?<\/p> <p>  The statement refers to enforcement issues. It states: \"With a motor attached, the rickshaw is a mechanically propelled vehicle and subject to certain road traffic laws like any car.\"  Does that imply that motorised rickshaws are subject to the same regulations as taxis?  If that is the case, what is the problem?  I originally raised that issue because the vehicles were uninsured, unlicensed and unregulated.  I ask Ms Nic Lochlainn to clarify those issues.<\/p> <p>  A document with which I was presented this afternoon states that it is not proposed to license motorised rickshaws to carry passengers for reward but, in line with Ireland's EU obligations, it will be permissible to drive motorised rickshaws with EU-type approval for personal use.  How is public safety served by permitting the driving of motorised rickshaws for personal use but not for reward?  How is it proposed to monitor that?<\/p> <p>  Ms Nic Lochlainn raised the issue of a rickshaw being a mechanically-propelled vehicle once a motor is attached.  According to the statement, this is \"challenging when it comes to enforcement since it is so hard to be certain about the type of vehicle involved in advance of taking any enforcement action.\"  However, it is obvious whether a rickshaw is motorised as the driver does not have to pedal furiously to get from one place to another and can attain higher speeds.  I ask Ms Nic Lochlainn to explain the rationale behind that statement.  It is not clear why the Minister proposes to ban motorised rickshaws.  The reasons given do not add up.<\/p> <p>  Ms Nic Lochlainn mentioned the importance of the consultation process in drafting the legislation.  Rickshaw drivers did not engage in the initial consultation, so a separate consultation or process was conducted with them.  I ask that the details of that process be provided to the committee.  Did it involve more rickshaw owners or drivers?  Ultimately, rickshaw drivers have the most to lose under the Bill.  I seek clarity on the rationale behind the Minister's decision to ban motorised rickshaws and regulate non-motorised rickshaws.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018112800002#E00800","speaker":"1333"},{"type":"speech","time":1543411800,"counter":950,"content":"<p>I am in a small quandary here.

Every policy requires regulation and enforcement in addition to legislation.  My first question relates to the regulatory impact analysis that the Department has provided us with.  Where did the analysis of the costs come from?  What urban centres are being looked at by the Department?  What would the enforcement actually look like?  Would the Department work with existing agencies?  I would have expected the issue of insurance to have been considered in the context of the regulatory impact analysis.  Was that considered in any kind of detail with the insurance industry or the insurance federation?  Is it the case that only the vehicle will be licensed, or will the vehicle and the driver be licensed?  It is not entirely clear if both will be covered.<\/p> <p>  I am confused about the motorised rickshaws.  What place do they have?  How will they be regulated?  Will they be banned?  How will they be dealt with if they present?  This industry has grown up without any legislation or regulation.  It is proposed that rather than banning these vehicles, they will be legislated for and regulated.  Is it tenable to ban something that may already be in use here?  What obstacles are posed in such circumstances?  Where exactly might these vehicles be used?  Will they be used on public roads?  There tends to be a degree of parking of these vehicles on pedestrianised streets.  Has that aspect of the matter been considered?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018112800002#F00200","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1543411800,"counter":952,"content":"<p>I thank the officials for coming in.  I have been tackling this ongoing problem for many years.  The Minister originally said he was going to try to ban these vehicles outright.  Now he is basically telling us that motorised rickshaws can be used for personal use and he will regulate non-motorised rickshaws.  A number of questions arise in that context, for example, relating to insurance and tax issues.  In the case of motorised rickshaws that are used for personal use, I imagine that insurance and tax will kick in.  Where does that leave us in the case of non-motorised rickshaws?  One is not required to get tax, insurance or a licence plate for a bicycle.  I expect that there will have to be some way of identifying or checking non-motorised rickshaws.  Is it intended that some kind of identification, like a licence plate, will be required for non-motorised rickshaws?<\/p> <p>  Where are we on the issue of an NCT-type test in respect of these vehicles?  I am very curious about how this will be done.  An ordinary driving licence covers motorised vehicles but it does not cover non-motorised vehicles like those the Minister is proposing to legislate for.  Is it proposed that a licence will be needed for non-motorised vehicles?  I am curious about how that will work.  Will there be rules and regulations on overcrowding?  How will this be judged?  Some of these rickshaws carry two, three or four people.  Many of them are built for no more than two people.  One often sees three or four people in a rickshaw.  Gangs of people jump into them.  How will that be addressed?  Will we do so by introducing a specific requirement for it to be indicated clearly on each vehicle that it is a two-seater or a three-seater?  That definition needs to be very clear for us.<\/p> <p>  As I have said, the type of licence is a big issue.  It will sometimes be difficult to figure out whether a vehicle is motorised.  Will we have a specific definition to take account of whether it has an engine or other form of mechanical propulsion apart from pedal power?  I imagine that someone might argue that he or she has removed the electrical components of his or her vehicle so that it can run on pedal power.  Will there be a grey area here that there will be a bit of argument about?  All of this will need to be monitored.  We are struggling to monitor other industries.  What form of inspection will we have?  Will we have inspectors?  It seems to me that the Garda will end up looking after this.  I cannot see us putting people in place to deal specifically with this activity.  Clear guidelines will be needed to govern how it is tackled.  I am curious.  Will some sort of memorandum be given to the Garda?  If certain rules will have to be followed, they will need to be outlined clearly.<\/p> <p>  An examination of this sector is long overdue.  In light of the way we have introduced licences into the taxi industry, we should have a ceiling on the numbers of rickshaws.  We should not just rubber-stamp applications for motorised or non-motorised rickshaws.  If a non-motorised rickshaw is being used commercially and people are being charged, we should be able to set down clear rules and regulations in that regard.  A similar point can be made about the use of motorised rickshaws for personal use.  I am a bit worried about this whole issue.  The next thing we will tackle is the motorised scooters that are being used now.  That is the next thing on the agenda.  When the new system for rickshaws comes in, it will have implications for motorised scooters.  We need to watch that space as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018112800002#F00300","speaker":"1303"},{"type":"speech","time":1543411800,"counter":953,"content":"<p>Some excellent probing questions have been asked and need to be answered.

I welcome the decision to provide for strict and fair regulation of them.  It is very important that they are properly regulated.  During the initial discussions we had some months ago, it was suggested that certain substances which are abused tend to be sold from these vehicles or by people who use them.  Like many others, I made the point that the drug problem is a serious issue and a matter for Garda enforcement.  If people are breaking the law, they should be apprehended regardless of where they are or what they are driving.  I welcome the Department's clear assertion in its opening statement that it would be unfair to include all rickshaw drivers in the law-breaking category.  It is clear that they are not all engaged in this activity.  I welcome the clarification in that regard.  I also welcome the recognition that driving rickshaws can be a way of earning a useful income for students and people who may be unemployed.

I will do my best and the Chairman can remind me if I forget something important.  We have engaged with the NTA and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na extensively on the vehicle and both organisations have always been clear with us that motorised and pedal-assisted rickshaws look the same.  One can have a pedal-powered rickshaw which is simply like a bicycle.  One cycles it and it moves.  One can have a pedal-assisted rickshaw which has a small motor.  One pedals and the dynamo starts to work and the rickshaw moves faster.  Under road traffic law, both types are regarded and treated as bicycles.  As members have pointed out, they do not require motor tax or motor insurance.  One cannot get a driving licence for one just as one cannot get a licence to cycle a bike.  The other type of rickshaw has a larger motor.  Our legal advice suggests that if one can hit a button or turn a throttle which makes the vehicle move without any pedalling or human effort, it is a mechanically-propelled vehicle .  If one has a rickshaw which can be used without pedalling in any way, it is a mechanically-propelled vehicle and falls into the definition under road traffic legislation which covers cars, for example.  In that case, the rickshaw requires motor tax, a driving licence and motor insurance.   That is the main differentiation.  The enforcement difficulty is as follows.  Deputy Munster mentioned that we are allowing them for personal use.  The State is not allowed to prohibit people from using vehicles if there is type approval for that vehicle in the EU.  There is type approval for some rickshaws under EU law.  However, it is our general experience that rickshaws are really only used in two city centres in Ireland, namely Dublin and Cork.  The NTA survey shows that a very high percentage of respondents &ndash; 83% - said they were from Dublin while only 5% were from Cork.  In essence, the issue is city-centre based.  It is not our experience that people buy rickshaws for personal use.  They are somewhat cumbersome for personal use.  They take a lot of energy to move.  As such, our understanding is that people buy them to carry passengers.<\/p> <p>  Under existing laws, a motorised vehicle being used to carry passengers for hire or reward is governed under the existing Taxi Regulation Act.  Currently, the NTA could make regulations to govern them.  However, the regulations the NTA has made on small motorised public service vehicles requires them to have four wheels.  In essence, the motorised ones are prohibited but as I said of our conversations with the NTA and the Garda, people on the ground seeking to enforce these laws cannot do so because they cannot tell whether a rickshaw is a motorised vehicle.  Anecdotally, they have told us that if they put to someone that theirs is a motorised vehicle, the person can literally hop around the corner and remove or adjust the motor in such a way that it becomes a non-motorised vehicle in respect of which a prosecution cannot successfully be brought.  While there is a ban on motorised rickshaws already in law, as one is not allowed to have a small mechanically propelled public service vehicle which does not have four wheels if one is trying to carry passengers, it has been impossible to enforce it.  The new heads of legislation propose to introduce detention powers which allow anyone to, on a whim essentially, detain a vehicle that looks like a rickshaw that may be motorised and which is carrying passengers or plying to do so.  The person can then establish whether it is a vehicle governed under the Taxi Regulation Act or governed by the new Bill when adopted.

However, such expertise certainly exists, as far as I understand, in Ireland and certainly in the EU.  There are people who can inspect vehicles, establish the size of the motor and whether a vehicle is motorised or non-motorised.  I do not envisage any difficulty with the NTA even though it does not have those skills in&ndash;house at present.  These issues were discussed with the NTA before developing the general scheme.<\/p> <p>  A question was raised about insurance.  Several Deputies asked whether we had engaged directly with the insurance industry.  We have not engaged directly with the insurance industry.  As I have pointed out, the vehicles that will be licensed under this general scheme will not be motorised vehicles.  Therefore, they will not be subject to the normal motor insurance requirements.  It is expected in our conversation that the insurance requirements relating to these vehicles may well be public liability insurance requirements.  However, that is a step further down the road.  We are giving powers to the NTA to ensure that insurance is in place.  I imagine that in future when it becomes clear that this sector will be regulated, it will be inspected carefully.<\/p><p>At the moment, as Deputies have indicated, there are concerns that the sector is unregulated and it is not clear what kind of standards or vehicles are there but once we have this regime in place it will be quite clear that only vehicles that are roadworthy will be licensed.  The drivers will be Garda vetted and will be persons of good repute so we will be looking at an entirely different industry.<\/p><p> While I am aware that in recent days the NTA has issued reports on the costs of entry into the taxi industry, it is also the case that these are slower vehicles and that cyclists do not face the same kind of premiums and these vehicles are like bicycles.  I can only say that we expect that the industry will be much more regulated, that standards will be much higher, that they will be carefully enforced and that the insurance industry will take all of that into cognisance when it begins to set premiums.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018112800002#H04200","nonspeaker":"Ms Maev Nic Lochlainn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543411800,"counter":1016,"content":"<p>Will the NTA publish the draft regulations that it intends to bring in at the same time that this Bill will be debated in the D&aacute;il?
