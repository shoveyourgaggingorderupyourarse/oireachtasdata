Last January, a calf investment scheme was announced, initially for &euro;1.5 million.  It was expanded to &euro;4 million.  Some 2,500 farmers have applied for the scheme.  I welcome the opportunity to discuss the Minister's detailed report because I want to know how many farmers received a payment under the scheme.  It is a worthy scheme.  It gave the opportunity for on-farm investment to farmers when it came to calf rearing.  This has been a deficit in the system over the past few years.  We have seen a major expansion in dairy and beef herds, particularly on the dairy side.  A total of 1.5 million dairy cows will calve in January, February and March and investment in calf-rearing equipment on those farms will be welcomed.<\/p> <p>The one drawback of the scheme, which I have mentioned, is that it was announced on 7 January this year.   For a three-week period between 7 January and 28 January, farmers had an opportunity to apply for this scheme at the start of the calving season.  It was illogical in that sense.  It is akin to announcing the Christmas bonus on St. Stephen's Day.  If we are to have a new calf-rearing scheme, it needs to be announced in the next few days.  Announcing it in January is too late for the industry.  The preparatory work that goes into spring calving has begun.  Sheds are being cleaned out and washed and equipment is being readied.  From 7 January, 1.5 million dairy cows will calve, particularly in my part of the world.  That preparation is in full swing at the moment.  I hope we have a new scheme and that it is announced shortly in order that dairy farmers who need this equipment will have the opportunity to apply in a timely manner.  That has to be in the month of December, allowing an opportunity to have the equipment in place for when the calving season starts in full.<\/p> <p>This was a new scheme.  It is important to acknowledge it was the first of this nature.  Because it was a new scheme, we had to learn from the pitfalls.  There were positive aspects but the opportunity is there for a new scheme.  However, it has to be rolled out in December to give farmers the opportunity to apply and get the equipment in place so when they have the busy spring period, which is only eight weeks away, they can have the equipment to work through the calf rearing, which has been an important part of the animal welfare issues we have been trying to work through in the past few years.<\/p> <p>Covid is another issue.  There has been a reduction in labour in farms.  This scheme allows for a major reduction in labour.  The labour required in calf rearing is immense.  By investing in this equipment, labour is reduced.  Labour is not there at the moment anyway, but it reduces the opportunity for being caught offside regarding the availability of labour.  <\/p> <p>I welcome the Minister's report and look forward to responding to him.  Will we get a copy of the written statement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020111800002#B00300","speaker":"1666"},{"type":"speech","time":1605695400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to provide an update on the calf investment scheme for farmers.  I thank the Senator for raising this matter, which he has raised on many occasions before on the agriculture committee and which he has a strong commitment to developing.<\/p><p><font color=\"#212100\">  This on-farm investment scheme supporting investments in calf-related items opened to farmers last January.  The scheme was one of a series of measures put in place in advance of the spring calving season last year with a view to ensuring the best possible calf welfare outcomes.  The scheme is fully funded by the Exchequer.  A total of &euro;4 million was secured to fund the scheme, which was open for applications between 7 January and 28 January this year.  The minimum investment required for the scheme was &euro;1,000, while the maximum investment was &euro;7,500, with both figures excluding VAT.  A 40% grant aid applied to applications meeting the terms and conditions of the scheme.  This means the maximum grant payment per holding was &euro;3,000.  <\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#212100\">  I am pleased to report that there was a great deal of interest in the scheme with 2,414 applications received.  Approvals to proceed with the investments issued to 2,338 applicants.  Applications for payment could be submitted as soon as the investment was complete.  The final date for the submission of payment claims was extended to 30 September 2020 in light of Covid-19 restrictions.  More than 1,500 payment claims were submitted by this date, which is a substantial number.  Payments under the calf investment scheme commenced in August 2020 and are issuing on an ongoing basis as cases are cleared by the Department for payment.  Any applicant who has been contacted by the Department with a query regarding their payment claim is urged to respond as soon as possible to provide for the earliest possible issue of payment.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#212100\">  With regard to calf welfare, I recently attended a meeting of the calf stakeholder group, which is an ongoing group hosted by my Department, to hear the activities that various stakeholders are taking to support and ensure the welfare of calves born in Ireland each year.  It was good to hear the positive contribution of the various participants, including the farm organisations, and that Ireland's position with regard to calf health and welfare compares favourably internationally. <\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#212100\">  I was pleased to note the ongoing research initiative by the Department and Teagasc on the issue of the transport of calves and the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation-Teagasc projects on enhancing dairy\/beef integration efforts.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#212100\">  It is also important to point out that the Department continues to operate a large on-farm investment scheme, namely, the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS.  TAMS comprises a suite of seven measures and was launched under the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020, with a budget of &euro;395 million over the full period of that programme.  To date, expenditure under TAMS II has exceeded &euro;242 million. Under the young farmer capital investment scheme, additional support is available for young trained farmers and they are offered a higher rate of grant aid of 60%, compared to the standard rate of 40%.  Payments under the TAMS II scheme continue to issue on an ongoing basis.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#212100\">  I encourage all approved participants who have completed their investments to submit their payment claims.  I also urge any calf investment scheme applicants with any outstanding query from my Department to respond as soon as they are able to do so to allow for the early issue of payments under the scheme.<\/font><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020111800002#B00400","speaker":"1546"},{"type":"speech","time":1605695400,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive response.

Does he think it will be announced at an earlier date than this year?  Will there be any calf investment scheme?  The uptake of this scheme has been amazing.  The interest from the agricultural community in my part of the world is very much there.  I am worried that we will not have a scheme this year.  It is important that we do.

In 2019, the then Department of Education and Skills entered into an agreement with Limerick and Clare Education and Training Board to provide seven classrooms and ancillary accommodation at Gaelscoil Mh&iacute;ch&iacute;l C&iacute;os&oacute;g in Ennis at an estimated cost of &euro;3 million.  The project had been agreed, a design team was put in place and plans were drawn up, the normal procedures for the development of such a school.<\/p> <p>I express my appreciation for the work the team in Gaelscoil Mh&iacute;ch&iacute;l C&iacute;os&oacute;g in Ennis has achieved over the years.  In 2006, the school was the fastest growing Gaelscoil outside of Dublin with an enrolment of 190 pupils.  In 2020, a total of 481 pupils are on the roll.  It is a fast developing school and has played into the development of the Irish language in County Clare and the wider area.  That has been well recognised with further investment in the Gaelchol&aacute;iste in Ennis Community College.  The school has provided a seed for the rebirth of the Irish language in the area. <\/p> <p>Unfortunately, despite the fact that the plans have been drawn up and an agreement is in place, there is no provision for an adequate sports hall and assembly area.  That is a major deficit from the perspective of the Department.  It would make sense to include a sports hall and assembly area as part of the overall investment.  The Minister knows that the economy of scale achieved in doing this type of work when builders are on site far outstrips trying to do work at a later date.  A two-stream school needs those kinds of facilities.  There is inclement weather in the west of Ireland, similar to the weather in Dublin today.  That is a regular feature of life in the west and it would be inappropriate for children not to have the necessary facilities.  I appeal to the Minister, notwithstanding the protestations from the Department, to have another look at this project and try to provide the appropriate infrastructure to a school like this.  It educates our children and develops the Irish language.<\/p> <p>There is a wonderful team in the school, under the principal, Mr. D&oacute;nal &Oacute; hAinif&eacute;in, and a fantastic board of management which has put a lot of work into this project.  Let them get on with their job of running the school, rather than having to continuously deal with the Department and argue over whether a sports hall and general purpose area should be included in the project.  They have done so much to get the school to this point.  I appeal to the Minister of State to put in place, or add to the agreement that is already in place, provision for a sports hall.  It is needed and is important.  I hope the Minister of State can advance the case as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020111800002#C00200","speaker":"1655"},{"type":"speech","time":1605695400,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I congratulate Senator Dooley on his appointment to the Seanad and thank him for raising this matter.  It allows me to clarify the current position on Gaelscoil Mh&iacute;ch&iacute;l C&iacute;os&oacute;g which, as the Senator said, is a Catholic co-educational school with an emphasis on the Irish language.  I understand it has 471 pupils; the Senator said there are 481.  Either way, it has a large school population.<\/p> <p>I will outline some of the background to this matter.  In 2014, the school authority applied to my Department for capital funding under the additional school accommodation scheme.  The Department subsequently approved an extension to the existing school building comprising five mainstream classrooms and two special education tuition rooms, on which I commend the school.  Delivery of the project was devolved to Limerick and Clare Education and Training Board.<\/p> <p>At that time, the school authority was requested to manage its enrolment and not grow beyond the principal and 18 mainstream teachers in line with the approved accommodation.  Following the appointment of the design team to the project in 2015, a master plan for the project was submitted to the Department for consideration.  It outlined accommodation for a principal and 20 teachers and included a substantial new physical education, PE, and general purpose area, along with ancillary and administrative areas which were not approved as part of the project brief and would not qualify for funding under the terms of the additional school accommodation scheme.<\/p> <p>At a meeting with officials from the Department that year, the school authority signalled its intention to reject the devolved funding offer.  However, in 2018 a further meeting between officials and the school authority was held and agreement was reached to increase the scope of the project to include two additional mainstream classrooms, in effect raising the long-term projected staffing for the school to one principal and 20 teachers.  At that meeting, the matter of a new PE and general purpose area, to which the Senator referred, was also discussed. <\/p> <p>My officials once again informed the school authority that the provision of a PE hall did not form part of the additional school accommodation scheme and could not be considered for inclusion in the accommodation brief for the proposed extension.  The school authority was advised at that meeting that it was open to it to apply for this accommodation under the major capital programme to be considered in future years.  The approved building project is, as the Senator knows, currently in the early stage of the architectural design process.<\/p> <p>A stage 1 submission was approved by the Department in April 2020.  The school authority had again requested that the brief be amended to include a sports hall and had submitted drawings showing a sports hall included.  The position of the Department, from my instructions, remains unchanged and it is not possible to fund a PE hall or general purpose room under the additional school accommodation scheme. <\/p> <p>As the Senator will be aware, capital planning and budgeting are undertaken on a multi-annual basis.  Under Project Ireland 2040, the education sector will receive approximately &euro;12 billion between 2018 and 2027.  This includes &euro;8.8 billion for the school sector and &euro;2.2 billion for higher education infrastructure.  The specific allocations in each area are closely monitored and may be adjusted from year to year to take account of project progress and other factors.  Since 2018, in excess of &euro;1.2 billion has been invested in capital infrastructure under the school building programme.  A further &euro;725 million has been allocated for investment in 2020.<\/p> <p>As the Senator knows, the Department has a large pipeline of projects for delivery under the school building programme.  The main elements of the pipeline currently include 372 large-scale projects and approximately 800 projects for delivery under the Department's additional school accommodation scheme, which includes the additional accommodation project for Gaelscoil Mh&iacute;ch&iacute;l C&iacute;os&oacute;g.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020111800002#C00300","speaker":"1472"},{"type":"speech","time":1605695400,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her response.  The effort made by the board and principal of the school at the time to get the development that was needed was substantial.  The school was working out of temporary accommodation.  The only option available to the school was the additional school accommodation scheme, which is what the authority was told.  Regardless of what scheme the project fell under, there will be 20 teachers, associated classes and a two-stream school when the structure has been completed.<\/p> <p>I know full well what goes on in the Department from having dealt with this issue year after year in respect of other schools.  It has a rigid silo approach.  That will have to be dismantled a little bit.  I know the Minister of State is committed to that kind of work.  We will have to tear down some of the silos.  Schools have been told that they can only get X if they are in scheme Y.  If the project proceeds, there will be 20 teachers and 16 mainstream classes, but no sports hall.

We are all aware that the number of people diagnosed with autism every year is on the increase in this country.  We have done quite well in recent years with regard to the autism spectrum disorder, ASD, units in the primary school sector.  I tabled my Commencement matter because we are not doing so well at secondary school level.  I want to find out from the Minister of State whether there are specific plans in place to build more ASD units in County Clare and all over the country.  All across the country there is only one place for every three pupils who need a secondary school ASD unit.  The children who have come from ASD units at primary school have grown accustomed to the structure and routine with great results.  Now we have parents who supported each other all the way as their children spent eight years in primary school now almost having to compete with each other for the one place that is available in the secondary school system.  I would like to know what will remedy the situation.<\/p> <p>For some reason, three quarter of the ASD units are attached to DEIS schools.  Not in any scientific paper anywhere ever has it been shown that there is a socio-economic link with having autism.  Why have units mainly been attached to DEIS schools?  Why is it not allowed to attach ASD units to private schools that are funded by the State and that taxpayers help subsidise?<\/p> <p>Can the Minister of State specifically tell me what will be done in the immediate and short term to increase the number of ASD units in secondary schools in County Clare?  Why have 75% of all ASD units been attached to DEIS schools?  That seems completely wrong.  We want equity in education and we want the same choices for everybody so ASD units should be attached to all types of schools.

May I also take the opportunity to congratulate her on her election to the Seanad?<\/p> <p>Enabling children with special educational needs to receive an education appropriate to their needs is a priority for this Government and for me, as the first dedicated Minister with responsibility for this area.  Next year, over 20% of the total education budget or &euro;2 billion will be invested in supporting children with special educational needs.  As a result, the numbers of special education teachers, special needs assistants, SNAs, and special class and school places are at unprecedented levels.  As many as 197 new special classes have been established nationally for the 2020-21 school year.  Of these, approximately 189 will be new ASD special classes with 64 of these in post-primary schools.  Budget 2021 provided for an additional 235 special class teachers in 2021.  We hope this investment will provide 1,200 additional special class places.<\/p> <p>My Department's policy is that all children with special educational needs, including those with autism, can have access to an education appropriate to their needs and preferably in school settings through the primary and post-primary school network.  This policy has been informed by published research, including the Report of the Task Force on Autism, entitled An Evaluation of Educational Provision for Children with Autistic Spectrum Disorders 2006, and the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, policy advice outlined in Supporting Students with Autism Spectrum Disorder in Schools.  This policy ensures that the majority of children with SEN attend mainstream classes with their peers.  Such placements facilitate access to individualised education programmes that may draw from a range of appropriate educational interventions.    These are delivered by fully qualified teachers, with the support of SNAs, special education teachers and the appropriate school curriculum.<\/p> <p>Some students may find it difficult to manage full-time placement in a mainstream setting.  For these students, placement in a special class or special school setting, where lower pupil-teacher ratios apply and other supports are available, may be appropriate.<\/p> <p>The National Council for Special Education is responsible for planning and co-ordinating local education provision and school placements for children with SEN.  The NCSE has advised that there are currently nine special classes that support students with autism in post-primary schools in County Clare.  One of these classes is an additional one for the 2020-21 school year.<\/p> <p>The NCSE recognises that there is a requirement for additional special class provision at post-primary level, as mentioned by the Senator, in Shannon and Ennis over the next few years.  This is based on local information regarding projected demand for future specialist places for students with autism.  It is open to any school to make an application to the NCSE to open a special class, which will be approved where it is considered that there is a sustainable demand into the future.  The active collaboration of school communities is vital to the effective inclusion of students with special educational needs.

It is good to see her back here again and I thank her for all of her work on the areas within her brief.  I am aware that the Seanad recently discussed day care services for persons with disabilities.  My Commencement matter has a specific focus in asking the Minister of State to outline when community social day care facilities for older persons and respite facilities for older persons and their families are expected to reopen.  It is a more specific issue.<\/p><p>To give some context, we know that many families are struggling to cope because community day care facilities for older people have remained closed.  Day care centres are used by approximately 14,200 people.  Their closure means many carers are lacking a crucial support mechanism that enables them to take respite breaks.  Sage Advocacy, a support and advocacy service for vulnerable and older adults that has been in communication with me, has been undertaking extensive research into a phenomenon known as carer burnout.  The Minister of State will be well aware that this is seriously affecting those carers for whom services have not resumed.  We await publication of the research findings but we are well aware of the issue.  <\/p><p>Many people have contacted us because they are exhausted.  Yesterday, in an article in <i>The Irish Times, <\/i>Professor Suzanne Cahill reported that 70% of spouse carers for people with dementia had at least two chronic health problems, one third had clinical depression and most had visited a health service professional in the previous month.  This is clearly a wider public health issue as well as an issue of empathy, compassion and rights for older persons.  Many facilities remain closed, meaning many older people may become increasingly socially isolated from their peer group and others.  The lack of social interaction will have a negative effect on their mental and physical health and the health of their carers.  <\/p><p>While I am conscious that we have had extensive discussion of this issue in the Oireachtas, without a timeframe there is a lack of certainty.  I am aware that the HSE is undertaking risk assessments in respect of local services, which is very welcome, and that huge efforts are being made by those working in this area to ensure that services will be provided.  However, the Government&rsquo;s position remains that some services may not be suitable for reopening.  Again, I understand that with current Covid-19 restrictions, the usual dynamic of social interaction has changed.  Some facilities may simply not be suitable.  The positive news on vaccines gives us hope that services will return to normal in due course.  For many people and their families, an issue arises due to the absence of a timeframe and clarity on when all services will be able to reopen.  The Minister of State, in answer to a parliamentary question on this matter last month, stated she would ask the HSE to continue to assess the risks and benefits of reopening and would explore alternative methods of service delivery for older people.  Has she received an update on this?  What arrangements will be made for those for whom reopening is simply not a viable possibility in the short term?  <\/p><p>We have found ways to ensure our childcare facilities, schools, universities and colleges could reopen, at least in some form, within the parameters set out to protect public health.  We are discussing plans for reopening the hospitality sector, including restaurants, as well as other sectors of society.  This is clearly a vitally important part of a broader discussion around quality of life, especially as we have seen other healthcare facilities opening.  Very important issues around the provision of healthcare for people in a non-Covid-19 environment are being recognised.  I ask that the reopening of all day care services for older people be prioritised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020111800002#E00400","speaker":"1631"},{"type":"speech","time":1605695400,"counter":31,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an gCathaoirleach Gn&iacute;omhach and I congratulate her on taking the Chair.  I also thank Senator Bacik for the constructive way in which she always raises these particular issues as they are very close to all of our hearts.  I have just spent the last hour on a webinar with Irish Rural Link and a significant part of the conversation was spent discussing care of the elderly, meals on wheels, day care centres and active retirement groups which are hoping to restart.  This is, therefore, a very timely Commencement matter.<\/p> <p>As we are all aware, community services such as day care and respite play an important role in enabling older people to continue living in their communities and maintain their social connections.  However, the introduction of physical distancing, isolation and restricted contact with loved ones has changed the usual dynamic of social interaction. <\/p> <p>The HSE is working closely with providers and community staff to identify where service is most required and has been undertaking risk assessments of local services.  This is to ensure, insofar as possible, that day care and respite services can resume in the context of Covid-19, having regard for public health advice.  Services will resume when it is safe and all infection prevention and control measures and the requirements of physical distancing can be maintained to protect service users and staff and prevent any further spread of the virus.  Unfortunately, I am not in a position to give a definitive timeline.  When I was appointed to this role on 1 July our aim was to open these services in September and that is what we were working towards.  The risk assessments were being undertaken in every community healthcare organisation, CHO.  I was very hopeful at the time that we would be able to open them, even at a restricted level.  Unfortunately, as we all know, the virus knows no boundaries and with the escalation again in the figures from the end of September into October, it has not been possible to do so.<\/p> <p>Some day centres may not be suitable for reopening due to the constraints of their physical environment.  It will be necessary to continue or expand alternative service delivery models.  Some of the issues identified by the HSE include the sharing of facilities with other groups or clients and transportation of clients to day care centres where family members cannot assist.  This has proven to be hugely problematic where some day care centres use small minibuses to move perhaps ten or 12 service users.  The availability of isolation areas should a client or a member of staff become unwell is also an issue that has been identified.<\/p> <p>The HSE has established a focus group to ensure day care centres continue to be prioritised and to develop a plan to assist service providers in having a suite of options available for the provision of day care and supports.  This plan will be developed in line with the current Covid-19 roadmap. <\/p> <p>Additional or new home support packages are being put in place for the most vulnerable clients, with the focus on both the carers and the persons who attend the day care services.  A model of day care in the home is being finalised.  Focused on individuals with dementia especially, this model is being reviewed with a view to transferring it to regular day care centres.  The model will continue to develop even when day care centres reopen and will be based on the needs assessment and benefits for client and carers. <\/p> <p>At present, the HSE is only allocating respite provision to clients most at risk of carer breakdown or an inappropriate admission to hospital.  As the Senator will be aware, the whole premise of the winter plan is to try to keep older people at home as much as possible and avoid having to transfer them to acute hospitals.  We are very conscious of those who are most at risk of inappropriate admission and respite occurs in such circumstances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020111800002#E00500","speaker":"1614"},{"type":"speech","time":1605695400,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

It is still very disappointing and frustrating for persons in need of these services and their families not to have any sense of a timeline.  It gives hope to hear that a focus group has been established in the HSE to ensure services are being prioritised.

All three Government parties gave commitments in their manifestos to carrying out a feasibility study of metro south west.  This was given on the back of considerable campaigning by the Metro South West group.  As the Minister of State might imagine, the campaign group was delighted when it heard that the study was going ahead but when it sought the terms of reference, it found that the study was confined to a stand-alone metro to Knocklyon.  The group was informed by officials in the Department of Transport that it refers to a stand-alone line to the city rather than being a continuation of the MetroLink to south-west Dublin.  It makes no reference to that preferred option of continuation and does not take into account Firhouse as an area of growing population.  The lack of this continuation of the link was the very basis on which the campaign over recent years was mounted.  There was a lack of consultation with the group, which is a matter of regret because taxpayers' money is now being spent on a feasibility study where there is a perception that it has been designed to fail.<\/p> <p>The group that is campaigning is not a fly-by-night group; it represents 35 residents' associations in that south-west triangle between the two Luas lines.  They have gone to considerable effort to demonstrate that buses alone cannot deliver sufficient capacity to fulfil the public transport needs in south-west Dublin.  The contrast between south-west and south-east Dublin is quite stark.  South-east Dublin has the DART, the Luas and the long-established high-quality bus corridor along the Stillorgan Road, whereas south-west Dublin connectivity is based on buses alone.  A deep analysis has gone into BusConnects, taking it at its height with all that it proposes.  There still will be only an additional three buses and an additional capacity of 240 seats and passengers for that huge area of population and an even larger projected population.  Developers are actively building houses, South Dublin County Council is developing land and 480 ha has been zoned for residential development.  The bus capacity does not meet the population need, as it stands, let alone the future capacity.  It is crucial, therefore, that buses will not be the only answer.  We needed another solution and, as a result, an awful lot of work went into the south-west metro proposals, with an earnest analysis of the population and public transport capacity.  It is deeply disappointing that the terms of reference of the feasibility study, as they stand, are so incredibly narrow.<\/p> <p>The feasibility study should stand on a number of pillars.  First, it should be independent and objective but, with due respect, the National Transport Authority, NTA, has stated that buses alone will meet the need.  It has rejected the Metro South West group's proposals several times based on a significantly outdated study that has no relevance to the proposal as put forward by this campaigning group.  It is not independent and does not seem objective, and so prescribing the terms of reference in this instance, I venture to say, is not appropriate on its part.  The designation of the terminus for the continuation of the MetroLink should be left open.  Prescribing it as Knocklyon greatly limits its capacity and its scope for being a really productive feasibility study.  Lastly, it should be timely and co-ordinated so that the outcome of the feasibility study is in line with the rail order next year, and independent consultants need to be involved.  The cost-benefit analysis of extending the MetroLink to south-west Dublin and using the boring machine there stands on its merits and makes sense.<\/p> <p>I urge the Minister of State to have meaningful discussions with the campaign group and to include its views in the terms of reference.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020111800002#F00400","speaker":"1682"},{"type":"speech","time":1605695400,"counter":37,"content":"<p>I thank the House for inviting me to speak here for the first time.  I am impressed by the passion and coherence of the question the Senator put forward.  The Government is committed to a fundamental change in the nature of transport in Ireland.  We believe that to deliver on this commitment, we need a whole-of-system perspective for all modes of transport, whether active travel, bus or rail.  That means developing evidence-based multimodal transport strategies that will guide development over the medium and long terms, and transport strategies that are integrated with land use plans and enable local authorities to locate houses, jobs and other demand factors along high-capacity transport corridors.  This is the type of framework that many of our EU and international peers use and it is the one that can deliver fundamental change.<\/p> <p>In Ireland, we are beginning to see the emergence of that type of framework.  In the greater Dublin area, there is a statutory 20-year transport strategy, developed by the NTA and approved by the Minister for Transport.  It is a transport strategy that covers all modes and all counties in the greater Dublin area, namely, Dublin, Meath, Kildare and Wicklow.  It must be reflected in all land use plans and is subject to extensive and statutory consultation during its development.  The current strategy was published in 2016 and referred to two metro lines, effectively a metro north and a metro south.  Those projects were initially considered for development as one project known as MetroLink but, in response to issues raised during the non-statutory consultation process, the preferred route for MetroLink is now proposed to link the estuary in north County Dublin with Charlemont on the Grand Canal and future-proof for a later connection to the Luas green line.  That project will be taken forward for Government approval next year and, if approved, will be submitted to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.<\/p> <p>That does not mean we are not open to new ideas or the potential for other metro options.  The NTA is preparing to launch a review of the transport strategy to ensure that it is kept up to date and informed by latest developments.  This need to review and refresh is both common sense and a requirement of the legislation, which states that the strategy must be reviewed by the NTA every six years.  As part of that review, the NTA will consider the potential for future metro options in the greater Dublin area, including the potential for one in the south west of the city.  The first step in considering that potential is to conduct a feasibility study, a process the NTA is seeking to start.  The study will consider whether a metro-type solution should be pursued further for this part of the city.  The study area will be similar to that considered in the original transport strategy and will examine the south-west corridor in general.  This is just one analysis being conducted as part of the NTA's broader review of the transport strategy.  The intention is that all these various strands of analysis will be published by the NTA next year as part of the public consultation on the review of the strategy.  Everyone will then have an opportunity to consider the information and to put forward their views on how the revised transport strategy should look.  <\/p> <p>The transport strategy is a very important framework for the future development of transport infrastructure in the greater Dublin area and I expect that many people will have interesting ideas on what any revised strategy should contain.  I look forward to hearing the Senator's views on the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020111800002#F00500","speaker":"1479"},{"type":"speech","time":1605695400,"counter":38,"content":"<p>I note and fully respect the openness to modality changes for our entire population.

For example, from 2017 to 2020, Monaghan County Council awarded 22 State contracts of which ten were awarded to contractors outside the State.  Upon further examination of the period 2019 to 2020, 13 contracts were awarded and eight of those were awarded to contractors outside the State.  The total value of those eight contracts was &euro;23,000,700.  That is a substantial amount of money and a major potential loss to the local economy.  <\/p> <p>It is frustrating for a local contractor who tenders for such contracts to see businesses lose out and to see the business going outside the State.  It is also frustrating when those same local contractors employ local people.  Those same local contractors buy their materials from local suppliers and pay rates and taxes in this State.  We all understand the State tendering process.  However, local people in County Monaghan are asking questions about a tendering process that more often than not results in contracts being awarded to firms outside the State as opposed to contractors inside the State.<\/p> <p>Many people are asking questions about the State tendering process that consistently results in local firms losing out.  They seek some form of investigation into the awarding of substantial State contracts.  All the contracts I mentioned are in excess of &euro;1 million.  We seek clarity that the process the State is currently undertaking is fair to everyone, that it is a level playing field and that there are no hidden areas that some people can take advantage of, especially from outside the State as opposed to contractors inside the State.  I would like the State to carry out inspections before a contract is awarded, during the contract and at the end of the contract to ensure all areas of employment law and other areas are fully compliant and above board.  Local contractors would like, where possible, to get work within their own county.  It is extremely frustrating for them to see contracts being awarded to firms outside the State whose employees have to travel to the county in the first instance before they even start work and who also have that added expense.<\/p> <p>I look forward to hearing the Minister of State's comments.

The EU treaty principles of equal treatment and non-discrimination, transparency, mutual recognition, proportionality, free movement of goods and services and the right of establishment must be observed on all tenders.  Public procurement procedures require all applicants to meet the standards set out in the tender documentation when applying for public contracts.  The assessment of a tenderer's financial and economic standing, and professional and technical capacity is a key part of the procurement process.  This is because the contracting authority must be satisfied that a tenderer has the necessary capacity to carry out a contract if awarded it.<\/p> <p>Establishing the appropriate certifiable criteria that are relevant and appropriate to a particular contract is a matter for the contracting authority concerned.  In this case it would be Monaghan County Council.  This is because the contracting authority is in the best position to gauge the criteria that are appropriate to the needs of a proposed contract to ensure value for money and minimise risk to the Exchequer.  The qualification criteria that are required by the contracting authority should be proportionate to the subject matter of the contract.  Verification of compliance with the non-exclusionary grounds for selection is sought before the awarding of any contract and to ensure they meet the award criteria, whether they are inside or outside the State.  A contracting authority should also ensure it has appropriate contract management mechanisms in place post award to ensure compliance by the contractor of its obligations under the contract.  <\/p> <p>The Office of Government Procurement, OGP, supports compliance by providing procurement solutions, advice, guidance and systems for public bodies promoting good practice and proactive engagement with our sourcing partners in health education, defence and local government sectors through the procurement executive.  Furthermore, the OGP&rsquo;s key account managers are in regular contact with the procurement officers in Departments and public bodies to help, support and remind them of their obligations regarding public procurement.  It should be noted that it is the responsibility of each contracting authority to ensure it adheres to the policy framework and associated guidelines which have been developed to facilitate compliance with the public procurement rules.  Public procurement practices are subject to audit and scrutiny under the Comptroller and Auditor General and Local Government Reform Acts.<\/p> <p>There is a section in our programme for Government about procurement and several references to it.  We refer to the fact we want to see green public procurement brought in and social considerations taken into account when bids are awarded.  We are working on that and that must be done within three years, which is our commitment in the programme for Government.  A local supplier may be bidding against an organisation on the other side of the world and that distant company would have a much larger carbon footprint in the delivery of its service and labour practices, and the amount of money it would be investing in employment and training may be much lower than is being done in the local firm.  If we can find a mechanism to operate in that respect, that is certainly one of my objectives in this Ministry.<\/p> <p>The Deputy asked about Brexit.  The year 2020 has been the year of the pandemic and 2021 looks like it will be the year of Brexit.  We do not know yet whether we will have a deal.

The ruling stated that the UK had failed to properly implement EU law, specifically certain parts of two EU health and safety directives which had not been transposed correctly.  This meant that some self-employed workers did not enjoy the same legal protections as employees.  As Members will know, the gig economy is characterised predominantly by workers with short-term or freelance contracts.  Those workers are the van drivers, takeaway delivery drivers and couriers, all individuals whom I consider to be front-line workers.  They are people who have worked right through this pandemic and have been on pretty much every doorstep in this country in recent months.  They have worked continuously and are at a higher risk of contracting the virus than employees in some sectors.<\/p> <p>In the specific case to which I refer, the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain, IWGB, sought a judicial review of the implementation of the relevant EU directives and the gap in protection for those it represents.  Concerns were raised about the provision of personal protective equipment, PPE, to these workers and it was found that they should enjoy the same protections as other workers, should have access to PPE and should, if they feel unwell, be allowed to stay home from work.  In his ruling, Mr. Justice Chamberlain stated that the issues were of potentially wider significance and found that the IWGB was correct to say that the term \"worker\" includes those working in the gig economy.<\/p> <p>This could be of significance in Ireland since we also have many workers who are employed on those types of contracts.  These people work for Deliveroo, Just Eat and DPD and other couriers and have been on every road and every estate in the country this year.  I ask that the Leader bring the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment before the House to the House to provide an update on the Department's view on that ruling and whether there may be significant implications for Ireland.  Are gig economy workers properly protected and is there a requirement under those EU directives for the provision of PPE to those workers in this country?<\/p> <p>I raise a second issue which came before the House yesterday and which was broadly discussed across all media.  I refer to the EU budget and the provision of Brexit and Covid recovery supports .  Members will be aware that Poland and Hungary have vetoed the EU budget because they are seeking concessions in respect of abdicating elements of the rule of law, significant human rights infringements and limitations on free speech within their jurisdictions.  This has the potential to delay significant amounts of money coming to Ireland to protect our economy, assist the recovery from Covid and protect against the impact of Brexit on 1 January.  I ask that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, come before the House to discuss the implications of the actions of Hungary and Poland, including how they might affect Ireland in the context of accessing the funds to which I refer.  I ask that the Minister update the House on what is happening at EU level regarding how it intends to deal with this matter.  My view is that this behaviour needs to be stamped out.  Poland and Hungary cannot be allowed to get away with what they have done and there need to be significant consequences for those member states trying to impede the recovery of the EU from Covid.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020111800002#K00200","speaker":"1642"},{"type":"speech","time":1605695400,"counter":51,"content":"<p>I wish to move an amendment to the Order of Business to delete the motion relating to the sixth report of the Seanad Committee on Procedure and Privileges on Standing Order 45, which is scheduled to be considered without debate.

Institutions will argue that they do not have the budgets to pay all of their staff, hence the use of these contracts and postgraduate students for unpaid tutorial or lecturing work.  This is no way to treat staff.<\/p><p>Over the summer, postgraduate students in NUI Galway were expected to teach as part of their postgraduate studies with no remuneration.  This has been a widespread practice for a long time, but it is the first time it has been so blatant.  It is no coincidence that in Ireland vocational roles are treated so poorly.  Teaching and healthcare staff are affected.  I mention again the plight of our student nurses and midwives who are on the front line and are still unpaid.  I request, via the Leader, that the Ministers for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science come to the House for statements on employment practices in the higher education sector.<\/p><p>This is stand up awareness week, which is co-ordinated by BeLonGTo, an organisation providing a stupendous service for LGBT youth.

However, he suggested a temporary loosening of the qualifications required to work in childcare and I want to say this is not a solution.  The reason we have a crisis in childcare is because the pay and conditions of childcare are so appalling.  The reason we have a crisis in childcare is because thousands of childcare workers have to sign on each summer.  The reason we have a crisis in childcare is because the average rate of pay is just &euro;11.46.  The reason we have a crisis in childcare is because 79% of childcare workers have no recourse to a sick pay scheme.<\/p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in put forward very concrete solutions in this regard and suggestions for the budget to ring-fence &euro;30 million to ensure every childcare worker gets a living wage, as was asked for by the SIPTU trade union that has organised thousands of them.

I have raised this issue in the Chamber for five years in a row and, once again, the Government of the day ignored those requests and did nothing for childcare workers.<\/p><p>I appeal to everyone in the Chamber because we all know people working in childcare and they are voting with their feet.  There is a huge issue in terms of people leaving the sector because they cannot afford to earn a living in it.  We speak about essential workers.  These are essential workers.  There were 19 outbreaks of Covid in one week in October in childcare services but these workers are not required to wear a face mask.  It is all well and good to applaud these essential workers but the fact of the matter is that for the past six years nothing has been done for them.

One of the calls to me involved a spouse who believed he was entitled to know what was happening to his wife in hospital and the other was from a sister about her dependent sibling in hospital.  In both cases, the hospitals were very reasonably following the instructions of the patient as to who had a right to be informed.  To be fair, they had very impressive systems of allowing information to come to them so they could ensure that in making the decision of who will get the information the medical team was fully informed.

Fifty deaths of rough sleepers and people in emergency accommodation have been reported in Dublin alone, and we are yet to reach the rough winter months.  Increases in deaths among people known to homeless services have been reported in Cork and Galway as well.  In January, the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, DRHE, stated that there had been 34 such deaths in 2019.  On \"Morning Ireland\" yesterday, the DRHE revised that figure upwards to 49.  We undoubtedly have a growing problem.  These tragic and unnecessary deaths should not be happening and we need to do more to prevent them.<\/p> <p>I welcome the Government's commissioning of a report, but it needs to act.  We must see an end to dormitory-style accommodation.  There is no place for it in this day and age.  We must also see an increase in mental health and addiction supports for those experiencing homelessness.  Covid has placed a significant strain on the mental health of many on this island, in particular the most vulnerable people living on our streets.  We need a dramatic increase in tenancies under the Housing First policy in order to get people out of emergency accommodation.  This model works and there is no reason it cannot be rolled out across the country.  We need to introduce adult safeguarding reviews to ensure that, when someone dies, we fully understand the reasons for the death and address the problems in order to prevent it from happening to someone else.<\/p> <p>People experiencing homelessness are among the most vulnerable in our society.

This is an area of Dublin near which I used to live.  There was a plan to have 253 social homes, 172 affordable homes, 214 cost rental homes and 214 private homes on the relevant site.  Councillors put a stop to that entire development by a vote of 48 to 14.  The result is that not a single unit will be built on the site for at least eight years.  The supposed reason for the decision is that instead of allowing a developer-led project with a 50-50 split between private sites and social and affordable houses, councillors want the council to develop the site to provide 100% social and affordable housing.  That seems to me to be a case of cutting off one's nose to spite one's face.  In other words, petty ideological reasons now mean that instead of having 425 social and affordable homes, there will be none in that development.

All we were trying to do was to allow more Members the opportunity to speak and for leaders not to have 12 minutes but to give everybody here the chance to offer their opinions and views during Private Members' business.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Regina Doherty:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As I said, it can certainly go back to the CPP.  I will withdraw No. 2.<\/p><p>On the number of debates that have been requested this morning.  I agree with Senator Chambers regarding sthe directive that was issued a few days ago.  We have spent the past eight months genuinely looking at elements of our society that have contributed greatly to the functioning of it, whether they are communities, businesses, public services, that in many of our day-to-day dealings, we probably heretofore took for granted.  One could probably delve even further to look at some of those who are perhaps not treated as well as they should be by businesses.  Based on my own experience, there are probably tens of thousands of people working in the gig economy, and I will certainly ask for a debate on that ruling to make sure that they are looked after and that the reflective rule of law on that EU directive is transposed.<\/p><p>There is also a need for a debate on the reaction yesterday of our Hungarian and Polish colleagues to the multiannual financial framework funding.  It is not, and should never be, good enough or accepted by the other 25 member states that two member states that have a questionable way of observing the rule of law in the EU, which we all accept, assert that it does not stand in their countries.  We certainly need a debate on that issue.<\/p><p>I will certainly make a request for a debate on higher education funding.  I absolutely agree with Senator O'Loughlin that the announcements by the Department of Education yesterday that every and any new school will have ASD units and individual ASD teams is welcome.  Indeed, two colleagues raised the much-needed school buildings in Duleek and Ballinasloe.  There is not a community that we all live in or represent that does not have children with special needs.  What absolutely should be made a rule of law today is that every school in the country should be compelled, as was the case in south Dublin last year, by directive of the Department of Education, to have ASD units, however small, and reflect on the needs of the children that they serve.<\/p><p>The last thing I will bring up is our much loved Dublin Zoo.  One can see from the representations that were made here this morning how valuable an institution it really is.  I do not know if Members heard the director on radio this morning, but one would have to commend the zoo for having the reserves that it had accumulated and that allowed it to stay open for the past number of months without any income and that will allow it to survive until early next spring.  However, I believe it is incumbent on the Government to look after the zoo, Fota Wildlife Park and other institutions that are much loved by families.  This is the case whether they have young children or not; my own children are no longer small, but we still love going to the zoo.  It is incumbent on us to look after the zoo.  On behalf of all Members, I will write to the Taoiseach today to ask him to make sure that the funding is looked after.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020111800002#P01600","speaker":"1653","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605695400,"counter":92,"content":"<p>What about my point?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020111800002#Q00200","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speech","time":1605695400,"counter":93,"content":"<p>I will certainly ask.

He indicated that he was going to establish a group which over an eight-month period would come forward with proposals on how, in turn, the proposals of the Manning report would be implemented.<\/p><p>Subsequent to that, between February and June of that year, the group was established and its terms of reference were set out by a Government decision.  The group met and I was elected as its chairman.  The group met over a period from June to December 2018 when it completed and presented its work to the Taoiseach.  The group had the advantage that the Department of the Taoiseach paid for the retention of a skilled parliamentary draughtsman to devise a Bill that would be appended to the report.  The group itself met on many occasions, deliberated on how it intended to craft a report, and received evidence about the practicality of various ways of implementing the Manning report.<\/p><p>The report was sent by me, as chairperson, to the Taoiseach in December 2018 and in early 2019 I noted that the Taoiseach had made somewhat dismissive remarks about the report in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, in the Chamber in which we are now.  I asked to see him on this issue and he told me, much to my surprise and disappointment, that he himself was an abolitionist during the referendum and that he had no particular interest in progressing the matter any further.  This contrasted greatly with the impression that he had given the Seanad the previous February.  <\/p><p>Over 12 months the situation had changed dramatically and we were then running into a general election and suddenly all interest in the Bill disappeared.  I was told that the Government had no intention of introducing the Bill in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, as I had recommended in my covering letter and in addition to that, I was told that it could be introduced by any private Member but the Government in those circumstances would allow a free vote and it was highly unlikely to go anywhere.<\/p><p>That set of circumstances smacks to me of utter cynicism.  The Manning report was put in place following the rejection by the people of a proposal to abolish this House and this report was published and it became part of the programme for Government for the 2016 to 2020 Administration to implement it.  Yet by early 2019 that commitment was completely thrown aside and all interest in implementing the Manning report seemed to have evaporated in a miraculous way.  <\/p><p>My own view is that this was breathtaking political cynicism because many Members participated in the Manning report implementation group, Members who are here in this House and others, in good faith believing that they were finally taking the steps without constitutional change, to give the people of Ireland a very substantial say in who sat in this Chamber.  That is what was proposed, is what the Government had committed itself to doing and is what was immediately taken off the agenda and effectively thrown into the political wastepaper basket.  <\/p><p>We now come to the point where the question of Seanad reform simply will not go away.  I want to welcome the Minister of State with responsibility for electoral reform here and I have spoken to both him and to the Minister, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, about this matter.  I fully empathise with the position of the Minister of State who has indicated that his party wanted to have Seanad reform as part of the programme for Government but that the other two parties showed very little interest in having it there.  In fairness, that is the truth of the situation.  The Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Brien, as I understand it hopes to have somebody on the Government benches move an amendment to the motion for a Second Reading of this Bill today to postpone the Second Reading until 31 December 2021 in order that further consideration to the implementation of the Bill can be given by the section of the Department over which the Minister of State has responsibility.  The effect of that amendment, if it were carried, would be to put into the record of this House that the Bill would be deemed to be passed on 31 December 2021 and it would fall then to be considered whether it or other legislative proposals which the Department had come up with in the meantime would be progressed thereafter to Committee Stage etc.  <\/p><p>As far as I am concerned, Senator Malcolm Byrne introduced legislation recently designed to implement the result of the referendum and to spread the university seats more equitably across institutions of higher education.  The result of that Bill if adopted in isolation would be that perhaps 800,000, or perhaps with the passage of time 1 million or more people, would elect 10% of the Members of this House provided that those people were graduates of higher education.  The remainder of the electorate, which would probably be 2 to 3 million other people - though a declining fraction as higher education is more generally available -  would have no direct say and that 1,200 people, being representatives in local government and the Oireachtas would elect or select the remaining 90% of this House.  <\/p><p>The case for reform is overwhelming.  I remind the House that the former Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, in order to try to induce the people to accept the referendum for the abolition of this House informed the people prior to the referendum vote that if his proposal to abolish this House was rejected he would not reform this House.  That was also a very cynical move.  He effectively was saying that he would leave it as undemocratic as it was so that the people were not to think that they would get a better Seanad, but he changed his mind when he got what he described as a wallop at the hands of the electorate in his attempts to wreck this House and the Constitution with it.<\/p><p>I will not talk about recent controversies but one of the functions of this House is to ensure that certain powers in respect of the Judiciary are not abused by a majority in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and we have our own separate function in that respect.  <\/p><p>We have other functions.  This House has a veto on any plans to implement any measure at European level to deploy the passerelle clause, in other words, to give up unanimity requirements.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michael McDowell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=719\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This House, under the Constitution, has significant functions apart from its legislative scrutiny function.<\/p><p>I will continue in the short time provided for in the Standing Orders of this House in the form in which they still are.  I would have had to sit down about three minutes ago if a certain thing had happened this morning.  This Bill was crafted in good faith by a collective effort of Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  It was modular in form.  It acknowledges that change will not happen in a big bang.  It was gradual in form, in that it provided for a phased introduction of these reforms.  It was a genuine, bona fide effort to finally give this House a broader base with regard to the people who select who is here.  It was also designed, as the Manning report attempted, to retain a function for representatives in local government to have an input into the composition of Seanad &Eacute;ireann and thereby the Oireachtas.  It is a fair Bill.  It is expertly drafted.  It is capable of being implemented.  It may cost money but it is worth doing.<\/p><p>Now is not the time for cynicism or further delay.  The Minister of State has told me privately, and said that I was at liberty to say this, that he wants to go ahead with these reforms.  This is the occasion on which to do it.  I wish that we would make faster progress than the amendment, which is likely to be tabled by the Government in respect of the Second Reading indicates.  I am taking the Minister of State at his word that he is genuine and bona fide committed to implementing the reform of the Seanad in the way that he has indicated in private to me.  I thank him for those assurances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020111800002#T00100","speaker":"1669","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605695400,"counter":113,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I welcome the opportunity to debate Seanad reform for the second time in as many weeks.  In 2013, when I was not a Member of this House and never dreamt that I would be, I did everything that I could during the referendum campaign to ensure that this House would survive.  When I was elected to this House, I was deeply honoured, and I am as honoured and as privileged today as I was in 2014 when I came in here.  Many of my colleagues have said to me that in my support for this Bill, I am committing political suicide.  If this is what I have to commit political suicide for, I will gladly go to my political grave, because this House desperately needs reform.<\/p> <p>I have been told that no county councillor will ever support me again for supporting this Bill.  I believe our county councillors are far more discerning than some people in this House give them credit for.  In 2015, I addressed a meeting of county councillors from all over Ireland on the issue of their pay, terms and conditions.  They were told at that meeting that it was bad that this new Independent Senator had brought their pay into the public domain, and that people were working in the background on it and would sort that out for them.  It is 2020 now and it was not sorted out.  Maybe the county councillors would get much more from the 15 people they have elected here than the 43 who have failed to deliver for them in the entire life of the Seanad.  I am talking about the time since 1937.<\/p> <p>I commend my colleagues, Senators McDowell and Higgins, and indeed Senator Warfield.  They all sat on the committee that Senator McDowell was talking about and came up with this draft.  It is an ideal Bill.  In an ideal world, it would be the Bill that would come to reform the Seanad.  It should be the last Bill that this House ever needs because it should bring this House to be what it was envisaged to be in 1937.  What have we done with it?  We have turned it into a replica of the D&aacute;il.  We have a Government and an Opposition side.  In the current Seanad, we have a rubber stamp.  Anything that comes here is passed.  We do not give legislation the right scrutiny that it should get in this House.  This House was never meant to have Government and Opposition.  This House was meant to be populated by academics and vocational experts who would put legislation through its paces and recommend that legislation be returned to the D&aacute;il if it was deemed to be faulty.  That does not happen and we have Government and Opposition.<\/p> <p>The Bill is ambitious and, if passed, as my colleague Senator McDowell has said, it does not have to be implemented in one fell swoop.  It can be implemented in a modular way that would allow for a less disruptive implementation.  I know that the Minister of State's party is committed to Seanad reform but I am afraid, if the boat sails today, that it will sail forever.  I do not understand why we have to wait until 31 December 2021.  There would be nothing wrong with passing this Bill through All Stages in this House and letting it go from there to the D&aacute;il to remain in the D&aacute;il for whatever length of time it takes to pass through the D&aacute;il.  There is no need to do what is happening today.  Were this Bill passed, it would radically change the Seanad.  It would radically change vocational representation in the Seanad.  From my perspective, it would deliver much better representation for the vocational groups that we are here to represent.<\/p> <p>Having 28 Senators here who are elected under a general franchise by members of the public would give this House the credibility it deserves.  Far too often, and the Minister of State is no different, I have sat in company and people have said the Seanad is a rest home for failed politicians or a warm-up home for those who want to get to the D&aacute;il.  It is treated with nothing but disdain by many people in this country.  As an Independent Senator who was fortunate enough to be elected, I would be the first person to admit today that my election in October 2014 was a fluke.  It was a good fluke because it led to other Independent Senators coming in after me.  It led to a realisation by independent county councillors around the country that they could elect Independents to this House.<\/p> <p>When I look at the history of this House, the great things that happened in this House were all initiated by Independent people.  I look at my colleague, Senator Norris, one of the great orators and legislators in this House.  I think of Feargal Quinn and of John Crown, who left this House saying he would never return because it would never be reformed.  We have to take our courage in our hands and reform this.  If this is my political death, and an end to my political career, I will walk out of here proud because at least I tried, but I am so disheartened.<\/p> <p>This House was formed in 1937.  In 1942, there was an amendment to the way this House does its business.  Other than that, it has sat in the doldrums.  It is difficult not to see the public view that it is simply a rest home.  It is difficult, with this Government, to see that we have moved away from having people from civil society among the Taoiseach's 11 nominees.  There is one such person, Senator Flynn, and I am delighted that she is here.  In the previous Seanad, there were six Independents, and there were Independents in the Seanad before that, all great Senators.<\/p> <p>As a former postgraduate from the University of Limerick, I welcome the expansion of the university panel.  As the Bill passes through, there will be amendments, probably looking at the cost.  At the end of the day, we need to make the Seanad answerable to the people of Ireland, who pay our salaries.<\/p> <p>When I saw the amendment tabled last night, my heart sank into my boots.  I saw that nothing has changed.  Cute hoorism is alive and well and is living in Ireland.

That is hardly surprising because when one puts a bunch of politicians together the multiplying effect of disagreement is compounded.<\/p><p>From where I stand in looking at this matter, the broadening of the electorate is very welcome but the perverse sub-panel arrangement must be addressed.  I cannot describe it any other way but perverse.  The constituencies need to be updated and take account of the modern world.  The way that I expect the Minister of State to respond to this is that he will talk about the commitment from Government for broader electoral reform and the very clear commitment from three parties that have a majority to deliver an electoral commission.  The programme for Government explicitly says it will, &quot;Establish an Electoral Commission to provide independent oversight of elections and referendums, to inform the public&quot; [the people who we are meant to serve] &quot;about elections and referendums, to update and maintain the electoral register&quot;, which is something I would welcome in Dublin Central.It will, &quot;Empower the Electoral Commission to regulate online political&quot; activities, which is something that I know will scare some political organisations but is not a concern for me or my party.  It will, &quot;Mandate the new Electoral Commission to examine the use of postal voting&quot;.  I know that Trump and others complained about it but we would welcome that as it is a really valuable service for a lot of our electors.  <\/p><p>I appreciate that Senators McDowell and Higgins are disappointed that the Government has responded by saying it will deal with this again in a year but I suggest that they take heart.  My journey here has taken me 16 years and I never gave up.  I urge them not to give up but stick at this and not adopt an adversarial approach.  This House does not have to be divided and can deliver reform, and broader electoral reform, but it takes two parties to work together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020111800002#W00200","speaker":"1656"},{"type":"speech","time":1605695400,"counter":116,"content":"<p>I deeply regret that Senator Craughwell in making a case for the legislation that is before us, chose to besmirch the credentials of people on this side of the House.  If he wants to check my academic and professional qualifications over a 25-year period then he need only check with the Clerk of the Seanad.<\/p> <p>As is so often the case, we are doing things backwards because I believe that we have already had Second Stage.  I know because I stood over there on 7 November last year when we had a two-hour debate on this report with the Minister of State's predecessor, Deputy John Paul Phelan.  It took him a full year to make his way into the Chamber from the presentation of the report in December 2018.  I remember it well because I sat with Senator McDowell as we waited for the report to come across from the printers that particular Christmas week.  I recall the dismissive nature of the then Minister of State's retort on that day in the Chamber was hugely regrettable.  <\/p> <p>We have already had Second Stage and it took place from June 2018 until Christmas 2018, which I believe is the longest Committee Stage ever.  We met weekly with only one objective which was to deal with the legislation because the then Taoiseach had asked for the text of a Bill to be produced in conjunction with the report.  As has been pointed out, the State provided an expert draftsman to produce that text.  What other Members of Parliament are going to have that resource at their disposal, to bring a Bill in here before any Minister, when the Taoiseach himself commissioned members of the Bills Office of the Oireachtas to help with the compilation of the legislation.  One will not find a more well crafted piece of legislation during the term of office of the Minister of State when he debates in this House.  Today, we should be on Report Stage yet, perversely, we find ourselves back at the start.<\/p> <p>I was a proud member of the Seanad reform commission.  I pay tribute to Senator McDowell on the manner in which he chaired the commission because it was inclusive, comprised of members of all parties and none.  The witnesses, if people took the time to read the report, were drawn from all areas of life.  When I and my party campaigned for the retention of the Seanad in the referendum we did so on the basis of reform.  This is unlike the current T&aacute;naiste whose idea of reform is to use the scalpel.  That is par for the course considering that idea of reform of the former Minister, Phil Hogan, was to abolish a whole load of councils across the country.  <\/p> <p>One of the big issues that people may dwell on is extending the franchise.  Dr. Theresa Reidy conducted an extensive consultation on this in countries where it already exists in other parts of world.  There is a large participation in the initial period but that tails off.  It is those who are actually committed to the electoral franchise.  We consistently have over 1.2 million people, who are citizens of this State, who never bother to vote on polling day and the number increases on local election day.  When people are afraid of extending the franchise either into Northern Ireland or abroad we must remember that over 1.2 million people never bother to turn out on election day and use their franchise that people fought to give them. <\/p> <p>I commend the work not just of the signatories of this Bill but the entire membership of the commission who sought to get legislation that could be accepted by all Members of the House.  We have done things backwards as we have already had Committee Stage.  One will not find a more detailed Committee Stage than what was undertaken, so we should really be on Report Stage today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020111800002#W00300","speaker":"1641"},{"type":"speech","time":1605695400,"counter":117,"content":"<p>I also join with other Members who have congratulated the signatories to this Bill on the work involved in it.

I had the privilege of sitting in the Seanad Chamber for the first time and making known my views on the Seanad.

Unfortunately, I did not have time to contradict him but I will do so today.  The Senators who are elected by local authority members around the country are democratically elected Members of this House.  They are indirectly democratically elected in exactly the same way as the Taoiseach.  Nobody ever suggests the Taoiseach is not democratically elected.  He is, however, elected by a college of elected persons in the same way the 43 Senators in this House are elected by a much larger college which is spread throughout the country and represents local communities.  I absolutely resist any suggestion to the contrary.  The danger with making that suggestion or challenging it in debates like this is that it becomes part of the popular discourse that, somehow, this is not a democratic Chamber.  It is a democratic Chamber.  That argument could perhaps be made in respect of the 11 nominees.<\/p> <p>Senator Craughwell stated that the Seanad is not as it was envisaged by &Eacute;amon de Valera.  That is not true.  The Seanad operates exactly as de Valera envisaged it; it is powerless, divided and deals with legislation in a way that is subservient always to the D&aacute;il.  That is exactly what he wanted and it is what he got.  The Seanad is, therefore, the way the framers of the Constitution envisaged it would be.  Perhaps the clearest sign that that is the case are the 11 nominees because their stated purpose is to ensure the Government maintains a majority.  It is far from the idyllic House Senator Craughwell describes, one populated by academics and experts.  I am not necessarily suggesting there is a lack of academics and experts in this House, far from it.<\/p> <p>It was always intended that there would be an Opposition and a Government side and it has always been thus.  Even if that were not the case, the Seanad could not operate because the lack of certainty would create a malaise.  The absence of agreement and of parties and structures in the House would end up merely delaying the passage of legislation.  I have great respect for Senator Craughwell who is a friend and near neighbour of mine but to suggest there should not be politics or politicians in a House such as this completely ignores the value of the contribution politicians have to make.<\/p> <p>A feature of modern society is that we simply dismiss the skill set politicians have.  In many cases, this has been developed over years of local government and other types of political activism involved in making decisions that are saleable and transmissible.  I can give any number of examples of people who came into politics in this country, sometimes high office, without training or serving an apprenticeship.  The difficulties they had when they got there became clear because they had not had the benefit of sitting in a council chamber or working in an organisation or political party.  Having served such an apprenticeship and having gone through that process, I know that in my 11 years at D&uacute;n Laoghaire&ndash;Rathdown County Council I learned much about how chambers such as this should operate, how decisions should be made and, more importantly, how to make decisions and bring people with us.  It is not the job of the Legislature or, indeed, the Executive to impose decisions on people that they cannot or will not wear.  Part of the job of a political assembly, the Seanad included, is to make decisions that bring people with us and include them.<\/p> <p>I baulk at the suggestion that this is not a democratic Chamber.  We represent people all over this country, not just the councillors who elect 43 Senators or the thousands of university graduates who elect the National University of Ireland, NUI, and Trinity College Dublin Senators or the Taoiseach who appoints 11 people to this Chamber, but the people of this country.  We are amenable and available to all those people in a way, I suggest, members of the upper houses in pretty much all other European countries that have them are not.  I suggest that Irish politicians are closer to the ground than the vast majority of their counterparts in western democracies.  We have the benefit of that and it is due, in no small part, to the fact that most Members of this House are elected by grassroots activists, local politicians and hard-working councillors who are incredibly close to their electorate at local level.  There is enormous benefit in that.<\/p> <p>I do not want it suggested that I am degrading the 11 Taoiseach's nominees because although de Valera may well have intended their role to be one of ensuring a Government majority, they have also been used to identify gaps in the representation of this House.  I say that knowing a number of them are here and I particularly acknowledge Senator Flynn in this regard.  Former Senator Billy Lawless is another example, as is former Senator Ian Marshall.  They are people who have represented views in this House that are not widely held in this country.  There are also elected Members who do that as well. <\/p> <p>The Seanad has a measure of democracy which goes beyond the mere geopolitical physical representation one gets in the D&aacute;il.  I disagree with Senator Craughwell that this House is a mirror of the D&aacute;il; it is quite the opposite.  If we look back through the work the Seanad, including in this term, has done in identifying flaws in legislation that has been passed in the D&aacute;il, we see that, on a number of occasions, Senators have said \"Hang on a minute; there is a problem with this section.\"  We do not get enough credit for that but it happens because we have a House of informed, hard-working people who listen to people on the ground.  Having said that, Senator McDowell is correct that the case for reform is unassailable.  We need to reform and we all want to reform.  I will reluctantly support the Government's amendment because it is important from the point of view of facilitating reform.  Reform is coming, however, so let us make sure we are all part of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020111800002#X00500","speaker":"1685"},{"type":"speech","time":1605695400,"counter":122,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and his stated commitment to reform in this area, which Senator McDowell has also noted.  I commend Senator McDowell and his colleagues on bringing forward this important Bill.  I also note Senator McDowell's most interesting account of some of the context and background to Seanad reform.<\/p><p>I spoke on this matter last week when we debated Senator Malcolm Byrne's Bill and I mentioned a sense of <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu<\/i>which I believe many of us feel when we discuss this topic.  It is useful to remind ourselves of the hugely significant constitutional role played by the Seanad.  It is important that Senators continue to assert that role.  It is, in fact, the reason a number of us, including me and the other Labour Party Senators and Senator McDowell, took a case before the High Court earlier this year to assert the role of the Seanad and seek clarification on the constitutional issue around the status of the Seanad post election.  Without going back over that case, it was important.<\/p><p>Colleagues spoke about the contribution made by the Seanad and Senators to ensuring robust levels of scrutiny of legislation and bringing forward legislation.  In my time as a Senator, I have had a number of Private Members' Bills accepted.  These have become law on issues as diverse as the legalisation of humanist weddings, recognition of freelance workers for collective bargaining purposes and prohibition of female genital mutilation.<\/p><p>The Seanad can and does play an important role in the development and scrutiny of legislation.  The current Seanad is different from the D&aacute;il in one particular respect, namely, we have a far better gender balance with 40% of Senators now women.  That is a record high.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Ivana Bacik:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2248\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This is very welcome when the D&aacute;il, however, continues to languish behind so many other European legislatures in its proportion of women Members, where only 22.5% of our Teacha&iacute; D&aacute;la are women, even with gender quota legislation in place.  It is entirely right in this sort of debate to assert the importance and significance of the Seanad.  We also acknowledge that reform is long overdue.  Indeed, in 2013, when the referendum was happily defeated and the proposal to abolish the Seanad was vetoed by the people, this was really a vote for reform not for the<i>status quo<\/i>.  All Members on both opposition and Government sides will acknowledge that.  As Senator McDowell did, I also acknowledge that the Green Party in both the most recent election and in the negotiations for the programme for Government appear to have pushed for Seanad reform as a priority.  I am glad that in last week's debate the Minister of State stated that although the programme for Government disappointingly does not include an explicit commitment on Seanad reform, the three composite parties have recognised the need for urgent action and that action would happen in 2021.  <br\/><br\/>In that context we can consider the ground that has been laid and the preparatory steps that have been taken towards that reform.  Without going back over all of the detail, we are all aware of the Manning report, which was a very important process chaired by former Senator, Maurice Manning.  I am also a big admirer of him and he, along with his other colleagues, did extraordinary work in bringing on the process of reform and producing a very clear set of proposals in a Seanad Bill in 2016.  <br\/><br\/>At the time of the preparation of the report, I made a submission on behalf of Labour Party Senators, which I spoke about last week and which put forward a series of practical ways in which the Seanad could be reformed to bring about universal suffrage, an expansion of the electorate for the six university seats and so on.  Those proposals merit review because they answer many of the concerns about the need for reform to make the processes for the election of the Seanad more democratic.<br\/><br\/>We are all also aware of the Seanad reform implementation group so ably chaired by Senator McDowell on which I was glad to serve for the Labour Party.  That group broadly endorsed many of the proposals in the Manning report and diverged from it on a number of issues.  The group's report included a draft Bill, which Senator McDowell has mentioned.<br\/><br\/>This Bill effectively builds on the recommendations of those different processes.  I am very happy to support it on behalf of the Labour Party because while it differs from the proposals we put forward to the Manning report in some ways, it nonetheless represents a practical and effective way to reform the Seanad.  It has some merits.  <br\/><br\/>The proposal to establish a Seanad electoral commission is welcome.  It would manage the electoral process and deal with some of the undoubted logistical issues that arise from changing and expanding the electorate for the 49 elected Senators.  <br\/><br\/>The provision whereby the Minister may appoint different dates for the commencement of the provisions to allow for an incremental expansion of the franchise is also welcome.  That answers perhaps one of the main objections or obstacles to Seanad reform, which is that of cost and logistical difficulty.  If one can set out an incremental process, that would address that issue.<br\/><br\/>The processes for the holding of Seanad elections and the nomination of candidates as set out in Part 4 follow the constitutional requirements and there are also provisions relating to the filling of casual vacancies, how the Seanad commission is to be set up and to function, and so on.  <br\/><br\/>Crucially, the Bill would also do what Senator Byrne&rsquo;s Bill sought to do in that it would expand the franchise for the six university seats to enable graduates of higher education institutions throughout the State to vote, which is very important, is something that I support and was in the Labour Party proposal in 2015.  This Bill, because it is more comprehensive, is a better vehicle within which to bring about that reform for the very reason that I pointed out last week when we were debating Senator Byrne&rsquo;s Bill, which is that his Bill would effectively bring about a lopsided Seanad and a very skewed electorate, with 800,000 voters electing 10% of the 60 Senators while the others would remain to be elected by the much smaller electorate that currently applies.  <br\/><br\/>It is essential that we bring forward legislation that creates a comprehensive package of reforms for the 49 elected Members, albeit that we would allow, enable or provide for within that comprehensive framework the incremental bringing about of the expansion of the franchise.  No Member would consider it as feasible to do everything all at once but it is important that if we are reforming the university panel by expanding the electorate there, we do this in the context of the broader reform proposals from the Manning report and from the implementation group.  That is the big strength of this Bill as opposed to Senator Byrne&rsquo;s Bill.  <br\/><br\/>The Labour Party has always called for the need to establish an electoral commission, which is very important, and our proposals had some significant aspects to them that are not included either in this Bill or in the implementation group report.  One of these, in particular, is that we proposed Seanad and D&aacute;il elections would take place on the same day.  That is quite a radical proposal and is permitted under the Constitution but would answer the critique often levelled at us that people who have failed to win a seat at the general election then turn around and run for the Seanad.  This proposal did not find favour with either the Manning report or the implementation group and is again worth reviewing.<br\/><br\/>In conclusion, the principle of universal suffrage is of great importance as is that of the expansion of the university seats.  The Government motion is disappointing and I ask Government Senators, who may be very reluctant to support that motion, to allow this Bill to pass Second Stage so that we can all work then together to ensure that it becomes reality.

Then 2013 was a pivotal year in the history of the Seanad when a power grab by the Executive of the day spectacularly backfired on it because civil society groups spoke up for this Upper House, our fellow politicians and national parliamentarians voices were not to be heard and their endeavours ran contrary to democracy.

Unfortunately, apart from its vital constitutional role, its true potential has to date remained largely unfulfilled.  It will not be blocked by Senator Ward.  I do not know what is causing the obstacles.  Senator Craughwell in his exuberant over-enthusiasm to welcome the Bill was unfair on the many officeholders of the Seanad who went before us and who may not have come from the university panels.  If they suffered from an Achilles' heel, it was not a self-inflicted problem, rather it was the nature of the House and how it operates.<\/p><p>I speak from the vantage point of having been an elected county councillor on two different local authorities, which happen to be in two different provinces.  County councillors are not afraid of change but there is a bogeyman or woman and I do not know what the problem has been.  There is a potential knight on a white horse who could translate words into action.  His name, and Members have heard it first here today, is the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan.  I believe him.  I have known him for a long time as a party colleague.  He is a man of his word.  I am very pleased that he is behind the steering wheel.  I will judge this matter on the basis of actions not words, but I believe there is a real opportunity.  I have spoken to the Minister of State privately on numerous occasions.<\/p><p>Well done to all the sponsors of this Bill.  It is an incredible work of drafting art.  Of course, changes will be made to it but that is the nature of our job as legislators.  I am glad the Minister of State has reached out to Senator McDowell and others.  I am glad Senator McDowell takes him at his word.  I advise Senator Craughwell that I do not believe this House is as divided as it appears.  He and Senator Fitzpatrick could reach out to each other.  We have one common goal.  We are all on the same side.  The Minister of State is on our side.<\/p><p>Just like I named all those people who deserved credit for 2013 success, the biggest credit of all goes to the people of Ireland.  Their voice was heard that day.  They said \"No\" to the Executive power grab.  We must remember that it is the people of Ireland who should be front and centre of all we do.<\/p><p>This is an encouraging day and I give the Bill a qualified welcome.  I will do everything I can as a Senator to make this happen but the Minister of State can understand the years and years of frustration.  I know a number of environmentalists.  They were thrilled when Senator McDowell was elected to this House.  They are not typical bedfellows.  I can think of the rumble in Ranelagh but many environmentalists who care about this Seanad said, &ldquo;Let McDowell at it.  He will give this a bit of impetus that is so badly needed&rdquo;.  I know he is doing that but time is rolling on.  Even with the likes of Senators McDowell, Norris, Bacik, and Craughwell, this job of work is still before us.<\/p><p>I hope in the lifetime of this Seanad, we can look back on this day.  If there is one wish I have above any other - it is not a party-political aspiration - it is that we would reform this House once and for all, deliver on our promises to the people of Ireland and make the Seanad something that would be potentially very special.  This House has such potential to allow the unionist voice of Ireland and of citizens from all over the world to be heard here.  There is also potential to expand the franchise relating to the university seats.  I say to Senator Norris that it is a shame in a way that last week we started with tackling the best part of the Seanad, the most democratic part, but that was an irresistible opportunity to support all change.  Last week, the Senator branded that a form of gerrymandering.  I think his tongue was in his cheek when he said that.  An extension of the franchise has to be good.  I predict that Senator Norris would top the poll no matter how many were added on to the number of graduates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020111800002#Y00400","speaker":"1667","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605695400,"counter":128,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020111800002#Z00200","speaker":"1631"},{"type":"speech","time":1605695400,"counter":129,"content":"<p>What about the young people?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020111800002#Z00300","speaker":"1675"},{"type":"speech","time":1605695400,"counter":130,"content":"<p>The young people would not have a chance in that particular constituency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020111800002#Z00400","speaker":"1667"},{"type":"speech","time":1605695400,"counter":131,"content":"<p>They will have to buy more stamps.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020111800002#Z00500","speaker":"1669"},{"type":"speech","time":1605695400,"counter":132,"content":"<p>They will have to buy many more.

I might reference some of that material.<\/p><p>It dawned on me as the debate was proceeding that this is one of the most important days of this Seanad term.  That has been reflected on.  We will not be presented with another such comprehensive Private Members&rsquo; Bill in our time here.  I say that because I am losing hope in our ability to deliver Seanad reform.  I want to use my time to appeal to all Senators as we have so little time here, even those of us who are lucky enough to be re-elected.  Much of the debate has focused on references to &quot;I&quot; and that &quot;I got here this way or that way&quot;.  Ultimately, we have very little time here.  We would all do well to use our limited time to prioritise this issue so that we can leave here and say that we are proud of the role we played, that we started Seanad reform in this House and that the legislation went to the D&aacute;il and was enacted.  In the end, it is about setting aside self-interest and the comfort of the <i>status quo<\/i>and saying &quot;I am willing to jeopardise a seat or my position to change the system&quot;.<\/p><p>It is not that the Seanad is undemocratic - Senator Ward touched on this - because it would be unconstitutional if that were the case.  The issue I have is that it is just about democratic.  The majority of Senators are elected by approximately 1,200 people.  A candidate in a Seanad by-election is elected by even fewer than that number, namely, by Deputies and Senators.<\/p><p>I made most of the points in favour of this Bill in the debate which took place last week.  I thank Senator McDowell for bringing the Bill forward.  It was the main the focus of my contribution last week.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Warfield:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I will not repeat the points I made but I will say why I am so proud of this Bill and the work I put in alongside others in bringing it to this stage of development.  It was a collective process.  The annexe has been used at times to belittle the work of the committee by saying the annexe was a dissenting view.  I would never have submitted a statement on behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in in that annexe if I had known the annexe would be portrayed as a dissenting view.  It is far from it.  We worked hard to produce this legislation.  <\/p><p>For my part, I am proud of the amendments.  I tried to get the vote at the age of 16 in there.  That was rejected but I still supported the report.  I tried to achieve a greater number of Senators to be elected by the public.  That was rejected, a compromise was made and we supported that.  Another amendment was adopted to the effect that, where a nominating body had more than two nominations, it would be required to have an equal balance of male and female and, where a balance was not achievable, the majority nominated by the nominating body would be women.  On the factors to be considered by the Taoiseach, I was passionate that the Taoiseach would give regard to and have consideration for minority groups, that is, to people and communities who do not have representation here in the Seanad.  Other amendments concerned undertaking initiatives to encourage voter registration.  Others were about reforming the way we do by-elections by looking at a replacement list, as the European Parliament does, so a by-election would not be just elected by the D&aacute;il and Seanad.<\/p><p>In conclusion, I will not support the Government amendment.  This place is not the real world.  I do not think we would get away with the type of stalling we have seen on Seanad reform in any other workplace.  It is disappointing that we see it here again in the proposal from Senator Doherty to delay the Bill until next year.  It has been done to kill Bills of mine in the past and I have no doubt it is designed to kill this Bill.  That is a huge regret on one of the most important days in this Seanad and for Seanad reform. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020111800002#Z01200","speaker":"1686","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605695400,"counter":139,"content":"<p>I move amendment to amendment No. 1:<\/p> <blockquote> \tTo delete &ldquo;31st December, 2021&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;31st May, 2021&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020111800002#AA00200","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1605695400,"counter":140,"content":"<p>I second the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020111800002#AA00300","speaker":"1631"},{"type":"speech","time":1605695400,"counter":141,"content":"<p>I will speak to the amendment later.  I am glad to co-sponsor this very comprehensive legislation at 104 pages.  While I am one of the co-sponsors, this legislation is not simply a product of those who are putting it forward today.  This is the agreed legislation that came from the Seanad reform implementation group and the points made by Senator Warfield are important because there has been a suggestion that this is a magic impossibility and that we cannot find agreement.  In fact, this legislation is the proof that agreement can be reached.  It is testimony to that.  Like Senator Warfield, I had proposals that I brought into this.  I would have liked a different balance with more people elected directly from the public than by councillors.  Compromises were made.  People brought their best ideas.  They were debated with expert testimony and expertise in, as Senator Cassells stated, one of the longest Committee Stages on legislation ever.  There were months of Committee Stage and every single line was going through.  We each had our say and brought our proposals.  People engaged in good faith and some proposals were successful and others were not.  In the end, the legislation was published and there was a unified report.  There are annexes with different opinions that people have, as they do with any legislation, but there is no minority report.  To be clear, this is the report of the implementation group.<\/p> <p>People have different views on different issues, including on issues they feel should be subject to constitutional change in the future, such as the idea regarding the titles of the panels, mentioned by Senator Fitzpatrick, which requires constitutional amendment.  That was not within the scope.  People parked the wider ideas they had around political reform and other issues they were interested in and engaged in a disciplined way with the task at hand, namely, to look at how the recommendations of the Manning report would be implemented.  It was a task that reflected the programme for Government commitment directly, which was not a commitment to look at Seanad reform but a programme for Government commitment in the last Oireachtas to implement the Manning report.  We were that far along the stages that we were looking at having the recommendations already and this was the tool to implement them.  That is what we bring forward and what does it mean?  It means every citizen over 18 in this State would have a vote.  They would be able to vote on one of the panels but only one, so that we would move away from the situation for university electors sometimes having two votes.  They would each be able to vote on one of the panels, according to the theme and subject matter that was most passionately important to them.  For example, they might say education is a huge issue for them and they would use their vote on the education panel.  We would benefit from not simply the different persons who may put themselves forward as candidates - many excellent people already put themselves forward as candidates for the Seanad elections.  We would benefit from the expertise, insight and knowledge of the electorate who would express what they know and consider to be important.  Those who voted in 2013 to retain the Seanad because they wanted it reformed, as an expression of good faith, were telling us they wanted to have a say in the Seanad.  They would have a say in the Seanad, an input into who enters this Chamber and direct representation.  That was the promise made and I was part of the campaign in 2013 to retain and reform the Seanad.  I take that seriously.  We have talked in the last week about the 1979 referendum.  The 2013 referendum is an equally important mandate.<\/p> <p>That is the legislation we put forward.  It is detailed, comprehensive and entirely compatible with the Constitution.  It is expertly drafted and it was cynically disregarded.  The then Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, came to speak to us after asking us to leave our legislative proposals aside and work together, as we did.  He told us after all that he was not interested in it whatsoever.  I asked him if he was sincere.  I am afraid to say the clear message he gave was that he was not sincere in relation to Seanad reform.  There was a question about the mysterious reasons that Seanad reform is not happening.  It is not happening for a number of reasons but one clear reason is that two Fine Gael taoisigh in a row and a Fine Gael Minister who occupied the role, now occupied by the Minister of State with responsibility for Government reform, Deputy Noonan, chose not to follow through on their promises in a programme for Government and on the Bill they had commissioned and requested.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We lost two years because of a cynical desire to put it aside.  That is why I am very concerned.  I do not accept that everybody is on the same side on this.  There are those who do not want Seanad reform.  There are those who wanted the Seanad to be abolished, and as it was not abolished, they are quite interested in seeing it being ineffective and not reformed.  I say that having engaged in good faith with all parties over a number of years.<\/p><p>It is the case, however, that the Taoiseach has previously expressed an interest in Seanad reform.  In fact, in 2014, following the 2013 referendum, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin brought forward legislation to suggest there should be one person, one vote in the Seanad, the same idea in the Bill.  That is what the now Taoiseach brought forward as a private Member six years ago.  I accept the Minister of State's bona fides in expressing interest in moving forward in the area of Seanad reform.  A senior Minister has also expressed that he is committed to moving forward with reform in this area.  They now hold that power and responsibility.  In this case, the Taoiseach, the relevant Minister and the relevant Minister of State are members of Fianna F&aacute;il or the Green Party.  I rarely mention parties in the Chamber and try to avoid it, but it is relevant in this context.  The other party in the coalition had its opportunity over an extensive period.  It had the Ministries and the power as taoisigh but it chose not to move forward with Seanad reform.  That ship has sailed.  It is now the responsibility of those with that brief to work with all parties and ensure this is delivered.<\/p><p>I cannot accept the amendment to postpone the Bill and will have to oppose it.  As Senator Cassells noted, the Bill has had many Second Stages and upwards of 100 hours of Committee Stage debate.  The intention of the amendment to postpone the Bill by not just 12 months but to the very last day - New Year's Eve - of 2021 is to stall the Bill further.  It would basically provide that we would not come back to it until 2022 when, I remind the House, the rotation of Taoiseach will occur.  It is now the responsibility of Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party not to bounce this ball back out of their area of control and not to allow this legislation and progress in the area to be stalled until 2022, when the authority will be with the person who will then be Taoiseach, who has expressed in the D&aacute;il Chamber that he does not believe in this legislation.<\/p><p>I have proposed an amendment that will instead provide that the Bill should be read again in May.  It will allow time for a springtime engagement in advance, a summer between Second Stage and Committee Stage, a proper conversation and engagement, and it would mean we had progressed the Bill this year.  I urge the Minister of State to consider accepting my amendment to move the Bill past Second Stage on 31 May instead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020111800002#AA00400","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605695400,"counter":143,"content":"<p>The House will understand the decision of myself and the Cathaoirleach to, at this juncture, call the father of the House.

I wonder what kind of lunatic would use that requirement.  People talk about elitism; there is elitism for you.  I glory in the fact that to be a candidate for either the National University of Ireland or Trinity College, one does not have to have a degree.  One has just to get a nominator, a seconder and six assenters.

It will include, \"persons entitled to claim Irish citizenship in Northern Ireland and who reside in Northern Ireland or in the State\".  That is another few hundred thousand.  It will include, \"Irish citizens who hold a current and valid Irish passport and who reside outside the State\".  There is another few million.  What about it?  Shove them all in.  The more, the merrier - uncle Tom Cobley and all.  The Bill goes on to include, \"Irish citizens holding a requisite qualification and who are graduates of an institution of higher education in the State, and ... serving members of the D&aacute;il, members of the outgoing Seanad, and serving members of local authorities\".

If we are going to have a second Chamber, and the people have decided that we will, I believe that the only way that we can have that meaningful change that the public will appreciate is by way of referendum.<\/p> <p>There is talk about extending the franchise to the other universities.  I assume that was brought in for minorities, but 80% of the people in this country now go through third level education, so why do we need a universities vocational panel for the House?  Why do we need representation for that sector?  The vast majority of Members have third level education anyway.  We would only be moving the chairs on the deck, and that is one of the reasons we need a change.  That type of change can only take place through a referendum.<\/p> <p>How can the franchise be extended to 800,000, as Senator McDowell has mentioned, including Irish passport holders abroad and people in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland?  There would have to be two electoral registers.  We cannot maintain the current electoral register for D&aacute;il and local elections, because there are many shortcomings in how it is compiled.  How would having two registers work?  I am very much in favour of the provision in the Bill to establish a commission for reform of the electoral register.  If one looks at the practical outcome of reforming Seanad &Eacute;ireann, the franchise could be extended to between 4 million and 5 million people.  That is twice the number of people that vote in D&aacute;il elections to elect 160 Members.  There would be double that to elect 60 Members to a second Chamber.  How feasible is that?<\/p> <p>From a cost point of view-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020111800002#CC00600","speaker":"1636"},{"type":"speech","time":1605695400,"counter":165,"content":"<p>All I hear are problems.

It costs somewhere north of &euro;20 million for a D&aacute;il election, so one would be talking about more than &euro;40 million to elect Seanad &Eacute;ireann under the new Bill.<\/p> <p>It has all the sorts of problems I have mentioned, so I hope that the Minister of State evaluates all of the issues before he returns to the House at the end of next year, and that he puts us on a path forward.  There is no doubt that there needs to be change, and while this House does a great job scrutinising legislation, we can do a better job if we stick at it.  One of the problems is that the vast majority of Members want to be Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  The Labour proposal to have elections on the same day could be a way forward.  There are many issues to address and there are inadequacies and shortcomings in this Bill.<\/p> <p>There is also the problem in regard to the counting of votes.  One could have a count for a vocational panel where there are 500 electors with 40 or 50 candidates.  One could imagine how long that would take; it could take weeks to count and transfer the percentages of votes, etc.  That could take an enormous length of time as well, and one would also have to consider the cost of holding those counts in centres.  There is a lot to take into account if we want to reform Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  After all, we are talking about a second Chamber.  In the previous Seanad, the Government had no majority; in this Seanad, the majority is about two to one, as the Government has 40 and the Opposition has about 20 seats, and I do not see much difference in either Seanad.  In the previous Seanad, there was not much of a change in the way we did our business compared with the way we are doing it today-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020111800002#CC01100","speaker":"1636"},{"type":"speech","time":1605695400,"counter":169,"content":"<p>We worked hard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020111800002#CC01300","speaker":"1645"},{"type":"speech","time":1605695400,"counter":170,"content":"<p>We did work hard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020111800002#CC01400","speaker":"1636"},{"type":"speech","time":1605695400,"counter":171,"content":"<p>We were very inclusive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020111800002#CC01500","speaker":"1637"},{"type":"speech","time":1605695400,"counter":172,"content":"<p>And we succeeded.
