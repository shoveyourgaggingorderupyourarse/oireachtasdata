For example, a secretary or caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019, been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The increases recommended by the Arbitrator are binding and must be applied by all schools who employ staff to whom the Arbitrator&rsquo;s recommendation applies. \u00a0\u00a0My Department receives informal correspondence by telephone in respect of grant-funded secretary and caretaker circulars, as regularly occurs with the publication of pay circulars.\u00a0 Advice is provided on the implementation of the circular and the appropriate steps to take.\u00a0 Secretaries and Caretakers who have queries regarding the application of the circular should raise queries directly with their individual employer \/ Board of Management.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the recent survey of Secretaries and Caretakers has identified some schools that are non-compliant with the provisions of the 2015 Arbitration Agreement, and my Department will be making contact with these schools to remind them of their obligations under the agreement, as implemented through various circulars. The links below will bring you to the most recent circulars in respect of the pay increases under the 2015 Arbitration Agreement.<\/p>  <p>  www.education.ie\/en\/Circulars-and-Forms\/Active-Circulars\/cl0076_2018.pdf.<\/p>  <p>  www.education.ie\/en\/Circulars-and-Forms\/Active-Circulars\/cl0077_2018.pdf.<\/p>  <p>  Officials from my Department attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills on the 9th of April to discuss the status of non-teaching staff.<\/p>  <p>  In May this year officials from my Department had discussions with F&Oacute;RSA trade union representatives as part of a planned meeting. F&Oacute;RSA took the opportunity to formally table a pay claim.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  This was tabled as a follow-on claim from the current pay agreement for this cohort of staff which lasts until December 2019. The Department issued surveys\u00a0on the 10th of July\u00a0to establish the full current cost of the trade union&rsquo;s claim. This is standard practice.<\/p>  <p>  Officials from the Department met with F&Oacute;RSA representatives in September.

Most relevantly to this case, under international law they are not part of the State of Israel. <\/p>  <p>  Clear and non-misleading indication of origin for certain goods is an essential part of the EU's consumer policy. In the specific case of the occupied Palestinian territory, an Interpretative Notice on Indications of Origin was published by the European Commission on 12 November 2015. This provides guidance to importers and retailers on how EU rules on place of origin labelling should be applied in this case. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the case referred to the Court of Justice in June 2018, Ireland, as an interested Member State, lodged observations. The court&rsquo;s judgment, issued on 12 November 2019, found that foodstuffs originating in territories occupied by the State of Israel, must bear the indication of their territory of origin, and when these products originate from an Israeli settlement, this must also be made clear on the label. <\/p>  <p>  The Court of Justice&rsquo;s ruling is an interpretation of France&rsquo;s implementation of the Commission&rsquo;s Notice and associated EU Regulations.

This preclusion for credit unions reflects the potential implications for credit unions should such instruments be written down or converted to equity upon the failure of a credit institution.<\/p>  <p>  Credit unions continue to be permitted to invest in senior bank bonds.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111900061#WRE03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Credit Union Regulation","counter":256,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111900061#WRE03700"},{"type":"question","counter":257,"qnumday":124,"qnumall":"[47251\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111900061#WRE03800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on the fact that the Central Bank of Ireland set policy for credit unions while regulating same.","asker":"1250","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":258,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, my role as Minister for Finance is to ensure the legal framework for credit unions is appropriate for the effective operation and supervision of credit unions.<\/p><p>The Central Bank has statutory responsibility for the registration, regulation and supervision of credit unions in Ireland.<\/p><p>Under Section 84 of the Credit Union Act, 1997 the functions of the Central Bank are to administer the system of regulation and supervision of credit unions with a view to the:<\/p><p>- Protection by each credit union of the funds of its members; and<\/p><p>- Maintenance of the financial stability and well-being of credit unions generally.<\/p><p>In March 2012, the Report of the Commission on Credit Unions made a number of recommendations regarding the strengthening of the regulatory framework for credit unions and also recommended that regulation making powers be delegated to the Central Bank. <\/p><p>In order to increase transparency and confidence in the regulation making process, consultation arrangements are provided for in Section 84A(2) of the 1997 Act.<\/p><p>In accordance with legislative provisions, the Central Bank invites external scrutiny of both its regulatory powers and remit, and the performance of its supervisory functions through regular formal reviews by external parties (Peer Review).<\/p><p>Section 32M of the Central Bank Act, 1942 states that:<\/p><p>At least every 4 years the Bank shall make appropriate arrangements for-<\/p><p>(a) another national central Bank, or<\/p><p>(b) another person or body certified by the Governor, after consultation with the Minister, as appropriate,<\/p><p>to carry out a review of the Bank&rsquo;s performance of its regulatory functions.<\/p><p>The 2015 International Credit Union Regulators Network Review was the first review of the Central Bank's performance of its regulatory functions in relation to credit unions and represented an opportunity for the Central Bank to invite external scrutiny on the performance of its functions in relation to credit unions for the purpose of ensuring that they measure up to international standards and the expectations of sector stakeholders.<\/p><p>The ICURN began its second peer review of the Central Bank's performance of its regulatory functions in early 2019.

It is also important to note that the Probate Office of the High Court deals with matters relating to probate and as such is the responsibility of the Minister for Justice and Equality.<\/p><p>However, the Deputy may wish to note that under section 21 of the Credit Union Act 1997 (1997 Act) as amended, a credit union member may nominate a third party (e.g. a family member) to be the recipient upon the death of the member to the whole or part of the member&rsquo;s property that they have in the credit union at the time of their death.<\/p><p>The 1997 Act (as amended) imposes a statutory limit of &euro;23,000 on the amount that can be passed by way of a nomination. Thus, if at the date of the nominator's death the amount of the member&rsquo;s property in the credit union exceeds &euro;23,000, the credit union may only dispose any property up to the value of &euro;23,000. The effect of these provisions are that any nomination up to &euro;23,000 will pass outside the terms of any will. Any sum in excess of this will revert to and be an asset of the estate, which needs to be distributed under the terms of the will or the rules of succession where there is no will.<\/p><p>Ordinarily the production of a grant of probate would be required to release funds from a bank account to the personal representative, irrespective of the amount. However, if a person dies leaving small amounts of money in a bank, the bank may agree to release the funds without the necessity for a grant of probate.<\/p><p>While most applicants instruct a solicitor to process their application for a grant of probate, personal applications can also be made to the Probate Office of the High Court for a grant of probate.<\/p><p>The Central Bank has also advised me that in order to be registered a credit union must have a set of rules. Under section 15 of the Credit Union Act, 1997 the registered rules of a credit union bind all members. In some cases these rules specifically set out the credit union's approach to the nomination of property and the statutory limit under the 1997 Act.<\/p><p>The Deputy may also wish to note that if an individual is not satisfied in any of their dealings with a financial services provider the individual may make a complaint to the provider&rsquo;s internal complaint resolution process.

I have no role in day to day supervision of the insurance industry, as this is the responsibility of the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI). In that regard, the CBI is responsible for the authorisation and supervision of these undertakings in Ireland.  All insurance companies operating in Ireland, whether authorised by the Central Bank or a competent authority of another EU state, are subject to conduct of business supervision by the CBI.  They must follow the Central Bank&rsquo;s <i>Consumer Protection Code 2012<\/i>(CPC).  <\/p><p>In relation to the issue of auto-renewals for insurance policies, I cannot comment on the individual case referenced in the details supplied.  However, I understand that, at a general level, this is something that a number of companies in the market include as part of their terms of business, in particular for certain types of insurance policies such as gadget, bicycle, pet and annual travel insurance.  I also understand that where a non-life insurance policy contract includes such an automatic renewal service, this is generally made clear to the consumer at the outset and, as stated, is included in the terms of business related to the policy contract.  <\/p><p>My officials consulted with the Central Bank of Ireland on this particular issue.  They advised that provisions 4.30 and 4.31 of the CPC provide that:<\/p><p>4.30:<\/p> <blockquote> \t  \t&ldquo;A regulated entity providing an insurance quotation to a consumer must include the following information in the quotation, assuming that all details provided by the consumer are correct and do not change:  <blockquote> \t <blockquote> \ta) the monetary amount of the quotation; <br \/><br \/>b) the length of time for which the quotation is valid; and <br \/><br \/>c) the full legal name of the relevant underwriter.&rdquo; <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote>  <\/blockquote>  <p>4.31:<\/p> <blockquote> \t  \t&ldquo;A regulated entity must set out clearly in the quotation provided to the consumer any warranties or endorsements that apply to the policy. Where the quotation is provided on paper or on another durable medium, this information must not be in a smaller font size than other information provided in the document.&rdquo;  <\/blockquote>  <p>In addition, the <i>Non-Life Insurance (Provision of Information) (Renewal of Policy of Insurance) Regulations 2007<\/i>provides that the insurer shall, not less than 20 working days prior to the date of expiry of a policy of insurance, where the insurer wishes to invite a renewal, issue to the client in writing a notification of renewal of the policy of insurance.  Moreover , Schedule 3 of the <i>Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1995<\/i>sets out the indicative list of terms which may be regarded as unfair. Part (h) cites terms &ldquo;automatically extending a contract of fixed duration where the consumer does not indicate otherwise, when the deadline fixed for the consumer to express this desire not to extend the contract is unreasonably early&rdquo; as being unfair.<\/p><p>Finally, the Deputy may be aware that there are measures in the CPC that require all regulated financial services firms to have complaints handling procedures in place.  Neither my Department, nor the CBI, investigates individual consumer complaints however, if a person feels that they have been unfairly treated by an insurance company, and after following the firm&rsquo;s complaints process, they are still not satisfied, they have the right to refer the complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO).  This is a statutory independent body that mediates unresolved disputes\/complaints with regulated financial services providers. Insurance Ireland also operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance.

Partial structural remediation was carried out in another school. Structural remediation work for another 6 schools is advancing since October.  <\/p>  <p>  Planned detailed structural investigations were carried out in 17 schools over the summer months also and, based on engineering advice, precautionary measures and other engineering solutions were put in place in parts of 13 of those schools before they reopened after the summer holidays.   <\/p>  <p>  As well as this, a solution has been devised for Ardgillan Community College.  The design phase for this work is progressing and the project will move to delivery when this is completed.  <\/p>  <p>  The bulk of the remainder of the Schools Remediation Programme is scheduled to be undertaken on a phased basis over 2020 and 2021 and work is well underway in my Department to underpin this.

The availability of the options to retire on pension in the case of teachers covers a very wide age spread from age 50 to age 66 (age 70 from 2018). Approximately only 5% of teachers work to their compulsory retirement age, the remainder retire voluntarily where they have the reached the required service or reached the minimum age threshold to do so. That said the  approach adapted by my Department has proved robust and has provided a good indication of the scale of likely retirements and the expenditure implications for the following year.<\/p>  <p>  The need for supplementary estimates over the period 2014 to 2018 to cover additional pension costs did not arise due to errors in forecasting.<\/p>  <p>  Prior to Budget 2019, and aside from allocations to cover pay agreements, there had been no significant increase in the expenditure base for pensions for a number of years, despite increased costs.  Given that this expenditure is demand-driven and non-discretionary, it was therefore necessary to seek supplementary estimates to provide for retirements and pension costs over and above what would be supported by the original allocation, having regard to offsetting savings which arose in other expenditure areas.    <\/p>  <p>  This is an issue which has affected other Votes with significant pension commitments.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department, and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, have worked closely to resolve this issue in order to better align the expenditure allocation with the expected pensions and retirements bill.  For 2019, the Government allocated an additional &euro;147 million in funding for pensions in the education sector, in addition to &euro;12.5 million to cover the pensions-related costs of the Public Service Stability Agreement.

Funding for apprenticeship has been assigned to the further education and training and skills category in the table, although some of this funding ultimately flows to higher education institutions. <table>    <tr>       <th><\/th>       <th>2018<\/th>       <th>2019<\/th>       <th>2020<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>The additional contributions to the National Training Fund arising from the increases in the employers NTF levy <\/td>       <td>&euro;47.5m<\/td>       <td>&euro;69m <\/td>       <td>&euro;74m <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Additional revenue allocated to the higher education sector from levy increase<\/td>       <td>&euro;28m<\/td>       <td>&euro;36m<\/td>       <td>&euro;29m<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Additional revenue allocated to the further education and training and skills sector from levy increase<\/td>       <td>&euro;19.5m<\/td>       <td>&euro;33m<\/td>       <td>&euro;45m<br \/><br \/><\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111900063#WRG04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1351"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":381,"content":"<p>Question No. 166 answered with Question No. 139.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Quality and Qualifications Ireland","counter":382,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111900063#WRG04400"},{"type":"question","counter":383,"qnumday":167,"qnumall":"[47265\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111900063#WRG04500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that QQI is advertising for an administrative position while a valid panel from a recent recruitment exercise is in place.","asker":"1302","askee":"1290"},{"type":"question","counter":384,"qnumday":168,"qnumall":"[47266\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111900063#WRG04600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he is satisfied that QQI has advertised a post for an administrative position while there is a valid panel in place for a position at the same level.","asker":"1302","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":385,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 167 and 168 together.<\/p><p>Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) is a statutorily independent State Agency.

Partial structural remediation was carried out in another school. Structural remediation work for another 6 schools is advancing since October. <\/p>  <p>  Planned detailed structural investigations were carried out in 17 schools over the summer months also and, based on engineering advice, precautionary measures and other engineering solutions were put in place in parts of 13 of those schools before they reopened after the summer holidays.   <\/p>  <p>  As well as this, a solution has been devised for Ardgillan Community College.  The design phase for this work is progressing and the project will move to delivery when this is completed.  <\/p>  <p>  The bulk of the remainder of the Schools Remediation Programme is scheduled to be undertaken on a phased basis over 2020 and 2021 and work is well underway in my Department to underpin this.  Details will continue to be communicated to the schools as my Department&rsquo;s plans develop and progress.  <\/p>  <p>  About &euro;40m has been spent this year up to the end of quarter 3 2019 on the remediation programme, covering the cost of investigations, precautionary measures, fire safety upgrades and structural repairs.   <\/p>  <p>  The cost to date is less than was initially estimated and this is largely due to the well-managed way in which the remediation programme has been handled. <\/p>  <p>  I am unable to provide a further breakdown on this figure at this time to avoid compromising either the legal process underway to recover costs against the contractor involved or the planned public procurement process to carry out the remaining remediation work.  <\/p>  <p>  The Public Spending Code requires Government Departments to make contingency provision within their overall capital programme to meet any unforeseen demands or additional costs which might emerge for the capital programme as a whole.<\/p>  <p>  In accordance with this requirement, the cost for the schools remediation programme is being met to date through a contingency provision as part of the increased 2019 capital budget of &euro;942m and also from the reduced funding requirement for the multi-annual capital development in TU Dublin Grangegorman following the sale of DIT Kevin Street.

The Department has not had engagement with the HEI in relation to any specific structural organisation of the type the Deputy refers to and which remains a matter for the institution.<\/p><p>In terms of national higher education policy, Government policy as set out in the Programme for Government is to support the creation of technological universities (TUs) as HEIs of sufficient size, capacity and critical mass to have a significant impact at regional, national and international level. TUs will have greater links to industry and will have a major impact on the capacity to create and retain jobs in regions. They will assist in achieving national strategic objectives such as are set out under Project Ireland 2040, the National Development Plan and Future Jobs Ireland. Government will continue to prioritise those institutions which have clear ambitions and plans for the furthering of industry-relevant technological research and education. <\/p><p>Under the statutory framework detailed in the Technological Universities Act 2018, two or more IoTs may jointly seek TU designation through a prescribed legislative process. Section 29 of the Act provides for the application jointly by two or more applicant institutes to the Minister of Education and Skills for an order seeking designation as a TU subject to their jointly meeting specified eligibility criteria.  Section 38 of the Act provides that an applicant institute and an established technological university may apply to the Minister for an order. The undertaking of the relevant legislative process remains a discretionary matter for decision by the governing bodies of the HEIs involved. <\/p><p>In addition to the enactment of the 2018 Act, Government have put in place a number of very important supports enabling the establishment of TUs. <\/p><p>The TU Research Network (TURN) established by my Department completed a report which was launched on 6 November 2019 entitled &lsquo;<i>Technological Universities<\/i>: <i>Connectedness &amp;amp; Collaboration enabled by Connectivity&rsquo; <\/i>and which details the case and requirements for a state change in higher education reform whereby TUs will assist in the delivery of national strategic objectives for regional socioeconomic development, higher education access, research and skills progression. <\/p><p>The report makes recommendations for the strategic development of TUs in a structured system-wide approach and identifies the need for investment in integrated multi-campus digital infrastructure, research capacity building and realignment of the policy framework and funding for TUs. <\/p><p>In response Government announced in Budget 2020 the provision of &euro;90 million over the next three years under a new TU Transformation Fund to support IoT consortia to achieve TU designation and the further advancement of established TUs.

ongoing priority for Government.  <\/p><p>Currently, almost 20% of the total Education Vote or &euro;1.9bn is invested in supporting children with special needs.  <\/p><p>Since 2011 investment in Special Education supports has increased by 50%, which is significantly above the 7% increase in total student numbers over the same period. <\/p><p>As a result the numbers of special education teachers, special needs assistants and special class and school places are at unprecedented levels.<\/p><p>The majority of children with Autism attend mainstream class, where they may access additional supports if required. <\/p><p>But some students may find it difficult to manage full-time placement in mainstream and so placement in a Special Class or Special School setting may be deemed appropriate where placement in mainstream class is not in the best interests of the child.<\/p><p>The NCSE has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide and has well established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents.<\/p><p>Nationally, 167 new special classes opened this school year, which means there are 1,618 special classes in place, compared to 548 in 2011. <\/p><p>Of these 1,353 special classes cater for students diagnosed with ASD.<\/p><p>Provision in our 124 special schools has also increased from 6,848 placements in 2011 to 7,872 this year.<\/p><p>The NCSE has planned a further expansion of special class and school places nationally, including in Cork and Dublin, for next year.<\/p><p>The extent of new classes being opened in recent years shows the willingness of schools to open special classes and normally this is the case. <\/p><p>However there are some parts of the country where the Council has faced challenges in getting schools and their Patrons to voluntarily agree to provide special class or school places.  <\/p><p>I know that this can cause much anguish for parents and families involved.<\/p><p>As Minister I have a power under Section 37A of the Education Act 1998 to direct a school to provide additional provision where all reasonable efforts have failed.<\/p><p>The legislation was activated on the 29th October, 2019 following a report by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) which identified a shortage of special school and special class places right across south Dublin.<\/p><p>The NCSE has identified 82 children needing special education school places for this or next year in south Dublin.<\/p><p>This is the second time the power under section 37A of the Education Act 1998 (as inserted by section 8 of the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018) has been used.<\/p><p>The law contains a procedure through which the NCSE can test the capacity of schools in an area to provide more special education places and through which ultimately a Ministerial direction can be made requiring a school to make additional special education places available.<\/p><p>The necessary steps in the Admissions Act process, will continue to be expedited to ensure that children with special needs are provided with access to a suitable education.<\/p><p>I

With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level. For school planning purposes Meakstown and Charlestown are located in the Finglas East_Ballymun_Dublin 11 school planning area in which there are currently nine primary schools and one post-primary school.<\/p>  <p>  Using school planning area boundaries within my Department&rsquo;s Geographic Information System (GIS) allows data within those boundaries, including data for enrolments in schools, child benefit and other relevant data to be added to the mapping information, grouped and analysed.

There is close ongoing cooperation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI and other law enforcement agencies who all work closely together on a broad range of policing responsibilities.  <\/p><p>As I have outlined in the Houses previously, the existing multi-agency cooperative arrangements in place to tackle cross-border crime are already quite structured and successful.<\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that in November 2015 the British and Irish Governments and the Northern Ireland Executive agreed a series of measures in the <i>Fresh Start <\/i>agreement, as part of a concerted and enhanced effort to tackle organised and cross jurisdictional crime.  These measures included the creation of the Joint Agency Task Force which is led by senior officers from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Police Service of Northern Ireland, the Revenue Commissioners and UK Revenue and Customs.  A number of other relevant bodies, including the National Crime Agency and the Criminal Assets Bureau are also closely involved.<\/p><p>The objective of the Task Force is to build on existing law enforcement frameworks and to increase the collective effectiveness of operational actions.  In this format, the senior management level of the two police services provide strong strategic direction and oversight to front-line operational activities.  <\/p><p>The Task Force has had some notable success in tackling cross-border criminal activity across a range of crime areas.  These include not just traditional smuggling activities, but also rural and farm crimes, organised burglary and drug crime.<\/p><p>The regrettable absence of an Executive in Northern Ireland means that the work of the Task Force is less visible than it might have been.  It was designed to report to Justice Ministers north and south and it is my hope that the restoration of power sharing in Northern Ireland will allow the Task Force to reach its full potential. <\/p><p>The multi-agency nature of the Task Force is critical to its success. It is a strong example of the extensive North-South cooperation between the police, customs services and other law enforcement agencies involved in tackling crime and enhancing the safety of all communities on both sides of the border. The Task Force complements both the ongoing formal and informal co-operation between AGS and PSNI. <\/p><p>The Deputy may also be interested to note that the collaboration between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI was recently extended with establishment of the first ever AGS-PSNI Joint Investigation Team involving Eurojust. This is a very significant and positive development will further strengthen the already close and positive cooperation between police services on the island of Ireland. <\/p><p>Finally, I would assure the Deputies that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the full support of the Government in its ongoing work in addressing cross-border criminality and we are providing record resources to enable it to perform this critical role. The Northern region continues to benefit from the accelerated recruitment to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as part of the Government&rsquo;s plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021, supported by the unprecedented level of Government funding to the organisation.<\/p><p>Garda strength in the Northern Region has increased to approximately 1,500, an increase of 150 Garda&iacute; since the end of 2017.  These Garda&iacute; are supported by approximately 160 Garda staff in the region, which represents an increase of almost 35% over the past 3 years, with the result that additional Garda&iacute; can be redeployed from administrative to operational policing duties where their training and policing expertise can be used to best effect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111900069#WRN02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prisoners Temporary Release","counter":677,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111900069#WRN02400"},{"type":"question","counter":678,"qnumday":280,"qnumall":"[47868\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111900069#WRN02500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his views on whether a meeting of the parole board (details supplied) which led to a number of escorted absences from prison was legitimately held in view of the fact that it occurred less than seven years from the commencement of a life sentence; the steps he plans to take to remedy the situation; if he has sought the advice of the Attorney General on the issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":679,"content":"<p>The Deputy will appreciate that I cannot comment on individual cases. <\/p>  <p>  However, in general terms it is important to note that limited day release under escort and supervision should not be confused with the release of an offender on parole.

Pillar 4 is focussed on increasing participation in the labour force as this will lead to a more equitable, balanced and sustainable development of Ireland&rsquo;s workforce.<\/p>  <p>  Pillar 4 of Future Jobs Ireland outlines a number of key ambitions and deliverables to help to increase participation in the labour force. A number of these ambitions are centred on flexible working solutions which can offer benefits for employers, employees and wider society in general. Flexible working encompasses a wide range of practices including part-time, compressed hours, job sharing, home-working and remote working. Such solutions allow for tangible benefits for employees including improving their work-life balance. It also provides solutions for those who would otherwise take unpaid parental leave but cannot afford to do so. <\/p>  <p>  A deliverable under this Pillar is the completion of research on remote working. My Department is currently leading on this research which focusses on understanding the prevalence and types of remote working arrangements within the Irish workforce and the attitudes towards such arrangements. The research will identify the influencing factors for both employers and employees partaking in remote working. The research will also include an international policy review which will consider related policies abroad in order to understand the impacts of this on remote working.<\/p>  <p>  To assist this work, an Interdepartmental Steering Group has been formed with representatives from my Department, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, the Department of Rural and Community Development, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of An Taoiseach. This Group is providing guidance and feedback to the two staff members of my Department who are leading on this report.<\/p>  <p>The research will include desk research, an online national employee survey and engagement with key stakeholders, including employer representative bodies and remote working interest groups. As part of the consultation process my Department held a Remote Working Consultation Forum on July 18th   of this year. This was attended by Government Departments, State Agencies, enterprises, and the remote working community. The insights arising from this Forum will be included in the final report which will outline the relevant policy implications of remote working for Ireland. The report is expected to be completed in Q4 of this year and published in early 2020.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111900070#WRO02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Patent Applications","counter":738,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111900070#WRO02600"},{"type":"question","counter":739,"qnumday":300,"qnumall":"[47627\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111900070#WRO02700","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"her views on a matter (details supplied) concerning obtaining a trademark for a new product; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1318","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":740,"content":"<p>The Patents Office is the statutory body that deals with the registration of trade marks.

The Scheme generated considerable savings in drug costs amounting to &euro;177 million, particularly in the earlier years. However, savings had reduced considerably by 2005.<\/p>  <p>  The object of the IDTS was to encourage rational drug prescribing practices on the part of GPs and to enhance the information and services available to patients.  In return, GPs would be allowed to access funds for approved practice developments (investment in practice premises, equipment, computerisation etc), research and education, and additional primary care expertise at practice level. The remaining portion of the savings went to the Health Board for broad developments in general practice.<\/p>  <p>  It was subsequently agreed under the IDTS that GPs with a proven track record of savings could be allowed to draw down a sum equivalent to their anticipated saving over a five\/ten year period and to repay this advance by way of their savings.  Various types of agreements, many of them in the  form of mortgages, were signed between GPs and various Health Boards who received advances. The advances were paid out between 2002 and 2004 and were for periods of between 5 and 10 years. <\/p>  <p>  In 2005, following an independent evaluation of the Scheme, the HSE suspended the IDTS as it was no longer achieving its objective. <\/p>  <p>  In the aftermath of the suspension of the IDTS, approximately 30 GP practices had been refusing to make their annual repayments.  The HSE entered into a mediation process with the IMO who represented most of the GPs in question. The mediation process resulted in an agreement being reached between the HSE and IMO in March 2014. Most of the GP practices with an outstanding balance opted for the terms of the mediation agreement, of which three practices opted to repay in one lump sum.<\/p>  <p>  Thirteen GP practices are continuing to repay their outstanding loans in accordance with the terms of the mediation agreed mechanism.  The HSE is continuing to liaise with its legal advisors in relation to a number of GP practices who hold an advance loan and have yet to reach a settlement agreement. This process is on-going and the HSE is committed to reaching a legally enforceable agreement with these remaining GP&rsquo;s in line with the terms agreed during the mediation process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111900071#WRP00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospitals Funding","counter":776,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111900071#WRP00500"},{"type":"question","counter":777,"qnumday":313,"qnumall":"[47095\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111900071#WRP00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the investment in a community hospital (details supplied) in County Kerry;

The cost of disability can be defined as the amount it costs a person with a disability to achieve the same standard of living as those persons without a disability.  This includes extra living costs such as heating; disability aids and equipment; medical and drug costs; care costs and transport costs.  Following a procurement process, Indecon International Consultants have been commissioned by that Department to carry out this research.  It is hoped that the research, when complete, will inform policy direction in relation to the provision of adequate supports to meet the needs of people with disabilities, from a whole-of-Government perspective. <\/p>  <p>  There are improvements in access to a range of transport supports available to persons with disabilities in the State and on-going work is being carried out by Government Departments, agencies and transport providers to further improve access to public transport services.

The committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation.  It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department.  NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease.  Therefore, the immunisation schedule will continue to be amended over time.<\/p>  <p>   In 2009 the NIAC recommended HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccination for all 12-13 year old girls to reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer when they are adults.  In September 2010 the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of secondary school.  Gardasil is the vaccine used by the HSE in the School Immunisation Programme and is provided free of charge to girls in first year of secondary school.<\/p>  <p>   During the 2019\/20 school year, girls attending secondary school can still join the HPV girls only programme with appointments offered in HSE mop up clinics.  If your child is 15 years of age or older they will require three doses of the HPV vaccine in order to be fully protected. It must be noted that vaccinated women and girls may still be at risk from other high risk types of HPV that can cause cervical cancer and will therefore need to continue to have regular cervical smear tests.<\/p>  <p>   As you are aware, NIAC recommended that the HPV vaccine should also be given to boys.  On foot of NIAC&rsquo;s recommendation, my Department asked the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a health technology assessment (HTA) to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of extending the current immunisation programme to include boys in the first year of secondary school.<\/p>  <p>   HIQA completed the HTA in December 2018, recommending that the HPV immunisation programme be extended to include boys.  A policy decision was made to extend the HPV immunisation programme to include boys starting in September 2019 with the introduction of a 9-valent HPV vaccine.  However, the HIQA report published in December 2018 did not recommend an HPV catch-up programme for older boys for several reasons: <\/p>  <p>  - Vaccinating boys in the first year of secondary school provides the best possible protection against HPV infection; <\/p>  <p>  - Boys are already benefitting from the indirect herd protection provided by the girls' HPV vaccination programme which started in 2010.<\/p>  <p>  The ages at which vaccines are recommended in the immunisation schedule are chosen by NIAC in order to give each child the best possible protection against vaccine preventable diseases.  As the HPV vaccine is preventative it is intended to be administered, if possible, before a person becomes sexually active, that is, before a person is first exposed to HPV infection.  Therefore, the gender neutral HPV vaccination programme targets all girls and boys in first year of secondary school to provide maximum coverage.  All vaccines administered through the School Immunisation Programme are provided free of charge.    <\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to be guided by NIAC's recommendations on any emerging evidence on this issue in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111900075#WRT02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Paediatric Services","counter":1018,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111900075#WRT02300"},{"type":"question","counter":1019,"qnumday":399,"qnumall":"[47473\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111900075#WRT02400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of children living in County Meath waiting to see a paediatrician for an outpatient appointment, a paediatric cardiologist, a paediatric ENT specialist and a paediatric surgeon.","asker":"1225","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1020,"content":"<p>Reducing waiting time for patients for hospital operations and procedures is a key priority for Government.

It records episodes of drug and alcohol treatment during the calendar year. The latest NDTRS data for 2018 show that over 10,274 cases were treated for problem drug use, an increase of 15 per cent on 2017. Thirty nine per cent of cases were new, with 57 per cent previously treated. <\/p><p>Opioids continue to be the most commonly reported main problem drug at 42 per cent, followed by cannabis and cocaine at 23 and 22 per cent respectively. <\/p><p>Among new entrants to treatment, cannabis is the most common drug at 38 per cent, followed by cocaine at 31 per cent. Two-thirds of treated cases are provided in outpatient facilities, with 14 per cent in inpatient settings. <\/p><p>The episodes of treatment captured in the NDTRS for 2018 include a very wide range of interventions and settings from services in the community to specialist residential units. Partnership between the health services and the community and voluntary sectors is key to providing support for people as close to home as possible and at the level of complexity that best responds to their need.  <\/p><p>The Department of Health works with the HSE to raise awareness of the dangers associated with drugs through the <i>Drugs.ie<\/i>website. In 2019, the HSE developed and promoted two national campaigns aimed at students and the festival goers, who may not present at traditional addiction services. <\/p><p>Next year, the HSE will commence a targeted national campaign to raise awareness of the risks associated with drug use and recommend steps on how people can reduce the harms. This work will include information about club drugs, festival drug use, newer drugs, as well as cannabis. <\/p><p>A new educational resource ('Know the Score') on drug and alcohol use is due to be launched shortly for senior cycle students. This was jointly developed by the HSE, the Department of Education &amp;amp; Skills, and Drug and Alcohol Task Forces, as an action in the National Drugs Strategy. <\/p><p>I believe that the increase in numbers seeking treatment is encouraging from a public health perspective, especially as many also use other drugs. Mixing drugs can impact on recovery and increase the risk of overdose. I firmly believe that addressing the drug problem requires a multi-pronged approach, providing harm-reduction and prevention initiatives in tandem with treatment services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111900077#WRV01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1307"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Addiction Treatment Services","counter":1124,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111900077#WRV01700"},{"type":"question","counter":1125,"qnumday":437,"qnumall":"[47694\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111900077#WRV01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of medical detoxification units provided directly by the HSE in each of the years 2015 to 2018 and to date in 2019;

protection of Natura sites and specific changes necessitated to the forestry licensing process consequently; and the additional steps which will form part of the forestry license approval process.","asker":"1350","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1216,"content":"<p>Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) decisions and Irish law cases relating to Appropriate Assessment under the Habitats Directive  have resulted in changes to forestry licensing procedures.   The main examples are outlined below. <\/p>  <p>Case C-323\/17 People Over Wind and Peter Sweetman v Coillte Teoranta resulted in the following ruling:   &ldquo;Article 6(3) of [the Habitats Directive] must be interpreted as meaning that, in order to determine whether it is necessary to carry out, subsequently, an appropriate assessment of the implications, for a site concerned, of a plan or project, it is not appropriate, at the screening stage, to take account of the measures intended to avoid or reduce the harmful effects of the plan or project on that site.&rdquo;<\/p>  <p>Two recent Irish High Court decisions are also related to this ECJ decision, i.e. Eoin Kelly v. An Bord Plean&aacute;la (2019) and Heather Hill Management Company CLG v An Bord Plean&aacute;la (June 2019).   Both cases reinforced that any measure, including &lsquo;best practice measures&rsquo;, designed to avoid or reduce the effects on a Natura site cannot be considered during Stage 1 of the process (i.e. AA screening), but instead, can only be evaluated during the AA itself. <\/p>  <p>  As a result, my Department does not consider any relevant protective measure set out in the environmental guidelines or standards, or presented in the proposal itself, when undertaking AA screening of an application to ascertain whether there is a possibility of it having a significant impact on a Natura site, alone or in combination with other plans and projects. This means that a project can only be screened out if no possibility of a significant effect can arise, even if no protective measures were applied. <\/p>  <p>Case C-461\/17 Brian Holohan and Others v An Bord Plean&aacute;la   resulted in the following rules relating specifically to the AA process: <\/p>  <p>  1. Article 6(3) of [the Habitats Directive] must be interpreted as meaning that an &lsquo;appropriate assessment&rsquo; must, on the one hand, catalogue the entirety of habitat types and species for which a site is protected, and, on the other, identify and examine both the implications of the proposed project for the species present on that site, and for which that site has not been listed, and the implications for habitat types and species to be found outside the boundaries of that site, provided that those implications are liable to affect the conservation objectives of the site.<\/p>  <p>  2. Article 6(3) of Directive 92\/43 must be interpreted as meaning that the competent authority is permitted to grant to a plan or project consent which leaves the developer free to determine subsequently certain parameters relating to the construction phase, such as the location of the construction compound and haul routes, only if that authority is certain that the development consent granted establishes conditions that are strict enough to guarantee that those parameters will not adversely affect the integrity of the site.<\/p>  <p>  3. Article 6(3) of Directive 92\/43 must be interpreted as meaning that, where the competent authority rejects the findings in a scientific expert opinion recommending that additional information be obtained, the &lsquo;appropriate assessment&rsquo; must include an explicit and detailed statement of reasons capable of dispelling all reasonable scientific doubt concerning the effects of the work envisaged on the site concerned.<\/p>  <p>Regarding 1. above, as land use professionals, Registered Foresters are expected to keep abreast of developments impacting on their sector. This includes developments relating to environmental legislation, such as the cited ECJ rulings. To supplement this, a Circular to Registered Foresters (and other stakeholders) has been issued (Circular 08 \/ 2019, dated 23rd May 2019) to remind relevant parties developing an NIS, to catalogue the qualifying interests and to   \"identify and examine both the implications of the proposed project for the species present on that [Natura] site, and for which that site has not been listed, and the implications for habitat types and species to be found outside the boundaries of that site, provided that those implications are liable to affect the conservation objectives of the site.\"<\/p>  <p>  Forestry licences issued by my Department allow for operational flexibility, but only within the confines of the licence itself and its constituent safeguards (including guidelines, requirements, standards and (if relevant) scheme terms &amp;amp; conditions). DAFM is satisfied that licences issued establish conditions that are strict enough to ensure a degree of operational flexibility that will not adversely affect the integrity of the Natura site.<\/p>  <p>  The AA process necessitates the input of various experts, and my Department does not foresee expert input being rejected in relation to any individual file undergoing the process. However, DAFM is aware of this ruling and will comply accordingly, if the described situation arises. <\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, currently, my Department is developing processes and procedures and investing resources to enable the processing and approval of forestry applications, taking according of the above European and national rulings. This includes the development of Standard Operating Procedures, training for District Inspectors and Registered Foresters, investment in ecological expertise (including the recruitment of two addition ecologists for deployment within the Forestry Inspectorate), and the ongoing development of iFORIS, the GIS platform used by Inspectors to process files.  A categorisation of files affected by these requirements is also underway in order to best assess further action needed and by whom.<\/p>  <p>  I am fully aware of the concerns of stakeholders in relation to the AA process but we have an obligation for complying fully and completely with environmental requirements. My officials are in regular communication with stakeholders and they have been fully apprised of the issues involved and of my Department&rsquo;s efforts to address them.  <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, for my part, I have commissioned a consultant to review my Department's processes and procedures on forestry applications and approvals similar to an exercise undertaken in Scotland.  I expect to receive this report by the end of November and that it will provide an opportunity to make our processes more effective and efficient going forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111900079#WRX01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Data","counter":1217,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111900079#WRX01400"},{"type":"question","counter":1218,"qnumday":476,"qnumall":"[47089\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111900079#WRX01500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the number of ecologists employed in the forestry inspectorate by grade; and the targeted number of new ecologists to be hired; and the date on which the new hires will be operational.","asker":"1350","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1219,"content":"<p>My Department currently has two ecologists in the Forestry Inspectorate.

The retrofitting of existing dwellings to this new standard is challenging both technically and economically. There are very few examples of large scale passive house retrofit projects internationally. For that reason, it is difficult to place a precise estimate on the likely cost of upgrading all homes in Ireland.   The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, as required by the EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (2010\/31\/EU), has introduced new requirements for home renovation which came into force on 1 November 2019. The impact of this regulation is that when buildings are undergoing a renovation of more than 25% of the surface of the building envelope, the entire building will have to be brought up to a higher energy performance standard. The Directive also requires that all new buildings are nearly zero-energy buildings (NZEB) by 31 December 2020. <\/p>  <p>  The Climate Action Plan has committed to increasing the scale and depth of retrofit activity in order to meet our emissions reduction targets from the Built Environment. This will involve 500,000 homes being upgraded to a BER B2\/cost optimal or carbon equivalent by 2030. A cost-optimal analysis commissioned by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government (Cost Optimal Residential Report Ireland 2018) estimated the cost to achieve a B2 rating from a starting point of a D\/E rating to be in the range of &euro;21,000-&euro;39,000.

A central commitment under the Plan is Ireland&rsquo;s ambitious target of 70% of electricity demand by 2030 along with a suite of actions to deliver this at least cost.    The new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) is critical to delivering on the 70% RES-E target and is being designed to achieve its targets within a competitive framework which will put downward pressure on the costs to end consumers. The RESS auctions will ultimately determine the precise mix and cost of renewable projects and technology diversity, including solar and offshore wind, that will occur naturally as the scheme matures. <\/p>  <p>  Private sector funding through corporate contracting will also be essential for meeting higher levels of ambition to increase renewable energy supply. The Climate Plan commits to a 15% target for the renewable industry to develop projects through subsidy free corporate power purchase agreements by 2030.<\/p>  <p>  Long term decarbonisation of the electricity sector will require significant investment in Ireland&rsquo;s potential in offshore renewables including harnessing the potential to export power generated offshore to other EU Member States.

In 2018\/19, private, for profit provision accounted for 74% (3,397) of all services contracted to provide at least one of the DCYA funded programmes, with community providers accounting for the remaining 26% (1,201).  It is estimated that there were 206,301 children attending ELC and SAC services during 2018\/19. Over the entire programme year, nine in every ten enrolled children (185,971) participated in at least one of the DCYA funded programmes (ECCE, CCS (including CCSP and CCSU) or TEC) (181,329 between September 2018 and June 2019). Those who were not eligible for schemes were largely school-age children. <\/p>  <p>  Informal arrangements for ELC and SAC are also common, including childminders. The Department of Children and Youth Affairs' Draft Childminding Action Plan estimates approximately 19,400 childminders, though the figure may be far lower. <\/p>  <p>  Arriving at an average household figure depends on agreeing a set of assumptions, and therefore should be interpreted with some degree of caution. The OECD&rsquo;s international comparative dataset includes an indicator measuring the net costs paid by parents for full-time, centre-based provision, after any benefits designed to reduce the gross ELC and SAC fees. <\/p>  <p>  According to the data, families with two children aged 2 and 3, with parents aged 40, who are in full time work, earning the average wage, paid 22% of their net household income on ELC in 2018, down from 25% in 2015. The calculated value is &euro;13,056 in 2018, down from &euro;13,466 in 2015. Budgets 2019 and 2020, which saw a combined extra &euro;130m approximately added to the ELC and SAC budget, are not reflected in this calculation. <\/p>  <p>  At a national level, Pobal&rsquo;s Annual Sector Profile 2018\/ 2019 provides a range of service data. The average weekly fee for full day ELC\/SAC is &euro;184.36 before any Government subsidy is deducted. The average weekly fee for part-time ELC\/SAC is &euro;109.98, again before any Government subsidy is deducted. As in previous years, average fees are higher in urban areas than in rural areas (&euro;191.33 and &euro;165.76 respectively for full day care per week) and in private services than in community services (&euro;190.74 and &euro;168.12 respectively for full day care per week). The average weekly full day fees in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown are 66% higher than the lowest recorded for Leitrim (&euro;148.33). The part-time fees are 60% higher in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown than in Monaghan, where these are the lowest, at &euro;83.19. <\/p>  <p>  The two year ECCE programme is currently considered to save parents approximately &euro;5000 on their ELC costs. The new National Childcare Scheme being launched on November 20th marks a radical new departure for ELC and SAC in Ireland, creating an infrastructure from which universal and targeted funding can be provided to children and families. There has been a 138% increase in investment in ELC and SAC over the last 5 budgets and First 5, the Whole of Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families, published in 2018 committed to doubling funding again over the next 10 years. This should see the average household spend reducing significantly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111900084#WRCC00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Childcare Services Expenditure","counter":1505,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111900084#WRCC00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1506,"qnumday":575,"qnumall":"[47208\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111900084#WRCC00900","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the amount spent each year on subsidies for private childcare services.","asker":"1433","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1507,"content":"<p>There are approximately 4500 early learning and care and school age childcare services registered with Tusla, the Early Years Regulator.

Of these, 25,893 work directly with children which represents an increase of 2,006 staff or 8% on the previous year. This increase matches the number of children enrolled in childcare which increased by 9% from 186,190 in 2016\/2017 to 202,633 in 2017\/2018.<\/p>  <p>  Services are required to operate within regulatory minimum adult-child ratios. While I understand that some providers may be experiencing difficulties in recruiting staff, the figures do not suggest a shortage of suitably qualified staff. However, there may be difficulties in recruiting and retaining staff due to low wages and poor working conditions. I have implemented a number of initiatives to attempt to address these issues.<\/p>  <p>  In Pobal&rsquo;s latest Early Years Sector Profile Report (2017\/2018), the staff turnover rate stood at 24.7% which while still too high, represents a 3% improvement on the previous year. However, data from previous years suggests that half of those contained in the 24.7% figure have left the sector, with the other half joining other services.<\/p>  <p>  The basic qualification requirement to work in the sector is a qualification in early childhood care and education at Level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications. When this requirement was introduced, unqualified staff who planned to retire in the coming years were given the opportunity to sign a 'grandfather' declaration. These declarations remain valid until September 2021. Those who wished to upskill to meet these minimum regulatory requirements were able to access a Learner Fund which provided financial support.<\/p>  <p>  A Level 6 qualification is only a requirement for room leaders delivering the ECCE programme. The Pobal 2017\/18 survey indicated that 65% of those working in the sector in mid-2018 then had a relevant qualification at Level 6 or above, indicating that there were enough staff qualified at this level to meet requirements. However, I acknowledge the challenge many providers are reporting in retaining staff and recruiting new staff. <\/p>  <p>  The most recent data on pay and conditions indicates that the average hourly pay in early learning and care and school-age childcare is now &euro;12.55 (as of May 2019), which represents a 3% increase on last year. As the State is not the employer, my Department does not pay the wages of staff working in early learning and care settings, and I cannot set wage levels or determine working conditions for these staff.  I am, however, doing all that is in my power to improve wages and working conditions in the sector. My support for improved pay and conditions for early learning and care professionals has been explicit, as their role is critical to supporting children&rsquo;s development and delivering better outcomes for children and families.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2020 saw a 9% increase in investment in early learning and care and school age childcare. Additional investment of &euro;54.5m will bring spending to &euro;628m in 2020, a 138% increase in investment over five budgets. Specifically, I secured increased funding for the Sustainability and Sectoral Employment Order Support Fund for the sector. This will see funding to support sustainability rising from &euro;1.7m to &euro;2.2m per annum.<\/p>  <p>  Recent initiatives which may improve the recruitment issues include the drafting of a Workforce Development Plan which will aim to raise the profile of careers in the sector and to ensure sufficient numbers of staff at all levels within the sector over the decade ahead, and the appointment of an expert group to examine the current model of funding for early learning and care and school-age childcare and its effectiveness in delivering quality, affordable, sustainable and inclusive services.<\/p>  <p>  Other recent measures I have taken to assist employers in improving the attractiveness of working in the ELC sector include: a 7% increase in ECCE capitation in 2018; higher capitation payments for graduates and Inclusion Coordinators; support for school-age childcare which will make it easier to offer full-time, full-year employment contracts; and a pilot measure to fund participation in CPD.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111900084#WRCC01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Childcare Services Data","counter":1511,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111900084#WRCC01400"},{"type":"question","counter":1512,"qnumday":577,"qnumall":"[47210\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111900084#WRCC01500","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the estimated amount it would cost to establish a national childcare service with all childcare provided free at the point of use, including the hiring of new staff to meet existing demand.","asker":"1433","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1513,"content":"<p>I am not, currently, in a position to provide the cost of a free national childcare service.

At that time ECCE operated for a 38 week period, or one programme year.  For some children with special\/additional needs, attending preschool five days a week was not feasible and they were permitted to split their ECCE entitlement over two years, e.g. a child may have availed of three days a week ECCE provision in year one and two days a week in year two.

The lack of consistency of care caused by high staff turnover impacts directly on quality, while low wages are a constraint on plans to upskill and professionalise the workforce. The most recent data on pay and conditions indicates that the average hourly pay in early learning and care and school-age childcare is now &euro;12.55 (as of May 2019), which represents a 3% increase on last year.<\/p><p>As the State is not the employer, my Department does not pay the wages of staff working in early learning and care settings, and I cannot set wage levels or determine working conditions for these staff.  I am, however, doing all that is in my power to improve wages and working conditions in the sector. My support for improved pay and conditions for early learning and care professionals has been explicit, as their role is critical to supporting children&rsquo;s development and delivering better outcomes for children and families.<\/p><p>Budget 2020 saw a 9% increase in investment in early learning and care and school age childcare. Additional investment of &euro;54.5m will bring spending to &euro;628m in 2020, a 138% increase in investment over five budgets. The very welcome level of investment needs to continue if we are to offer services that are of high quality, affordable and accessible. However, increased investment by itself will not ensure that staff wages and conditions will improve.<\/p><p>My Department has set out its vision for the sector, and a roadmap to achieve it, in <i>First 5 <\/i>the whole-of-Government strategy for babies, young children and their families<i>.<\/i><i>First 5<\/i>recognises that the workforce is at the heart of high-quality early learning and care and school-age childcare and seeks to build &lsquo;an appropriately skilled and sustainable professional workforce that is supported and valued and reflects the diversity of babies, young children and their families&rsquo;.<\/p><p>In particular, <i>First 5<\/i>commits to a Workforce Development Plan to raise the profile of careers in the sector and to ensure sufficient numbers of staff at all levels within the sector. The Workforce Development Plan, work on which began recently, will set out plans to raise the profile of careers in the sector, establishing role profiles, career pathways, qualifications requirements, and associated policy mechanisms along with leadership development opportunities and work towards a more gender-balanced and diverse workforce.<\/p><p>Preparation of the Workforce Development Plan will involve close collaboration between the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Department of Education and Skills, and an extensive consultation process. To help ensure a strong consultation process, a Stakeholder Group comprising representatives from across the sector has been formed and will work alongside the Steering Group.<\/p><p>Delivering on a further commitment in <i>First 5, <\/i>I have also recently appointed an expert group to examine the current model of funding for early learning and care and school-age childcare and its effectiveness in delivering quality, affordable, sustainable and inclusive services. The Expert Group is independently chaired and includes national and international experts in early learning and care systems, funding and quality, economics, and policy experts from a number of Government Departments.<\/p><p>In Budget 2020, I secured increased funding for the Sustainability and Sectoral Employment Order Support Fund for the sector. This will see funding to support sustainability rising from &euro;1.7m to &euro;2.2m per annum. The fund will assist high quality services which are experiencing financial difficulties to transition themselves to a sustainable footing, and will also assist with needs arising in the event that the Labour Court introduces a Sectoral Employment Order, which I have repeatedly called for the sector to pursue. My Department will readily co-operate with such a process when it is under way.<\/p><p>Other recent measures I have taken to assist employers to improve the pay and conditions of their staff whilst also addressing administrative demands include: a 7% increase in ECCE capitation in 2018; higher capitation payments for graduates and Inclusion Coordinators; support for school-age childcare which will make it easier to offer full-time, full-year employment contracts; and a pilot measure to fund participation in CPD. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111900084#WRCC03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Childcare Services Inspections","counter":1532,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111900084#WRCC03500"},{"type":"question","counter":1533,"qnumday":584,"qnumall":"[47853\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111900084#WRCC03600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if her attention has been drawn to the fact that three of the four cr&egrave;ches (details supplied) are at the highest level and final stages of enforcement which includes proposals to remove and prosecute; the plans in place to facilitate families discommoded if the cr&egrave;ches are closed; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1231","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1534,"content":"<p>Tusla Early Years Inspectorate provides regular updates to my Department in relation to services that are being removed from the Register of early years services or are being prosecuted, and in relation to the ongoing work of Tusla's National Registration and Enforcement Panel. <\/p>  <p>  It is not possible for me to comment on individual services that may be subject to regulatory or prosecutorial enforcement actions as this may limit or prejudice the legal processes involved, which would not be in the best interest of children and families.<\/p>  <p>  Thirty City\/County Childcare Committees across the country are available to support parents and providers with issues relating to early learning and care and school age childcare.

As part of the agreement, the property owner then leases the dwelling to the local authority for use as social housing for a length that is linked to the value of the repairs but subject to a minimum of 5 years.

The local authority, or AHB, is the landlord to the social housing tenant and carries out all landlord obligations. <\/p><p>The RLS, Buy and Renew and long term leasing schemes are available in all local authorities, in both rural and urban areas. However, it is a condition of entry into all 3 schemes that the property is in an area with a social housing need and fulfils social housing demand.  <\/p><p>Since the launch of <i>Rebuilding Ireland<\/i>, in the region of 553 vacant homes have been re-introduced to the liveable housing stock, primarily through the Repair and Leasing, and Buy and Renew initiatives. Local authorities are also working hard to bring homes back into use by acquiring dwellings in unfinished estates, liaising with financial institutions on their vacant property portfolios and utilising CPO powers to acquire empty properties. These recovered properties aid in the ongoing effort to meeting our commitments under Pillar 5 of Rebuilding Ireland, which sets out a range of measures to assist in meeting Ireland&rsquo;s housing needs by ensuring that Ireland&rsquo;s existing housing stock is used to the greatest extent possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111900087#WRFF03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Commercial Rates Data","counter":1701,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111900087#WRFF03500"},{"type":"question","counter":1702,"qnumday":645,"qnumall":"[47130\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111900087#WRFF03600","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the amount received by Offaly County Council from commercial rates in each of the past three years and to date in 2019; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1217","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1703,"content":"<p>The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority.\u00a0 The annual rate on valuation (ARV), which is applied to the valuation for each property determined by the Valuation Office, to obtain the amount payable in rates, is decided by the elected members of each local authority during the annual budget process.<\/p><p>Rates income data are published by local authorities in their Annual Financial Statements, which are published as a matter of course on local authority websites.\u00a0 2018 is the latest year for which audited local authority Annual Financial Statement data are available.<\/p><p>The rates collected by Offaly County Council from 2016 to 2018 are set out in the following table. <table>    <tr>       <th>Offaly County Council<\/th>       <th>2016 <\/th>       <th>2017 <\/th>       <th>2018 <\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Rates collected <\/td>       <td>&euro;12,227,675 <\/td>       <td>&euro;12,862,574 <\/td>       <td>&euro;14,718,781 <\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111900087#WRFF03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1265"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Housing","counter":1704,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111900087#WRFF03800"},{"type":"question","counter":1705,"qnumday":646,"qnumall":"[47230\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111900087#WRFF03900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if any local authorities have commissioned the construction of zero carbon homes.","asker":"1433","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1706,"content":"<p>In line with the introduction of Part L of the Building Regulations, all social homes commencing construction from 1st November 2019 are being constructed to Nearly Zero-Energy Building Regulations, subject to transition arrangements.<\/p>  <p>  Nearly Zero-Energy Building (NZEB) means a dwelling that has a very high energy performance, as determined in accordance with Annex I of the EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive Recast (EPBD Recast) 2010\/31\/EU of 19th May 2010.

(CCMA) in the preparation of a consistent and evidence based approach to the various funding challenges facing the sector. This work has helped inform the decision making process to ensure that a coherent and sector wide view of the particular issues are presented. Of course, all such issues have to be considered within the parameters of the national and fiscal budgetary situation and the competing priorities presenting themselves at the wider Governmental level. <\/p>  <p>On its establishment, Irish Water was initially subject to commercial rates for 2014.  In November 2014, the Government announced a new package of measures related to the financing of Irish Water.  As part of these measures, section 12 of Water Services Act 2014 provided that Irish Water would not be rateable for the purposes of the Valuation Act 2001.  This decision to exempt Irish Water from commercial rates was made to ensure that households and businesses paying water charges at the time would not have to meet this cost.  Local authorities were compensated for this loss of revenue through the Local Government Fund. It was always the case that this compensation measure would only remain in place for as long as Irish Water was exempt from commercial rates. <\/p>  <p>  In July 2017 the CCMA submitted a report concerning rates on water infrastructure and the financial impact of the Irish Water rates exemption to my Department.  Among other things, it recommended that the exemption for Irish water from rates in the Water Services Act 2014 be reversed and that Irish Water be valued as a global utility undertaking in a similar manner to other national utility networks.  <\/p>  <p>  A new funding model for water services was developed in 2017 following on from the report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services, which was approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas in April 2017.  The Water Services Act 2017 was enacted on 17 November 2017 and implemented key features of this new funding model.  Section 61 of the Act contained a provision to remove the Irish Water exemption from commercial rates.  This was consistent with the general approach applicable to the infrastructure of public utilities.<\/p>  <p>  On 20 February 2019 the Minister for Justice and Equality made the Valuation Act 2001 (Global Valuation) (Irish Water) Order 2019 (S.I. No. 60 of 2019) which provided for the Commissioner of Valuation to carry out a valuation of relevant properties occupied by Irish Water.  The Order provided that the global valuation be made by reference to 31 March 2018 and entered in the Central Valuation List by 18 October 2019.  Further to this Order, the independent Commissioner for Valuation issued his preliminary national valuation on 18 July 2019.   Section 61 of the Water Services Act 2017 was commenced with effect 18 October 2019, when the valuation was then entered on the Central Valuation List.<\/p>  <p>  Earlier this year the CCMA submitted a further report on this subject to my Department, which highlighted the local government sector's concerns in respect of the rating of water and waste water infrastructure and the distribution of the Irish water valuation and considered the financial impact on local authorities.  Most recently, following the issue of the preliminary valuation certificate for Irish Water in July 2019, the CCMA submitted a report concerning rates income impacts and Irish Water.  <\/p>  <p>  In all engagement and communication on the rating of Irish Water and the cessation of compensation in lieu of rates from Irish Water, my Department indicated that it was actively monitoring the financial impact of this transition on individual local authorities in the context of their overall financial position. This is an ongoing process and engagement takes place on a bilateral basis between officials in my Department and individual local authorities. My Department has been in regular discussions with the nominated local authority representatives regarding the potential implications of the valuation of Irish Water from March 2019. These discussions took place during the Reval 2019 process and the development and passage of the Local Government Rates and Other Matters Bill, and had a particular focus on the financial implications for local authorities. I am satisfied that there was sustained and robust engagement with the local government sector on this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111900088#WRGG01850","answer":true,"speaker":"1265"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Traveller Accommodation","counter":1744,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111900088#WRGG01900"},{"type":"question","counter":1745,"qnumday":660,"qnumall":"[47471\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111900088#WRGG02000","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the Traveller accommodation allocations for each local authority for 2019; and the drawdown to date by each local authority in tabular form.","asker":"1215","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1746,"content":"<p>In accordance with the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998, housing authorities have statutory responsibility for the assessment of the accommodation needs of Travellers and the preparation, adoption and implementation of multi-annual Traveller Accommodation Programmes (TAPs) in their areas.

Nevertheless, in order to target SSF funding interventions, in October 2018, local authorities were invited to undertake an economic assessment of their sites to assess whether the provision of affordable homes was necessary and economically viable. \u00a0As part of that assessment local authorities were also asked to\u00a0consider the broader housing affordability within their area.\u00a0 19 local authorities returned economic assessments, this included Kilkenny County Council, who carried out assessments on two of its sites around which it was indicated affordability issues existed.<\/p><p>To date, I have allocated SSF funding of &euro;127 million, in support of 35 projects in 14 local authority areas, for infrastructure works that will see the\u00a0delivery of almost 3,200 affordable homes. \u00a0Of these 35 approved projects, one is located in Kilkenny City and was identified in the Council&rsquo;s economic assessment. \u00a0This site at Crokers Hill has received approval in principle for SSF funding of almost &euro;2m for infrastructure that will support the delivery of 26 affordable homes. \u00a0The overall cost and the timing of delivery for this project is contingent upon the completion of design, planning and procurement of the project in the first instance, and Kilkenny County Council and my Department are working to achieve delivery from this and other sites as quickly as possible. <\/p><p>I anticipate that a further call for proposals under the SSF will issue to local authorities in 2020. <\/p><p>Homes delivered under the SSF\u00a0are subject to the provisions of Part 5 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 which was commenced in June 2018.\u00a0 This legislation now provides the statutory basis for the delivery of affordable housing for purchase in the State. Regulations in respect of the making of Schemes of Priority were signed\u00a0on 12 March 2019, and these were issued to local authorities on 22 March 2019.\u00a0 The purpose of a Scheme of Priority is to set out the affordable purchase arrangements at local authority level.\u00a0 This includes the methodology that will be applied by local authorities to determine the order of priority to be accorded to eligible households where the demand for such affordable dwellings exceeds the number available.\u00a0 I can confirm that Kilkenny County Council submitted their Scheme of Priority to my Department\u00a0on 24<sup><\/sup>April 2019 which I subsequently approved on 29<sup><\/sup>April 2019.<\/p><p>In line with the legal requirements of the Affordable Dwelling Purchase Arrangements, further regulations will be put in place over the coming months regarding eligibility and other matters. When the operational procedures for the scheme are finalised, and before dwellings are made available for purchase under the scheme, a programme of communication will be undertaken by my Department and local authorities.<\/p><p>In addition to SSF, funding of &euro;200m has also been made available under the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF), which is also designed to activate housing supply by putting in place the enabling public infrastructure necessary to ensure that large scale development could take place on key sites in urban areas of high housing demand. 30 projects received final approval, at a total cost of &euro;195.71 million, of which &euro;146.69 million will be funded by the Exchequer with local authorities funding the balance. \u00a0These projects will stimulate development of approximately 20,000 housing units across 14 local authorities and approximately 7,800 of these homes will be offered at a discount on open market prices. \u00a0Kilkenny received approval for two projects; one in Western Environs and one in Ferrybank with a combined LIHAF funding of over &euro;9m to deliver a total of 730 homes by 2021. \u00a0Infrastructure works commenced on 4<sup>th<\/sup>March 2019 in Western Environs and in Ferrybank on 1 October 2019.

It is important to note that the limits introduced at that time also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.<\/p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.<\/p>  <p>  However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is under way. The review will also have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111900088#WRGG04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social and Affordable Housing Expenditure","counter":1767,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111900088#WRGG04313"},{"type":"question","counter":1768,"qnumday":669,"qnumall":"[47590\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111900088#WRGG04325","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the average cost per unit for social housing units under Part V in O'Devaney gardens; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1228","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1769,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware the development at O'Devaney Gardens is based on a tenure mix, which includes 30% of the homes on site to be designated as social homes.

I understand that the advice of the Council executive to the Council members at the meeting was that an exhaustive process had been undertaken over the last number of years and the delivery model proposed was considered the most effective way to develop the site both in terms of mixed tenure and from a financial perspective.<\/p>  <p>  This agreement will seethe development of 768 homes.  This will include a tenure mix which is structured to ensure community sustainability and comprising 50% private housing (411 homes), 30% (192 homes) social housing with the final 20% (165 homes) set to become affordable housing.  This is in line with the tenure mix previously agreed between the Council and my Department.  This approach was also agreed by the previous Council in 2017.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that on 4 November a group of Councillors including representatives of Fianna F&aacute;il, Labour, the Social Democrats and the Green Party, acting under the name of the 'Dublin Agreement Group', announced that an &ldquo;agreement has been secured&rdquo; to purchase of 30% of the total units available at O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens from the developer. However, as I understand it, this agreement has no legal basis, and presumably relies upon any purchaser paying the full open market price for these units. <\/p>  <p>  A number of weeks previously, I made myself available to meet with a delegation of Councillors in relation to O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens, but this offer was not taken up.  No information has been provided to me in relation to how it was envisaged such an approach would work in practice. More importantly the Councillors in question did not confirm from where the very significant capital funding required had been secured.

This grant funding is associated with the 165 more affordable homes for purchase that will be delivered on site at significantly below open market rates.  These 1, 2 and 3 bedroomed homes will be made available to purchasers at an average price of &euro;300,000 and in no circumstances will they cost more than &euro;310,000.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111900088#WRGG05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Adaptation Grant Eligibility","counter":1777,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111900088#WRGG05100"},{"type":"question","counter":1778,"qnumday":672,"qnumall":"[47612\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111900088#WRGG05200","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if a person is eligible to apply for the housing aid for older people scheme if they have lifetime right of residency; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1234","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1779,"content":"<p>The Housing Aid for Older People scheme provides grants of up to &euro;8,000 to assist older people, aged 66 or above, living in poor housing conditions to have necessary repairs or improvements carried out. <\/p>  <p>  The grant is available to eligible members of owner occupied private homes.

New projects emerging from this fund include Normal People, The South Westerlies In addition, under this scheme, in conjunction with RT&Eacute;, Screen Ireland funded the production of 4 television sitcom pilots, a scheme to support new Irish comedy. All four pilot episodes aired on RT&Eacute; this Autumn and one will be selected to go to full series. Through Screen Skills Ireland, the agency supports and develops the skillset for the independent production sector through training initiatives to enhance the creative, technical and business skills for television creatives and crew. This includes a structured Multi-Camera Drama Directors Training scheme, in partnership with RT&Eacute;, which took place in early 2019 as well as regular training courses for all areas of television production including: television production research, writing and structuring television drama and developing ideas for factual and entertainment programming. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111900089#WRHH01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Bodies Data","counter":1806,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111900089#WRHH02000"},{"type":"question","counter":1807,"qnumday":682,"qnumall":"[47412\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111900089#WRHH02100","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the institutions which are under her remit; the procedures in place to appoint persons to the board of each of the institutions; the appointments made to boards under the remit of her Department since January 2019; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1255","askee":"1243"},{"type":"speech","counter":1808,"content":"<p>I am advised that all appointments to State Boards under the aegis of my Department since 01 January 2019 are as set out in the table below. <\/p><p>The Public Appointments Service (PAS) operates a dedicated website, www.stateboards.ie, through which it advertises such vacancies.
