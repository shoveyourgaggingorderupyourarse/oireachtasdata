We have made significant progress in both the Oireachtas and the Government over that period.  For example, the Oireachtas unanimously declared a climate and biodiversity emergency and the Government published the scheme of the Bill which will revolutionise the way we deal with climate.  It will introduce, for the first time, five-year climate budgets and it will set a target for the 2050 net zero emissions that Ireland aspires to deliver.  That will be very significant.  It will also introduce entirely new accountability within the House.  Instead of this transition statement, which has come into disrepute within the House, each Minister will be sectorally responsible and there will be a powerful Oireachtas committee with similar powers to the Committee of Public Accounts which will oversee our responsibilities in respect of climate.  That will be a very significant change for the House.<\/p>  <p>  We have also passed the commitment to a carbon price, which is the first increase of that carbon price and that money is hypothecated, as economists would say.  All the proceeds are being used to drive on climate action, either in the form of just transition such as the significant packages for the midlands, or by supporting those who are worst equipped to fund such changes with schemes like the better energy, warmer homes scheme or the fuel scheme, and increasing our activities in all types of measures that deliver climate action.<\/p>  <p>  Another very significant milestone is the signing of the contract for the national broadband plan, which we signed in January.  People will see how significant broadband has been over the course of the Covid-19 crisis in providing an alternative to our conventional ways of travelling and working, which are highly carbon-dependent, by using remote working opportunities.  Such opportunities have certainly revolutionised the way people are now working. <\/p> <p>It will be a challenge to try to retain those structural changes, but we have shown the potential that exists if we go down the line of having every premises in the country connected to high-speed broadband.  That can have a significant impact on the way we do business.<\/p> <p> In that intervening period, Ireland also signed up to the EU Green Deal, which is an ambitious statement from the new President of the European Commission.  Europe had a target of a 40% reduction on 1990 levels and has increased this to between 50% and 55%.  The latter represents a significant step upwards and will require Ireland to take a significant step beyond what is contained in the climate action plan.  Work on how that will be done is ongoing.<\/p> <p> It is worth giving the House an account of some of the changes we have made in the Department.  The first new renewable energy auction has been published and we will shortly be receiving applications.  It has a 10% pot for solar energy, as well as an open competition in respect of other renewables.  The House will be glad to learn that it also has a reservation for renewables generated by community organisations.  There will be a community gain of &euro;2 for every megawatt hour generated and that money will go into a fund to benefit communities.  Agreement was not reached by the European Union on this occasion regarding a community participation element whereby a shareholding element could be obtained by a community.  A design was developed but because there is a state aid element, approval has not yet been granted.  It is something we will persist with for the next round.<\/p> <p> At the end of June we will publish a waste and circular economy strategy which will seek to deliver on our ambitions, such as in the area of eliminating all non-recyclable plastics, halving food waste and so on.  Many ambitious changes are planned.  The retrofit task force and the &euro;20 million midlands pilot initiative are well advanced, but unfortunately Covid-19 has put paid to hitting the ground with the midlands programme.  The work on designing an aggregated scheme so that we could treat areas in very large packages and have work on very substantial numbers of homes done together to a high level is well advanced and will be essential to our longer-term ambitions.<\/p> <p> The House knows we have signed an agreement on the interconnector with France.  This will be a significant project.  We have issued the new arrangements for renewable heat.  We have started the roll-out of new electric vehicle chargers with the ESB and local authorities have started the roll-out relating to the commitment over the next couple of years to provide 1,200 local authority and 700 ESB chargers.  The first major hub on the N7 is at an advanced stage of preparation and will shortly go live.<\/p> <p> We have committed to the extension of the smoky coal ban and have significantly developed the just transition package.  The closure of a power station in the midlands was accelerated due to the decision of An Bord Plean&aacute;la and we have put in place a just transition package, which is now live in the midlands, in terms of applications for funds.  The restoration of bogs has commenced under the contract from the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.<\/p> <p> The other encouraging thing is that the most recent data shows that 2019 saw the largest ever reduction in carbon generated from energy use.  This is a significant milestone.  The electricity sector is showing a very strong performance as we increasingly displace fossil fuels with energy from renewable sources.<\/p> <p>Renewable energy comprises approximately 36% of what we generate and we need to accelerate that to reach the 70% target in the climate action plan.<\/p> <p> Obviously, 2020 is important because it is the year in which calculations will occur to decide the shortfall.  The shortfall was predicted to involve a fine of between &euro;6 million and &euro;13 million on the carbon emissions side.  In light of the situation that obtains this year, it will certainly be less than that, although the more significant fines will probably apply to Ireland in respect of the renewable target where we will have a shortfall.<\/p> <p> Work is continuing on the national climate and energy plan to be submitted to the EU.  Both it and the long-term strategy require sign-off by a new Government.  They are somewhat delayed.  We have published the 12 sectoral adaptation plans, which involve each of the sectors and every part of Government.  They go across four themes: our natural and cultural assets; water and flood; critical infrastructure; and health.  Those are the four themes in respect of which we have 12 separate strategies to anticipate the adverse impact that may come with climate change and to fortify our infrastructure against them.<\/p> <p> The four climate action regional offices are operational.  These cover the local authorities of Mayo, Dublin Cork and Kildare.  I have been very keen to have a very detailed and rolling programme of consultation with people both sectorally and regionally, with young people and with various interests.  We have had more than a dozen of those consultations, as well as the big more formal events such as that held in Croke Park before we launched the climate action plan.  It is really important to bring people with us on what is a very challenging journey.<\/p> <p> This is the biggest challenge of our generation.  It will require people to change the habits of a lifetime.  It will require mobilising large amounts of capital to redirect the economy and society.  It will require people accepting different infrastructure from what they are used to.  It is really important that we in the Oireachtas provide leadership on that journey.  I look forward to working with Deputies on all sides to ensure that the resolution passed in the previous D&aacute;il to address the climate challenge becomes the lodestar of this D&aacute;il as we seek to demonstrate to our people, as well as to the wider world, that we are taking this threat to our environment deadly seriously.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000003#A00400","speaker":"1549","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1591778400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Deputies Lahart, &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, Flaherty and Chambers.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the opportunity to participate in the discussion on the annual national transition statement, which includes an overview of climate change mitigation and adaption policy measures adopted to reduce emissions and greenhouse gases.  This is only a policy statement as enunciated in the introduction to the actual report.  It is not about implementation.  The entire report is only fluff and puff.  It would be far better if the legislation required a report on activities specifically, rather than an annual policy statement.  This House is great at annual policy statements but not half as good at ensuring that they are actually implemented.<\/p>  <p>  I want to deal with two topics only.  The main gap in this report is that there is no significant reference to the carbon tax collected in 2019 or any previous year.  One would almost think the Government was starting to embark on the road to collect carbon tax.  The Revenue Commissioners have confirmed that in 2018, some &euro;441 million in carbon tax was collected.  I am putting on my hat as a former Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts where we had detailed discussions on this exact topic with the ESRI, the Revenue Commissioners and other experts.<\/p> <p>They told us that in 2019 Revenue were expecting to collect approximately &euro;500 million in carbon tax.  There is no reference to that in this report, to where this money came from, or to where it was spent and utilised.  This report is fundamentally flawed.  I am far more concerned about the serious issues that are not in the report rather than what is actually printed in this lovely policy statement.<br\/><br\/>Over the past five years more than &euro;2 billion has been collected in carbon tax from Irish taxpayers.  There is no reference to where this was spent.  There was never an accounting system or a system of reporting to the Oireachtas as to where that &euro;2 billion was spent.  I acknowledge that as a result of pressure from Fianna F&aacute;il, in the most recent budget for 2020, where an extra &euro;90 million is going to be collected, the allocation of this money is to be given in the report with reference to the transition fund.  There is no mention of the other &euro;500 million that is and has always been collected.  The Minister has been collecting over the years a great deal of money in carbon tax on petrol, diesel, marked gas oil, kerosene - home heating oil - natural gas and solid fuels, but without any specifics as to where this has actually been spent and used to meet the objectives of this legislation.  This report is therefore fundamentally flawed and is only huff and puff as far as I am concerned.<br\/><br\/>I will discuss now the EU emissions trading system, which is actually referred to in this report.  Reading the short paragraph which defines the EU emissions trading system, it states that the EU trading system is:<\/p><blockquote>\tThe EU Emissions Trading System ... is the main cornerstone of the EU&rsquo;s policy to combat climate change and operates on the &quot;cap and trade&quot; principle, where a cap is set on the total amount of emissions that can be emitted by installations beyond which allowances must be purchased.  This cap is reduced over time, incentivising a reduction in emissions. <\/blockquote> <p>It goes on to say that there are 103 such facilities licensed in Ireland under this legislation.  These include the main power generation facilities, major construction projects, utilities, hospitals, and other major emitters of carbon.  This is very interesting and a little bit of not giving the full picture.  Again it is a case of what the Minister did not say.  He gave credit to us for reducing our carbon emissions in 2019 in the energy sector.  That is because Moneypoint was closed.  He can claim no credit because the facility was out of action, and yet we are using it as a reason to say we were brilliant last year.  What the Minister did not say, and I am saying it, because it is a fact, and I am putting it on the public record, is that the carbon that was not emitted from Moneypoint last year can be carried forward by the ESB to overproduce carbon emissions next year and can be offset against future emissions.  The company also has the option of selling it on the international EU trading system.  There is a lot of hocus-pocus going on here when it comes to meeting actual targets.<br\/><br\/>Essentially, when it comes to the emissions trading system, there are 103 facilities in Ireland and thousands across Europe that have a cap on what they can produce and that must purchase these emission credits if they go over the cap, and we are saying to the biggest 103 polluters in the country that they can pollute all they like, and if they go over their limits, they can purchase carbon credits from another country as their way of buying out their carbon reduction obligations.  This is a simple statement of fact and is what we are not hearing today.<br\/><br\/>There is only one organisation that I do want to compliment under the partnership bit on this and that is the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, which is the competent authority to ensure compliance.  I am pleased to see that in 2018 - again we got this information at the Committee of Public Accounts - that St James&rsquo;s Hospital was fined &euro;210,000 for breaching its emissions targets and because it had not purchased carbon credits at European level.  Vodafone was also fined &euro;51,000.  I do know that Vodafone paid up its money, and we were told at the Committee of Public Accounts that a payment plan was in place for St James&rsquo;s Hospital.  I am sure that has been done.<br\/><br\/>I am far more interested in seeing a report from the Minister in future, and this would be essential for any new Government, that lays out and explains to the D&aacute;il and to the public where the &euro;600 million that will be collected in carbon tax this year will go.  The report before us only focused on the &euro;19 million because we forced the Minister to do it, and the big picture is totally outside it.  I want fewer fluffy policy statements and more specific reports on these issues in future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000005#C00200","speaker":"1590","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1591779300,"counter":13,"content":"<p>Like my colleague, I want to huff and puff, but I will take the opportunity to advocate for the cycling argument.  The transition statement on climate action provides us with an opportunity to look at the opportunities provided by Covid-19, the opportunities provided in a crisis, the changing behaviour of the public, especially over the past couple of months, and the reluctance of some members of the public, and regrettably for the immediate future, to take to public transport in huge numbers until we get some kind of resolution to the crisis.  There is an opportunity but also an issue.  There is an opportunity to really embed the change in pedestrian and cycling behaviour that has grown among the public, but we also need to tackle the attraction of people taking to their cars to come back into the city as they return to work, and it is very welcome that they are returning to work.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to focus on Project Ireland 2040 in the two minutes I have, and it is ridiculous to have just two minutes in which to contribute to this debate.  Project Ireland 2040 does not mention e-bikes.  On the science of e-bikes the Minister talks of them being optimum for journeys from 10 km to 15 km.  We need to tax incentivise those.  Sales of e-bikes during Covid-19 have grown exponentially.  Some of the sellers and providers are running out of them.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport of course had very little to say about the issues of transport for four years, and he never moved on the e-scooters.  The Minister went out to public consultation and never came back with a resolution.  It is well past time to embed this and to regulate them.  A huge amount of innovation is taking place in this space.  We talk about e-cars, and the Minister has set targets for e-cars, but the plan does not mention e-motorbikes, which are a coming phenomenon also.  These are relatively cheap and incredibly efficient, while reducing carbon in their own way.  There are no measures, however, in this regard.  Any of the measures taken in the past number of weeks have been taken by the local authorities, on which I commend them.<\/p>  <p>  A number of measures need to be taken, and I have produced a document on behalf of Fianna F&aacute;il on mobility and cycling connected to Dublin.  We need to look at safety and basic things, if one can believe it, in relation to signage.  We need to look at secure parking facilities.  There is one public bicycle-parking facility in this town.  Just one.  If we want to encourage people to take to bikes in greater numbers and use them to commute to work and for leisure activities then we need to take some measures.  We need to undertake immediate research and investigate exactly why women are reluctant to cycle.  There is an opportunity now.  During Covid-19 women, children and young families took to bikes in big numbers.  We need to look at tax incentives and not just the cycle to work scheme.  We need to look at tax incentives for employers to encourage their employees to replace their cars and to come to work on their bikes.  The time to move is now.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, said that we need to change the habits of a lifetime.  People have done that in their hundreds of thousands in the past two months.  It does not requires the millions of euro the Minister is talking about.  These are small measures that could be incentivised quite quickly and would have a dramatic reduction in carbon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000007#E00100","speaker":"1572"},{"type":"speech","time":1591779300,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I wish this was a real question and answer session where we had an opportunity to tease things out.  I will raise a number of issues.  Obviously, we must reduce our carbon footprint and we need to get on with the job.  In doing so we must involve communities.  There are two specific issues.  One is on community gain.  Who will get to spend the money?  Will companies get to spend the money they will be statutorily obliged to spend, or will they be told to hand that money over to some entity such as a Leader company or a local authority to spend?  I do not like the idea of the big companies coming with largesse they may be statutorily obliged to spend.  How does one define the community that should gain because of the pain?  That issue needs to be clarified to be clear.  There is a fair spend of it.  There is another issue in this regard.  I take it this will extend to offshore wind generation.  Again, it becomes even more important to define which communities will gain.  Will it be the coastal community or, in some great metamorphosis, will the companies manage to transfer the money far away from the local community that has been impacted?<\/p> <p>On the issue of feed-in, I heard the Minister speak of community involvement in energy.  The other element of this is micro-generation, where individuals, particularly in rural Ireland, can get involved either through solar or wind energy.  What is the situation in respect of a good, decent feed-in tariff which they have in other countries?  There are very good models of this.  We do not need to reinvent the wheel.  It could be hugely attractive.  People could produce enough electricity for their own uses, for charging up their motor vehicles and for feeding into the tariff when they do not need the electricity.  What is the policy on a feed-in tariff for micro-generation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000007#E00200","speaker":"1575","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1591779900,"counter":16,"content":"<p>As a native of Leinster where peat can be found in the veins of most families, it is with a heavy heart that I accept the closure of our bogs for commercial power generation.  However, that does not mean I accept the manner in which this process has been covertly fast-tracked, nor do I accept the shabby treatment of Bord na M&oacute;na workers.  We are gambling a great deal on the just transition fund because at the moment not a single cent has been poured back into our beleaguered community.  I am conscious that a raft of Longford projects are due for submission for the first round of applications on Friday.  Collectively, these projects could be transformative but, as a matter of urgency, we need to start seeing the investment flowing into our community.<\/p>  <p>  The scale of the compensation package on offer is by no means comparable to that available to other European companies which are exiting the coal industry.  Longford and the midlands will not be bought for a fraction of what we have contributed to this country over the past 70 years.  It is important that we stop viewing the just transition fund as merely a carbon-reduction plan because it is about much more.  I appreciate it is about the future but specifically it is about the future for my community, a community that has to stand back and watch as one of its largest industries is dismantled.  I would like to see a commitment in budget 2021 that Longford County Council will be compensated for a &euro;1 million reduction in its rates bill.<\/p>  <p>  We also need to see full buy-in from all Government agencies.

That decision needs to be revisited, not only as part of a just transition training programme, but also as part of the recovery programme.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I hope, and the local community in Lanesborough expects, the ESB will stand back and allow the local community an opportunity to formulate plans and alternative uses before the semi-State company presses ahead with plans for the demolition of the &euro;200 million power station in our village.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000008#F00200","speaker":"1597"},{"type":"speech","time":1591779900,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I am delighted to hear that in next year's 2020 statements we may not see any huff and puff and Fianna F&aacute;il will blow the house down and usher in a new level of transparency where we will have action plans, implementations and costings.

On the same page, it is stated that \"the 2030 reduction targets\", under what we signed up to with the EU, \"require that Ireland reduce its non\u2010ETS emissions by 30% on 2005 levels by 2030\".  There is much talk about a 6% or 7% reduction in carbon emissions targets.  Going back to something that was said earlier, we have not yet seen any modelling done by Departments showing year-on-year how that reduction in targets is going to be achieved.  We have also not been given any costings.  What is the plan and where is it?  I ask that because when we discussed this issue with departmental officials in recent weeks and months, they told us that in some areas the modelling has not been done.  When we look at all the areas, such as agriculture, transport, residential, commercial and non-energy intensive industry, where we have to achieve a reduction of 6% or 7%, whatever the figure parties might settle on, reaching that target will require huge change.  It will require transformative change and we want to see that change, but we also have to see what is necessary to make that change happen.  What is the modelling and where is it?  If it exists, what is it Department by Department?  This is an opportunity.  I agree that this is 70 pages of fluff.  There is not much in this report.  The crux of this matter, the real issue, is how we get from A to B.  How do we get from having a target to actually reducing our emissions?  There is no point having these targets if there are no implementation plans and actions.  Has the modelling been done?  If it has been done, how can we achieve those targets on a percentage basis year-on-year?  Where is that information?

The purpose of the climate action plan was to get us back on a track where we would wipe out that deficit.  That plan has been published and, roughly speaking, it indicates a 3.5% annual reduction in our emissions.  It allocates them to each sector, with specific measures outlined as to how the reductions will be delivered.

I hope the Minister will take some pointers on this issue.  Rural communities do not wish to be dumping grounds for pylons, wind turbines, battery storage plants or forestry.  All Members know of instances where communities have not been properly consulted and are left to battle big companies, sometimes having to go all the way to the High Court in order for justice to be done.  This is not about saying \"No\" to renewables, but it must be about proper planning, proper oversight and consultation from the very beginning.  We need to bring communities with us.<\/p>  <p>  In recent years in particular, there has been a steady increase in applications for forestry in parts of counties Roscommon and Galway.  We need to ensure that proper regulations are in place to make certain that no one area is targeted and blighted with forestry.  We also need to look at other options, such as offshore wind energy generation.  Ireland is one of the only countries in the EU with an Atlantic coastline, but the option of offshore generation has not been developed.<\/p>  <p>  During the general election campaign, I met a young woman from just outside Ballinasloe who was having difficulty obtaining planning permission to build a house on her farmland in order to allow her to continue farming close by.  There is a concern that local authorities are moving away from one-off housing, which will mean an end to rural communities.  We should be sustaining and supporting those communities.  Not everyone wants to live in Dublin or another urban centre.<\/p>  <p>  Another worry is the continued targeting of farmers when it comes to climate action.  Farmers must not pay the price for climate action. In many cases they simply cannot afford to do so.  Whatever Government is in place for the negotiations on the new Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, will need to bear that in mind because we know that farmers have been threatened with significant cuts under it.  We cannot take from farmers the subsidies on which they depend while also expecting more and more from them.  Farmers need to be incentivised to implement practices to reduce carbon emissions and rewarded when they do so.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to raise the issue of illegal dumping.  This problem appears to be getting worse in many rural areas.  There are several black spots in counties Roscommon and Galway.  Two weeks ago, a litter warden told me that, basically, sending a warning letter is all they can do in many cases.  If that is the law as it stands, then that law needs to be changed.  Local authorities need far stronger enforcement powers and they need to be resourced to ensure they have an adequate number of litter wardens per county.  Part of that solution should be to bring control of waste collection back under local authorities.<\/p>  <p>  Many rural towns and communities have not experienced any recovery whatsoever and the Minister needs to be mindful of that in the context of climate change actions.  I ask that he consider rural-proofing climate action measures.  We have a significant amount to do, but we need to bring people with us, including rural towns, villages and communities, farmers, Bord na M&oacute;na workers and, of course, the young people I commend on having opened many eyes to the need for immediate action.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000010#H00300","speaker":"1604"},{"type":"speech","time":1591780800,"counter":32,"content":"<p>The Minister has 30 seconds to reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000010#H00400","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1591780800,"counter":33,"content":"<p>I fully accept that we need consultation in the areas referred to by the Deputy.

It has the potential to provide an even greater amount of power.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy is correct that the concentration of forestry is a source of significant resistance.

It was based on viewing forestry not only as a commercial enterprise, but as a way to ensure biodiversity and provide an amenity for communities.  I have written to Coillte regarding Oldcourt woods at Garryduff in Rochestown.  It is an area of considerable biodiversity in spite of its relatively small size.  It is home to a variety of squirrels, including the increasingly rare red squirrel, as well as jays, rabbits, foxes and, possibly, badgers.<\/p> <p>The proposal to clear-fell here is a huge concern to residents and has been likened to a scar, in part because of the last road that went through these woods, and it is something people do not want to see repeated.  The road is unnecessary and the replacement of conifers with broadleaf trees can take place gradually.  It is also important to note where this is.  There has been enormous development in this area and the city has sprawled out to it, although it is 8 km from the city centre.  There has been huge development.  It is crucial to maintain an oasis of calm and tranquillity as our cities grow, particularly near areas where there are large populations.  I note that Cork City Council on Monday night voted in favour of seeking that the woods be handed over to the city council as an amenity.  I ask the Minister to intervene with Coillte to make it aware that he believes woodlands near urban areas are scarce resources to be cherished.<\/p> <p> I wish to raise one other issue and I will give the Minister a chance to respond.  There has been a lot of talk regarding Government formation and what that might mean for road projects.  While I support increased investment in public transport, balanced regional development, particularly in the Munster region, needs certain key projects to go ahead.  I would be concerned that projects such as the Dunkettle interchange or the M28 could be casualties.  Can the Minister reassure me that such projects as these, which are provided for in the development plan, will go ahead?<\/p> <p> I will make a final point on roads.  An awful lot of the money that is spent on roads is not necessarily to do with cars.  I can think of a project in my constituency, the L2455, which might not sound like much but is a multi-million euro project.  It is all about ensuring that residents can walk outside of their homes from the estates they live in because currently they can only travel by car, given it is right at the edge of the city and people cannot get outside their estates in Lehenaghmore and Lehenaghbeg except by car.  That is not acceptable.  Road projects like that have to be protected.<\/p> <p> In the time remaining I ask the Minister to respond on the issue of the woods and on whether he will intervene with Coillte and also in regard to protecting those projects outlined in the development plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000010#H00600","speaker":"1460","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1591781400,"counter":36,"content":"<p>While I fully accept the value of woodlands in urban areas and the importance that we, in our urban living, put on natural resources, I am not in a position to comment on the specific case the Deputy raises.

We have seen significant progress in balanced regional development in recent years and we have to sustain that.  In my area, when I was responsible for enterprise, we created for the first time regional enterprise strategies that have been very successful.  The Department of the Minister, Deputy Michael Ring, has been very vibrant in producing schemes that support rural and village communities and town centre revival and we need to see more of that sort of connection.<\/p>  <p>  From a climate perspective, rural Ireland also has to recognise that change has to be made and structural changes will have to happen in our rural communities.  To go back to the point made by Deputy Kerrane, it is of course important that we bring people with us but we cannot pretend structural change is not going to happen, so it is about finding how we deliver that structural change, some of which is difficult to get one's head around.

One of the positive benefits has been the reduction in greenhouse emissions and their impact on climate change.  Many people I know have not filled up their car since March.  Working from home is no longer niche; it is now a revolution in how we work.  The majority of people, some 59%, are happier working from home and surveys show that not having to face the daily commute is the top benefit of working from home.<\/p>  <p>  It is not just working from home that has changed.  Over 250,000 people are now cycling more compared with this time last year, which is an amazing statistic.<\/p> <p>Restrictions on travel have revealed what is available to us on our doorsteps as we shop locally and explore local different walks.  For many people, plans for holidays are now focusing on Kerry rather than the Canaries.<\/p> <p> As we emerge from this crisis and rebuild our society I ask the Minister the following.  What lessons can we learn to permanently reduce our greenhouse emissions?  Can he outline the estimated reduction in greenhouse emissions since March?  Can he outline what plans he has to make some of these changes permanent to support working from home, which is a revolution, support the increase in cycling and encourage staycations and shopping locally to continue into the future?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000011#J00300","speaker":"1566","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1591782000,"counter":39,"content":"<p>As the Deputy has recognised, remote working and remote delivery of health services are really transformative opportunities.  In the health area they have taken huge pressure off our hospital system.  We are beginning to see that digital technology can revolutionise our environment.<\/p>  <p>  For remote working, the estimate is that 10 KW hours per remote worker - a person who opts for that - per day is what is saved.  I have asked my Department to calculate what that will be in carbon emissions but it is significant.  If we cut our travel reliance it would be a very significant emission reduction. <\/p>  <p>  In terms of what we have calculated, the only work that I have seen is from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, and its numbers are running around 6% or 7% but we do not know how the year will end up.  Remote working definitely has had an impact on emissions but we will not know that until later in the year.  Obviously I do not think anyone would want the way in which we achieve our emissions to be by having 1 million people effectively furloughed, on furlough or whatever the term is, either on Covid payments or with their employers very much limping along, but we can learn.  <\/p>  <p>  There are many other structural changes.  As people start to re-evaluate their lives and the way they live them then not only will there be remote working but one will see different changes.  People will recognise the merit of buying local so I think there will be a stronger emphasis on local purchasing and local materials.  Obviously many countries will be re-evaluating their supply chains.  That is not all good from an Irish perspective.  There will be a re-evaluation of where we source our materials and how one delivers security will become more important so there are changes there.<\/p>  <p>  I would be very much saying to people that, as they look to the coming years, they need to make structural decisions that put their homes, farms or enterprises into a stronger position in the face of the climate challenge and this pause is a very good time.  I would be urging enterprise agencies, as part of their mandate to tackle climate, to ensure that for any company they support they would do an audit of how it is on climate resilience, energy efficiency and switching to renewable options.  The same is true of homes.  This time has been a reminder of the frailty of the environment we live in.  People need to look at their lifestyles, as we reopen, to see what from the good practices that we have learned in the lockdown we can carry into more normal times.  The management of our waste is a case.  Many people being at home are not having the same food waste as they would have had when they lived their busy lives.  We have very high levels of food waste in this country and it is estimated to be about &euro;700 per household.  That is something people could seriously look at as a win:win, saving themselves money, saving on the production of food and saving the carbon impact of sending food waste to a dump or an incinerator.  <\/p>  <p>  There are many dimensions where we can start to look at how we embed the structural changes we need.  If anything good can come from Covid-19 it is for all of us to re-evaluate the way we relate to the environment around us and start to make those small changes.  We have talked of breaking the habits of a lifetime and those are important habits to seek to break.<\/p> <p>The challenge for the Government will be to ensure we protect those most exposed, vividly in the case of Bord na M&oacute;na workers, and to protect those least equipped to make the change.  I hope schemes such as the warmer homes scheme can help people to make these choices.  We have to make it easier for people.<\/p> <p> A lot of reference has been made to cycling as an alternative to cars.  I have been cycling in every day in recent weeks and it is a pleasure to do so.  The council has made provision to make it safer to do so.  This is something we can embed.  On the other hand, we have trouble with our public transport.  Despite it being the optimal way to travel, the social distance restrictions are creating real problems.  There are many things we can do and the challenge for the House will be to identify those pathways and bring people with us along them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000012#K00200","speaker":"1549","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1591782300,"counter":41,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the effort made by the Minister and the Department in recent years.  Our task to reduce our emissions significantly is gargantuan and will require a significant and sustained effort from all members of society and sectors of the economy.  Effort should not and does not equate to burden.  Often we tend to forget this.  If we were to look at the benefits of acting on climate change, such as cleaner air and water, warmer homes and greater energy independence, on the whole our country stands to gain.  While my party is on record as wanting increased ambition I still think it is important to acknowledge the work done to date, particularly in getting various Departments to work together.<\/p>  <p>  The fact that the Minister is presenting his statement today with three of his ministerial colleagues to account for progress in line with the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015 and that we have dedicated almost a full day of D&aacute;il time to discussing the statements is an important step.  The establishment last year of the climate action delivery board, chaired by the Department and Department of the Taoiseach, is very welcome and provides a structure whereby actions can be co-ordinated and delivered at the highest levels of the Government.  I also support the establishment of a climate change unit in the Department of the Taoiseach, serving as the important liaison between relevant Departments.<\/p>  <p>  As each year passes our targets become ever more urgent.  The Minister acknowledged in his annual transition statement that our two biggest sources of emissions, agriculture and transport, which together make up well over half of our emissions, are increasing by almost 2% per year.  Every year that our emissions increase makes life more difficult for our young people and the future prospects of key sectors in the Irish economy.  We know not only that they will have to cut their emissions, but also that those cuts will become increasingly drastic as a result of the unsustainable trajectory we are on.<\/p>  <p>  Increasingly, the threat to our planet is becoming more tangible.  The news headlines keep coming.  An unprecedented temperature of 30&deg;C was recorded in the Arctic yesterday.  Closer to home, April and May were the driest two consecutive months in the Phoenix Park since records began.  We face a hosepipe ban due to water shortages.  There are fears about our fodder stocks this winter.  We have been speaking about decreasing emissions for so long that there is a temptation to be casual as we reduce the scale of ambition needed to a percentage figure, but the Minister will agree that whatever targets and measures are committed to we can be neither casual nor reductionist about them.  Averting dangerous climate change requires collective understanding and determination throughout the Irish economy and society.<\/p>  <p>  As I have said, the Department has made great strides in driving a whole-of-government approach to climate action but it is clear that a great deal of the action does not sit with the Department.  We need all sectors to play their part while making sure no sector is targeted unfairly and the most vulnerable in society are protected during our transition.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge the contribution of the electricity generation sector, which falls under the Minister's Department.  It is the one good news story we can celebrate and we should be proud that Ireland regularly tops the polls ahead of our European counterparts in the generation of electricity from wind energy.  We have been increasing our share of electricity that is generated from renewable sources and it looks like we were up to 36% at the end of last year.  We had a target of 40% by the end of 2020 and it looks like we will not quite get there but it is still impressive growth from our starting point of less than 5% in 2000.  We have seen innovation and dynamism from the private and public sectors in getting us to where we are today from the wind energy sector, the national grid and all of the vital national infrastructure that has got us so far.<\/p> <p> While I am aware that Ireland is often criticised for its domestic performance on climate change, I appreciate that our challenge to reduce emissions is unlike that of many other countries.  Our emissions challenge does not lie in decommissioning carbon intensive industries but in investing heavily in our housing stock and transport systems.<\/p> <p> We also have a major challenge with emissions from our agriculture sector.  Irish agriculture is striving to be as sustainable as possible.  I fully recognise that but we still have progress to make to reduce emissions in agriculture and to work with the sector to identify and pursue the most viable, fair and accessible options for our farming communities.<\/p> <p> I also wish to acknowledge Ireland's efforts to advance international climate action, chiefly articulated through the work of Irish Aid and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  The UN climate regime, while cumbersome at times, has been essential to driving collective, fair and country-led action.  As is often said, climate change does not respect boundaries or economic status, but the impacts of climate change are far more severe and devastating in the countries that have negligible greenhouse gas emissions, such as the countries that fall into the categories of the world's least developed countries and small island states.  The UN system gives these countries a fair and equal say on international climate action and we should continue to be fully behind that.<\/p> <p> By the same token, Ireland has a strong and well-proven reputation for supporting and standing with countries that are most vulnerable to climate change impacts.  While our island and economy are small in comparison with other big donors, our focus and concentration of support for the most vulnerable are applauded worldwide.  This has been most recently cited in an OECD peer review of our development assistance.  We have become a reliable and entrusted partner to some of the poorest countries around the world, and we should be proud of that.  In recent years, Ireland has increased its overseas development aid and international climate finance budgets.  These are welcome trends.  We are aware, however, that international development co-operation budgets tend to be among the first to face cutbacks in financially challenging times.  This tendency cannot and should not become reality in the upcoming efforts to rebuild the Irish economy after Covid-19.  Any backsliding on our commitments to meet our overseas development aid and climate finance targets would put a strain on that trust and undermine our voice in the EU and UN systems.  It also risks reducing the positive impact of Irish development co-operation in countries that continue to battle the consequences of a changing climate.<\/p> <p> It is often and correctly said that investments made today will have lasting impacts for decades to come.  I would also like to touch on the opportunities the country can avail of through the green recovery package that was recently presented by the President of the European Commission.  Under the recovery package, Ireland is in line to receive up to &euro;1.2 billion in EU grants.  This funding could make a phenomenal difference to building back our economy in a cleaner and fairer way.  We are at a juncture where we can use EU funding and national investments not only to build our economy back but to bring to life our ideas for safe and sustainable mobility, thriving local economies and improved energy infrastructure.<\/p> <p> Ba mhaith liom labhairt faoi mo Dh&aacute;ilcheantar, Cathair Luimnigh.

In some ways, my constituency is Ireland in microcosm, reflecting the mix between urban and rural.  When elected, I pledged to represent the farm families in my D&aacute;ilcheantar as vigorously as I would represent those who live in housing estates.  There are those who wish to use the climate as an excuse to drive a wedge between rural and urban communities.

Does it mean the aforementioned fee-and-dividend model, which is doing the rounds in public discourse at the moment, is a real prospect in terms of Government formation?

Many people talk about the 30% target, but that excludes electricity.  We have put in place measures that we believe will deliver that.  In any event, the EU has stepped up its ambition although it is using a 1990 target.  The EU ambition is for a 50% to 55% reduction on a 1990 target.  That is approximately 35% to 40% on where the EU is today.  We are going to have to step up our ambition in the same way.  We can expect that we have to come up with policy measures to match that.  That will be a challenge for us.<\/p>  <p>  Quite apart from the programme for Government negotiations, which I am not going to comment on, there are challenges for us in meeting the new European green deal and the likely allocation to Ireland of obligations under that new ambition.  That is why we have to come up with these measures.  The reality is that we will probably end up in a position like Denmark, which has committed to high ambition but cannot specify all of the pathway.  That is the reality we will have to follow.<\/p>  <p>  I will not comment on Government discussions around carbon pricing.  I know the Labour Party favours hypothecation.  That was ultimately the decision made by the last Government when carbon pricing was introduced.  Of the &euro;90 million that was raised, &euro;9 million was allocated to cycling and other allocations were made.  It is arguable that this helped people to make the change.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Sherlock raised the issue of eliminating combustion engines.  Eliminating new registrations of combustion engines from 2030 is still absolutely part of the target.  Increasingly, other members of the EU are seeking that the EU would adopt that target.  A lesser target has been a feature of the EU under which it would give longer before we make the transition away from combustion engines.  Anyway, as ambition rises other countries will also be adopting the Irish and Danish positions and many others.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000016#O00200","speaker":"1549"},{"type":"speech","time":1591783800,"counter":52,"content":"<p>I want to discuss sectoral issues.  I know the Minister is not the line Minister responsible for agriculture but he will have a view on agricultural emissions.  The Labour Party espouses a position whereby the Government needs to consult the stakeholders in agriculture to talk about agricultural emissions.  Everyone recognises that there has to be a reduction in agricultural emissions but how we get there remains to be seen.  I am hopeful that the State is moving beyond thinking and into real policy interventions.  We will all be aware of the good research conducted by Teagasc on how to reduce the emissions.  I am keen to know, if agriculture is seen as an emitter of greenhouse gas emissions, where the thinking is at present in respect of how the agriculture sector will move forward in playing its part in reducing those emissions.  We always defer to the academic research when it suits us.  Anyway, the Minister will be aware of a recent study carried out by UCC through the SFI Research Centre for Energy, Climate and Marine, MaREI, which is a renewable energy research entity.  The centre referred to how drastic reductions would need to be made.  In one instance a reduction in the national herd was cited if we are to meet the 7% target.  I do not believe we should get bogged down in over-simplifying our discussions around what the reduction looks like in terms of a requirement to reduce the national herd to reach output of X.<\/p> <p>This is why we need to have some sort of stakeholder process.  There needs to be a just transition for agriculture so that if we are to move to reduce emissions properly, we include the farming and agricultural community as part of that.  If it is the case that the next Government seeks to set a target of 7%, there will be a lot of worried people in rural Ireland.  If one of the policy outputs as a result of a new programme for Government is a drastic reduction in the national herd, that would have a massive impact in a very short space of time on rural communities.  People need to transition.  New schemes need to be devised and new financing options made available for people living in rural Ireland who would displace one form of activity for another, recognising their role as guardians within the rural economy.  I hope that we do not use very sharp implements that could have unintended consequences for citizens who live in the rural economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000016#O00300","speaker":"1514","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1591784100,"counter":54,"content":"<p>I have listened to all parties in this House, and no party that I have heard has indicated that it plans to set targets for a reduction of the national herd.

Many of those technologies are more uncertain than the ones that have been the focus of the climate action plan, that is, those in the category of better farming methods.  That said, there is no doubt that we can look at those other elements of the Teagasc marginal abatement cost curve, MACC.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy is right to say that consultation with stakeholders is going to be key in every sector, but particularly in agriculture where traditional methods of working are so interwoven into rural life.

Governments responded quickly and politicians worked together to agree measures that were based on science and the evidence of experts.  Our public sector and communities worked tirelessly to form a safety net around the most vulnerable.  We demonstrated that, together, we could face down this enormous challenge.  The response was not perfect and there are lessons to be learned, but I am reminded of something that Dr. Mike Ryan from the WHO said, \"Perfection is the enemy of the good when it comes to emergency management.  Speed trumps perfection.\"<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, when it comes to the climate and biodiversity crisis that we face here in Ireland, we are seeing neither speed nor perfection.  Instead, climate action in this country has amounted to an endless stream of reports, reviews and plans with very few results.  Where there has been legislation, it has been weak on targets; where there have been gaps, these have been filled with policies and plans; and where we have had policies and plans, we have had very little oversight of or accountability for their implementation.  Not surprisingly, this has led to very few results in the five years since climate action was first legislated for.<\/p>  <p>  Take for example the 2014 national policy position and the 2017 national mitigation plan, both of which were wholly unambitious.  They have now been superseded by commitments in the Government's climate action plan.  This plan, however, has never been put on a statutory footing and is not linked to the ongoing preparation of the national mitigation plan or long-term strategy.  Soon there will be a national energy and climate plan under the EU clean energy package, which will produce yet another separate climate strategy whose statutory basis is in EU rather than national law.<\/p>  <p>  We have been left with a web of disjointed and incoherent policies.  One's head would actually spin at the different streams and the number of documents, and while some of them are ambitious, the follow-through actions are missing.  Good climate action policy requires good legislation.<\/p> <p>Without that legislation, policies and plans will merely amount to pure rhetoric and a sluggish approach to climate change.  They will not provide the sense of urgency that we require at this point.  Strong, target-driven legislation will be the central driver in the delivery of our national and international climate action obligations, but we remain without this for the time being.<\/p> <p> The climate action (amendment) Bill has been left in limbo.  It would have provided a robust framework that was reinforced by five-year carbon budgets, set out key sectoral targets and provided the Oireachtas with oversight and the powers we required.  For the fifth year in a row, however, we are participating in a debate on an annual transition statement in the absence of the implementation of effective legislation.  In essence, this is our environmental Groundhog Day.<\/p> <p> We need the implementation of strong, target-driven legislation that is backed by science to help us achieve our climate action and biodiversity objectives.  Biodiversity absolutely needs to be included in these discussions.  We should not be talking about the climate crisis without also referencing the biodiversity crisis that we face.  I welcome that the House last year declared a climate and biodiversity crisis, but we need to move on.  The two major issues are intertwined and cannot be dealt with independently of each other.  We need policy and legislative coherence on them.<\/p> <p> The transition statement references biodiversity, but it is weak and minimal in that regard.  Of all the actions in the climate action plan, biodiversity is not referenced once.  There is some discussion about green schools and agriculture, but the focus we need on biodiversity is not present.  There is a sectoral adaption plan for biodiversity under the transition statement, but we will not have the opportunity to discuss it with the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht today.  That is a major gap in this debate on the transition statement and demonstrates that biodiversity is not being taken seriously in our considerations on climate action.<\/p> <p> Biodiversity and nature-based solutions are key to addressing climate change adaptation and mitigation and allowing nature to be the solution to a multitude of the challenges we face.  They provide carbon storage potential, flood management, soil stability, water management and erosion reduction, but these are just a few of the benefits that we can get from using nature to address climate change.  Since there will also be the biodiversity benefits, it would be a win-win for the environment.<\/p> <p> In recent days, it has been reported that seagrasses are 30 times more efficient at capturing and storing carbon than tropical forests, yet we do not have a full picture or understanding of where our seagrass populations are and their full extent.  We certainly do not have management plans in place for them and we do not afford them any protection through marine national parks or no-take zones.  Seagrasses are only one example - there is a multitude of examples across our natural world that we should focus on protecting and enhancing.  Nature in turn will help us to address the climate change problems we face.<\/p> <p> We need to take nature seriously when it comes to climate change.  It is unfortunate that the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is not present to be part of that discussion.  Will the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment commit to incorporating nature-based solutions and biodiversity measures in all the climate change, adaptation and mitigation plans, policies and legislation as we proceed?  Having such a commitment and striving in that direction would be important.<\/p> <p> I wish to ask about funding for measures under our many plans and policies.  At local level, councils have been heavily involved in developing mitigation plans and adaptation plans.  They have biodiversity officers in place and have worked with the climate action regional offices on their climate action charters.  However, the difficulty is that no funding is being attached to many of the programmes.  This time last year, I was a member of Wicklow County Council and our local property tax had to pay for our climate officer.  It is a good strategy to have local councils, which are on the ground at the coalface with communities, develop climate change policies and drive them at local level, but we will have to fund that work.  For even simple measures like the electric chargers that the Minister referenced, councils must cover 25% of the cost.<\/p> <p>We are going into a very uncertain economic future where councils will find it difficult to perform their normal standard functions.  They will struggle to carry out the additional climate change and biodiversity measures we are asking of them.  Will the Minister commit to giving councils additional funding to perform their climate change and biodiversity responsibilities?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000017#P00300","speaker":"1627","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1591784700,"counter":58,"content":"<p>I welcome Deputy Whitmore's comments.  She is absolutely right that we have not had the legislative framework to allow for a focus on delivery.  However, this is the last time we will have transition statements in this House, as they are a legacy of the 2015 legislation.  The new legislation, the general scheme of which was published in December, sets out the new approach which will be very much results-oriented.  As we discussed earlier, there will be an implementation board in the Department of the Taoiseach which will ensure that actions committed to are honoured.  We will also have a very strong Oireachtas committee that will oversee targets on an individual, sectoral and ministerial basis, rather than the sort of catch-all bulldog clip approach of one Minister coming in and being accountable for the whole lot.  That legislation will be a powerful shift in the way we manage the climate challenge.  It reflects a lot of work, starting with the Citizens' Assembly and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Action, as well as the work of my own officials and others across Government.  Everyone recognises that we have not had the necessary structures to implement change.<\/p>  <p>  It is a little unfair to say we are making no progress.  We have made progress even in the past 12 months.  Renewables on our grid are significantly increasing, there has been an increase in the penetration of electric vehicles, and the carbon emissions from energy were down by close to 2% in 2019, at a time when the economy still grew very significantly by 5.5%.  We are seeing some turning of the oil tanker, to use that possibly inappropriate phrase, as we seek to get to grips with this challenge but we have a huge distance to go.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy is right that there is a separate biodiversity plan which was not included in the climate plan.  It was not under my remit and when I was putting this together the biodiversity plan was being developed elsewhere.  She may be right that we need to integrate those in some ways, but that is a matter for future Governments.

I will start with a couple of big picture points.  I read a report the other day that said climate emissions may be down 12% in the State this year, not because of any actions by the Government, but because of the virus.  It is like what happened ten years ago when there were declines in carbon emissions because of the crash in the economy rather than anything a conservative Government did.  The Government's record is more accurately shown by the fact that carbon emissions in this State are the third highest in the EU, behind only Estonia and Luxembourg.  They are more than double the carbon emissions <i>per capita<\/i>of Sweden.  This country is on track for billions of euro worth of fines in 2030 for not reaching targets.  I read that the EU average for the amount of land under afforestation is around 35%, whereas in Ireland it is less than a third of that.<\/p><p>If the Green Party goes into government, presumably the idea will be promoted that this will make a radical difference. <\/p> <p>There are two issues.  One is whether the policies will go far enough and the other is whether they will be just.  I only have time to deal with the justice issue today.  I believe the policies will not go far enough because they will be within the framework of a market economy which will put profit before the environment.  Presumably if the Green Party go into government, more policies will be wheeled out, packaged as measures to tackle the crisis.  Will justice form part of those policies?<\/p> <p> Under the previous Government and the current caretaker Government, we saw the lack of justice towards the Bord na M&oacute;na workers in Shannonbridge and Lanesborough who had consented to the closure of their peat-burning stations and sacrificed their jobs for the greater good.  They were promised a just transition, but for a long time Bord na M&oacute;na refused to set up a forum.  There was a real prospect of workers and communities being left behind.  There was a suspicion that there was an agenda of deunionisation.  It was only when the workers raised their voices and protested like the protests that were called during the general election campaign that some change on the issue was forced.  We will watch this very carefully when the new Government comes into office.<\/p> <p> The big issue will be the question of a carbon tax.  It is &euro;26 per tonne at the moment.  The previous Government wanted it to be up to &euro;80 per tonne by 2030, and I understand the Green Party want it to be &euro;100 per tonne.  We are opposed to the idea of a carbon tax on ordinary people.  If the Government wants to put a carbon tax on big business, that is a different matter. Some 71% of carbon emissions in the world since 1988 have come from a mere 100 corporations.<\/p> <p> I understand that the Green Party went into Government talks with a policy of a fee and dividend model, in other words, people pay a carbon tax and are then refunded money.  That at least allows for the possibility of something like refunds for the majority of ordinary people while leaving the carbon tax on the richest in a society.  An alternative is a wealth tax to provide refunds for people who have paid carbon tax.<\/p> <p> That is rather different from the model being argued for by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, the so-called hypothecated model, whereby everyone is charged the carbon tax and the money is ring-fenced for environmental policies.  In other words, it is a policy which makes ordinary people pay.  I would not say that the dividend model was progressive, a phrase which is sometimes used, but it was certainly less reactionary than the model being argued for by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  We have had quite a few press reports in recent days that the Green Party have conceded on this issue and that some money may be given back to people in receipt of social welfare, but that would be the exception rather than the rule.  In other words, the party would have signed up to what would clearly be a regressive tax.  I want to make it very clear that this is something which will not just be opposed from these benches but will be opposed by ordinary people, as was the case in France.<\/p> <p> The final point I would make to the Green Party negotiators is that I have read about liquified natural gas being a no-no in Shannon, which I hope is the case.  I hope that is true for everywhere else in the country, including Cork where there are plans to introduce it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000019#R00300","speaker":"1522","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1591785000,"counter":61,"content":"<p>I also want to make an appeal to Green Party members not to go into government with Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  If the Green Party allows itself to be used as a green mudguard for the pre-existing neoliberal and austerity policies of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, it will represent a substantial setback for the environmental movement.  It will not be a step forward in any sense.  It will not bring us any closer to the radical change we need to achieve a just transition to a net zero carbon economy.  In fact, it will bring us substantially further away.<\/p>  <p>  When people voted for change in the previous general election, they were not voting to take the neoliberal and austerity policies of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael and place the word \"eco\" in front of them.  Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael will be very happy to have the assistance of the Green Party as a green mudguard and to place the blame on it for every austerity measure they introduce.  They will say the measures are about the environment.  In doing so, they and, unfortunately, the Green Party will contribute to damaging the image and cause of the environmental movement in the eyes of substantial sections of working-class people who will say this is a movement which means austerity for them.<\/p> <p>I think it will be very clear in the programme for Government which we will presumably see in the coming days that Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il will not sign up for the change we actually need which is a programme to get us to net zero by 2030.  It does not even look as if they will sign up to something like a binding 7% reduction year-on-year.  Why is this?  Enda Kenny gave the game away in Paris five or six years ago where he said it is not really a priority for us.  He said that at the talks in Paris of all places.  The current Taoiseach is more skilful so he now says we cannot be a laggard etc., but the truth is that Ireland remains a laggard.<\/p> <p> Under Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, Ireland will continue to be a laggard because they represent the big polluters.  They represent big agribusiness; they represent the biggest polluter in the State, Ryanair; and they represent the likes of CRH.  They are not willing to stand up to those big businesses which are responsible for the majority of carbon emissions in our State because that is who they represent.<\/p> <p> Right-wing political commentators have been full of very helpful, useful and neutral advice to the Green Party suggesting that the only responsible thing to do and the best thing for that party's political future is to go into government with Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  They do so completely disregarding all the history of parties that portray themselves as progressive, left or whatever going into coalition with right-wing parties in this country.  There is a lot of history of it to analyse.  They ignore all that, including the history of the Green Party in government in similar circumstances in 2007 on the cusp of a major economic crisis.  They ignore all of that to say, \"This is what you should do.\"  They do that to pile pressure on Green Party Deputies, Senators and above all members in order to maintain stability from the point of view of the political and economic establishment in this country.<\/p> <p> The evidence from 2007 is clear.  Obviously, the Greens were wiped out in the following general election because they signed up for the bank bailout, the troika deal and all those other measures.  However, they also made regression in environmental measures.  Deputy Eamon Ryan, as a Minister, stood over the continuation of the building of the offshore refinery in Rossport and the onshore pipeline at a time when protesters, including me, were being battered off the streets by garda&iacute; serving the interests of Shell.<\/p> <p> They will say it is urgent to make change etc.  In reality it will set back the prospect of winning change immediately.  It will set back the prospect of building the kind of movement we need.

They can fight for a four-day week without loss of pay.  They can fight for a programme of green jobs.  They can fight for a sustainable model of agriculture, all as part of the Green New Deal with socialist policies.  It can also allow us to place on the agenda breaking fundamentally with the political establishment as opposed to shoring it up, and to place on the agenda the need for a left government with socialist policies that can actually deliver the change we need to save our environment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000020#S00200","speaker":"1628","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1591785600,"counter":63,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister, Deputy Bruton, for being in the House today.

As the Minister knows, a substantial amount of work had been done within the Department on the clean air strategy.

In global terms the focus has been on energy generation and how we chose to travel or heat our homes.  What we eat, however, has a substantial climate impact.  The carbon footprint of wasted food is estimated at 3.3 gigatonnes per annum.  More than one third of all food is wasted.  It is not just food itself that goes to waste, but it is also all the resources that went into making it from the water to the land to the labour.  If food waste was a country it would rank only behind the United States of America and China for greenhouse gas emissions.  Globally, 23% of food waste volume happens at production level, 12% happens at storage and handling, 5% at processing level, 9% at distribution and marketing, and 52% of food waste volume occurs at consumption level.  Irish agriculture is already taking the lead with a number of agricultural measures to improve efficiency in our agrifood sector to reduce our carbon intensity.

I commend the Deputy because when he was the Minister he extended that monitoring programme.  I believe it will need to continue to be extended.  It has held up the clean air strategy.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy is correct on food waste.  We have set a target of halving food waste, which is an EU-wide target.  In the waste and circular economy strategy we are seeking to introduce measures that would deliver this.  Deputy Naughten will be aware that of the 52% of food waste at consumption level, large parts and the worst waste occurs in the food sector and not in family homes.  There is, nonetheless, food waste in family homes.  We will target waste in hotels, restaurants and other catering facilities where very large volumes of food are wasted.  While this is a huge challenge and it is very important that we do it, one of the difficulties we face is where food is sourced from other countries and we do not get the benefit on our carbon inventory.  The only impact we could show is where Irish production is reduced as a consequence of the elimination of food waste, as opposed to elimination of food waste on imported products.  That will fall on the inventory of others.  It is a bit of a dilemma in that it is a production-based inventory and not a consumer-based one.   The Deputy is absolutely right, however, and it is included in our plans.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000023#V00200","speaker":"1549"},{"type":"speech","time":1591786200,"counter":69,"content":"<p>I will be more than happy to receive written responses to any questions if there is insufficient time.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue.  It is significant and concerning for many midland counties, including County Offaly where we wait for the job losses to occur at the end of this year.  It is not a good prospect, especially as we are currently in the middle of a pandemic.  It is already difficult for many communities.  To add to this we in the midlands also have job losses coming.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge and welcome the publication of the first interim report of the just transition commissioner.  There is much to welcome in this report, not least the sense of urgency that has been brought to it in attempts to ensure a genuinely just and fair transition takes place.  That has been one of the key challenges in this entire process, along with a sense of contradiction that has emerged.<\/p> <p>While the whole-of-government approach at present is about de-escalating the flood of job losses across this State that has arisen in recent months, the very opposite appears to be happening in the midlands.  The whole transition process was due to be drawn out until 2030, and people accepted that and were adapting accordingly.  Now it is down to a mere 12 months, if we are lucky.  The commissioner himself noted this in his report.  There he referred to the perception that no account was taken of the long-term impact on workers, their families and the communities, and the reasonable and legitimate expectation they had that the use of peat as a fuel in these plants would be phased out by 2030.  It was also noted that management and unions, primarily in Bord na M&oacute;na, now have less than 12 months to adjust rapidly to this new reality and to scale, map and, insofar as it is possible, present a clear pathway for continued employment, reskilling, redeployment, retirement and voluntary redundancy.  There are still a substantial number of Bord na M&oacute;na workers left in limbo regarding voluntary redundancy.  It is totally unfair.  They are not receiving communications from Bord na M&oacute;na.  There needs to be some level of intervention out of fairness for the workers in that regard.  If it is possible, the Minister should intervene urgently.<\/p> <p> The commissioner accepts that there are many formidable challenges in relation to the just transition.  My key concern is that all of these challenges around employment retention in the midlands, in Offaly in particular, were already acute and severe before the onset of the Covid-19 crisis.  Now we have a report and the outlines of a pathway forward but within a radically changed and uncertain economic climate.  What assurances can the Minister give that the already limited and modest financial requests put forward by the commissioner will be honoured and, more importantly, implemented urgently?  Will such commitments transcend the lifetime of this Government or will we be back here again in a few months with the Green Party insisting that the transition process needs to be speeded up further?<\/p> <p> Within the climate action fund under Project Ireland 2040, there is a commitment for the allocation of &euro;500 million from 2019 to 2027 to support initiatives that contribute to a low-carbon, climate-resilient future.  The first call allocated funding up to &euro;77 million across seven projects and was expected to leverage &euro;300 million in total investments.  Has that expectation of &euro;300 million in investments been realised?  For the second stage of the fund, a call for expressions of interests was launched earlier this year, with 190 expressions received by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment when the call closed in March.  Will the Minister provide details of how many applications have come specifically from midland counties?  Where are these investments taking place and are they creating any jobs?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000023#V00300","speaker":"1592","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1591786500,"counter":71,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Nolan for her recognition of the work of the just transition commissioner, which is very valuable.

This Government has talked the talk but it has not walked the walk.  People talk about historical things that happened in the recent election.  All the Independent Deputies were elected from outside of Dublin.  Why?  Because people on the ground in rural Ireland said they were not being listened to.  We are the best country in the world for protecting and respecting other people's cultures, except when it comes to our own and especially when it comes to the farming sector.<\/p> <p>I come from a farming background and I also have a background in construction.  Throughout history, those in the farming sector ensured that there was always another generation to take over farms for the future.  The problem now is that every generation has to deal with all the changes being made within the farming sector.  Those people are working long and hard with everyone to do that.  However, the lack of understanding of change in farming is evident.<\/p> <p> Agriculture is the main driver of the rural economy.  There are 260,000 jobs in the agricultural sector, or one in eight of the total number of jobs.  Some 90% of beef produced in Ireland is exported.  Our food exports in 2019 were valued at &euro;13 billion.  Ireland is the fifth biggest exporter in the world and the largest in Europe.  How do we incentivise farmers?  We know that agriculture is a contributor to our national emissions, but there is a distinct divide between the cause of emissions and being a contributor.  Agriculture is not the cause of all emissions in Ireland.  That suggestion can cause great offence to farmers, who are just existing.  Farmers are, however, conscious of the environment and the causes of carbon emissions.<\/p> <p> Farmers find it unbearable to imagine that their production is being curtailed, yet there are trade deals to import beef, produced as a result of deforestation, from Brazil.  I refer to the proposed importation of 99,000 tonnes of beef, with a value of &euro;21 million, from January to September 2019.  Stopping that 99,000 tonnes of beef coming into Europe was tackled by an organisation of young farmers around Europe, including Macra na Feirme.  It signed a petition calling for that beef to be stopped from entering Europe.<\/p> <p> The UK is no longer a part of the European Union so beef produced as a result of deforestation can come into that country and damage the market there for Irish beef.  If we are serious about emissions reductions, we need to look first at land mobility.  Land mobility involves moving land from one generation to the next.  In 2019, Macra na Feirme produced a comprehensive paper on succession planning leading to partnership.  It secured 500 arrangements in respect of 47,000 acres.  What does that mean?  It means that we need to look at ways of incentivising young farmers to take more land or for older farmers to retire.  We need to do this because we need to get better at technology and farming practices.  If a farmer is nearing retirement or a farm is not providing a living, will there be investment in technology and in better farm practices?  No, there will not.  Land mobility may be the answer.<\/p> <p> There is much talk about reducing the national herd.  Is it just talk?  Milk recording services carry a high rate of VAT, that tripled last year to 13.5%.  Why?  This is a cutting-edge technology that highlights high-performing animals, thus allowing the culling of non-performing animals and reducing the national herd.  We are missing out there.  We need joined-up thinking; we do not need to be disincentivising such important practices.<\/p> <p> Reducing the VAT rate on sexed semen would also help to reduce emissions.  For example, a reduction in the number of Friesian bull calves being born would reduce the national herd.  A properly funded set of agri-environmental schemes needs to be based on results.  Teagasc has the latest cutting-edge results.  The farmer will follow the plan and know what is right for his or her environment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000024#W00300","speaker":"1499","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1591786800,"counter":74,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Pringle.

Sadly, that has nothing to do with Government policy.  Rather, we can thank Covid-19 for it.  It is probably the only good to come out of the current situation.  Is the best we can hope for that that situation will continue?  I do not think so.<\/p> <p> The Minister stated that the Government achieved its targets for 2019 early.  However, again, that had nothing to do with Government policy.  The reduction in 2019 can be completely put down to the closure for maintenance of the ESB coal-fired electricity plant at Moneypoint.  During the closure, we met our electricity demand.  That showed that the required reduction is achievable through renewable energy if we wish to do so.  The thing about the Government plan is that there seems to be a lot of planning or talking about planning, but not much actual work.  Maybe all the talk about plans will lead to a significant reduction in the final years of the plan and there will be significant reductions in 2027 to 2030, inclusive.  Unfortunately, I do not think that will be the case.<\/p> <p> The climate action (amendment) Bill appears to be the main plank of the Government's plan.  It is at the early stages of planning within the Department.  I believe it will take the full lifetime of the next Government to pass the Bill.  I acknowledge that the Minister is part of a transition Government and cannot control how it will be progressed, but the timeframe laid out in the transition statement is optimistic, to say the least.  The Government approved the general scheme of the Bill at the end of 2019, but slippage was inevitable on its commitment to publish the Bill in the first quarter of 2020.<\/p> <p> The commitment to offshore wind generation in the recently announced tender is very welcome.  It is the option that can meet our targets into the future.  I am concerned that the Minister recently stated that the Government has not yet decided whether the power produced will be taken ashore by the State or by private enterprise.  I think that must be done by the State.  There should be a limited number of landfalls, all of them run by the State, to ensure that vital infrastructure will stay in our control into the future.<\/p> <p> The significant job potential in the offshore wind sector cannot be underestimated.  Many fishermen already work in the offshore wind industry in the UK, Germany and Denmark.  They are well qualified and sought after to make that system work.  Surely, they could benefit from having that type of work available here.  In addition, boat-building businesses could very quickly move to building work boats to facilitate the construction of offshore wind farms.  There will be a need for other vessels to undertake tasks, including the management of developed wind farms.  There is significant potential in this area for indigenous industry and workers.  If we get it right now, we could ensure all of our people could benefit from that development. <\/p> <p> An area on which the Government could do a lot without doing too much and easily reach the requirements is that of domestic generation.  People could generate electricity in their homes, particularly through the usage of solar panels, and put it back into the grid.  There needs to be a way to show how much power goes back into the grid.  Although domestic producers of power may not be paid for it, just showing the benefits that result from using green technology to send power back into the electricity grid would have a significant impact and could free up the grid for other things.  That step is vitally important and very easy to do.  The Government would not have to do very much to make it happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000025#X00300","speaker":"1547","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1591787100,"counter":77,"content":"<p>I agree with much of what Deputy Pringle stated about meeting our energy demands.  Have we done so?  Did we import energy in the relevant timeframe?  We need to be realistic.  We are building an interconnector with France.  Are we going to say that we could not countenance producing nuclear energy in Ireland but we have no problem importing it from France or even Sellafield?<\/p>  <p>  We have energy needs.  I remember a constituent giving out to me about a wind power station.  They thought wind power was terrible and Moneypoint was awful.  I asked what was the first thing they did each morning and they said it was to turn on the light.  I asked from where they thought the energy for that came.  We need to get energy from somewhere.  I completely support the usage of renewable energy, but we cannot rely on it for 100% of our energy.  It is not realistic to do so.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy O'Donoghue referred to farming and I agree with much of what he stated in that regard.  Farmers are very realistic people.  They are probably the first to grasp change in Ireland.  Many County Clare farmers to whom I have spoken this year accept that there is climate change.  They can see it, but they do not know what is causing it.  There is some disagreement on how it is caused.  I accept that it is caused by human behaviour but there are others who do not accept that.  The vast majority of farmers looking at climate patterns now say there is climate change and we need to be able to adapt to that change.<\/p> <p> With regard to Moneypoint and offshore, nothing has been done to replace coal.  For a long time we knew that Moneypoint was going to close, and it has closed, but nothing has been brought on line to replace it.<\/p> <p> Farmers can produce energy and they do so right across Europe in terms of solar panels and taking methane out and feeding electricity back into the national grid, and it is not just farmers as many private enterprises can do that.  Up to now, there has been no facility to do this and it needs to change so we can all be energy suppliers as well as energy users.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000026#Y00200","speaker":"1518","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1591787700,"counter":79,"content":"<p>In recent years, we have heard that clean green energy was going to save a fortune because we would not have to import, which is correct, and we were told it would be much cheaper.  In the past week, however, it has been announced that the ordinary consumer, under the public service obligation, PSO, levy, will pay &euro;70 more from next September on, and that is on top of what was there already.  Something like &euro;500 million will now go to these fat cats of wind who will come into this country.  Most of the profits from the wind industry are going out of Ireland, even though we are all told they would stay in this country.<\/p>  <p>  Departments should be given proper funding.  First, we raised the issue of hedgerows and it has finally been included after four years of knocking at the door.  Second, the report on methane in regard to suckler cows shows that using seaweed products has brought that down by 79%.  These are the angles we should be looking at, not kicking farmers and saying we should be culling half or three quarters of the national herd.<\/p>  <p>  There is a situation in the midlands, because of this so-called low carbon environment, whereby people have no jobs.  We had temporary workers at B&oacute;rd na Mona but where are they today?  They are unemployed.  This is happening right across parts of rural Ireland.  However, the people in the cities still want to make sure they have a light to turn on.  Security of electricity supply is very important, especially for business.  I fear that with this whirlwind we are on about at the moment, we could end up not being able to produce electricity in our country at times, and we will be relying on somebody else.<\/p>  <p>  Under the farm to fork strategy and the biodiversity strategy that Europe is pushing forward, we as a nation are being asked to designate over 30%.  When we talk about offshore wind, that will mean 30% out in the Porcupine area and along the west coast.  Every type of objector will object to the wind turbines going up in the sea as well, so how is this going to add up?<\/p>  <p>  As public representatives, we need to stand up for the agricultural sector.  The biodiversity strategy states that if people have peat land in the mountains where sheep are reared, they would let that back into the wild.  From the top of Donegal to the bottom of Kerry, perhaps excluding parts of Limerick, we are going to destroy family farms throughout that area.<\/p>  <p>  We need to cop on and know what we are going to do.  Are we going to let these family farms go?  If anyone goes down to Listowel in Kerry or goes to a dairy production area, they will find it is reclaimed peatland.  What the EU is proposing is to get rid of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, payment on those peatlands.  It is there in black and white in the document under the biodiversity strategy and the new CAP policy.  This is detrimental to people and families living in those areas.  Some of the farming organisations have been very quiet about this and do not seem to want to comment.  However, what I can see, and I have said it many times, is that many people would like to see a theme park Ireland from Donegal down along the west coast and to let the rest keep producing what the people need.  That is not going to happen, I can guarantee the House, because we in the west are not going to accept it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000027#Z00200","speaker":"1508"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Message from the Standing Business Committee of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann","time":1591788000,"counter":80,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000028#AA00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1591788000,"counter":81,"content":"<p>The Standing Business Committee has completed its consideration, under Standing Order 30, of:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe request by the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation to waive the requirement for pre-legislative scrutiny, under Standing Order 173, on the general scheme and the draft heads of the Microenterprise Loan Fund (Amendment) Bill 2020 and has agreed thereto. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000028#AA00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1591788000,"counter":82,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 11.35 a.m. and resumed at 12 noon.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"An tOrd Gn\u00f3 - Order of Business","time":1591788300,"counter":83,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000029#FF00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1591788300,"counter":84,"content":"<p>I remind Members that the House has agreed, for the duration of the Covid-19 emergency only, that the rapporteur's report on the Order of Business shall not be read out but shall be taken as read.

Last week, when I was in the House, I was conscious that the Business Committee had also scheduled this full session on the issue of a summer programme.  I am happy to be here today, in advance of bringing proposals to Cabinet, to hear further from Deputies on the topics concerned.  On foot of the constructive engagement we have had in this House in recent weeks, I know Members will bring constructive suggestions and proposals to the House today.  I have asked my officials to ensure that we will look at these proposals and will see how we can facilitate them.  In introducing a summer programme designed to support children, especially those at risk of regression in their education because of the steps required to combat Covid-19, I will have the support of this House.  It is worth reiterating that a lot has happened across the education and skills sector during the 13 weeks since schools, colleges, universities and other settings closed on 12 March.  Between now and the end of August, the Government intends to do a lot more, including the provision of targeted supports through a summer programme.  <\/p>  <p>  I said last Thursday in this House that the pace at which issues have been identified and addressed over the past three months is a credit to those who work in the sector, the students and their parents.  Specifically in regard to the summer programme, that intensity of work has continued over the past few days.  I stated that I would return to Cabinet with more detailed proposals this coming Friday, in conjunction with more detail on the wider school re-opening planned for the end of August.  I expect to be able to make further announcements at that stage.<\/p>  <p>  Normally each summer the July provision operates to benefit more than 10,000 children with severe and profound intellectual disabilities and those with autism.  I believe that it is essential that a summer education programme runs this year for those most in need.  It will help children to reconnect with learning and assist their return to school in the autumn.  An education programme will also help to reduce regression for those at greatest risk of this happening.  <\/p>  <p>  In developing proposals for a summer education programme to support children with significant special educational needs, my thinking has been informed by a number of core principles.  The programme should contribute to the overall well-being of the child and the family.  Supports must address regression and its impact on reintegration and transitioning to planned educational settings for next year.<\/p> <p>A school-based programme and a home-based programme need to be provided.  Supports should be targeted at those students with the greatest needs.  Where possible, some degree of flexibility on the operation of the scheme, in terms of timing and duration, should be permitted while recognising the need for equity of summer provision as far as possible for those to whom it is provided.  Those children who would normally qualify for the July provision programme should be included.  Where possible, some expanded provision to include other children with significant special educational needs should be included, with a focus on those at greatest risk of regression.  The programme must be of a high standard and as far as possible it should complement the programme of support being developed by the HSE.  There is a need, as far as possible, to integrate the summer programme with a more general return to school in the autumn.  The programme has to be operated in a way that is informed by public health advice, is workable and is offered in a way that ensures parents want their children to participate.<\/p> <p> Normally in summer, school completion projects and DEIS literacy and numeracy summer camps are run in DEIS schools.  From speaking to principals and teachers, I know some children at risk of educational disadvantage have found the remote learning experience challenging.  However, SNAs, teachers and principals have stayed connected with their students and I acknowledge their role in this regard.  We all share a genuine concern that children and young people who may have disengaged as a result of this experience may struggle on return to school.  The learning loss that typically occurs for the students during the school summer holidays is likely to be significant.  In the current situation, by September 2020 these students will have missed out on formal education since March.  A summer programme aimed at those most at risk of educational disadvantage in order to rebuild that connection between student and school is vital.<\/p> <p> I want a summer education programme to run, recognising that students with special educational needs and those at greatest risk of educational disadvantage need to be prioritised.  I assure parents that in the coming days I will be in a position to give them a green light for their children to participate in a summer programme.  The programme will be a stepping stone to help those who most need support.  It will help children to renew relationships, retain connections with school and learning and help to support ongoing social development and well-being.  These programmes can only run with the support of schools, principals, teachers, SNAs and other staff.  I know the efforts those working in the education sector have made and the lengths they have gone to in order to support their students.  I emphasise that any programme will be voluntary in nature and it will be a matter of individual choice as to whether schools or teachers feel they can participate.  I ask those schools, teachers and SNAs who feel they can do something over the summer to help in this endeavour and I ask that they would choose to do this.  I cannot pretend that this is a small request given the challenges we have all faced since the pandemic first arrived, but I know that for those who can their contribution to the lives of the most vulnerable children will be truly appreciated and hugely rewarding.<\/p> <p> I also know that public health guidance to schools and the provision of appropriate supports will be important elements in ensuring that any summer programme can take place . I will return to the Cabinet on Friday to set out the shape of this year's summer programme.  I know the positive impact a programme will have and I want to see it happen but we must do so in a safe way for all concerned.<\/p> <p> Before I conclude I want to make some broader references.  I can confirm that since I was last in the House, when I provided an update on how the work on calculated grades for this year's leaving certificate was progressing, the online portal through which schools upload school level marks opened.  This happened on Monday, as planned.  I was delighted, as I am sure was everyone else in the House, to see us enter phase 2 of the roadmap to the reopening of society.

As the Deputy knows, last week I announced I wanted to include Down's syndrome in the scheme, and it will be included.  We are also looking at incorporating school completion, for example, and expanding the literacy and numeracy programme we have in 70 DEIS primary schools into post-primary schools.  We are looking at a massive increase in the capacity of that scheme, but it will rely on the volunteerism of schools and teachers.  From soundings and the leadership we are getting from the likes of the Catholic Primary School Management Association, CPSMA, the INTO and the Irish Primary Principals Network, IPPN, at primary level, the indications are quite strong that there is a lot of goodwill and good feeling towards the programme.

Addressing the shortfall in provision for the special educational needs of all children, particularly those who face disadvantage, must be an absolute priority for the current Government and the next one.  What has happened in the past three months has not been the fault of the Government but comes on top of reduced provision and not enough provision in general for students with special educational needs.  Their constitutional rights to education have not been vindicated.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to raise two other issues with the Minister, and I hope he will take cognisance of them.  I welcome what he said about the leaving certificate.  That seems to be going relatively smoothly.  On the reopening of schools, however, the Minister said he would update Cabinet on Friday.  With respect, the Cabinet is the decision-making body of which he is a member, but updating is for the D&aacute;il, to which he is accountable.  We represent the parents and children.  It is for the Minister to update us today so we can then tell the parents.  The Cabinet makes the decisions; it does not get updates.  I would like the Minister to update us.  Furthermore, and I have said this to him privately, I would like him to make a declaration that schools should, where possible and when public health allows it, whether in the new term or otherwise, have some type of graduation or progression ceremony for sixth class and sixth year students.  Some schools are doing so but some are not, and it would help if the Minister made a national announcement to encourage this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000032#JJ00200","speaker":"1503"},{"type":"speech","time":1591789500,"counter":95,"content":"<p>The Deputy was here last week when I said we would be back again next Wednesday and I would bring a detailed submission and guidelines to Cabinet on Friday.

I have taught the July provision so I understand how difficult it is to get staff during the summer months to cater for those children's needs, especially during this difficult period, with all the public health advice and all that will be attached to it.  I have just three points to make to the Minister.  If he cannot clarify any of them today, I ask that he consider them ahead of Friday's announcement.<\/p>  <p>  First, can the Minister clarify if all students who ordinarily would have been eligible for July provision in previous years will be entitled to the same this year?  I note statements from different groups, such as Inclusion Ireland, that there is a suggestion that this service would be restricted to children in special schools or units only and that children with diagnoses in mainstream schools may be omitted.  If the Minister could give clarity on that, I would appreciate it.<\/p>  <p>  Second, families who have sourced a registered teacher themselves are getting ready ahead of the summer.  They go through the same song and dance every year.  Again, these people may not have their children in special units or special schools.  Will they be eligible for July provision, given that their children may not be in a position to attend a special school or there may not be a centre in a local school?<\/p> <p> The third question relates to how difficult it is to get teachers and staff generally to sign up to this.  Will the Minister consider retired teachers?  They may not be registered currently with the Teaching Council but would have been previously.  Will the Minister consider teachers who are undergoing training at present and who may or may not be registered with the Teaching Council?  These teachers could fill a gap if there are difficulties in getting staff.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000032#JJ00400","speaker":"1521","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1591790100,"counter":98,"content":"<p>I would like written answers, please.  Is the Minister categorically saying that the summer provision scheme, which is to replace the July provision scheme this year, is not only going to be awarded to children who currently attend special schools?  Will there be provision for other students who have been in lockdown since March?  There is too much confusion about the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  All parents are struggling at the moment, especially those with children with additional needs.  Without expansion of the scheme there will be no structure or routine in the lives of these children until September.  That is something we have to sort out.  I welcome the inclusion of Down's syndrome children but the Minister must admit there is major confusion and a lack of information.  Many parents are constantly going through hardship.  They are constantly ringing to know what is happening.  The Minister needs to clarify this no later than Friday because it is unacceptable.  Clarification on what is happening needs to be given.  Parents and children need their routines.  The Minister needs to come back on that urgently.<\/p>  <p>  Special needs assistant allocations have been made for the coming school year 2020-2021.  Although mainstream allocations remain unchanged, the same is not true for special school classes.  I have been made aware of an unacceptable reduction of one SNA post in Carlow because of a lack of assessments to diagnose autism spectrum conditions by the HSE and private assessors due to Covid-19 restrictions.  The demand for SNA testing cannot be gauged.  What can the Department do to provide this resource to children who have really suffered under the restrictions?  Will the Minister leave the allocation in place until testing resumes and then look at revisiting it?<\/p>  <p>  There are many concerns about the plans to reopen schools.  School staff, parents and students need certainty.  There is talk that the schools may reopen in August.  Will the Minister confirm when mainstream schools and special schools will reopen?<\/p>  <p>  Another thing needs to be clarified.  Will the State be providing financial support for English language schools that were closed due to the pandemic in March to enable them to reopen in 2020?  I know provision has been made for the students, but what about the schools?<\/p>  <p>  Will the Minister clarify how students taking part in post-leaving certificate courses who have yet to complete their practical examinations due to the coronavirus restrictions are to be graded?  This arises where their teachers have received no instructions from the Department of Education and Skills to carry out predictive grading.  These students are afraid they will not secure a place in third level.  Students who are taking film courses in Carlow have contacted me.  They have been unable to enter the school for the sound part of their examinations.  As the Minister can imagine, this is not a test that can be taken online.  The students need the special equipment.  All in all, this is important.  The PLC students believe they have been totally forgotten and there are real concerns here.  I have major concerns on this too.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to ask the Minister about the summer works programme.  A school in Myshall was looking for emergency works.  Those involved plan to half do the roof.  If they partly do the roof, then next year they will have to replace the roof.  Are the emergency works going ahead?  Is there funding for the summer school works programme?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000033#KK00200","speaker":"1511"},{"type":"speech","time":1591790100,"counter":99,"content":"<p>As the Minister well knows, two sections of our community have paid the greatest price in terms of safeguarding the public in the face of Covid-19.  I am referring to the elderly and our special needs children.  Some of the toughest calls that many Deputies in the House have taken in the past three months have been from parents who are despairing as their children flounder and regress academically.  The House has reflected much in terms of the future care plans for the elderly, in particular those in the nursing home sector, but we have heard little on how we intend to address the imbalance and regression in special needs education during the past three months.  I have had calls from parents of special needs children in Longford who feel abandoned, forgotten and bewildered.  We urgently need a total recalibration of special needs education and sustained targeted investment in the sector.<\/p>  <p>  It falls for me to tell the Minister that Longford parents are worried.  We have seen a scaled-back return of respite services for special needs children in the county.  We will be demanding a full and expanded programme of respite support in the county.

It is an issue that I raised here last year relating to Firhouse Educate Together secondary school.  We thought we had it resolved.  A permanent site has been located for the school and the tendering process for building work has been gone through which is really exciting and also very important.  A temporary site had been located to accommodate the pupils from the school in the interim period, pending the completion of the permanent school building.  The Department has now rejected the temporary site for the school and wants the pupils from Firhouse Educate Together post-primary school to travel to City West which is 10 km away.  This raises social distancing issues on the bus, on top of all of the arguments that I made this time last year.  I ask the Minister to look at this and revert to me on it.  The school needs four to eight classrooms.  That is all that is required.  The students are occupying the existing Firhouse Educate Together gaelscoil at the moment and there could be capacity within the area but the Department needs to initiate discussion and action on it.<\/p>  <p>  On July provision, I welcome the inclusion of children with Down's syndrome.  July provision is voluntary and perhaps some aspects of it could be made mandatory by the Department because it is a programme in which children with special needs thrive.  I know that the Minister accepts that and will be issuing guidelines on Friday.  I have already been contacted by parents from my constituency who have said that a number of schools have already said they are not doing it.  Can the Minister to explain why?  Can an explanation be given to parents?  School building works are preventing some schools from offering the programme.  Could the Department encourage boards of management to consider using community centres or other local facilities?  I ask the Minister to provide an explanation, in writing if necessary, as to why some schools are saying no if there is a willingness on the part of teachers to voluntarily participate in the programme.   Is it health and safety concerns or what is involved?

If ever there was a time for them to be the priority, it is now.  Children with special educational needs and those suffering educational disadvantage are those who have lost most from school buildings being closed and they should be number one on the Department's agenda.  Parents are under unbelievable strain.  Children feel, in many instances, isolated and incredibly frustrated.  The lack of socialisation is particularly difficult.

Despite the best efforts of everyone, including teaching staff, they are swamped.  We have all been inundated with heartbreaking stories from constituents who are at their wits' end.  <\/p>  <p>  The Minister may have seen the report on RT&Eacute; News last week featuring such parents.  D&uacute;radar gur bhraith siad go raibh dearmad d&eacute;anta orthu agus go rabhadar tr&eacute;igthe.  One parent who featured in the report, Ms Angela Hynes, described the impact on her daughter Zoe.  She said that Zoe is biting her arm in frustration and is eating her clothes.  She said that her daughter is no longer engaging and is \"not the child she was nine weeks ago\".  She used to be able to spoon feed herself, thanks to the hard work and dedication of her teachers but now she has stopped entirely.  That is just one example of the kind of falling back that is happening to countless children across the State.  These children need support, specialised routines and care.  Countless parents have been asking me if July provision was happening this year.  <\/p> <p>When I asked the Minister, he stated that it was happening or at least some provision would be made.  I must say, though, that following on from my contacts with parents and teachers, I am becoming increasingly alarmed about the confusion that exists.  From speaking to people in the sector, it seems that the Minister and the Department are not on the same page.  A consultation with the Department suggested that the summer scheme would be for children in special schools and classes, excluding the 65% of autistic children in mainstream schools.  That evening, the Minister contradicted that.  Meanwhile, the public is still in the dark.  There is not much detail.<\/p> <p> The Minister is saying that Friday is coming, but today is 10 June.  How will this be ready?  The elephant in the room is that it might not be possible to deliver this on anything near the scale the Minister has discussed.  I hope that he does, given how important it is.  Right now, however, I am concerned that it will not happen in that way and that we could have a repeat of the SNA reallocation or the failed childcare initiative.  I am seeking reassurance in this regard.<\/p> <p> Schools are not signing up for this programme because they have no information and likewise teachers.  I fear that the numbers will not add up for the ordinary programme, never mind the expanded programme.  From what I have heard, only a few schools have signed up.

We will find out within the next three days - after formal contact with the schools and once we have got approval from the Cabinet - what type of feedback we will get from the schools.  Our contacts with them so far have been quite positive.  Schools will have issues until they know what the working protocol will be.  In providing those guidelines, we will be guided by health advice at all times.  We are discussing the safety of these children, many of whom have complex medical needs and profound intellectual disabilities.  As such, we are very conscious of the work protocol.<\/p>  <p>  As to ensuring there is confidence in the scheme working, it relies on its voluntary nature.  Deputy Lahart raised the question of whether that should be changed but it is the nature of the scheme.

Clarity must be provided in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister asked us to be constructive.  Where teachers are concerned, the Minister needs to look beyond the standard cohort of registered teachers.  Retired teachers need to be considered.  In addition, substitute teachers are concerned about losing their Covid payments.  The Minister needs to consider that matter and ensure that they keep their payments so that they can sign up as well.<\/p>  <p>  I asked about Down's syndrome children and the Minister has confirmed that they will be eligible.

There are other school settings and settings outside of school where parents can come together in a group of ten in a community-based setting, such as Spraoi agus Sp&oacute;rt family centre in Carndonagh, County Donegal, Juniper Tree Autism Services in Athlone, Autism Support Louth &amp;amp; Meath, Early Start Education preschool in Rhebogue, Limerick, and Bagenalstown Family Resource Centre in Carlow.  There are opportunities for parents to come together there as well.  They also have the opportunity of home-based tuition which was 70% of provision last year, so if 70% went for home tuition last year it is going to be heavily weighted in that direction this year.  I am confident and ambitious and I know the Deputy is ambitious as well, though he is being sceptical today.  He will be familiar with Lower Glanmire national school in New Inn, which did it last year.  I hope that the likes of the 232 schools that did it last year will do it again this year, but obviously they have to be confident in doing that themselves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000036#NN00200","speaker":"1548"},{"type":"speech","time":1591791900,"counter":110,"content":"<p>Mar gheall go bhfuil srian ar mo chuid ama, iarraim ar an Aire na freagra&iacute; a thabhairt i bhfoirm scr&iacute;ofa.<\/p>  <p>  It is not often that a meeting is so emotional that it reduces me to tears, but two weeks ago I had just such a meeting with the parents' association of Rosedale School, a school for children with severe or profound intellectual disability in Galway city which was featured on RT&Eacute; news last week.  These parents are exhausted and heartbroken.  Many of their children require 24-7 care which means the parents need to take shifts overnight to mind the children.  The children in this school represent a tiny percentage of children with special educational needs, yet they are the most vulnerable and at risk.  They feel completely ignored and isolated by the Government.  Rosedale is not simply a school for these children, but their only social setting outside of their family home.  They receive supports such as speech and language therapy and occupational therapy and they learn life skills and independence.  The children have received no support from these services since Rosedale closed and the parents can see the detrimental effect this is having on their children's development and their children are regressing.  They told me very clearly that their lifeline is gone.  One parent said: &ldquo;It has taken years of dedicated hard work and consultation with many multidisciplinary professionals to help my son regulate and engage to this level, and as is probably clear by now since March 12th my son's whole world has fallen apart.&rdquo;  Another parent said: &ldquo;When I look at him now my heart breaks, I think he has regressed by about five years in the last number of weeks and it is unbearable for me to consider the implications any further delay in returning to his beloved Rosedale will have for him.&rdquo;<\/p>  <p>  The parents have told me they need a school-based summer programme and that an online programme will not work for their children.  They need to know first when it will run and second what staff are available.  Some SNAs have had their contracts moved to the HSE to enable them to work in children's homes.  Will their contracts need to be reverted prior to the commencement of the summer programme?  If the programme is delayed into August, what provision will be made for the required nurses who take their leave in August?  These are not just schools for these children and families - they are their hospitals and their social settings, and they bring so much joy to these kids.  One father said to me that while he knows his daughter has a life-limiting condition and does not like to say it, all he wants is for her to be as happy as possible while she is with them.<\/p>  <p>  These parents are deeply concerned that if a second wave hits Ireland, these schools will be closed again.  Can this service be reclassified as an essential service, given that the children's needs are more complex and their conditions are far more profound than children in other schools?  The class sizes are limited to between four and six pupils, with many of the children having limited movement.  The teachers have control over hygiene and are fully versed in infection control.  Given the hardship on families, along with the regression of the physical, social and mental development of these children, can these schools reopen immediately?  One mother described the big smile on her little daughter&rsquo;s face when she sees the school bus coming.  The Minister can put that smile back on that child's face and I urge him to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000036#NN00300","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speech","time":1591791900,"counter":111,"content":"<p>I welcome the summer provision announcement from the Minister, but I along with many parents across north Kildare despair that the scheme might be another case of the Department speaking first and thinking later.<\/p> <p>My head is bursting and my heart is breaking from listening to all the thoughts and worries of exhausted parents of children with special needs and what they have relayed to me over the past few weeks.  I hear in their voices the realisation that the love they have for their children with special needs is not enough to provide the services they need.  Some parents are anxious about children who are vulnerable from a medical point of view.  A mother texted me after a long chat the other evening.  She told me her son is high risk and has a high inflammatory disease, as well as Down's syndrome and a profound intellectual disability.  He is tube fed around the clock and requires 24-hour care.  She hopes the Department will be able to provide him with one-to-one July provision at home as she is terrified of him catching the virus.  <br\/><br\/>I have spoken to the parents of children with Down's syndrome who welcome that they have been included in the scheme this year.  It is very important that they be included in future years.  I have spoken to other parents whose children attend special schools but do not qualify for July provision.  I accept that is something for another Minister to decide, but I hope the Minister appreciates that I want to give voice to their concerns today.  <br\/><br\/>We are coming out of lockdown, but for many of the parents I have spoken to, lockdown is how they feel they have been living their lives.  They feel like they are in lockdown because they have been locked out by an outdated system with a stony face that seeks to confer a privilege on their children rather than the rights to which their beloved children should be entitled, such as health, care and education.  They are not looking for the sun, moon and stars.  They are looking for their rights and for the State to show kindness to their children whom they love.  The Minister's press release had a headline and announcement, but I ask that he please put kindness in the story of the summer provision.<br\/><br\/>As the Minister knows, community-based activity is very important for most of these children.  Has he investigated the negative effects of social distancing and the possible additional stress it might cause children?  Do we have the capacity to provide one-to-one July provision at home for medically vulnerable children who need structure and stimulation?  Parents like the mother to whom I referred need to know we are there to help her and her son.  <br\/><br\/>What is the position regarding school transport?  It is not the responsibility of a school <i>per se<\/i>, but managing transport is one of the trickiest aspects of managing Covid-19.  I would like to know whether any plans are in place to address the issue in the context of children.  How does July provision cater for deep cleaning and the additional cleaning that will be required, given that some children have problems with spitting or dribbling and will have intimate hygiene needs in this new Covid-19 world?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000036#NN00400","speaker":"1585","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1591792500,"counter":113,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy Emer Higgins, seven minutes and three minutes.

Unfortunately, school closures have had a detrimental impact on children with special needs and their families.  Sadly, some children have regressed since March.<\/p>  <p>  The disruption that has been caused in people's lives shows how important this year's July provision is.  It helps children realise their full potential.  That is why we need clarity on this issue.  The disruption and chaos in the lives of families with children with special needs need to be replaced by clarity and structure.  The benefits of the July provision are enormous.  It is fantastic that children with Down's syndrome, who have been excluded until this year, will be included in this year's programme.

I get that, the frustration coming from parents and the need for that clarity.  That is why I am very focused on bringing a properly worked out memorandum to Cabinet on Friday.  To answer Deputy Higgins, we will bring clarity to this on Friday.  Parents will have an opportunity to register on Friday and we will make that process as easy and as simplified as possible.  I have no interest in a bureaucratic process here.  In the past it took six to seven weeks to register for the July provision.  We are not doing that this year.  We want to do it more quickly within the space of a couple of weeks.  That is the position that I am finding myself in and I am putting pressure on my officials to make this happen in as speedy a way as possible.<\/p>  <p>  On the Down&rsquo;s syndrome issue raised by the Deputy, there has been an ongoing campaign by the Down&rsquo;s syndrome representative groups and I know voices in this House, in my own party and across the floor have been voicing this for years.  This is the right thing to do which is to be as inclusive as possible.  It is also important that we bring clarity as to who can apply and will be covered on Friday.  There was an issue last week as to whether, for example, 65% of autism students in the mainstream be excluded.  They will not be excluded; they will be included.  I will bring clarity to that on Friday as well.<\/p>  <p>  Another question concerned any issue which may arise regarding supply of teachers.<\/p>  <p>  On another question raised, if there is an issue with the supply of teachers we will look at other creative ways around this.  Two Deputies have made suggestions regarding retired teachers.  If that is needed we will look at every possibility because the expectation has been created now that this is going ahead.  It is going ahead and will do so in a comprehensive manner but at the centre of this is the child.  We will make it work and ensure that the parent has a choice to have a school-based setting, but obviously if the school does not volunteer to open that school option will not be there and the home-based setting will be an option as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000039#QQ00100","speaker":"1548"},{"type":"speech","time":1591793100,"counter":119,"content":"<p>I wish to raise with the Minister the issue of St. Brigid&rsquo;s school in Mullingar and the students who have missed a large portion of the year now, many having special needs and various different issues to deal with in their own environment.

I will try to give the Minister plenty of time to respond.  I want to pay tribute to his work.  All the Departments are learning on their feet here and it is important to acknowledge the work that is being done.<\/p>  <p>  It is also important to outline the origins of the July provision for the House.  In 1993, Marie O&rsquo;Donoghue, the mother of Paul from Cork, challenged the Irish State and the Department of Education on the right of her son to an education.  They won their case and from this flowed the right to July provision for children with autism and other complex learning disabilities.  The Government has an obligation to provide support for these students with special educational needs and this is the purpose of the July provision.<\/p>  <p>On 5 June the Minister announced changes to the July provision scheme.  These changes will completely change the purpose of the scheme and have caused confusion and distress to children and their families.  He announced a primarily school-based scheme.  On the Department's website it states that it is intended to be similar to July provision with a home-based strand, a school-based strand, and a health-led strand.  This, in addition to contradictory briefings given to various voluntary organisations, has led to this confusion.  In the school-based strand, as the Minister is aware, many schools do not have special classes in their schools for a variety of reasons, including a desire to immerse all children completely in the school community.<\/p> <p>More than 400 schools are currently availing of the summer works scheme for renovations.  Many have reported that they will have difficulty in staffing special classes.  Many of the mainstream schools with special classes have never run July provision education due to the lack of staffing numbers.  Will the Minister outline what consultation has taken place with schools; the budgets that have been agreed with schools for personal protective equipment, PPE, and daily sanitising; and the guidelines that have been offered to schools for the cleaning and sanitising of classrooms, the implementation of social distancing and the cleaning and sanitising of therapeutic equipment and multisensory rooms?<\/p> <p> On the health-led strand, some 15,000 special needs assistants work in Irish schools.  Will the Minister indicate how many of these public service workers have been redeployed to work with Tusla on a temporary basis to fill the health-led strand of this initiative?  What other measures are envisaged under this strand?<\/p> <p> The home-based strand, which must be provided by qualified teachers, has also been announced.  Will the Minister confirm that the home-based July provision will continue for each child with autism and complex learning challenges who requires it?  Perhaps the Minister will also outline what guidelines have been developed for the provision of such home-based services.<\/p> <p> The terms of the July provision have been altered from their original purpose to meet different needs this summer.  The programme was exclusively designed for the education of children with autism and other learning disabilities who benefit from an extended school year as per the Supreme Court judgment in 1997.  The Department has extended the programme this year to focus on students and young people with complex needs, as well as those children with behavioural, social, emotional and sensory difficulties.  The Minister also has stated children with Down's syndrome will be included.  From speaking with SNAs, I anticipate that demand will far exceed supply.  Some schools will not open for the July provision and there will be a struggle to find tutors.  How does the Department hope to match demand with the number of schools that will open and with the necessary complement of SNAs and tutors for the summer programme?<\/p> <p> My second question on SNAs has already been addressed by Deputy Murnane O'Connor.<\/p> <p> With the summer holidays approaching, has the Department liaised with schools in the State with regard to additional requirements under the summer works programme?  Apart from the fact that this is the best time for schools to carry out such works, it also represents a boost for local building contractors at a time they need it most.  It should also be used as an opportunity for schools to refit buildings to accommodate social distancing and optimise the best use of the school buildings and playgrounds for reopening in August.  Are additional resources available within the summer works programme to help schools adapt to social distancing and hygiene requirements?<\/p> <p> Public health advice has changed recently to allow for the running of outdoor summer camps.  Will the Minister now allow primary schools and teachers to welcome back sixth-class students in a socially distant and compliant manner before the end of the school year?  I ask this while aware of the isolation and feelings of loss experienced by this cohort of children who are facing the transition to secondary school having had such an important step in that transition robbed from them by the pandemic.  This follows on from a question submitted previously by my colleague, Deputy Catherine Martin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000039#QQ00300","speaker":"1512","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1591793700,"counter":122,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his contribution.  As for the different analyses of last week's contributions from the officials and what happened on Friday, basically what happened on Thursday was under certain health advice but Friday changed everything.  On Friday, the NPHET advice was that schools will reopen and the school summer programme could go ahead.  When we were given the green light, obviously everything moved into a more expansive phase also.  My officials know where I stand on this.  I want to be as inclusive as possible and I want to be as ambitious as possible but I am also a realist.  I am aware that when one is relying on the voluntary effort of schools to open up, combined with the choice of parents as to whether they want to use the home-school programme or the school-based programme, one is dealing with a number of unknowns.  The known aspect that we have is through a consultation.  The Deputy asked what consultation there has been.  We have consulted with the National Association of Boards of Management in Special Education, NABMSE, which is the representative body for more than 126 special schools in the State.  They have been very honest and upfront about where they see the challenges.  There were discussions on the summer programme but they are also thinking of August and September.  We have to balance the NPHET advice and the protocols we have on what can work, be it home based or school based.<\/p> <p>We have to ensure parents have the confidence to send their children to schools if the schools should decide to open.  The Deputy is correct to ask about the measures that will be in place in relation to hand sanitisers and equipment to ensure schools are clean enough.  All those details will be provided on Friday through the guidelines.  I will get back to the Deputy on the number of SNAs working with Tusla, because that number is changing all the time.<\/p> <p> On the question around summer works, our protocol and protocol guidelines are developed in Tullamore in the planning and building unit.  We have a budget for this year and that budget has not changed.  The budget for the building programme was decided on last October.  The Department is working closely with schools which are ready to go to tender or which are ready to go to construction.  We are working through those.  The Deputy's specific question was around summer works and he is correct in saying this is the time to get that work done, when the schools are vacant.  That will go ahead in any schools that got funding for summer works for this summer.  This is the time to do emergency works as well.  I am glad to say that in the past number of weeks work has restarted on the Western Building Systems schools with which we had issues.  Obviously, the workplace guidelines that construction workers work within in general apply within the education sector as well.<\/p> <p> I wish to return to the issue of the summer programme.  The reason I want to have an expansive summer programme is that we have identified, as has the Deputy and as have parents, that there are gaps in education.  There is regression, and the Deputy will have had constituency representation on this and will have had direct contact with parents.  Parents can see that there has been a regression in their son's or daughter's progress.  Equally, schools have been very proactive in reaching out.  I am hearing great stories.  For example, in Scoil Mhuire, Glenties, the SNA has arrived at the house and waved in the window at the student over the past couple of months.  Principals are staying in touch with parents, staying connected.  However, it is no substitute for the physical presence within the school.  That is why the focus of the summer programme will be on reconnecting.  It is a focus on education.  There will be a reconnection to ensure that the move back to school for many vulnerable students in August and September will not be as big a leap as it otherwise would have been.<\/p> <p> I said last week that I would be in here today without the guidelines because I am bringing it to Cabinet this Friday, but on Friday parents will have the opportunity to register.  That will give us an opportunity to see what the level of demand is. We are going to work very closely with those parents to make this happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000040#RR00200","speaker":"1548","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1591794300,"counter":124,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for the work he has done on issues I raised last week.  The safe pass issue has been resolved, and I thank the Minister for that.  I thank him also for his work on July provision because I understand that he has demanded, against the advice of his officials, a more expansive and more inclusive July provision and that might be the reason for the mixed messages in that the Department is saying one thing to advocacy groups, but the Minister is steadfast in demanding a better system.  For that, I congratulate him.<\/p>  <p>  I find it difficult sometimes to listen to Deputies in this House who with a straight face can almost bring one to tears with their advocacy for children, yet their political parties at the same time in a different room are advocating for the abolition of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  I want to put on the record of this House that this country has an appalling record on children's rights.  As recently as this year we heard of the scandal in Scouting Ireland.  The life chance one has is formed by one's childhood.  That is the reason we have a Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  It is under-resourced and it needs more support.  A classic example is the way childcare is way down the list of priorities in the political system.<\/p> <p>It is gross hypocrisy for people to come into this House and speak on behalf of children who are losing opportunities in school life and refer to how desperate the situation is for those children and their parents, while at the same time their political parties are trying to manoeuvre into a situation where we can abolish the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.<\/p> <p> Children with special educational needs are poorly served in this Republic because they fall between two Departments.  I believe more than 1,400 children in my constituency are on a waiting list for speech and language therapy.  I have a letter from a father who received a letter from the HSE telling him the waiting time for the intervention his daughter needs in Beechpark Services is five years.  Children with additional educational needs are more likely to suffer unemployment, abuse and discrimination and they are also more likely to end up in addiction.  Parents are saying they are exhausted because when they try to advocate for their children no one seems to listen and resources do not seem to be available.  They are being forced to be almost full-time campaigners, which they cannot be because they have to be full-time parents.  I held a meeting to discuss this issue in my constituency last October.  There were several speakers and I expected about 20 people to attend, whereas 150 people showed up.  All of them were exhausted.<\/p> <p> I appreciate the efforts the Minister is making.  Some of the comments made to me concern the acknowledgement that two months in the summer is too long for a child with additional needs to be without some kind of structure, such as the July provision scheme provided in previous years.  Given children have been out of the school system for several months, surely a longer school programme or July provision scheme is now required.  The Minister might be in a position to address that issue.  There are also parents of children due to attend school for the first time in September.  They are hoping the scheme could be expanded to include them because it has been difficult to acclimatise children to a school setting in the same way as happened previously.  <\/p> <p> What happens if a school says \"No\" to a request from parents?  I am aware of a letter sent from the Saplings educational facility, which has, I believe, five schools for children with autism.  A letter was sent yesterday to parents stating that due to the non-availability of suitably qualified and experienced full-time staff and the complex needs of pupils, the organisation will not be in a position to provide July provision.  This matter again falls between the Minister's Department, the Department of Health and the HSE.  It is fair to say that children with additional needs, such as autism and other complex needs, are very poorly served in our education system.  They are also poorly served outside of the system. <\/p> <p> The idea that we should put children, in a departmental sense, at the bottom of the list of political priorities as people jostle as regards Government formation is an outrageous suggestion.  That needs to be stopped right now.  The Minister will not admit this, and I know he is fighting an internal battle in this regard, but the approach of the Department is to outsource everything to the school and if the school says \"No\", there is not much the Department can do.  Parents will tell us they get lists of schools from the special education needs organiser, SENO.  The SENO will state the child has autism, provide a list of schools that may be applied to and then he or she wishes the parents the best of luck.  Parents in my constituency get a list of schools located as far away as Drogheda.  I know parents who have applied to school after school, and the schools have all found legitimate, or other, reasons to say \"No\".  I mentioned last week that the Minister, under the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018, has the power to intervene and demand a school open a unit.  It seems that in this programme for the summer months the Department is again outsourcing its responsibility.  If a school says \"No\" to a request from parents, that is just the way it goes.<\/p> <p> I appreciate that the Minister will give more detail on Friday. <\/p> <p>As it is now early June and the programme is due to start in July, I would like to give some sense of reassurance to parents that if the Saplings Special Schools organisation to which I referred or another local school says \"No\", the Department will be in a position to step up and provide this resource for children which we all accept is greatly needed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000041#SS00200","speaker":"1551","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1591794900,"counter":127,"content":"<p>I appreciate the comments made by the Deputy.  I do not know how much longer I will be in my current position.  One of the things I have greatly valued during my time in the Department is that its officials are very open-minded and good to work with.  There are times when we have differing opinions, but that is life and it brings discussion and an energy to the Department.<\/p>  <p>  On the issue of the summer education programme, there has been intense and focused work at departmental level.  That is not to take away from the other big issues that arose in recent months, such as calculated grades for the leaving certificate, the junior certificate cycle or dealing with all of the other conundrums for which, basically, there is no manuscript.  One of the things I value and very much respect within the Department is its response to any issues or challenges that arise.  We have a challenge to meet on this issue.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy is correct to ask about what happens if a school says \"No\".  That has occurred in the context of July provision.  A particular school with which I am familiar has a phenomenal reputation.  It has ASD classes and a rich tradition of school inclusion, but it has never opened the school for a summer-based programme.  However, it worked to ensure that tutors were provided for the students.  A very significant stand-out figure is that under a traditional programme, 70% of July provision is home-based.  That means that out of 4,000 schools, 232 would open.  However, I am confident that as a result of engagement, not just at official level but also between the likes of the Irish National Teachers Organisation, INTO, the Irish Primary Principals Network, IPPN, the Catholic Primary School Management Association, CPSMA, and other umbrella groups, we will be in a strong position to try to facilitate parents as best we can.<\/p>  <p>  The programme is voluntary in nature, but it is trying to give parents a choice.  The parents to whom I, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in and every other Deputy speak are under pressure.  They have had a tough few months.  I am a parent with three children and I know the stressed environment that arises from balancing working from home, such as trying to do a web exercise relating to the leaving certificate with departmental officials, with trying to help with Irish homework.  It is difficult to jump from office to kitchen.  I know the intensity of juggling home schooling and work.  There are additional pressures for the parents of children with serious to profound intellectual disabilities.  I get that.  That is why I think Deputies will comprehensively facilitate this summer programme as best they can by using their contacts and network, whether in Glanmire, Darndale, elsewhere in Dublin or Letterkenny, to try to encourage people to show leadership and make this work.  I believe we will do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000043#UU00200","speaker":"1548"},{"type":"speech","time":1591794900,"counter":128,"content":"<p>I think we get the best results from these sessions when we ask questions and get answers.

There are a lot of questions to be asked.<\/p>  <p>  In the absence of any further clarity being provided today, I wish to go back to the statement on the summer education programme which was released by the Department last Friday.  In it, the Minister is quoted as stating: \"It gives us an opportunity to provide a vital additional support for some of the children with significant special educational needs and those who have been at risk of educational disadvantage since schools closed in March.\"<\/p> <p> At primary school level, is this a mix of students who would traditionally avail of the regular July provision, with those at greater risk of educational disadvantage now being added?  If that is the case, and I understand from the Minister's response that it is, how does he propose to meet the very diverse, complex and different needs of those students with the same programme, considering those students will have been off school for six months?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000043#UU00300","speaker":"1560","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1591795200,"counter":130,"content":"<p>There are three strands, if the Deputy wants to break it down into specifics.  There is a health-based strand, and I am working very closely with the Minister, Deputy Harris, and his officials are working closely with mine, with regard to children with complex medical needs.  There are potentially 600 students in that category.  I am meeting the Minister, Deputy Harris, at 3 p.m. to go through the work we have done and to come up with a roadmap for those children.<\/p>  <p>  There is also the traditional July provision, which 10,000 students availed of last year, and that has been the average for the past couple of years.  Some 70% of those were based at home and 30% were based in  school.  I want to add to that July provision and, in particular, I want to ensure that those with Down&rsquo;s syndrome are included as they were not included before.  That is additionality to the July provision which is going to be new.  I want to re-emphasise that there are many students with specific disabilities in the mainstream.  They are not going to be excluded and they will be included also.<\/p>  <p>  The third strand is disadvantage, which I know is the Deputy&rsquo;s specific concern.  We are looking at school completion and literacy and numeracy at both primary and secondary level.  There are 70 DEIS schools in the literacy and numeracy programme and we want to add to that.

What exactly does that look like in terms of the well-being programme in the schools?  If teachers and SNAs are being asked to run the programme, are they equipped to support young people with such complex and diverse emotional needs?<\/p>  <p>  We know SNAs and teachers do an incredible job but these are not normal times.  Some students who come back in late August or September will need access to counselling as they will have experienced trauma, and we have all heard of some very difficult cases in the last while.  When they return to the summer programme, will they seek that support from the teachers?  Will counselling be available?  I am particularly thinking of the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS.  Will NEPS be available in the schools?  Will it be able to triage the most difficult cases?  It is not just a question of having guidelines from NEPS but of having NEPS on the ground to triage the most difficult cases.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000044#VV00300","speaker":"1560"},{"type":"speech","time":1591795200,"counter":132,"content":"<p>NEPS has continuously been directly involved with the schools since 12 March and, in fact, it would have had a significant role in determining the cancellation of the leaving certificate in terms of the impact on well-being and mental health of students.

From engagement with parents, including individual engagements I have with parents, I know parents want to see a stepping stone.  This is a stepping stone to re-engagement and reconnecting with the school in August and September.

There is a lot of very welcome detail in that which I wish we had got today.  I will try to outline some of that detail and, for the benefit of Members, I will read a little of what is involved.  Page 4 of the document the Minister gave to the schools on Tuesday states that the optimal time for delivery of the summer programme is as close to the official reopening of schools as possible.  The time close to reopening will also coincide with the leaving certificate results in mid-August.<\/p> <p>Do we have a date for the leaving certificate results to ensure that they do not overlap with the summer programme?

There is a lot of guidance on well-being.  These measures to support young people may be sufficient for the general support of all students but do they dig deep enough to support the complex, emotional and behavioural issues with which principals know students will return?  As teachers try to deal with these issues, what emotional supports will be offered to them?<\/p>  <p>  At some of the schools I have contacted over the last couple of days to seek guidance about this particular session, I have been told of students who have been in their rooms for the best part of three months, who have not really gone outside, have piled on weight and who have emotional issues.  Some of them have experienced traumatic events in their own homes.  Teachers will face the brunt of all of that as soon as this programme starts.

Maybe that did not happen in all cases but in the main, that is the feedback we have received.  The physical presence in the school is what has been missing and that is why we want to reconnect.  We feel that this measure is a stepping stone for a lot of children who potentially have regressed.  It is also an opportunity for parents to acknowledge assistance.  One parent to whom I spoke this morning could not praise the SNA highly enough in terms of providing an ongoing connection.  The measure is about reconnection.

They include a lack of digital voices, students not having access to the necessary technological skills, students not having appropriate space or facilities in which to work at home and the lack of scaffolding or learning that would take place in classrooms.

It had arrangements in place for temporary accommodation starting in September this year but that is no longer possible due to the coronavirus because the Gaelscoil currently using the accommodation believes it needs the extra space.  The Department is telling Firhouse Educate Together secondary school that it cannot be facilitated and it will have to move to Citywest.  It is not viable for a school in Firhouse to be based in Citywest.  The school has a high proportion of students with additional needs who would have to travel daily back and forth to Citywest.  The Department needs to step in and step up to ensure that Firhouse Educate Together secondary school is able to have a secondary school in Firhouse from September.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000047#YY00400","speaker":"1628"},{"type":"speech","time":1591796700,"counter":151,"content":"<p>That is a matter that is close to my heart.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000047#YY00500","speaker":"1572"},{"type":"speech","time":1591796700,"counter":152,"content":"<p>I know the Acting Chairman has raised this issue as well and I am conscious that Deputy Brophy has raised it on a number of occasions.

From the first incidences of Covid-19, front-line staff across the country took on the challenge of doing all in their power to preserve well-being, while supporting industries ensured the continuation of our supply and distribution chains in food, energy and allied care services.<\/p>  <p>  The Government announced significant funding to support the reallocation of health services and to provide business and welfare support payments as the lockdown period became a reality.  How noble we as a people might appear in rising so stoically to such a challenge.  However, we have in our midst families who struggle every day to manage difficult and sometimes impossible care burdens as a result of their children exhibiting the most challenging behaviours with complex learning needs.  These children require significant and sometimes specialist educational intervention.<\/p> <p>This summer's educational programme is a vital support for such families and children as they struggle to maintain their place within the learning curriculum.  I welcome any efforts of the Department directed towards the programme this year.  The Minister might comment on the possible staff resourcing that will accompany it.<\/p> <p> Notwithstanding this year's July provision programme, I wish to highlight to the Minister the challenges facing the ever-increasing number of schools in which such specialist teaching interventions are required.  The number of early-going and even secondary school children with behavioural issues who may be deemed to be on the autism spectrum is increasing.  Catering to these pupils' needs requires the resources of the Department, and in many cases the resources provided are not adequate to meet the needs presenting at these schools.  Many schools are reduced to two or three possible psychological assessments of students in any one calendar year under the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS.  Many parents are forced to consider private psychological assessment because of the two-year wait time in NEPS, but this private assessment may be considered as an invalid reference for the special educational needs organiser, SENO, whose role it is to allocate special needs assistant hours to pupils meeting the departmental criteria.<\/p> <p> I spoke recently to two sets of parents who have gone through this process where the evaluating person who gave the assessment was considered an invalid reference because the assessment was not carried out through NEPS, yet they are qualified to give, and do give, NEPS reports.  Schools I have been in contact with have reported that their SENOs allocate a total number of hours and leave it to school management to decide how these hours are to be distributed.  This is a wholly unsatisfactory situation, with gross understaffing in respect of NEPS psychologists and many SENOs acting more like accountants than childcare experts when considering the allocation of SNA resources.  Not alone are the allocation hours of SNAs inadequate in many schools, but no provision has been made to provide sensory rooms for younger age groups in many schools.  Such rooms are a significant component of teaching, instruction and socialisation activity for such children.  I have met many parents who are at their wits' end trying to secure evaluations of their children as well as the necessary school resourcing to ensure their children can remain in mainstream education and acquire sufficient learning to achieve their full potential.  I have no doubt but that the Minister's email inbox also has many such requests and examples of such situations.  I ask that his Department adopt a similar proactive response to that which has been marshalled against the threat of Covid-19 in order that our schools and teachers can deliver a front-line standard of education that addresses the needs of those who most need it.<\/p> <p> As part of the Minister's schools portfolio, will he update the House on his thoughts on the planned status of school secretaries?  As he knows, many school secretaries work for meagre wages and cannot avail of sick leave or pension rights.  How can we value our teaching establishments if we do not value those who are intrinsic to the service delivery on offer, who care, who support teaching management and who contribute so much to safe school services?  These are our front-line staff too and they have been conveniently pushed to the background and overlooked.  They say it takes a village to raise a child.  It is now time to provide equitable pay to these villagers who do so much to oversee the safe and cherished care of all our children.<\/p> <p> In discussing the equity and economic benefits of providing educational support for all our students, I wish to highlight that Waterford remains the only city region without a university.  The economic consequences of the south-east regional brain drain were plain to see long before Covid-19 arrived in Ireland.  Without this strategic component delivered, this region will remain an economic outlier for years to come.  A south-east university was flagged as an essential component of the Government's 2040 development programme.  It has not seen the focused attention of the Minister's Department, which is required to solve the roadblocks in the proposed TU amalgamation process.  I, like many others, look on at the ability of the Department to assist the Munster TU programme with capital supports and industrial relations expertise while reflecting on the fact that one of the highest-functioning institutes of technology in the country, namely Waterford Institute of Technology, has not received a capital funding programme in over 15 years.  In addition, a refurbishment programme first requested over three years ago has still failed to materialise.  I know change is possibly coming to the seat the Minister occupies.  I ask that before vacating it, he set this as a priority project for completion by his Department seniors in the shortest time possible.<\/p> <p>Soaring rhetoric on the educational and economic imperatives of this project are no substitute for capital moneys invested to make it a reality.

He asked a question around resources that will go into the summer programme.  Obviously, it is a demand-led scheme and is based on volunteerism.  Last year, the July provision cost a little over &euro;16 million.  We are looking at an expanded scheme this year.  This involves bringing in other groups.  We will be looking to add significantly to the &euro;16 million investment.  Certainly, financial resources will not be a barrier in respect of this new summer programme.  The challenge lies in the supply of schools in terms of school openings and teachers and tutors coming forward, as well as the availability of SNAs.<\/p>  <p>  Teachers and SNAs have been highly engaged.  Obviously, on the basis of his contribution the Deputy holds SNAs in high regard and I agree with him wholeheartedly.  There are 17,000 SNAs in the country and they are the epicentre of every school.  Students know them by their first names and on a highly personal basis.  A report was completed during my term as Minister on what needs to be done for SNAs in terms of status and ensuring they get the proper professional qualification and recognition.  Those recommendations need to be implemented because they are really important.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy also mentioned school secretaries.  This is something for which I campaigned when I was in opposition and on the other side of the House and I wanted to see it brought to a conclusion during my term.  That did not happen and at present, the issue of school secretaries and caretakers is with the Workplace Relations Commission.  I hope progress can be made.  It will be a budgetary decision for an incoming Government.  There are a series of choices.  In any event, I agree with the Deputy on secretaries and the responsible role they play.  As someone pointed out during a previous debate, they are the glue of the school and are really important.<\/p>  <p>  As for the priority of university status for the south-east region, we are on the same page.  Whether it is a university for the south east or the north west, if we are to really focus on regional development, we need to have a university in the south east.  I have spoken to officials in the higher education section of the Department in recent weeks.  There is momentum at the minute.  The application is being made ready and I believe we will be in a strong position for a university in the south east towards the end of the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000049#AAA00200","speaker":"1548"},{"type":"speech","time":1591797900,"counter":157,"content":"<p>I am happy to speak briefly on the July education programme.  As we know, the scheme provides funding for an extended school year for children with a severe or profound general learning disability or children with autism.  Where school-based provision is not feasible, 40 hours of home-based provision may be granted.  I was shocked to read reports earlier this week that many disability organisations and parent representatives have expressed alarm at proposals outlined to them at two separate briefings with officials from the Department of Education and Skills.  As I understand it from the reports, they were told that new limits would be placed on children accessing the programme this year.  Given that more than 10,000 children with autism or a profound intellectual disability avail of the two-week scheme every summer, this is highly concerning.  I have highlighted this issue, along with the wider lack of classroom provision across midland counties for children with autism or a special needs diagnosis, many times on the floor of the House.  Information provided to me by the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, on the allocation list for special classes in primary and post-primary schools for the academic year 2019-20 shows that only ten new places were being provided for all schools in Laois and Offaly in addition to a further nine in total for Longford and Westmeath.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000049#AAA00300","speaker":"1592"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1591798200,"counter":158,"content":"<p>This becomes even more stark when one considers that Offaly has almost 40 primary and post-primary schools that have a requirement for special classes.  The allocation that has been provided is clearly insufficient and will not match the level of need or demand that currently exists.  This situation will only be compounded by the proposed changes to the July education programme.  The Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018 can assist in addressing this issue where the NCSE is of the opinion that there is insufficient education provision for children with special educational needs in an area.  In that context, I ask the Minister to review the situation in Laois, Offaly and the midlands under the relevant sections of the Act.  As a parent and former Gaelscoil principal I believe that all children, including children with special educational needs, have a right to an education in line with their abilities in order to live full and independent lives.<\/p><p>I also understand that the situation previously was that the allocation of home-based provision to siblings for July provision was reflective of the school grouping principle, that is where one teacher is allocated to a class of six pupils at the appropriate educational level, primary or post-primary.  Accordingly, it was considered appropriate, as in a school situation, that a tutor can provide tuition at the appropriate educational level to more than one sibling at that level simultaneously in the home.

We had a tremendous focus on the ground, engaging with the principals.  I want to acknowledge, in particular, Monsignor Dan O'Connor who was pivotal in ensuring that we got the extra places.  There may be issues in Offaly or other parts of the Deputy's constituency with regard to places.  Obviously, school principals may have reservations and concerns about what this would look like and whether they would have the proper resources to create the best environment for their students.

Yesterday I spoke to a representative of a school that takes in 90 children for July provision.  At this stage the school should be organising transport for the children, SNAs, teachers, physiotherapists and nurses.  School authorities should not be worrying about the conditions of the scheme and whether it will go ahead but this information is not available to them.  The July provision is 20 days of fun and music for children with complex needs who have been isolated at home since early March.  When autistic children are about to leave school, they are reassured for weeks beforehand but on 13 March these children left school and did not come back.  They were left at home with their parents, many of whom were trying to work from home as well as mind other siblings and they were also expected to take care of their child with additional needs.  Many of these children are non-verbal.  They are unable to express how they feel or understand what is happening.<\/p>  <p>  Who is responsible for the summer provision?  Is it the Department of Children and Youth Affairs or the Department of Education and Skills?  The July provision programme is not open to preschool children.<\/p> <p>A simple solution this year might be an extension of the access and inclusion model, AIM, programme because the SNAs involved, who already know the preschool children, could maintain a sense of community for them as they transition to the next level of preschool.  Preschool does not have access to the July provision programme.  The scheme would be relatively inexpensive to run, with typical wages of between &euro;13 and &euro;16 per hour.  Perhaps the Minister would consider using social care students, student occupational therapists, student physiotherapists and student SNAs to accommodate preschool children this year.<\/p> <p> Simple questions are being asked by providers.  They are seeking three SNAs per class.  Since there is no swimming or horse riding this year, can children have home economics and music therapy?<\/p> <p> Some of the behaviours being witnessed are shocking.  Some children have not gotten out of bed since March.  They will require more effort on buses.  Home-based provision should still be an option in extreme cases.  HSE respite care needs to be reopened as soon as possible.  For the parents and guardians who took Covid seriously, it is time to reopen and give them the break they need.<\/p> <p> People require answers now.  There has been ample time to prepare a plan and inform providers of what is happening.  What about a simple extension of the AIM programme?  Where the transition is concerned, the people who have been with those children all the way up the line know the children.  It is not only the children who need a break, but also the parents.

I will not repeat that in English, as I have thanked him and his staff in Irish.<\/p>  <p>  In April, I was contacted by the Galway Autism Partnership about July provision.  As such, the Department was on ample notice.  The Department is under stress and a great deal of effort went into dealing with the leaving certificate, but children with special needs were invisible.  Indeed, they and their parents have always struggled to be visible, which was repeated verbatim in this document as regards July provision.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Minister for his written speech.  I have listened to all of the contributions and the Minister discussed the three stands.  Despite all of that, however, I am still not entirely clear.  While I appreciate that he forewarned us last week that the announcement would be this Friday, I am not sure how the message could change so substantially between now and Friday that he could not give us more detail today.<\/p> <p>All I can ask at this point is for the Minister to give absolute clarity on Friday.  I am not clear on this so I cannot explain it to people.  I am not sure if the July provision is going ahead as is with the extension to children with Down's syndrome in addition to the other courses.  Is priority being given to children with special needs, autism and Down's syndrome?  Can I go home and say to the people of Galway that they can rely on the July provision going ahead?<\/p> <p> I will quickly mention a few other items.  I will be writing to the Minister about them but I am seizing this opportunity.  If we do not learn from this situation we are simply going to repeat the mistakes of the past.  The NPHET committee was not adequate and did not have a broad enough range of experience to look at this issue.  There should have been a voice from day one for nursing homes, though that is separate from the Minister's brief, and a voice for special needs.<\/p> <p> I refer to universities.  I have a letter from a young student who is doing a Master's in medical device design in the National College of Art and Design.  It looks like a wonderful course, but it includes a summer project.  He and his colleagues do not know if they will be doing that summer project.  That is a matter for the Higher Education Authority, HEA, but it is a simple matter that could be clarified very quickly as there are very small numbers involved.<\/p> <p> I reiterate that children with special needs are not visible in general.  On top of the burden of coping with the Covid crisis, when the schools eventually reopen they will be facing a loss of SNAs.  That is despite the Minister's assurances in a statement made in April where he said: \"As part of the decision to defer the new allocation model, I am also confirming that no school will receive a lower allocation of SNA support\".  I have received representations, as I am sure have other Deputies, stating that even if the SNA has not been lost, a substantial number of hours are lost.<\/p> <p> D&eacute;anaim tagairt do scoil i gcro&iacute;l&aacute;r na Gaeltachta, sa Ghaeltacht is m&oacute; sa t&iacute;r.

Let us have some practical sense and say that as Covid has done enough damage, we are not going to reduce the teachers of any school in the country at the moment, even if they go below the numbers by one or two students.  It is not possible.  They are going to have to spread out.  That particular school has no sinks or taps and the boys have to use the girls' toilets, for various reasons.

I concur with the previous Deputy on a few of the issues she raised.  There is a fear that some children with autism have gone backwards because they were not getting their educational needs met.  We have to make sure that those people in the community, many of whom are silent, get proper representation and the proper educational system they deserve.  There is trepidation among parents, teachers and SNAs that this has not been handled well.  Every Deputy is looking for clarity on the July provision.  I am not going to labour the point because the previous Deputy has outlined it very well.<\/p>  <p>  School transport is also an issue.  I know this is the Minister's area but the Minister of State, John Halligan, would have been involved as well.  Will the same problems throw up their heads for school transport?  What types of provision will be laid out in school transport from September onward?  Is there going to be social distancing or physical distancing?<\/p> <p>Will there be problems given the number of buses?  Will all of this be sorted out in the meantime?  <\/p> <p> I refer to SNAs.  I have been contacted by a number of schools and my understanding, based on the principals who called me, is that whatever the allocation was last year will be the same for the coming year.  What happens if there are extra children who need SNAs in those schools?  There is something called an exceptional measure, but principals have to go around in rings in October to fight their case.  For one year at least, why would the Minister not give clarity to school principals in particular?  Things are difficult enough for them.  <\/p> <p> In fairness, a lot of good has been done and many things have been handled very well.  This is not about having a go at anybody.  It is about at least providing peace of mind for those children who may need SNAs starting off in September and now do not know whether they will have them.  I ask the Department to change the rules that mean what schools had last year is what they will have next year, and it is tough luck if they have more children but they can apply for exceptional measures.  We all know people have to go through appeals and back and forth to fight for services.  For God's sake, this September, given the circumstances our country is in, the Minister should outline a clear vision for principals, who have enough on their hands at the moment trying to plan how they will make sure there is safe physical distancing and children adhere to the rules in schools.  They are planning for SNA allocations already, and the Minister should at least provide them with some clarity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000052#DDD00200","speaker":"1508","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1591799100,"counter":167,"content":"<p>I thank both Deputies for their contributions.  If we went with last year's July provision, we could announce it and everything would be out there.

Deputies can tell their constituents that children with severe and profound intellectual disabilities will qualify.

The long-term challenge for the sector, as outlined in the climate action plan, is to meet the national policy objective of an approach to carbon neutrality which does not compromise our capacity for sustainable food production.  That plan goes on to set out sectoral greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets for the first time.  The target for agriculture is to reduce its emissions by between 10% and 15% by 2030.  Uniquely, agriculture and land use can also remove CO2 emissions from the atmosphere.  Our plan also requires agriculture to ensure that land use and land use change remove at least 26.8 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent from the atmosphere and contribute to the development of sustainable decarbonised energy systems.<\/p>  <p>  In the longer term, at EU level the drive is towards zero net emissions by 2050.  However, in getting to this position it is acknowledged that it is not possible to eliminate all emissions, such as those that arise from food production.  The aim is for a fair, healthy and environmentally friendly food system. <\/p>  <p>  The recently published farm to fork and biodiversity strategies as part of the European Green Deal are at the heart of this transition and propose ambitious actions to halt biodiversity loss and transform our food system.  At this stage, these strategies articulate a vision for the agrifood sector.  There are no legislative proposals to give effect to this vision, but these will follow and will be preceded by impact assessments that will allow us to properly evaluate the detail. <\/p>  <p>  However, it is not only policy that is driving change.  Society too is demanding a step-up in national climate and environmental commitment.  As policymakers, we will have to work with stakeholders to seek the opportunity in this vision for sustainable food production.  We will need to align our policy for the development of the agrifood sector with public and market sentiment and our national and international obligations to the environment, while protecting farm incomes.  <\/p>  <p>  The agriculture and land use sector is playing its part in the national climate effort by reducing emissions where possible, sequestering carbon and managing our carbon pools, and <\/p>  <p> contributing to the development of sustainable decarbonised energy systems.  I will provide some specific examples of the actions that my Department has been engaging in.  It is progressing a national climate and air roadmap for the agriculture sector to 2030 and beyond and has engaged in significant public consultation in this regard.  This has involved a series of stakeholder engagements, including a one-day workshop which brought together a wide range of stakeholders to share information and discuss how to deliver on the sector&rsquo;s climate commitments.  The agriculture and food sector is one of the first sectors to take such a step.  To my mind, this demonstrates the level of commitment across the sector to tackling climate change.<\/p> <p>The roadmap will translate the overall sectoral ambition into more detailed actions and targets for delivery over the coming years.  It is informed by the Teagasc marginal abatement cost curve, MACC, which identifies and costs various actions that will deliver emissions reductions and removals.<\/p> <p> My Department continues to invest in mitigation measures.  For example, almost 24,000 farmers are participating in the beef data and genomics programme, BDGP, which has seen more than 1 million animals genotyped to date.  Approximately 49,000 farmers are active in the green, low-carbon agricultural scheme, GLAS.<\/p> <p> On the forestry front, Ireland has its highest level of forest cover in more than 350 years, at 11% of total land area.  Under the current National Forestry Programme 2014-2020, afforestation rates have been, on average, 5,343 ha per annum and the latest wood-flow analysis indicates that in 2018, 40% of the roundwood timber used in the Republic of Ireland was used for energy generation, with consequential savings of 880,000 tonnes in emissions.<\/p> <p> On the energy efficiency side, our farmers are availing of investment options such as biomass boilers and air-source heat pumps under the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, II pig and poultry, and the young farmers' capital investment scheme.  My Department also announced a &euro;10 million fund in April last year to support the installation of solar photovoltaic, PV, across all farms and the use of LED lighting.<\/p> <p> We continue to engage in collaborate initiatives such as the agricultural sustainability support and advisory programme, ASSAP, with Government and industry representatives working together with farmers to improve water quality, as well as working closely with Bord Bia and Teagasc to effect positive change at farm level through research, advisory services and carbon audits.<\/p> <p> My Department has also published a Code of Good Practice for Reducing Ammonia Emissions from Agriculture following a public consultation.  This code will go hand in hand with our efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.<\/p> <p> While I have thus far focussed on mitigation, there are two important elements to climate action, with adaptation planning being the other part of the story.  We know our climate is changing and this is evident again this year with the driest spring in Dublin since records began in 1837.  The agriculture and land sector is particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and, therefore, needs to be prepared and resilient so that it can face whatever challenges the weather might throw our way.  The first statutory agriculture, forest and seafood climate change sectoral adaptation plan was published last year.  The plan sets out the projected changes in climate and focuses on those identified as most likely to impact the sector.  Raising awareness and embedding climate adaptation across all our policies is central to how successful we are at adaptation planning, with buy-in and behavioural change being key.  With that objective in mind, my Department adopted a case study approach in the plan, setting out a range of examples of how the sector has been impacted by changes in our weather and identifying steps towards building resilience.  Our climate is changing and sustainable adaptation is going to be necessary.  By taking steps to reduce the exposure of agriculture to present climate variability we can inform future climate adaptation requirements and increase resilience.  I think at this stage we are all agreed on the need to act, and I hope the brief outline I have provided assures the House of both my commitment and that of those working in the sector to addressing the climate challenge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000055#KKK00200","speaker":"1454","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1591800000,"counter":173,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Deputies Cahill, Niall Collins, Michael Moynihan and Devlin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000056#LLL00200","speaker":"1546"},{"type":"speech","time":1591800000,"counter":174,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

It is important to note the starting point of agriculture in the transition.  We are efficient in how we produce food and, globally, our food is recognised to be of a very high quality.  It is one of the key drivers of exports, with the agrifood sector employing 250,000 people.  As a nation, we are an outlier in terms of the contribution of agriculture to emissions compared to other countries.  Given the fact that agriculture is such a big part of the economy, it contributes 30% of our overall emissions versus 20% for transport and energy.<\/p> <p>The farming community is aware that agriculture needs to contribute to meeting the transition targets and is very much up for doing so.  As the Minister outlined, many schemes have been promoted in recent years, notably under the rural development programme, with the objective of contributing to reducing our carbon footprint, meeting climate change objectives and improving biodiversity.  It will be critical in the years ahead that we hold our starting position as a green producer of food, that we continue to be a world leader in food production and that we contribute through agriculture to meeting climate change objectives and arresting the decline in biodiversity that we have seen in recent decades.  The next Common Agricultural Policy will be particularly important in that regard.  The Minister referred to the recent publication by the EU of the biodiversity and farm-to-fork strategies, which are pointing the way.  While we must ensure impact assessments are done on how the strategies will impact on farming, they set the direction of European policy, of which Ireland will be part.<\/p> <p> While farmers are up for increasing sustainability from both an environmental and a biodiversity point of view, we must also ensure that our approach is sustainable from an income and employment point of view.  Farmers will be expected to do more and they are up for doing more.  However, we must ensure they are rewarded for the extra effort they will make in the years ahead.<\/p> <p> Fianna F&aacute;il will play its part, working with the Oireachtas and the farming community, in leading the way in terms of the sustainability of agriculture from an environmental and income point of view.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000056#LLL00400","speaker":"1546","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1591800300,"counter":177,"content":"<p>It is the responsibility of every industry and sector to play its part in meeting the climate change targets in the coming years.  We are setting ourselves ambitious targets, which is the right thing to do.  However, it is vital that each sector bear a fair share of the burden.  That is true of agriculture but the burden must be economically sustainable.<\/p>  <p>  We have the bioeconomy and ongoing research in UCD under Professor Kevin O'Connor.  In my constituency, we have the Lisheen site which is producing research and technology that will be a great help in sustainable food production.<\/p>  <p>  To meet our targets, it is essential that we have an environmental scheme, similar to the previous rural environment protection scheme, REPS, which farmers will buy into and which will have 50,000 to 60,000 participants.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister mentioned the part that forestry has to play.  We are meeting less than 50% of our planting targets in forestry.  Unfortunately, that will have an impact on reaching our targets on emissions reductions.<\/p>  <p>  In the short time available to me, I will raise the issue of designated land.  Brussels has made proposals to increase the amount of designated land in this country.  Whether it is land in the Shannon Callows, hen harrier land or designated land under another banner, farmers are not being properly compensated for the restrictions being placed on them.  This land has a very significant role to play in reducing emissions and producing a carbon sink.  I have never seen restrictions imposed on farmers which have reduced the capital value of their land by up to 80%.  It is imperative, given the challenge of climate change we face, that farmers who have had designation imposed on them be properly compensated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000057#MMM00200","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speech","time":1591800600,"counter":178,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to discuss this matter because it is so important to our economy and my constituency.  Coming from a neighbouring constituency, the Minister will know the importance of farming in Limerick, where approximately 6,000 farms support 6,000 farm families.  We have the full range of farming mix, from dairy and beef to poultry farming.  There is very high-quality land across the Golden Vale and marginal land of a lesser quality in other parts of my constituency, which poses challenges.  Farming is a major employer, employing almost 10,000 people.  The value of agricultural output and exports from my constituency alone is of the order of &euro;1 billion per year, so it is a very important sector.<\/p>  <p>  Farmers in Limerick, similarly to those up and down the country, face great uncertainty because farmers are primarily price takers, as we see in the case of milk and beef.  The uncertainty is compounded by the Government formation talks.  We hear about an agenda to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by 7% year on year, to reduce the national herd or to end the export of live exports, which would narrow the competition available to farmers and producers.  All of that is worrying people and it is against the backdrop of the Mercosur deal with the imminent import of cheap beef from countries where the climate change agenda we are discussing simply does not exist, such as Brazil and other parts of South America.<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister knows, we need to support our farmers in Limerick and throughout the country.  We need more diversification and we need to scale up the support schemes, particularly to keep the jobs.  Some 280,000 people are employed nationwide in food production.  That is against the backdrop of a recent UN report that tells us that despite all the scaling up, food production in Ireland will have to increase by about 50% by 2050.  We are recognised as a premium-food-producing nation, but we have to build on the scaling up while recognising our climate change agenda.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Irish Farmers Association, the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, the Beef Plan Movement and Macra na Feirme, which are continually in touch with me and my colleagues in Limerick and which impress on us the challenges they endure day after day.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister might reply in writing to the following question in his own time.  Will additional funding be made available?  Will he scale up the schemes to deal with the challenges of the climate change agenda?  Will he outline in his reply what he will do for young farmers?  Macra na Feirme has raised with me the issue of the intergenerational transfer of holdings and the challenges that presents.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, broadband is a considerable issue for farming and rural County Limerick, and I echo the comments of other speakers in respect of designated land, which is another significant issue in the county.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000058#NNN00100","speaker":"1493"},{"type":"speech","time":1591800600,"counter":179,"content":"<p>I call Deputies Michael Moynihan and Devlin.

From the consumer's point of view, we produce the finest product in the world.  We produce an expert product that, for those who consume it, whether in the home or the restaurant, is top quality.  We have to be very strongly supportive in that regard and make no apologies for the product being made.  We then have to go back to the primary producer, who has in recent decades conformed to all the regulations, going back to those that were nearly impossible to envisage.  Farmers comply with them daily.  As the Minister will know through the Department, they comply with the regulations almost 100%, in terms of ensuring there is traceability and accountability for the product that has been produced.  We must acknowledge the farmers who do that and farm families the length and breadth of the country, as well as the product we have.<\/p> <p>We then have to tie that in to the challenges that exist, not only in Ireland but also throughout the rest of the world.  We can stand over the product we export, however.  I am aware that the Minister has been at many trade talks right across the world and can stand over the product.  Any Minister, Department or official can stand over the product our sector is trying to sell.<\/p> <p> We must ensure farmers continue to produce.  Many parishes and communities will say there are no young farmers taking over or that, having moved on to other jobs, they are simply not going back to farming because they do not see a future in agriculture.  We will have to make sure the agriculture industry is attractive to young people and that it is an attractive one in which to have a livelihood and to comply with the regulations. <\/p> <p> As we renegotiate the CAP, we must ensure the family farm is protected.  As we go forward, we must have a new agri-environmental scheme that is genuinely an environmental scheme.

Since I represent the maritime county of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, it is an issue close to my heart.  The marine sector is a vital part of Ireland's economy and of our culture as an island nation.  Protecting and maintaining the quality of our oceans is a pressing concern for the long-term health of this State.<\/p>  <p>  Harvested from the edge of the Atlantic Ocean, Irish seafood products are some of the most outstanding in the world but if we are to maintain this distinction, we must do more to protect our seas.  In my constituency, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, community activists such as Margaret Brown and young environmentalist Flossie Donnelly have done tremendous work leading volunteers and cleaning regularly the coastline in the area.  I hope the Minister will join me in commending those individuals on the work they have done.  The council equally supports their role, as is evident from its having secured recently blue flag status for Seapoint.  Seapoint is a special protected area, by EU designation, for biodiversity purposes.  It is disappointing, however, that Killiney remains without a blue flag.  Just recently, we heard that Merrion Strand in Dublin failed to meet EU standards for the fifth year in a row.  It is simply not good enough.<\/p>  <p>  Nationally, we need greater emphasis on protecting our marine biosphere.  We have a moral and economic obligation to protect and enhance the immense natural resources of our waters for future generations.  Ireland has specific legally binding EU obligations in regard to achieving good environmental standards in our seas.  I note the Minister did not mention this in his remarks.  The international targets set for Ireland are to have 10% of our waters protected by the end of this year and 30% by the end of 2030.  Currently, just 2% of Irish waters are protected.  This is the second lowest percentage in the European Union.  The next Government must remedy this.<\/p>  <p>  I support the actions to strengthen Ireland's role in protecting natural oceanic resources for future generations.

The fundamental problems lie in the analysis to the effect that, first, farmers are considered enemies of the process of delivering on our climate change obligations and, second, all farmers are essentially the same.<\/p> <p>When we speak of beef, for example, the suckler herd is discussed in the same context as factory feedlots.  There is no comparison between the two, as suckler farmers can play a very important and positive role, whereas factory feedlots play an almost entirely negative role in an environmental context.<\/p> <p> We are told that over the course of the next few days we will face a possible, if not probable, deal between Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party that will be put to their memberships.  This will be a pivotal test as to whether the voices of family farmers have been heard.  We know many of them were part of the vote for change and the parties to the deal - or at least some of them - have been doing their utmost to deny that mandate for change that was clearly given.  It is interesting to hear many conversations emanating from Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael representatives to reassure their members that the Green Party will not be disastrous for rural Ireland or Irish family farming.  I have my views on whether it will or will not have such an effect but the inference behind this is that Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael have had a positive influence or been good for rural communities and Irish family farms.  I argue that this is entirely a false premise and the parties that have been in government over successive decades have overseen the diminution of the Irish family farm network, which in turn has had a negative impact on rural communities.<\/p> <p> One of the big tests we will see coming from a programme for Government, if one is agreed, is the position of the Mercosur trade deal.  The Cathaoirleach will recall this Chamber voted by a large majority to reject the Mercosur trade deal but the outgoing Government refused to respect that mandate given in this House by the representatives of the people in this State.  Nothing encapsulates the double standards around the discussions on climate change more than the Mercosur trade deal.  The conversation almost instructs the suckler farmers with perhaps ten or 12 cattle to reduce their output while at the same time there is implicit support of a European Union trade deal that will see hundreds of thousands of tonnes of additional beef coming into Europe.  That is not only hypocritical but downright crazy from an environmental perspective.  We know countries like Brazil are not any way close to matching the type of standards our farmers adhere to and that country, conversely, is tearing down rainforests in order to produce beef.<\/p> <p> We also know forestry is important.  I support the notion of a sustainable forestry policy that can play an important role in our climate action obligations.  A good forestry policy should be good for communities and people should want to live beside a forest.  It should be good for farmers and forests should present opportunities for diversification.  A good forestry policy should be good for the local economy and people should be able to find work locally that would in turn be a driver of local domestic economies.  A good forestry policy should of course be good for the environment.  Only the geniuses that have run this State for so long could come up with a forestry policy that manages to do none of this.<\/p> <p> The test will come before us when we see how these parties answer such questions.  The test will come if we see a programme for Government that does not reject the Mercosur agreement, that does not support family suckler farms instead of factory feedlots and that does not support people who wish to move to organic farming.  If we do not see a payment scheme for those involved in the process of carbon sequestration, I fear many of our local rural communities and farming families will feel the mandate for change was not heeded on this occasion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000059#OOO00600","speaker":"1451","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1591801500,"counter":188,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak in this annual debate on climate action.  Farmers need a long-term strategy for Irish agriculture.  Many farmers are worried that the next Government will continue to demonstrate a complete lack of vision when it comes to the future of the family farm.  Farmers want to see that there is a long-term future for them that is sustainable and compatible with climate action.  Unfortunately, what we have seen from successive Governments is a lack of clarity and ambition when it comes to agriculture and climate action.<\/p> <p>There is a need for big ideas and large projects that provide farmers with positive alternatives to which they can transition.  For instance, where is the Government strategy to develop biomass and biogas production, two sources of renewable energy that would provide farmers with new income streams?  Despite our large agricultural sector, we are miles behind countries such as Germany and other EU states when it comes to the production of renewables such as biogas and biomass.<\/p> <p> An answer to a parliamentary question in the past two weeks showed that &euro;861 million in carbon tax was collected in the past two years.  The midlands, and farmers, must get their fair share of that.  How much of that money was spent on replacement jobs, diversification for farmers and Bord na M&oacute;na workers?  I refer to measures that would allow farmers in the midlands, for example, to diversify and transition to growing renewable energy crops such as biomass?  The three midlands power stations could be used for biogas energy production.  Those plants could create an income for farmers, energy for the country and, importantly, jobs for the region.  Surplus heat can be used for horticulture, which Bord na M&oacute;na has started to look at.  Despite all that, there is still a concerted effort to decommission two of those three power plants.<\/p> <p> Where is the Government strategy to develop long-term on-farm afforestation?  Currently, large corporations are coming into rural areas, buying up farms and planting spruce.  That is replacement farming.  That is not agroforestry; it is replacement agriculture.  We need a long-term strategy that gives local farmers the opportunity to plant trees as part of on-farm forestry.  That will give them new income and would also enhance biodiversity and improve carbon sequestration.<\/p> <p> Those are just two of the positive ideas on which farmers can and want to contribute to climate action but, long term, there is no major Government planning.  Instead, we have seen a great deal of focus on carbon tax and reducing the national herd, two policies that alone will not solve the climate crisis until affordable alternatives are available.  We should reward farmers for protecting hedgerows and other sources of carbon sequestration.  The issue at the moment is that farmers are being financially incentivised under the current CAP to cut back on hedgerows.  That has to change under the new CAP.<\/p> <p> The Minister mentioned TAMS.  The scheme had a pilot renewable energy aspect, which was welcome.  He has seen for himself the potential in that.  We need that reopened and expanded.  We also need the Bill I introduced in 2019, the Solar Panel (Climate Action) Bill, progressed through the D&aacute;il to make it easier for farmers and small businesses to put solar panels on the roofs of buildings from which to generate electricity.<\/p> <p> Instead of supporting negative measures such as increasing the current carbon tax, Sinn F&eacute;in wants to see a continued campaign to work for positive alternatives such as renewable energy and improvement of on-farm forestry, which will give farmers a real opportunity to diversify and create new sources of income.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000060#PPP00200","speaker":"1491","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1591801800,"counter":190,"content":"<p>Will I be able to make my contribution in two parts?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000061#QQQ00200","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"speech","time":1591801800,"counter":191,"content":"<p>Certainly, yes.

That is an improved scheme, as has been mentioned, in respect of farmlands, which would take into account the time it would take to grow particular trees, and also the type of trees, while ensuring the growth of a steady supply of native trees.  However, as we have seen in the past in County Louth and across the State, we have had a large number of forests with which there have been an increasing number of issues.  That is likely to continue into the future.<\/p>  <p>  Last week, large tracts of cultural land were destroyed on the Cooley Peninsula, with the fire spreading onto local authority lands.  I commend the fire services from Louth County Council for the incredible work they did while at the same time also battling malicious fires in Dundalk.  I want to mention a particularly malicious arson attack on the house of a garda in Dundalk at the weekend and commend the vigilance of neighbours and the fire services for the quick response.<\/p> <p>Without them, we could have been dealing with a far more tragic situation.  Data show that forest fires will increasingly feature in the future as we deal with the issue of climate change.  We need to take steps to ensure a better, co-ordinated response to such fires.  The fire service did incredible work in Cooley but it needed the help of the Air Corps.  We had to wait our turn as it was dealing with other fires in other areas of the State and also encountered technical difficulties.  We need a plan for responding to large-scale fires.  We need to determine what is best practice.  This might involve fire breaks or managing gorse on mountains.  We need to ensure the Government plays its part in this regard.  We need a co-ordinated response from Government which involves the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the fire services, Coillte, the local authorities and any other necessary bodies.  We will be looking at such a plan at a local level within County Louth.  Some discussions in this regard have already started.  <\/p> <p> We are a very small island and in responding to fires, as in responding to climate change, we need to view the situation in an all-island context.  The areas about which I am talking are around the Border.  Louth has led the way in such co-operation in the past.  Under a memorandum of understanding between them, Louth County Council and Newry, Mourne and Down District Council have dealt with issues regarding dumping and so on.

I sometimes despair about the general narrative around forestry because it seems to suggest that forestry policy is monolithic and insists on a particular species and a particular way of planting.  The issues that, understandably, excite people in the context of forestry policy relate to the type of policy which is, fortunately, no longer with us.  This policy involved planting right up to the side of the road and right up to the back of people's gardens.  This left many communities and individuals to live in shadow and increased their sense of isolation.  That type of forestry policy has, fortunately, largely been consigned to the past.<\/p>  <p>  There is now much more regulation in the area and a greater diversity of species involved.  For example, almost 40% - something like 38% - of afforestation approved to date in 2020 consists of broadleaf species.  Anyone listening to the narrative on public airwaves and on social media would believe we are planting nothing but Sitka spruce.  Almost 40% of afforestation now consists of broadleaf species.  With regard to our forestry targets, the number of applications in 2020 has increased 20% on this time last year.  That reflects well on the mid-term review of the forestry programme which was carried out recently.  This saw significant changes to the premiums paid.  Greater premiums are now paid for planting broadleaves.  <\/p>  <p>  There is also support for different types of forestry.  There are still traditional commercial afforestation plans but there is also continuous use forestry and agroforestry.  This involves afforestation at a much lower density and is compatible with continuing to farm while growing trees.  That is really important from a social point of view because many farmers do not want to throw in the towel on their traditional methods of farming but still want to see if they can carry on some forestry, with significant financial support from the State including tax-free premiums.  That mix of new afforestation types is resulting in a significant level of new interest in afforestation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000062#RRR00200","speaker":"1454"},{"type":"speech","time":1591802100,"counter":195,"content":"<p>I really appreciate the Minister's response.

There are, of course, two subjects involved.  First, there is the issue of retaining a viable agricultural sector and then, at the same time, there is the issue of meeting international norms in respect of carbon reduction.  It is entirely possible for the two to run alongside each other without either being excluded or sacrificed.<\/p> <p>The single biggest step we can take on carbon reduction is on generation of electricity from non-fossil fuels.  That is as simple as it gets.  Other countries have proven that long ago and they have advanced the degree to which they are going down that road rapidly.<\/p> <p> The other thing to remember is the fundamental nature of the agri-food business in this country.  We do not produce food just for our own population.  We produce food for approximately nine times our population.  That is very sizeable and will have to be replaced by other food production methods in the event of their being a major reduction in food production in the agri-food sector.  There is also an economic issue.  The two can be complimentary and can proceed alongside each other and we can achieve the targets we need to achieve.<\/p> <p> Reference was made earlier to native deciduous species.  I am all in favour of that, but I have to keep in mind that some species have a greater capacity than others to sequester carbon - the sitka spruce and the western red cedar have that capacity.  You would need 4,000 acres of native deciduous species for 1,000 acres of spruce to achieve the same results.  This is considerable.  We also need to be mindful that there will be an impact in this country from Brexit, which will not be positive, and we need to be geared for that and ready to take whatever action is necessary.  We must also regard our agri-food sector as the manufacturing sector; it is the engine of our industry and the equivalent of the major heavy industries in other countries throughout Europe and across the globe.  We do not have car manufacturing plants or heavy engineering plants or the heavy emissions which come from those plants, but we have the agri-food sector which is deemed to produce a high level of carbon emissions.  This can be controlled and modified considerably by dietary change and by various farming methods, and that is being done.  We need to get credit for the degree to which we have been able to adopt measures which are conductive to carbon reduction and at the same time allow the industry to continue.<\/p> <p> Reference has been made by many people as to the degree to which compensation will compensate for reductions.  Beware of that.  The beet growing industry should provide a sufficient lesson to remind us that compensation is only for the time being, it does not go on forever.  Any resolution we achieve should be more long term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000062#RRR00500","speaker":"1584","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1591802400,"counter":199,"content":"<p>Deputy Durkan has left some time so the Minister might address the issues raised.

It is those who have a capacity to do it in the most sustainable manner and our sustainability credentials, while not saying we do not have room for improvement, are amongst the most sustainable.  We can argue about who is first or second, but broadly speaking we are amongst the most sustainable and we have a grass-based production system.  It is important we underpin our offering on the global marketplace in the context of that sustainability.  Consumers are very focused on that anyway.  We have a natural advantage that we should not willingly hamper in any way.  It is worth remembering that, particularly in the context of a growing global population.  Someone opposite made the point that up to 2050 there will be a requirement to increase global food production by 50% because of a growing global population.<\/p> <p>That is a challenge for us as well.  We must ensure that we are the most carbon efficient per kilo of output.  We start from a good position, but we have more to do.  We have a critical role to play from a global point of view in feeding the world.<\/p> <p> On forestry, we are at our highest level of afforestation in nearly 350 years at 11%, with 50% in public ownership and 50% in private ownership.  As I said in reply to Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, we must encourage more landowners to participate in that afforestation endeavour because it is not only a legitimate land use and crop but it is also significant in terms of sequestration potential.  I note the point the Deputy made about the sequestration of different tree types.  What he said about the sequestration of Sitka spruce, in particular, is true.<\/p> <p> My Department has been active in the area of renewable energy in terms of LED lighting, solar panel grant aid and other initiatives such as renewable heat pumps and so forth that are supported under the TAMS grant scheme.  I accept that we can do more in the bioeconomy area.  That is an important opportunity.  We come to this debate in a European context late in the day.  The industry is very much in its nascent stage in this economy, but that brings its own advantages insofar as we can learn from others.  Our agriculture model for anaerobic digestion, for example, is different in the context of feedstocks from those of many of our European counterparts with whom we are sometimes compared because we have an outdoor livestock production system.  We do not generally have the feedstock from animal slurries.  If one is looking at alternatives for feedstock, including food waste or grass, we must ensure that it is grown in a sustainable way.  There is a great deal of research ongoing in this area and my Department is certainly playing its part in that.  I see that as an important activity from a climate point of view and also as an economic activity for farmers from which they can benefit in the years ahead.<\/p> <p> On Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute;'s point, I am not familiar with this issue of inter-agency co-operation, but it makes absolute sense.  I am sure it happens on a practical level.  If there are forestry fires, road accidents or whatever, there is a level of co-operation, obviously underpinned by memoranda of understanding, MOUs, and so forth, that would see the efficient deployment of emergency services in any circumstance.  That makes sense on an all-island basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000063#SSS00300","speaker":"1454","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1591802700,"counter":202,"content":"<p>I wish to make a final point.

There are millions of people throughout the world in need of a decent diet and that will continue for the foreseeable future.  We need to concentrate on that.  At the same time, we must make our contribution to the reduction of carbons and I believe we can do that effectively, and proportionately better than anywhere else in the globe.

This will not work on a punitive, wagging the finger and telling people what to do basis.  It will only work if it is a better country everywhere.  That applies particularly for rural Ireland, farming, forestry and land use.  We can do this.  We can deliver a low carbon society that is good for our people, good for nature and provides food security, healthier food and a long-term future that is stable.<\/p> <p>I was lucky to meet one of the great pioneers of renewable energy, the German politician, Hermann Scheer.  He was a social democrat, not a Green, and one of the great leaders of the solar revolution whom I had the pleasure of meeting.  I always remember the closing paragraphs of his book, <i>The Solar Economy<\/i>, with its one main message, namely, farmers are critical.  He argued they will be the heroes and will be key with their ingenuity and their knowledge of the land.  He also said working out how we manage our land in the best way is going to be central to meeting the climate change challenge we face.  He was right.<br\/><br\/>We need a national land use plan to help our farmers.  It is not about telling the farmer how to use the land because they have the best knowledge of what they do on their land.  Such a plan, however, has to set a framework where we plan our land, firstly, for thriving rural communities.  We work out the people at the centre of this environmental transition we are about to take.  It has to work out how we produce the best food related to the land and also how we store carbon, particularly in our peaty soils.  At the same time, such a plan has to work out how we restore biodiversity and nature, particularly in our woodlands.  It must work out, with all this coming together, how we improve the quality of our water and protect against floods.  A knock-on consequence is that we start to tackle some of the local pollution problems we have with ammonia, nitrogen and other materials.<br\/><br\/>That land use plan will be critical to meeting our climate change targets.  We are fortunate setting out on this because European Union policy states we have to head in this direction.  Those nine principles behind the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, which is coming, are all about supporting this environmental and social agenda.  It is about critically changing the power imbalances in the food system where the large processors - the people processing protein - make all the money while the primary producers are left with nothing.  That has to change.<br\/><br\/>The European Union set out last week its Green New Deal strategy which is behind the &euro;1.8 trillion stimulus package to get us out of the Covid economic crisis.  Central to this is the farm-to-fork strategy which, again, is all about going green.  It states we are going to reduce nitrogen fertilisers which makes sense economically, socially and environmentally.  We are going to switch to organic.  Europe is aiming to have 25% of land organic.  Only 2.5% of land in Ireland is organic and that share needs to multiply in the next four to five years.  We must reduce the amount of antibiotics used, along with reducing food waste while improving food security, by changing from these long supply chain systems where we import grain from South America to convert to protein here to then ship to China, all in packaging which China then sends back the other way.  This whole system is going to change for the better.<br\/><br\/>People are worried because they have been presented with all sorts of scare stories that the Green Party will be bad for rural Ireland, farming, beef and dairy.  I fundamentally disagree.  Recently, I spoke to someone involved with the UCD Lyons research farm.  It is working on the future of farming along with Moorepark and other places and how we grow grass.  Our climate and land give us a significant advantage in grass growing.  They now say, however, we need to switch from pumping fertilisers and slurries on to land to promote Italian ryegrass to grow as fast as possible.  This is very vulnerable in either high-rain conditions, with wet fields, or in the very dry conditions we are seeing at the moment.  Those shallow-rooted, nitrogen-pumped grass systems are not safe or secure and do not work in a climate-changing world.  They say if we actually switch to mixed grass with natural flowers, weeds, herbs and other grasses mixed in, along with clover bringing in the nitrogen naturally, the farmer will get a far better return.  The amount of nitrogen the farmer might have to spread might go from 250 kg per hectare down to 90 kg.  That would be a dramatic reduction with savings to a farmer's fertiliser bill.  Animal health is dramatically improved as a result too.<\/p> <p>We can get a better price because we can go to the market and say that this is genuinely origin green because it is from a much more diverse, secure system.<\/p> <p> In our upland areas, where we have really peaty soil, if we allow that peat to restore the carbon rather than letting it all evaporate by draining all that land, we can bring a cow or a sheep onto that and graze it in the summer period when the land naturally dries, and that helps us in our climate objectives because it stops the growth of birch or other native trees which would drain the land.  I am convinced that we can go to our international markets and say that this meat, dairy or other product is playing its part in the climate solutions that we need to deliver, and get a better price for it, while being genuinely origin green in everything we do.  That is the future that I see for Irish farming.<\/p> <p> We also have to change forestry, not just farming.  The Minister, Deputy Creed, is right that there is a change towards broadleaves and that Sitka spruce absorbs carbon too.  We must, however, get away from the monocultural clearfell rotation forestry that we have at present because it does not promote biodiversity.  We have to restore nature as well as storing carbon.  We can do that in a variety of ways.  I had the pleasure of sitting beside Deputy Fitzmaurice in recent years, up in the back bench where Deputy Sherlock is sitting, and he was forever nudging me and saying that we should use the idea of taking a hectare for every farm for what Deputy Michael Moynihan said earlier about schemes such as the rural environment protection scheme, REPS, where we get the farmer to help plant some native forestry that is genuinely mixed.  We could perhaps let some land rewild, in some corner areas of the field that would not take from the productive capability of the farm.  Farmers' knowledge of their land would allow nature to come back, store carbon, restore biodiversity and improve the water course.  If one managed it in conjunction with one's neighbours, we could improve our rivers and the whole system.  This is doable and we should support it to encourage a new generation of young people into family farming in our country.  It delivers all the benefits.<\/p> <p> At the same time, we should roll out agroforestry.  Those grasslands also store carbon and provide that capability, which we know works.  Smart young farmers throughout the country are doing this already.  We just need to do more of what is working and what is right, which will give us this origin green in everything we do.  Continuous cover forestry should not be clearfelled in order that in the long term, we get a continuous supply of high-quality timber which helps our local industries and helps us to keep population in rural Ireland.  This is all possible.  At the same time we should manage our peatlands, concentrating first and foremost on the cutaway large bogs, where by re-covering them with water, we will store millions of tonnes of carbon, which will allow us to meet our objectives.  We should get the skilled people of Bord na M&oacute;na to do that because they are knowledgeable about how that can be done best.  This is not a hardship posting; this is not a negative story.  This will be good for rural Ireland.  We can meet our targets and our obligations.  I do not believe we have a choice.  If we were to go the other way and said to count us out because we do not really want to be origin green and just want to go half way with our measures, at some point the rest of the world will rightly say that Ireland is not actually origin green in what it does.<\/p> <p> Let us make this change and let us change the whole distribution system in order that we have a better connection to the Irish consumer and the Irish farmer, so that they get a better price.  Let us be more diverse so that we start to develop horticulture and a range of other tillage crops, as well as meat and dairy, so that we are not reliant on just that small number of producers and processors on the international markets.  Let us promote ourselves as the absolute best in class in protecting nature, in high quality, tasty food and storing carbon as we go.  Being a green seller to the rest of the world would see Irish farming thrive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000064#TTT00300","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1591803300,"counter":206,"content":"<p>It is very interesting to hear Deputy Eamon Ryan, who may be a prospective T&aacute;naiste, giving us a sense of his vision.  The potentially continuing or next Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine is also here to listen to that view.  I am in no way being facetious about this.  The view espoused by Deputy Ryan, possibly soon to be a Minister, is a vision that broadly we would all like to buy into.<\/p> <p>It is a picture of an Ireland that existed in the not-too-distant past, when one looks at grassland management, forestry management, land use and all that they entail.  We are, however, in a scenario where agriculture is a key component of our economy.  We have a particular type of production based on grassland and it has a massive benefit to the economy.<\/p> <p> I would like to ask the Minister about the national herd.  In the context of climate action the debate around agriculture has been narrowed into the funnel of reducing the national herd.  There has been an oversimplification of that argument and it has become the narrative.  Some of us want to see a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions but do not want to see the fabric of the rural economy being taken out and ripped to shreds in one fell swoop.  I am sure the Minister can understand, as can Deputy Ryan, that there are farm families who rely on beef production.  This is because most people are now farming to schemes.  An unfortunate outcome of the way we have managed agriculture over the decades is that people farm to schemes and are incentivised to go into a particular scheme because that is from where they derive their income.  Somewhere within that discourse there has to be a discussion about how we incentivise those farmers who are, with some degree of justification, suspicious or sceptical about the direction of travel to move towards schemes such as agri-environment schemes and TAMS that will ensure they can continue to manage and produce livestock in a way that is sustainable but does not compromise their membership of a community.  In rural communities, on a Friday night, one could have three generations of a farm holding or household sitting in a pub talking to their neighbours about what happened at the mart.  We cannot tell them they must stop beef production in one fell swoop.  We have to manage a transition towards a future that they are a part of and have ownership of and which does not compromise their ability to produce livestock.  There is a happy medium.<\/p> <p> I am not a scientist so when I look at Teagasc research I have to interpret what the organisation is trying to say.  There seems to be something in its research which, through a pathway of proper land use, schemes and buy-in, allows us to get to the 2030 target.  However, certain things have to happen.  Farmers need to be part of a discussion and to have ownership of what needs to happen if we are to reach the 2030 target.  There is a disparity between the 3.5% climate action plan target and the 6.5% or 7% target that has been bandied around as part of discussions on a programme for Government.  This is causing a great deal of confusion and is wrapped up in the narrative that the 7% figure equates to a reduction in the national herd.  I do not think that will happen but there needs to be clarity regardless of who is in government.  Will our annual emissions reduction target in the climate action plan be 3.5% or will it ramp up to 7%?  I am seeking the Minister's perspective on this and to have him enlighten us.  If the annual target goes up to 7%, what will be the knock-on effect for farmers, the rural economy and people living in rural Ireland?  Will it entail, as it must in my view, the setting in place of schemes that will ensure there is no drastic loss of income and give the individual landowner and farmer a stake in what that future looks like?<\/p> <p>Broadly, the question I have for the Minister is whether we will see an increase.  All parties here, ironically enough, have bought into the 7% target, because the Joint Committee on Climate Action agreed to that.  It is interesting to hear from our friends in Fianna F&aacute;il, who are in opposition now but might soon be sitting at the other side of the House, using opposition rhetoric.  I do not speak in a pejorative way about targets and about the reduction of the national herd but they need to be honest about the fact they signed up for these very targets.  We need to have honesty in this debate around climate action, because it is a non-partisan and apolitical space and we need to work together on it.  I will be interested in hearing the Minister's perspective on how we get from a target of 3.5% to 6.5%, as Deputy Eamon Ryan indicated - or is it 7% or 6% or whatever you are having yourself - because that will have a knock-on effect for agriculture<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000066#VVV00200","speaker":"1514","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1591804200,"counter":209,"content":"<p>The direction of travel for Irish agriculture has been abundant for many years now.  There has been a lot of commentary in recent times about a REPS-style support in the environmental scheme.  That, in itself, tells a story.  Long before the current debate around targets began, farmers were acutely aware of their role in landscape management and sustainable agricultural product and in many ways were indicative of what was needed in the international marketplace.  That was long before the debate we are now having was under way.<\/p>  <p>  We have had REPS, the agri-environment options scheme, AEOS, and we now have the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS.  Under GLAS, for example, we have what farmers sometimes bristle at, which is the lack of recognition that they have been working at this long before it became politically popular to talk about.  Some 260,000 ha are under low-input permanent pasture.  That is a low-intensity management system compatible with best environmental practice.  Traditional hay meadow comprises almost 60,000 ha.  There are hundreds and thousands of bird and bat boxes and such in terms of biodiversity.  This is what farmers have been doing.  The world did not begin on 9 February or any time recently on this issue, it is a journey farmers have been on for many years.  <\/p>  <p>  With due respect to Deputy Eamon Ryan, this term that he uses regularly, \"genuinely origin green\", is a disservice to the enormous efforts in which farmers are involved on that journey. To give an example, 250,000-plus carbon audits have been conducted on over 50,000 farmers' holdings to ensure they are not just genuinely origin green, they are origin green.  If one has a product that is labelled \"origin green\", it is because it has met the audit requirements.  It is a buy-in from farmers and from more than 260 food processors to the whole concept of putting our best foot forward on the international stage.  That is not to say for a moment there are not other things we need to do.  We need to make sure we bring people along who have been with us on a journey through REPS, AEOS, GLAS, organic schemes, the beef data and genomics programme, BDGP, which is lightening the carbon footprint on our beef sector to which Deputy Sherlock alluded.  <\/p>  <p>  This is a journey that continues.  It is accelerating at a pace now because the backdrop is the biodiversity strategy, the Green New Deal and the farm to fork strategy.  While they do not have a legal instrument at the moment, they will migrate across into Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, strategy.  That is undoubtedly the case but we need to make sure we do that in the context of a growing global population that has to be fed and in a sustainable way that does not compromise sustainable food production.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000068#XXX00200","speaker":"1454"},{"type":"speech","time":1591804200,"counter":210,"content":"<p>The next party to speak is the Social Democrats.

It has made farming and fishing communities fearful of climate action.  I often end up asking the question as to whether farmers should be more worried about climate action or climate change.<\/p> <p>I am interested to know what the Minister thinks.<br\/><br\/>We need action and it will require determination, vision and leadership.  A business-as-usual approach simply is not working.  Ireland is failing to meet its emissions targets and the annual transition statement is a clear signal that the Department is not about to change its approach.  I have learned that when it comes to climate action and the Minister's Department, there are three important points to highlight.  First, the Government and vested interests portray climate action as a cliff edge for farmers and fishing communities.  Ministers stating that a reduction in emissions will &quot;decimate&quot; Irish farms adds to the false narrative that change will have a negative impact on our livelihoods.  As a farmer and a scientist, this is incredibly disappointing.  Farmers and fishing communities need to be treated with respect, not fed platitudes.  Changes in the sector are inevitable.  The first step in solving any problem is recognising there is one.  Climate action has to be understood and pursued as a necessity and an opportunity.  A just transition can and should be at the centre of all climate policy and farmers need that reassurance.  Second, it is necessary to highlight that emission efficiency is not the same as reducing emissions.  The emphasis on efficiency instead of overall reduction of emissions is failing, and failing fast.  Ireland's 2020 emissions target was a 20% reduction.  The Minister's statement tells us it is going to be 6% at best.  Efficiencies will not help farms about to face another drought.  Third, I have learned that when the Government refers to things like ambitious targets for all-of-government climate action and does not follow it up with specific ambitious actions, that is just paying lip service and is another slap in the face for the next generation of farmers.<br\/><br\/>I have three examples which illustrate issues with the current approach.  The first concerns valuing sustainability.  Last Monday was World Oceans Day, an opportunity to celebrate the role that oceans play in our lives and to recognise the damage global economic systems are doing to them.  As a coastal constituency, in west Cork we know the sea is an amazing natural resource that supports our tourism and fishing sectors.  It is essential that we ensure the sea is respected.  Unfortunately, we need only look at all the litter and pollution on our beaches and overfishing by supertrawlers to realise this is not the case.<br\/><br\/>We need to support sustainable, small-scale fishing.  To do that we need to immediately address the lack of basic infrastructure for such fishing.  Too many small piers dotted around our coastline and islands are falling into disrepair and lack basic amenities like slipways.  They urgently need investment to preserve the livelihood of local families and the practice of truly sustainable fishing, the kind of fishing that has existed in rural and coastal Ireland for generations.  That type of fishing is more environmentally friendly and will keep families living on islands and in other coastal areas.<br\/><br\/>Funding for this comes in limited forms from the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Housing, Planning and Local Government to local authorities.  Having been a member of the coastal management committee on Cork County Council, I can tell the Minister how apparent underinvestment in small piers was.  At the very first meeting, I had to point out that everyone fighting for the same minuscule amount of funding was counterproductive and that we should instead make the focus how can we get more much-needed funding for piers.  I was advised to ask the Minister.  Can the Minister ensure that small piers are made a priority in the funding streams for marine infrastructure to support sustainable fishing and coastal and island communities?<br\/><br\/>My next example highlights the need for participatory decision making between farmers, fishing communities, their representatives and Government.  The sustainable development goals recognise partnerships as an essential part of the solution.  The Covid-19 tie-up scheme demonstrates the urgent need for greater engagement.  Once it was announced, fishermen and their organisations contacted me expressing dismay.  Not only was it insufficient to cover standing costs, it was ill-suited in assisting an industry on the verge of collapse.  The Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation called the scheme&quot;botched&quot; and more than 98% of respondents to a survey for <i>The Irish Skipper<\/i>said it will not cover fixed costs.  The Minister met fishing representatives in March and April but in May, this unpopular and unsuitable scheme was launched.  That is the result of a failed engagement process.  This is why farmers and fishing communities are so often negative about policies; their concerns and suggested solutions are disregarded.  <br\/><br\/>Not only do we need immediate adjustments to the scheme, we also need to be assured that the flawed systems which created the scheme are reformed.<\/p> <p>Will the Minister commit to engaging actively with fishing communities and representative organisations to make adjustments to the scheme?  More broadly, will he commit to a partnership-based model in developing climate action policies for emissions reduction?<\/p> <p> Third, there is the matter of priorities.  There is a limited budget but within that, there are always choices.  Small farmers and coastal and island communities are screaming out for funding, yet again this year, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is giving almost &euro;17 million to the greyhound racing industry.  This controversial, loss-making industry is funded with public money.  Last year&rsquo;s \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\" programme found that the industry is \"breeding animals to kill them\".  Now greyhound racing is set to commence ahead of vital services like breast and cervical cancer screening.  Why is this deeply problematic industry held in such high esteem by the Government?  <\/p> <p> Funding sustainable agriculture and fishing needs to be prioritised.  The annual transition statement and its catalogue of our current policy inadequacies has to be a wake-up call.  Action is required immediately.  Real changes are needed that will help save and enhance Irish farming.  The past five years, since the signing of the Paris Agreement, have been squandered on shallow gestures and a focus on efficiencies over achievements.  Even worse than wasting time we do not have is wasting time that our grandchildren and their children will not have.  We need action not only because of the inevitable fines, but because of the moral obligation to the next generation of farmers and fishing communities.  What is the Minister going to do to ensure farmers and fishermen can start to welcome and seek climate action?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000068#XXX00400","speaker":"1525","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1591805100,"counter":214,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for her contribution and her questions.

Many of the initiatives, therefore, that we have under way, for example in lower emission slurry spreading or using protected ureas and calcium ammonium nitrate are all steps that improve the efficiency.  The BDGP improves the genetic efficiency of our herd while the EBI improves the genetic efficiency of our dairy herd.  There are sequestration opportunities in terms of lower intensity management under GLAS, for example 260,000 ha of low-input permanent pasture or traditional hay meadows.  These are all of the steps we are taking.  This is not something that the Department has begun to embrace in recent days; it is something that has been under way for years and years.

Despite the Minister's bluster at the start of the crisis and the utter failure of the regulatory regime in the form of the Health and Safety Authority, it is clear that workers in meat plants were effectively sacrificed, bullied and intimidated into working in unsafe conditions throughout the crisis.  It was not until the clusters and the numbers affected became too big to hide that belated action was taken.  Even now, I am not content or confident that enough actions or safeguards are being taken to protect these workers.  Why did the State and its agencies fail workers in meat plants so badly?  The answer seems to be the same as to the answer to the question as to why we are failing in measures to tackle climate emissions in agriculture.  It is not because the agricultural sector is so vital to our economy, which it is, nor is it because we support family farms and want to see a thriving rural community and sustainable farming, as most of us do, and it is not out of concern for farmers and their families.  The workers in the meat plants, just like the beef farmers and others in this agriculture sector, are being failed because current policy has nothing to do with supporting farmers or the rural community.  It is about supporting a corporate agrifood industry which benefits only a tiny few and generates massive profits for those at the top of the chain, their shareholders and CEOs.  It does not support ordinary farmers and their families and it is certainly not supporting workers on the killing floors of the meat factories and abattoirs.<\/p> <p> That brings us to the issues of climate and our policy on agricultural emissions.  A false dichotomy or choice has been put out by people who claim to be the defenders of rural Ireland and loudly attack the Green Party on the basis that it is trying to destroy rural Ireland with proposals to cut the herd or nitrogen fertiliser use.  Sometimes the descriptions used would have us believe this is the greatest threat since the Famine or Cromwell.  We have greatly expanded the herd in recent years, with 20,000 cattle added to the dairy herd this spring.  Under the current business as usual plans, cattle numbers and fertiliser use are expected to continue to increase over the next decade, with the former set to increase by 11% and the latter by 6%.  This is driven by a policy of exporting to Asia and the Middle East.  My question to those who raise outraged voices and claim to represent rural Ireland and farming interests is how this policy is going for people in rural Ireland, farmers and their families.  How will the trend that is being defended improve matters for those families and farmers?  Are standards of living and the building of sustainable farming communities improving?  No, they are not.<\/p> <p> Last year, I stood outside Leinster House in solidarity with farmers who were being crushed by the corporate bosses and the policies of this Government, farmers who had been screwed by the beef processors which were posting record profits as they cut the prices they gave to the farmers.  How can anyone stand over a policy that is driving farmers to the wall and driving them out of the sector?  The Minister cannot pretend he is a friend of the farmer when all he has to offer is more of the same, which will ensure that Larry Goodman and other corporate interests record yet another year of profits in the tens of millions of euro, which are funnelled in to offshore accounts where they avoid tax.  The Minister cannot tell me this is a sustainable policy for farmers in Ireland.<\/p> <p> Current farming and agricultural policy is not working for ordinary farmers and it is certainly not working for the environment or climate.  This Government has given us more rhetorical commitments to reducing emissions and accepting the science of what actions we need to take.  However, that policy is governed by the corporate interests I mentioned and not the interests of the farmers or climate.  <\/p> <p> Once again, we see bizarre and unscientific efforts to explain away methane emissions and confuse the effect methane has on climate by pretending that if we account for it differently, it will go away or the problem may not look as serious as it is.  Science is screaming at us about this problem.<\/p> <p>We can fool ourselves if we want.  We can add up the emissions in various ways and we can pretend that offsets, sinks or taxes will allow us to continue polluting, but we cannot fool nature and we cannot fool the science of physics.  My concern about the Green Party and its members in the Government talks that are currently under way is that they may be fooled into thinking that a coalition of the Minister's party with Fianna F&aacute;il can deliver any of the measures required.  If they believe that a 7% reduction will be achieved under a party merged with Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, they are fooling themselves.  They may think it may not happen in four years but it could happen in ten.  I can guarantee them that with Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael driving the policy, it will not happen in 100 years, and the seas will be washing over us.<br\/><br\/>The main danger in the narrative of these talks is that those of us who want action on climate change and on agricultural emissions are painted as the enemies of the farming community when nothing could be further from the truth.  We support a reduction in herd sizes, a reduction in the use of nitrogen fertiliser and a programme of massive reforestation with non-commercial species for carbon storage, but we are also for breaking the cartel of meat processors and the large agrifood corporations that stand at the top of this pyramid.  We support better prices for beef farmers and a basic income that supports them and their families so they can grow the food that we need to give us real food security in the decades ahead.  We support sustainable farming and rural communities, not the vision that we are being given at the moment, which is about the interests of the corporations.  Just as the measures that we need to take in our towns and cities to combat climate change can lead to a better and more sustainable life for ordinary people, so too can the steps that need to be taken in agriculture lead to better lives for farmers and the communities in rural Ireland.<br\/><br\/>Warmer homes, better public transport, and sustainable well-planned towns, villages and cities are not a threat to ordinary people, but if the vision of climate action is offered solely in a moralistic attack on people's personal behaviour while landing more and more taxes on them when they can barely get by, we will feed the climate sceptics and leave untouched the systemic causes of climate change and the vested interests that are driving them.  In agriculture, if all we offer farmers are reduced herd numbers and restrictions on fertiliser use we leave them prey to the climate sceptics and the climate deniers whose agenda is to maintain the <i>status quo<\/i>and to hell with the planet and with the environment, but if we demand a real Green New Deal and see farmers as allies in this fight and reward them accordingly, we can build a constituency that can achieve climate targets and do it in a just and sustainable way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000070#ZZZ01300","speaker":"1486","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1591806000,"counter":228,"content":"<p>I do not see much point in responding to the opening point the Deputy made regarding Covid-19 in meat plants, as I am on the record of the House on that issue already.  Suffice to say, as I said then, that every individual who contracts Covid-19 needs to be treated in the best possible way by the health services and everything needs to be done to try and prevent the spread of the virus.  The Deputy will be aware that the last time we were in here discussing this issue there was some clamour due to the fact that the HSA had not been in the meat plants.  At that time, these agencies were just coming back to work as, like most others, they had not been at work.  I am pleased the HSA has been in many if not all of the plants where the clusters have occurred, and my information is that it has found that most of the meat plants are working as they should in terms of the new norm and taking the appropriate steps to protect workers in the plants.  That is not to say that notwithstanding the best endeavours of everybody - the HSA, the HSE, the workers in the plants and management in the plants &ndash; one can guarantee that the plants will be kept Covid-19 free.  That is obviously not the case, but it is important that every one of these agencies works to ensure that we do everything possible to minimise the risk and that is what has been happening.  It would not have been appropriate to come in here on that occasion and say that we were going to blitz these premises, because to be forewarned is to be forearmed, but that has happened and the Deputy will be aware it happened.<\/p>  <p>  Given that time is limited, I wish to point out to the Deputy that biogenic methane is different from methane generally.<\/p> <p>It is a specific cohort within the atmosphere and has a shorter life span, and that is why there is an issue between livestock methane production and general methane production.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000072#BBBB00200","speaker":"1454","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1591806600,"counter":230,"content":"<p>I must cut off the Minister there.

The key issue, therefore, is not methane production but the increase in the overall volume of methane produced from agriculture.  We must also note that throughout the EU, between 2005 and 2016 there has been an 9% reduction in overall cattle numbers.  Those who focus on farming being the climate problem conveniently ignore this fact.<\/p>  <p>  In Ireland, our climate action plan set a target for reducing agricultural emissions by 10% between 2017 and 2030.  Based on suckler cow numbers, emission reductions of close to 10% were achieved in 2018 and 2019 alone.  While we have achieved the 13-year target for the suckler sector within 24 months, albeit for the wrong reasons, and while this may help us to meet the national climate target, in a perverse way it will do more to damage the planet in terms of global warming.  That is because we count climate emissions based on the country where the food or product is produced, not where it is purchased or consumed.  Even though 90% of our beef is exported, Ireland is penalised for being the most carbon efficient beef exporter within the EU because the rules state the responsibility is on the producer rather than the consumer.  Relatively carbon-efficient beef production in Ireland can, therefore, be replaced throughout the Union with beef that is 35 times worse for the environment from the Amazon basin.  That is okay, according to climate mathematicians but not the atmosphere.<\/p>  <p>  We have a CAP that regulates food production in member states, except when it comes to climate emissions when we have a national cap, not an EU cap.  This completely undermines carbon efficient food production in favour of cheap food, regardless of its climate impact and regardless of where it comes from.  We need an EU-wide methane cap for agriculture that supports carbon efficient beef production in Ireland, which is good for reducing global climate emissions, and grass-fed beef on low-intensity grassland such as that produced in Ireland that has a lower negative impact on soil erosion, biodiversity and nutrient leaching than other beef production models - another fact that is conveniently ignored by those who focus on farming being the climate problem.<\/p>  <p>  Grass-based systems on disadvantaged land types in much of Ireland remove carbon from the atmosphere and convert it into human protein on land that is not suitable for tillage crops.  That does not mean that agriculture and farming should have a free pass.  The fact is that managing our land use better can take even more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, reducing its harmful effects on the climate and the oceans far quicker than shutting down farming.  For example, those who were so jubilant about the closure of Shannonbridge and Lanesborough power stations ignored the fact that one of the key objectives behind co-firing of the stations was to build up demand rapidly for locally-sourced biomass.  The principal reason for the lack of biomass in Ireland has been the absence of any proven demand for energy crops that would attract farmers.  If we were to operate our current peat-fired plants with 100% locally-sourced biomass, this would reduce agricultural emissions on local farms by 600,000 tonnes of carbon each year.  This would be the equivalent of the removal of 130,000 cars from our roads, generating &euro;372 per ha with the price of carbon at &euro;80 per tonne.  This would create 4,000 seasonal jobs in harvesting while guaranteeing the income to farmers right across the midland counties.<\/p>  <p>  Another good example is Gowla Farms outside Ballyforan, County Galway where members of my family worked in the 1970s producing dried grass for animal feeds.<\/p> <p>With one of the best grass production systems in the world, we should be focused on the development of new grass-based solutions to meet our current and future food and energy needs, but our research community is behind the curve.  Everything seems to be dictated by Food Wise 2025, which is about supporting existing agribusiness rather than the viability of family farms and our environment.  The centralised nature of research and development funding in Ireland through Teagasc is creating a knowledge cartel.  Research needs to move closer to the farmer and include and reward a wide range of farmers to get involved.  That is why, with the support of the Minister and the Cabinet, I established the climate action fund to support new thinking and innovation, with the sole focus of reducing Ireland's emissions.  This is the largest <i>per capita<\/i>sovereign fund of its type globally.<br\/><br\/>In light of what I have just said about methane, will the Minister commit to immediately reviewing the current scientific basis for enteric methane emissions from our national herd, as well as the impact of grassland, soil and hedgerow management on carbon sequestration in advance of any restructuring of the CAP?  The carbon value of soil, hedgerows and other farm stock needs to be measured and monitored and any increase in value returned directly to farmers' pockets.<br\/><br\/>I welcomed the announcement last October by the Minister for Finance of an allocation of &euro;3 million for piloting new agri-environmental schemes this year.  The goal was to reduce emissions from the agriculture sector while improving biodiversity and water quality and supporting farm incomes.  Has this money been drawn down and, if so, was it drawn down under existing or new pilot schemes?  Would it make sense to consider expanding the current, successful smart farming pilot, led by the EPA, which has seen a 10% reduction in carbon emissions from all farm types, and to support new initiatives such as carbon-neutral beef production?  Has consideration been given to designing an agricultural system around nutritional sovereignty?  This would mean Ireland would move to being an 80% to 100% food-secure nation.  The supply chain should be incentivised to embrace localised food systems and resources should be mobilised to ensure that new horticultural industries are developed to support such a goal.<br\/><br\/>We need to try to generate, innovate and support new thinking about the climate challenges we have in this country.  The difficulty is with those who are promoting the climate agenda to date.  They take an initiative that has been developed elsewhere in continental Europe and try to shoehorn it into the model in Ireland, which just will not work because we have a very different model of agriculture.  We have a dispersed rural population, which is not the case anywhere else in Europe.  We need to engage at EU level with the type of challenges we have here and to try to put forward specific innovative solutions.  That will require support from the research community here and answers to the questions I have just asked.<br\/><br\/>The Minister will argue that the research community is doing its bit for the agricultural sector.  His officials will be aware of the collaborative working group on sustainable animal production, established by the EU standing committee on agricultural research.  It is collating data that will, ultimately, feed into EU policy development.  It has produced a study on the drivers of change and development in the EU livestock sector.  That is very important in Ireland because, in terms of agricultural activity, we are more dependent on livestock than any other EU country, at 74%.  I read the committee's report.  The committee had asked 251 experts from across the EU to complete a questionnaire, based on their expertise as an economist, agricultural scientist or member of a farming association, to consolidate knowledge about EU livestock policy throughout Europe.  Of the 251 surveys sent to every EU member state, I was surprised when I saw the number of responses from Ireland considering that it is so dependent on livestock.<\/p> <p>Not a single questionnaire was sent back from Ireland.  If the Irish research sector cannot advocate for us in Europe among its own agricultural research community, what hope do farmers have of getting a fair deal out of the CAP?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000073#CCCC00300","speaker":"1603","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1591807200,"counter":234,"content":"<p>The Minister has one minute, literally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000075#EEEE00200","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1591807200,"counter":235,"content":"<p>It is very difficult to answer on many of these points when Deputy Naughten has chosen to limit the time in the way he has done.<\/p>  <p>  The research community and the Department work collaboratively with a host of partners.

This is not recognised very often.  Indeed, the agri-sector has become something of a scapegoat for all the environmental ills that afflict our society.  Farmers and their way of life have been demonised for too long.  When farmers work to introduce biodiversity initiatives, they are told they have to do more.  Rarely is credit given.  The fact of the matter, however, is that to qualify for many of the schemes, such as GLAS, they must meet the criteria.  They are doing so quite successfully and are doing their bit for the environment.  It is high time that this were acknowledged and credited.<\/p>  <p>  Irish farmers are well aware of their obligations and responsibilities but they will not be made the whipping boys of an aggressive and ill-informed environmental lobby for whom no measure is ever good enough.  This will do nothing to create the sense of genuine partnership and collaboration that we all need and, indeed, support.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister himself acknowledged in January that the EU's long-term strategy, A Clean Planet for All, accepts that agricultural production will always result in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions, such as methane and nitrous oxide.  Of course, these can be reduced, but not at the expense of the entire sector or of the rural economy and the family farm as we know it.<\/p>  <p>  I am conscious that in recent reply to a parliamentary question from my Rural Independent Group colleague, Deputy Mattie McGrath, the Minister accepted that the very concept of carbon neutrality has yet to be defined.  This needs to be addressed urgently.  It is fine to have a general sense of what climate neutrality might look like on paper but we need a definite sense of what the real-world implications will be for farming and agriculture more generally.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge and welcome that we are increasing carbon sequestration measures.  In fact, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, confirmed to me in a recent reply to a parliamentary question that hedgerows, which are not currently accounted for in Ireland's calculation of emissions targets, will be included from 2021.  As we know, greenhouse gas emissions and removals associated with the land-use change and forestry are currently reported in Ireland's national inventory report but this is prepared by the Environmental Protection Agency and submitted to the European Union and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change annually.  I acknowledge the fantastic research conducted by Teagasc in this area.  It has long argued that hedgerows and landscape features within the cropland and grassland categories can form part of the emissions and removal estimates for land-use categories.<\/p> <p> Will the Minister provide an update on his Department's engagement with the EPA with respect to the development of a land use map for reporting on land-based activities under land use regulations?  Will he accept that farmers do not receive anything like the credit they deserve for introducing and supporting carbon reduction measures?<\/p> <p> Information provided by the Revenue Commissioners indicates that since 2010, the State has taken in at least &euro;2.8 billion in carbon taxes.  I appreciate the Minister may not have the information to hand but will he please commit to providing the details of how much of that has come from the agriculture sector?  I ask because there is an inaccurate perception that farmers are simply takers and not givers when it comes to contributions to climate tax and renewal measures.<\/p> <p> I indicate again that I oppose any proposal to reduce the national herd, as this would destroy agriculture as we know it.  Have these proposals been accepted or can we consider how other sectors must also play their part in reducing emissions, and that agriculture cannot be the scapegoat, leading to the destruction of the family farm as part of our culture in trying to appease a number of people?  These people, in making their demands, do not understand agriculture.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000075#EEEE00500","speaker":"1592","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1591807500,"counter":239,"content":"<p>Ireland is lagging behind in any meaningful engagement with farmers and producers in developing biomethane, which could be used for fuel for heavy goods vehicles as an alternative to fossil fuels.  There are easy ways to help the process of anaerobic digestion, which is common in Germany, Denmark and the UK.  The process mixes slurry with maize and silage, leaving the materials to ferment and form methane gas that can be stored.  Sections of the country have finishing units where animals are housed and waste can be acquired easily.  There are also clusters of pig farms that could also be used for waste collection.  These facilities could also provide a means to produce renewable heat and gas.<\/p>  <p>  In the UK, 15% of gas consumed could be made from sewage, food waste and other organic waste from breweries.  The US has claimed that the waste from biomass could provide natural gas for 50% of American homes.  There are plenty of opportunities in Ireland for similar processes in Ireland and more must be done to consider such practice in agriculture.  How can the Department justify the lack of support in this regard?<\/p>  <p>  The renewable energy feed-in tariff, REFIT, scheme to incentivise microgeneration covers small-scale generators, particularly where domestic customers produce their own electricity and export the surplus to the national grid.  With the installation of solar panels and other technology, Ireland has committed to generate at least 16% of energy from renewable sources by 2020.  However, we are not on track to meet this deadline.  Ireland is the second lowest in the table of countries meeting their renewable energy targets in the EU and it is also second lowest in the table of member states producing renewable heat.  A simple solution to this would be to reopen the REFIT scheme by early 2021, thus encouraging homeowners and farmers to install solar panels.  The maximum allowed should be 70% rather than 50% of roof size.<\/p>  <p>  In the past the volume of energy generated from home and farm owners was so small that it did not justify the cost of using panels as there was not a high enough return to meet a commitment to the national grid.  People found the process of connecting to the grid with microgeneration slow and cumbersome.  More needs to be done so targets can be met.<\/p> <p>It is not just about blaming the farmers and the farming community.  I told the Minister, Deputy Bruton, earlier that farmers are blamed for everything.  As I said previously, it usually took one generation of farmers to rebuild to ensure the next generation survived.  At the moment, it is going generation, by generation, by generation.

I do not believe he has outlined that it is sustainable.  There are considerable differences about whether that is the case.  The crux of it is, who do we believe?  Reading the annual sectoral mitigation statement on agriculture would not leave one any the wiser.  It starts by outlining of plans from the climate action plan, which seem to be ambitious, but they are not referenced anywhere else in the plan so we do not know whether they are realistic, on the way to being achieved or totally unrealistic.  It states that emissions from the sector in 2030 are to be between 17.5 MT and 19 MT of CO2 equivalent by achieving between 16.5 MT and 18.5 MT of CO2 equivalent cumulative abatement over the period 2021 to 2030.  That sounds great.  It seeks to achieve a 26.8 MT of CO2 abatement through the land-use change and forestry, LUCF, actions and sets a target for the level of energy to be supplied by indigenous biomethane injection in 2030.  The fact that the plans are not mentioned again tells its own tale.  The most telling line in the document is that 40% of the overall budget of the new CAP at EU level will contribute to environmental or climate action.  Unfortunately, that is the level of our aspirations and how we will achieve them.<\/p>  <p>  We do not have a voluntary scheme for farmers.  That is possibly the only sector where voluntary schemes are set to reduce carbon emissions.  It is clear that we do not have buy-in to the voluntary schemes across agriculture and, therefore, we should now make it compulsory to participate in environmental practices.  Hopefully, the EU will go down that road because I do not believe we will do so.  It will have to be made compulsory to qualify for new payments from the EU because that is the only way we will get buy-in.  <\/p>  <p>  All the talk today is about the EU policy of farm to fork and what that will achieve for reduction of emissions.  How will that policy benefit the Irish type of production?  Much is made in this House of our production methods and how they are grass-based and environmentally friendly, yet all the discussion is about how bad Brazilian beef is for the environment, which I have no doubt is the case.<\/p> <p>It seems there is not much recognition of the environmentally sustainable production of Irish agriculture from the so-called markets or from the beef factories, which seem to only be interested in price and in reducing the price paid to farmers.  <\/p> <p> It is interesting that our own organic farming scheme, over which the Department has control, has been held back and that grant aid has been held back from farmers.  This scheme could help to grow our number of organic farmers and to reduce our dependency.  Any future EU scheme should ensure that a farmer who wishes to go into organic production will be assisted.  Badly managed funding calls should not give farmers false hope either.  Who will qualify and why should be clearly laid out.  Unfortunately, organic farmers are looked upon by the Department and the farming organisations as an awkward rump that must be dealt with.  <\/p> <p> Today I again heard the Minister talk about how methane is different.  It is different, in that it is far more damaging to the atmosphere.  It may be short-lived, but the impact it has over that short period is very significant.  The Minister does not do anything for our farmers by continuing to wrongly state that methane does not have an impact.  As long as we try to say that farming will not have an impact on the climate and delay recognising that farming, like all activities, impacts on the environment, farming and farmers will lose.  The only people will gain are the beef barons who own the slaughterhouses in the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000077#GGGG00600","speaker":"1547","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1591808400,"counter":247,"content":"<p>I have a few questions.  Deputy Eamon Ryan spoke about why people say that the Green Party will be bad for rural Ireland.  It would be helpful if that party made a statement on the export of cattle to third countries and on rewetting the likes of peatlands on mountains.  People are farming sheep on those lands.  It would be helpful if the Green Party could clarify its stance on a few issues like that.<\/p><p>Yesterday, in the Minister's own county, there was good news with regard to methane.  A study was carried out on feeding seaweed to cows.  This study showed that doing so reduced the methane emitted by a suckler herd by 79%.  Is the Minister's Department involved in this research?  Has Teagasc been involved?  Are we doing anything to work with those carrying out this work?  This study took a full year.<\/p><p>On the European farm-to-fork strategy and biodiversity strategy, if one reads the documents, one will see that the EU intends to designate 30% of land around the country.  This will be a higher designation than that of a special area of conservation, SAC.  One will hardly be able to live in such areas in light of the proposals under the biodiversity plan.  The plans also talk about rewetting peatlands.  Deputy Ryan mentioned earlier that sheep or cattle could go out on such lands during the summer, but they cannot live on fresh air for the spring, autumn and winter.  The sheep farmers on the mountains need their animals out then as well.  Will the Minister and the Government oppose the current proposals?  They will affect farmers from Donegal to Kerry, including the dairy farmers in Listowel who have reclaimed land.  We would say that they drained it and shored it.  It is now good productive land for the dairy sector.  It is proposed to remove CAP payments from such lands over a number of years.  As a D&aacute;il, we need to make sure that is not allowed to happen.<\/p><p>Everyone has been talking about forestry.  We have to cut to the chase.  Last year, 4,000 ha of the targeted 7,000 ha was not planted because of objections.  I believe there are 1,400 or 1,500 files with the Minister's Department with regard to ecology reports.  It is at a stalemate.  Deputy Eamon Ryan is right that he and I talked about this issue and if he had listened, he would have heard me say that we should plant 0.5 acres on holdings of up to 50 acres.  One could have a shelter belt in the corner of a field or down by a ditch so that the farmer could continue to farm.  The area planted would increase <i>pro rata<\/i>.  This would lead to 130,000 acres around the country if the money was there for it.  As I have said all along, &quot;show me the money&quot;.  I do not know if we have it.  It would be a good thing to include in an environmental scheme.<\/p><p>Where are we going in trying to resolve the forestry issue?  I know the Minister is working on it and I am not blaming him but we are at a stalemate even in respect of broadleaves.  I got a phone call this morning from a person who put in an application eight months ago.  This person wanted to have an ecology report carried out themselves but were told the Department had to do it.  The application is being held up with objections and appeals.<\/p> <p>Is there fast-tracking of that?  Whatever about Government talks, we can dream a dream and we can talk about doing the sun, moon and stars over the next five years.  However, if we cannot plant one tree today because of objections, because of EU law and because people see they can go through appeals, how are we going to get through that gap? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000078#HHHH00200","speaker":"1508","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1591809000,"counter":249,"content":"<p>To follow on from what Deputy Fitzmaurice said about the biodiversity strategy, as the Minister is aware, the EU wants us to legally protect a minimum of 30% of land across the Union.  We already protect about 16% so that would double the amount of land protected.  To put a picture on this, that would be the province of Connacht and about half of County Cork.  That is the 30%.  Within that, the EU wants one third, or 10%, to be strictly protected.  Looking at the designations, that means that even human visitation, never mind land use, would be strictly controlled.  Some of this works well for the forests in Finland and Sweden, and the mountains in France and Germany, but for rural Ireland it really means that agricultural production will have significant challenges and, in some places, will be impossible.  That is the first point. <\/p>  <p>  If we look at GAEC 2, which is required for the single farm payment, farmers are required to have in place appropriate protections for peatlands and wetlands.  If that is the case, as 30% of our land is designated, and as most of it will be reclaimed peatland and wetland, farmers will not be able to put that in place and even get 70% of their payments.  Will the Minister get GAEC changed from \"appropriate protection\" of peatlands and wetlands to \"maintenance\" of peatlands and wetlands?

What the Government and the D&aacute;il are involved in is the sustainable management of our country, economy, society and communities to ensure we are dealing with all the issues before us.  One of the most important is climate change, climate action and adapting to that.<\/p>  <p>  I am glad I had the chance today to listen to much of the debate earlier.  This is my third or fourth year participating in these statements on behalf of my Department and the debate has changed a great deal over the last couple of years.  One can see in the strength of the discussions today the recognition that this issue is important.  Deputies on all sides have taken on much greater responsibility in trying to tackle this and to focus on the plans to see what we are doing, whether we are implementing them correctly, whether we are making progress and how can we update and add to the plans.  I am glad to have that good policy debate today.  As we are in the process of forming a new Government there will be a lot more change in this area with positive developments to come.<\/p>  <p>  There was some criticism of the concept of having plans.  To be clear, the idea that one must have climate action plans, housing plans, jobs plans and recovery plans from Covid-19 is that they are the business case to secure taxpayers' investment in strategy and in actions.  This morning the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, discussed actions and implementing actions.  It is important that we put those plans in place but also that we are prepared to change and add to them and implement new actions in them as we go along.  That is number one.  Number two, we must be prepared to scrutinise our plans.  This is part of what we are doing today.  We come here to have our plan scrutinised and to explain to Members, as Ministers in the Departments, what we are doing and what we hope to do.  Members can scrutinise that and I am glad there are questions and answers on this today, unlike in other years.  It is an important development.  It is important that we monitor the plans, follow them and implement them action by action.  I have seen the success of that approach with the Action Plan for Jobs a number of years ago, the housing action plan, the rural action plan and now the climate plan.  It is important that we do that and follow it page by page, action by action and make the necessary change and adaptation while investing taxpayers' money wisely along the way.<\/p>  <p>  Another part of the conversation is that as we try to tackle climate change and make changes some of the debate today referred to the fears for rural Ireland.  I wish to make a point because I have often listened to the debate about planning, rural planning and one-off housing.  Everybody here thinks one must have a one-off house to live in rural Ireland, but most people outside the House recognise that this is not the case.  Yes, living in rural Ireland means living in a one-off house where it is suitable and right, or in a converted house or in an old cottage brought back into use, but it also means living in a rural village, be it on the edge of the village or on brown field sites in the middle of it or in streets that are left derelict for many years, or living in towns.  To drive rural Ireland there must be a purpose or function to live there.  One must be able to get a job locally and be able to work in the economy.  One must be able to go to school.  It involves education, health and so forth.  It is not just about housing.  Yes, rural housing is a very important part of it and we are focused on that and where appropriate it is fine.<\/p>  <p>  However, when we discuss climate change in rural Ireland, our job is not to scare people.  It should not be about that in this House.  It should be to represent rural Ireland and to ensure that we protect all that is part of rural Ireland and bring people with us on that journey.  As legislators we must ensure that the opportunities with climate change are shared by everybody so people in both rural and urban areas can benefit from them.  There are many opportunities, but sometimes the debate in this House tries to scare people.  That is unfair.  That is not what climate action is about and it certainly is not in our plans.  I am anxious to make that point.  I listened to it a great deal during the national planning framework discussion and it arose in some of the debate today.  That is not what we are trying to achieve here.  It is an unfair portrayal of the Government's plans and, in fairness, of most parties' plans.  Individuals never leave behind an opportunity to try to scare people, but that is not what we are doing at all.<\/p>  <p>  Again, I am delighted to be here for this process.  I re-affirm my Department's commitment to working collaboratively with colleagues across the Government so we can collectively and successfully deliver and implement critical climate mitigation and adaptation actions and measures.  We have set ambitious plans for the decarbonisation of our built environment.  These form an integral part of the climate action plan and we are driving a range of actions in planning, marine planning, housing and building regulations.  Project Ireland 2040, which we launched in February 2018, is the overarching policy and planning framework for the social, economic and cultural development of Ireland.  It includes a detailed capital investment plan for the period to 2027 - the &euro;116 billion national development plan for taxpayers' money in support of a long-term transformational spatial strategy, which is the national planning framework.  All Members of the House need to buy into that long-term planning and thinking.  Most do.  During the discussion on the national planning framework in the House the majority bought into it and accepted it.  Of course, people want reviews and changes.  That is fine.  However, we must remember the concept of long-term planning across all Departments.<\/p> <p>The lined and shared vision of the national planning framework, in tandem with the national development plan, is a joined-up planning and investment strategy focused on a series of shared national outcomes.  Foremost among these is climate action, along with the national objective to transition to a low-carbon and climate-resilient society by 2050.  A policy which will assist in making that transition and meeting our climate obligations is woven throughout the national planning framework and the national development plan.<\/p> <p> Shared outcomes, reflected in both documents, which are fundamentally supportive of climate action include compact growth, sustainable mobility, a sustainable management of water, waste and other environmental resources.  These all include significant elements of policy that provide a strong platform for the development of measures and actions in response to climate change.  The overall national planning framework strategy seeks to achieve a better balance of development between the regions, a greater focus on cities, supporting the rural fabric and targeting more compact growth in the development of settlements of all sizes, be that a village, a town or a city, from the largest city to the smallest village.<\/p> <p> Wind energy guidelines came up in last year's and this year's discussion.  The Department is undertaking a review of the 2006 wind energy development guidelines.  Thankfully, since the last time we had this debate, we have had a public consultation.  The review aims to address several key aspects including sound, noise, visual amenity, set-back distances, shadow flicker, community obligation and dividend, as well as grid connections.  We are working through all the submissions to the public consultation process.  Hopefully, we will be in a position to finalise those guidelines before the end of the year by making changes to section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000.<\/p> <p> Solar guidelines and exemptions are often raised.  Draft amendments proposed to the current planning exemptions have been substantially completed.  Those changes did not go as quickly as I hoped.  We have a number of exemptions ready, however.  We have worked in conjunction with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, as well as other relevant stakeholders, to progress and finalise those outstanding matters.  Once they are finalised, the Department will engage the legislative process, subject to Oireachtas approval, along with environmental report and considerations.  The housing committee did much work when it came to exemptions and helped us fast-track some when they were of benefit to everybody.<\/p> <p> Last year, I launched a public consultation on the national marine planning framework, which aims to give priority to key national policies in terms of renewable energy ambitions.  The general scheme of the marine planning and development management Bill, which will provide the legal basis for the marine planning system, was published in December.  It is currently under review with a view to publication later this year.  Some Members wanted it to go to the relevant committee in January or February.  Hopefully, we will get that back on track and get it through the Houses whenever we form a Government and get the committee system up and running.<\/p> <p> Approximately 40% of total energy produced is used in the building sector.  The energy performance of buildings directive sets ambitious goals for energy efficiency and renewables in buildings by requiring nearly zero energy building, NZEB, performance for new buildings from 31 December 2020.  In addition, the directive also requires energy performance requirements for major renovations to existing buildings are completed to a cost optimal level, which is a B2 building energy rating or equivalent where feasible.<\/p> <p> The implementation of the NZEB is a key action for the built environment and will contribute to Ireland's national low-carbon transition and mitigation plan.  The legislation is now in place and will contribute to emissions reductions from new dwellings commencing from 1 November 2019.  This legislation also effectively phases out the installation of oil boilers in new dwellings.<\/p> <p> A new element of the revised energy performance of buildings directive is the provision of infrastructure for the charging of electric vehicles.  Lack of recharging infrastructure is seen as a barrier to the take-up of electric vehicles in the EU.  The revised directive has new provisions which aim to accelerate deployment.  It is an issue that has been raised with me by many Members over the years.  These regulations will require infrastructure to facilitate the future installation of electric vehicle charging points in all new dwellings with a car parking space within the site boundary.  A public consultation regarding these draft regulations has taken place and it will be published later this year.<\/p> <p> On social housing, local authorities are currently undertaking an ambitious programme of insulation retrofitting, with the support of the Department, on the least energy efficient social housing units.  The programme has two phases.  Phase 1 focuses on the lower cost improvements such as cavity wall and attic insulation.  Phase 2 targets higher cost, deeper retrofit measures such as, for example, fabric upgrades and renewable energy resources including heat pumps etc.  Since 2013, funding of &euro;151 million has been provided to improve energy efficiency and comfort levels in over 72,000 local authority homes, benefiting those at risk of fuel poverty and making a significant contribution to Ireland's carbon emissions reduction targets for 2020.<\/p> <p> I can discuss the retrofit programme during the question and answer session.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000080#OOOO00100","speaker":"1505","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1591810500,"counter":254,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputies Michael Moynihan, Jackie Cahill, P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan and Jennifer Murnane O'Connor.

That is no reflection on the Minister of State or on any colleagues.  It is approximately six months since we previously had statements on transition and the climate action plan.  It is fair to say that there has not been much progress in that time.  Since then, with the Covid-19 emergency, the acute nature of our housing crisis has been further emphasised.  How can we address the fundamentals of that crisis, which are that people do not have homes, be they public or private homes?  How can we expedite the building and provision of homes while at the same time ensuring that we reduce the impact it has on our environment, that we do things better and that we use new practices?  That is crucially important.<\/p>  <p>  When engaging with stakeholders, we see that there will probably be less than 14,000 housing completions this year, which is well below the target set by the previous Government and what we actually need.  We probably need to build between 35,000 and 40,000 private and public homes a year, and we will be more than 25,000 behind that target this year, mainly due to the Covid-19 emergency.  We have to ensure that when we ramp up supply, we do it in a way that it is effective and sustainable, and delivers high quality, sustainable homes, both public and private.  I believe that we can do that and that the new Government will have to do that.  Housing design, modular construction and off-site construction can reduce the impact that the sector has and help us to meet our targets and the international commitments that we have given.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State mentioned a couple of issues.  We need to make sure that villages and regional towns in rural Ireland are properly serviced with wastewater treatment, schools and public transport, so that we can look at rejuvenating and regenerating them, and reducing the number of one-off houses across the country.  Our villages and towns should become places where people want to live and we can bring life back into them.  A significant part of that will be social housing provision on the land that the State, local authorities and State agencies own to deliver homes for people in those areas.<\/p>  <p>  We also have to look at our current stock of approximately 130,000 social homes.  The Minister of State mentioned the light retrofitting that has been happening, which is important in itself.  Approximately 130,000 homes across the country require serious attention to improve their energy efficiency.  Those savings and funds will come back to the State.  We also have to look at our private housing stock.  There are probably 500,000 homes across the country that need to be retrofitted over ten years.  That is not an insignificant target and we have to have the resources available to do that.  That also means looking at just transition, retraining people, new apprenticeships in this area and being bold about that.  When we look at building 40,000 to 50,000 homes a year, and retrofitting 40,000 to 50,000 homes in a year, both public and private, we have to know where the workforce is to do that.  That has to be a priority for the next Government if we are to achieve our climate action plan targets.  The public is well ahead of the Oireachtas on that and wants to see these changes.<\/p>  <p>  We need to be serious about community energy schemes.  We are looking at renewable energy and the state of that has improved over the decade.  We need to look at getting community buy-in and best practice across Europe and the world.  We need to look at community energy schemes that generate energy within communities, creating lower costs for them, and at biomass, wind energy, solar energy and so on.<\/p> <p>There is a lot of work to be done in this area and I hope and am certain that if a new programme for Government is agreed, this would be central to housing policy in that new Government to deliver sustainable homes in sustainable communities that help to meet our climate action targets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000082#QQQQ00700","speaker":"1561","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1591810800,"counter":262,"content":"<p>I will be very brief because I want to be sure that my colleagues get time to contribute.<\/p>  <p>  We have to look at what is there in rural communities.  We have to look at the existing nucleus of the smaller villages and towns and we must enhance them.  If the pandemic has taught us anything over the past three to four months, it is that.  People have been working from home.  The term \"remote working\" was used but it is smart working.  They have been working from rural communities and the great enabler there is, of course, broadband.  We must ensure that we provide for and consider strategically ensuring that people are accommodated and to enhance the communities that are already there.  We have seen many people thanking God that they lived in rural communities during this pandemic, that is, they lived in places that are safe.  We must take that message from the past number of weeks and agree that we have to look at another way.  We have been looking at the national planning framework and all the rest of it.  We must have a targeted look at all the villages and town throughout this country, where there are many vacant houses in rural communities that we could enhance and encourage.  The policy must be clear and must be that we are about repopulating rural Ireland.  It has to be about a social contract to make sure that people have the best quality of life.  We have experience of that in our rural villages and towns where we have excellent educational facilities and some fantastic sporting facilities but we have to bend that into our strategic plan going forward.

Thankfully this was resolved and most of those homes are now completed.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputy Darragh O'Brien has said, we have a very ambitious target set down of 500,000 homes to retrofit.  This involves carrying out multiple energy-efficient measures such as wall and attic insulation, replacing windows and doors etc.  The framework document published by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, which forms the basis of the ongoing Government formation talks, lists it as a priority whereby the proposed Government will \"Roll out an ambitious home energy retrofitting programme\".  It is vital that this commences at the earliest opportunity once the Government takes office.  Applications must be open to the public as soon as possible.  The providing companies must be made aware of the Government's intention in order that they can prepare and stock up on the materials that are not lost.  As for apprenticeships, which were also referred to earlier, how many will be needed to do this work?  The national apprenticeship centre is located in Thurles and places need to be provided there immediately in order that we will have the workforce that is needed when this work comes on track.  In my constituency of Tipperary, the Energy Communities Tipperary Cooperative was doing excellent work on a shoestring budget.  Therefore, achieving ambitious targets in this area will require good planning, speed and extensive funding.<\/p>  <p>  As for planning and how it has an impact on the reduction of carbon emissions, planning guidelines must take into account the huge differences between high-density urban populations and smaller provincial towns.  We cannot have a one-size-fits-all approach.  For instance, it makes sense to have very high-density housing and apartment buildings in major urban centres but it makes no sense in towns across rural Ireland.  Such towns need realistic density levels that match the profile of the town and are attractive for the market to build and affordable for families to buy.  We also must have housing provided for those who want to live in the community where they were born and perhaps to commute by public transport to an urban centre for work.  This surely makes sense as it would reduce the carbon footprint, would maintain the life of rural towns and would not herd the population into Dublin.  There was a specific case this week where Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann took the daily 17:05 service from Heuston Station to Thurles off the timetable.  Hundreds of people from mid-Tipperary are commuting daily to Dublin for work or if not daily, then two or three times per week.  Their housing needs are provided where they are born in their own town or village.<\/p> <p>They are using public transport, reducing their carbon footprint and not clogging the already congested city of Dublin, and then Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann decides to take away one of the daily trains.  Surely this does not make sense in the current climate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000083#RRRR00300","speaker":"1611","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1591811400,"counter":265,"content":"<p>I have a number of queries and would appreciate if the Minister could revert to me.<\/p>  <p>  First, I welcome a number of developments in the north side of Cork city in recent weeks.  The Lord Mayor of Cork cut the ribbon this week on developments in Knocknaheeny, Blarney Street and Blackpool, and we have the potential development of the St. Kevin's Hospital site on the north side of the city for which the Land Development Agency, LDA, has started plans. <\/p>  <p>  The main issue I want to raise is residential densities.  I spent six years on Cork County Council and I never got my head around the fact that An Bord Plean&aacute;la can operate on a density of up to 50 units per hectare, whereas the local authority is usually restricted to between 30 and 35 units per hectare.  Has a review of that requirement taken place in recent months?  Could the next Government examine the matter?  Whatever the merits of high or low density, consistency is needed as opposed to having two different approaches for local authority planners or having somebody who appeals a development to the board getting two different answers.  I will give the example of one case in Little Island, where I am from.  Cork County Council turned down a specific proposal for a housing development because the density was too high.  Its decision was appealed to the board, which also refused the proposal on the basis that the density was too low.  That disconnect needs to be reviewed. <\/p>  <p>  We have major issues with wastewater in Cork county.  Approximately 50% of the land designated and zoned for housing is not serviceable by proper wastewater treatment units.  In one sense, we are doing great work in terms of development and local area plans, but that has not translated into funding for Irish Water to carry this development through.<\/p>  <p>  My final point is on broadband, which Deputy Cahill just mentioned.  Various villages are getting new developments.  Courtbrack in Cork North-Central is one such example.  It has a brand new estate of more than 100 houses.  It is great that broadband has followed and that the estate is being serviced, but existing residents of the village do not have broadband even though they may live 20 m from a broadband connection point installed to service the new developments.  There is a lack of joined-up thinking and a disconnect if broadband is being brought to a village and people who already live in it do not have access.  They need to be thought of going forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000084#SSSS00300","speaker":"1521"},{"type":"speech","time":1591811400,"counter":266,"content":"<p>The consequences of the coronavirus have been mixed.  It is predicted there will be an 8% drop in global CO2 pollution in 2020, which is welcome, but locking people in their homes and closing down the economy is not an effective strategy to maintain this.  I am concerned that the European Court of Auditors flagged that our better energy warmer homes scheme is not delivering significant energy savings for the money we are investing in it.  When can we expect a report on the review of the projects for households renovated under this retrofit scheme between 2014 and 2018?  Does the court's decision mean the scheme is in trouble?  It has been valuable to many people, in particular those on lower incomes.<\/p>  <p>  I was deeply concerned by a statement from the Construction Industry Federation that there may be an increase of between 10% and 15% in the cost of home build projects.  We cannot allow affordability to be shelved or projects to be abandoned.  While we intend to keep workers safe, are approved housing bodies, AHBs, and local authorities going to lose out because they will be priced out of projects?  Are first-time buyers going to suffer?  I would like an insight into how much more social housing will cost, both in time and money.  Can we also commit to prioritising accessibility for those living with disabilities in our standards for private planning permission on developments and in local authority builds, as well as on local authority housing lists where people with disabilities, including mental health issues, must be given priority?<\/p>  <p>  If we can expect to live with Covid-19 for a long time and face the possibility of further pandemics, should we review standards in homebuilding programmes in areas such as the layout of gardens and outdoor spaces?  Can we look at the Danish concept of co-housing, which I have spoken about previously?  It is defined as a type of collaborative housing in which residents actively participate in the design and operation of their neighbourhoods. <\/p> <p>That is very important.<\/p> <p> The Minister of State spoke about local development plans.  Local authorities are going to experience the largest cuts in revenue they have ever faced.  There have been no rates or car parking charges and people cannot pay rents on housing.  What are we going to do to ensure that we give local authorities proper capital funding?  They cannot have cuts in their services, whether for the elderly or others, nor can they have cuts to staff.  We cannot allow that to happen.

I am aware that either this week or next week, the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, intends to bring to Cabinet a proposal to extend the ban on rent increases, notices to quit and evictions.  Will the Minister of State confirm whether that will happen this week or next week?  Renters and landlords are obviously keen to know when that decision will be made<\/p>  <p>  There is also the broader issue of the rent arrears debt burden that is building.  I note the Department has asked the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, to produce some research on this issue.  Will the Minister of State tell us when that research is expected and, if he is still in government at that time, will he give a commitment to work with those of us in opposition on the crafting of those solutions?<\/p>  <p>  I turn to the issues of mica in County Donegal, pyrite in County Mayo and latent defects more generally.  My colleagues, Deputies Mac Lochlainn and Conway-Walsh, and I have twice written to the Minister of State seeking a meeting to discuss some issues related to those matters.  Will he give a commitment to meet us?<\/p>  <p>  On issues around energy efficiency, will the Minister of State give us an update on the monitoring of the near zero energy building, NZEB, regulations?  The regulations are good but I am not clear as to who is to monitor them to ensure compliance.  I would greatly appreciate any information the Minister of State has about that.  There are guidelines to ensure the highest levels of energy efficiency in our local authority stock.  There are some really good practices in our local authorities but is the Department actively considering going beyond NZEB to have, for example, passive plus or forms of design for social housing that treat embedded carbon as well?<\/p>  <p>  Can the Minister of State give us an update on the regulations for offshore wind energy which the Government was working on before the election?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000085#TTTT00300","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1591812000,"counter":270,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  If I miss some of the questions, I ask him to remind me what they are.<\/p>  <p>  I am not sure if the proposals he mentioned about preventing increases in rent and evictions will go to Cabinet this week or next week but the intention is to go to Cabinet with them.  There are protections there which were supported by everyone in the House.<\/p>  <p>  We discussed legislation at the end of March and I committed to the Deputy that when we had the report from the ESRI on rent arrears, we would be involved in consultation.  It remains to be seen who is in government or in opposition because we might all be in new positions by the time that report arrives.  If I am in this position or the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, is still in his position, we will discuss that matter and seek support for any changes that are needed.  I have not seen the research yet but we will, of course, act on it when we get it.  That is important and we committed to that.<\/p>  <p> On latent defects, I apologise to the Deputy.  He asked twice for a meeting on the issue and there was a mix-up on my side and that of the Minister.  I am happy to meet the Deputy.  The timing of his request crossed over with guidelines that were about to be published.  I felt there was no point in either me or the Minister meeting the Deputy and pretending that something was coming when it was not.  It was best to wait until the guidelines were published, which happened seven or eight days ago.  I am happy to meet the Deputy and go through those guidelines with him.  Over time, we might need to tweak those guidelines because I know there are some issues around planning in Mayo and so on but I am happy to talk to the Deputy about that as well.  The Deputy and his colleagues have engaged with me on that matter many times over the years.  <\/p>  <p>  I recognise the support of the House for that scheme because it is quite a commitment of taxpayers' money.  It was originally to address the problem of pyrite in many houses and that has been successful - nearly 2,000 houses have been fixed over the past seven or eight years.  Mica is an issue that is now relevant in Mayo and Donegal.  This House supported addressing that through the last budget.  We now have a process to address that.  It is important that people have confidence in the system and know that if their house is fixed, it is fixed properly and is safe to live in.  Naturally, it will take a couple of years to implement.  No one is saying that every house will be fixed straight away but the commitment is there and that is the bottom line.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy also asked about the local authorities and who is monitoring the NZEB regulations.  The local authorities and certifiers of sites are doing that through the building control measures.  People in this House may disagree but most people internationally accept that the building control measures in this country are quite good.<\/p> <p>I am not saying they were good years ago but they have been quite good in the last number of years.  There is always room to improve on the number of people involved in that sector.  The process is right.  We have the shared service model now.  There is no harm in adding more people to that as resources permit, to constantly monitor and increase that as well.  The independent certifier process is a help also.  That is the responsibility.  Those regulations will probably have more of an impact for the years ahead because there was a transition period out to October or November this year.  It is important that we do that as well.  <\/p> <p> The Deputy asked about local authorities and if we are going to add to NZEB again.  We monitor the costs and benefits of this every couple of years.  We believe at this stage that nearly every new house is at an A1 rating and a high standard has been set.  Naturally we will review that.  We are always looking for high quality design, implementation and construction with all local authority and social housing.  I think we have achieved that.  More directives are being worked on at European level around decarbonisation and we are part of a working group on that.  That is the whole life cycle.  We will look at that and it might bring more changes to the products used.  On the retrofit programme, I heard commentary on the previous scheme.  The new scheme is monitored and we do a BER check at the start and end of the process.<\/p> <p> There was one more question so I will come back to the Deputy on that.  I do not want to use up his colleagues' time.  The marine regulations have to come through the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000085#TTTT00400","speaker":"1505","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1591812600,"counter":272,"content":"<p>When I was first elected to Cork City Council in 2009, I outlined in my maiden speech the housing crisis in Cork.

History tells that I knew what I was talking about because Sinn F&eacute;in was on the ground talking to people.  For 11 years, I have been putting forward proposals and recommendations calling on Cork City Council and the Government to have major housing builds.  Back in 2011, I put forward a suggestion to build 800 houses on the Old Whitechurch Road site that Cork City Council owns.  That was rejected by the then Minister, Phil Hogan, and the Department.  Last October, it got final planning to go ahead, eight years after I and my Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues had put it forward.<\/p>  <p>  Yesterday, there was some good news in Cork city with a number of housing developments.  There was an announcement by the National Planning Agency to build 274 units on the St. Kevin's site of the old Our Lady's hospital.

That was seven years ago.

Vacant homes are a disgrace in themselves but they also attract problems, including vandalism, anti-social behaviour, and illegal dumping.

Some projects are proceeding on brownfield sites in Castleknock and Blanchardstown, which had one house on a large tract of land.  These have been bought by developers with massive developments with perhaps 300 to 500 apartments being crammed onto the sites as SHDs.  These are areas where schools and community facilities are already at capacity.  Families moving into these apartments will have to look outside the community, in areas such as Ongar and Tyrrelstown, for school places.  They will have to traverse Dublin 15 to get their children to school.  This is not something that might happen; it has been happening for years.  Greenfield sites in Ongar and Tyrrelstown are being developed on a massive scale.  Poor planning and poor public transport means many people must use their cars, particularly around Tyrrelstown.  How can we expect to hit climate change targets when we lack the investment in buses, safe cycle lanes, trains, schools, and community facilities where people live?  Only two years ago, when I was a member of Fingal County Council along with one of my fellow Deputies, we spent inordinate time on the county development plan.  It seems the Government either does not know it exists or has simply ignored the critical elements we put in place for proper planning and sustainable development.  One element was that developments in villages would not exceed three storeys, which the Government overturned.  SHDs were the other critical element.  They have bypassed the local planning process.  An example is a co-living development in Blanchardstown where a former pub will be turned into a co-living development for 240 people, with virtually no facilities around it.  The facilities that are there are vastly over capacity.<\/p> <p>In terms of climate change, it is key that we get the community involved.  We need a real community development process that includes departmental co-ordination, co-ordination with the local authorities and with the community in terms of public transport, schools, community facilities, local shops, roads and infrastructure.  We need the Minister of State to commit to ensuring that the voice of communities is heard and respected every step of the way.  We need community development workers with professional backup to tackle the issue.  When a strategic housing development, SHD, or other development comes up, we must ensure that communities are given the space and capacity to be able to deal with them.  That is most important.  No matter what Government is in place, if we are to tackle climate change it is critical that we bring the community along and the only way we will do that is if people feel they are part of the process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000087#VVVV00400","speaker":"1476","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1591813500,"counter":279,"content":"<p>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for extending to me an opportunity that we all relish, that is, to speak on this particular issue that has engaged us over the past ten years with increasing frequency and severity in terms of the people who require housing.  There is a simple way to deal with the issue.  We are thinking of new ways and new descriptions to deal with it, but it is the old-fashioned ways that will solve the problem, that is, we build more houses.  We must build houses as a matter of urgency to meet the requirements of the people who are on local authority housing lists or who are likely to become part of the local authority housing list.<\/p>  <p>  Members should not forget that when I was a member of an all-party committee a few years ago I called for a greater emphasis on direct building by local authorities and a move away from the approved housing bodies as a means of solving the problem.  That is still the way to solve the problem.<\/p>  <p>  We need to build energy-efficient houses, but we need the houses first.  The energy efficiency is important and it is important to incorporate energy efficiency in the building of the houses, but as a matter of urgency we need to change the situation of the person who does not have a home, who perhaps has a family of four or five living in a two-bedroomed apartment, or whatever the case may be, and who has been on a transfer list for four or five, and in some cases, ten years.  That can be done by the next Government.  It can be done in a number of ways.  It can be done by means of the local authority loans system.  Such loans are readily available to qualified applicants.  We do not have to go around the country trying to find ways and means and loopholes to get through the haze and maze of the system.  It can be done by means of private development sites.  We had them in Kildare and in all other counties throughout the country and they were very effective and efficient especially in meeting the market of those on the local authority housing list who were in a position to fund their own home by getting a loan to do it.  They did it very effectively and efficiently.  As you know, a Cheann Comhairle, all over Kildare we had fine examples of that, and in other counties as well.<\/p>  <p>  We can also do it by way of direct build, which is the point on which I started my contribution.  We need about 37,000 houses in a year to tackle the market and to break the back of it once and for all.  I am not being pejorative when I say it, but the next Government, whoever the Minister is, will have to face that reality.  It is a tough one, but it means we will have to bring forward the requirement.  Having a five-year plan, whereby at the end of it the people who are already waiting ten years are 15 years on the waiting list, will not work.  We must do a simple thing, that is, bring forward the plan and deliver upfront.  In the first year and a half or two years we must, in effect, deliver the majority of the requirement in what might become a five-year plan.<\/p>  <p>  Like you, a Cheann Comhairle, I could speak for ages on this subject because it is above and beyond all others; it is the one single subject that takes up most of our time in constituency work.  It used to take up approximately a quarter of the time but now it takes up approximately 75% of the time.  That is an indication of the urgency and the need of the people who remain on housing lists.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to give the Minister of State an opportunity to reply.  There is also a group of people, which fall between those who qualify for a local authority house and those who have sufficient income to get a loan of their own, namely, those who are short of qualifying for a loan.<\/p> <p>They have to be considered.  The local authority has ways and means of doing that and did in the past by using various methods to ensure that the loan system was brought within their reach.  All of these will be the challenge of the incoming Government and the incoming Minister.  It will be a great opportunity for a successful breakthrough.<\/p> <p> I compliment the work of the current Minister and Minister for State.  I compliment them for doing everything that was possible in a very difficult situation.  Unfortunately, the challenge is still there.  Whoever is the Minister in the incoming Government, I hope that in the first week there will be a realisation that we have an emergency on our hands.<\/p> <p> I will finish with one last point.  House prices are far too high in this country.  One of the things that is assessed in the determination of wealth is property prices.  Of course, then we must have higher salaries and wages because half of the salary goes in the payment of the mortgage.  Obviously, that will have an impact on the quality of life of those who live in the houses.<\/p> <p> I could go on, as the Ceann Comhairle could as well, as I well know.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000088#WWWW00200","speaker":"1584","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1591814100,"counter":281,"content":"<p>Can I leave the rest of the time to the Minister of State, who is adept at responding to the queries that I have raised?

They will have the funding to deliver whatever housing they want to.  They have targets set for each individual county.  Thankfully, Cork, which was referenced earlier on, is one of the leading counties in housing delivery over the past couple of years.  There are major improvements there.  Likewise, Kildare and many others have a lot of opportunity here.  The resources are there for them to bring forward more housing and they are doing that.  They will build on that and they are to do more of that.<\/p>  <p>  I do not agree with Deputy Durkan about the housing bodies' role.  I think the housing bodies have a very important role to supplement the delivery of local authorities.  I understand the experience in Kildare was a lot of housing associations as well as the larger housing bodies over the years and it is a difference of opinion there.  The housing bodies in the past couple of years have been doing a very good job bringing a supply of housing.  They work with the local authorities.  Local authorities are central to this.  For years, it has been Deputy Durkan's point that they should be and they are.  It should be direct build as much as possible where they can, but when it comes to vacant stock, they should get in there very early.<\/p>  <p>  I do not agree with Deputy Ward that local authorities have not got the powers to compulsorily purchase order, CPO, properties.  They might have told the Deputy they could not, they did not want to or whatever at the time.  I agree with the Deputy that local authorities should step in if need be and ideally use the carrot.  We have had schemes, that have been referenced here and criticised, that have not worked to their full potential but they were good schemes put forward to incentivise the providers to let us use their housing and bring vacant stock into use.  They did not avail of them.  We need to update the schemes, change the schemes and increase the use of CPO or other powers to bring vacant houses back into stock.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Durkan made the point about the importance of dealing with the different income levels.  The Deputy is absolutely right.  Naturally, the majority of phase 1 of Rebuilding Ireland, over the past three or four years, involved social housing.  We are now at a stage where we are delivering over 10,000 social houses a year.  We are committed as a party - I hope others here are too - to bring that to 12,000 social houses in the years ahead.  Not every party is, by the way.  On top of that, we need to have thousands of affordable houses which will deal with the next income bracket, which Deputy Durkan consistently raises here.  Deputy Durkan is correct.  I hope whoever is in government next will deal with that affordable housing and the different income levels which are not being addressed and at present are shut out of the market.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with the Deputy that in some areas house prices are too dear.  We would all like cheaper housing but there is a cost to building a house.  What we need to achieve is to get the market price closer to the cost of building a house whatever part of the country it is and that is the point the Deputy is making.  That gap in between in some places is too high.  Certainly we know with all the quality of houses that are built now under the regulations we have and the NZEB regulations, there is a cost of a house and it is something more than what it was years ago.  However, one is buying a better house in most cases.  That is what we should encourage.  We try to do that with our social housing stock - high quality design and high quality build.  However, it has to be affordable to the market as well and that is what it is trying to do.<\/p>  <p>  I thank Deputy Durkan for his recognition of the work but also his constant championing of the cause, here and everywhere else, to do more.<\/p> <p>I challenge every Deputy, as I have on many occasions, to step up on this.  Not every party's manifesto reflected the need to put more money into housing, both social and private.  I hope we will get a Government of like-minded people that will drive on with new housing delivery.<\/p> <p> Local authorities have to have money to build housing.  Deputy Gould mentioned his wisdom in 2009, 2010 and 2011, and there is a man on our left with the same wisdom, about the need to build more houses.  We all recognise the need to do it but, sadly, at that time there was no money to do it.  I am sure that when Deputy Durkan put forward the suggestions to develop sites, he probably had solutions for the money required.  I do not know whether he did.<\/p> <p> Nevertheless, I do not disagree with the Deputy.  We needed to build houses, as was recognised by many.  On my first trip to Cork as a Minister of State with responsibility for housing, I looked at the same sites and asked the same question as the Deputy, namely, why not use that site and let us drive on with it?  While Cork has made major progress, the money was not there.  I wish it had been there in my early years as a Government Deputy and Minister of State in the period 2011 to 2015, inclusive, but it was not.  As soon as it became available, in the period 2016 to 2020, inclusive, we put it into housing, with a massive multi-billion euro spend that delivered those houses.  It is not enough, however, and we need more.  Cork, Kildare, Meath and everywhere else have to step up and do even more.  I am hopeful that in the years ahead, we can deal with this housing issue once and for all but it will mean spending money on houses.  I fully agree with the Deputy that local authority housing is the key in that regard, as are vacant homes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000089#XXXX00500","speaker":"1505","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1591814700,"counter":286,"content":"<p>We have come very far since the Green Party sustainable energy legislation brought in standards for new builds through the Partel regulation, which has brought more people out of the fuel poverty trap than any other policy.

While this carbon is embodied in construction materials, it is emitted through excavation, production, manufacture, transport and their end-of-life disposal.  In the European context we are well behind the curve, as many countries have mandated their state bodies to procure materials using life-cycle assessment practices, where materials have environmental product declarations, EPDs, or environmental cost indicators, ECIs, which assist designers to procure buildings in a way that reduces embodied carbon.

There is a commitment within the Department to work in this area.  As the Deputy will know, we are involved in an EU working group, which is probably the key one dealing with embodied carbon in construction materials and the whole life-cycle cost of construction.  We are not prepared to go ahead of the working group with the issue and we want to work with it on that because it affects construction products, the regulations around them and the availability of products and materials for sale in this country and at European level.<\/p>  <p>  That is where we want to concentrate our work, working at European level and pushing the agenda to go far with it.  We will be in a place to make changes to embodied carbon and construction material regulations in line with our European colleagues.

The Deputy rightly recognised we have made many changes to the building regulations in recent years, as we discussed earlier, but we brought the sector with us on that journey.  There has been much consultation to reach where we are today with NZEB, and it did not happen overnight.<\/p> <p>It does have an impact on the cost of housing construction and all involved in the sector.  We now need to invest a lot of money.  A number of contributors referred to training and apprenticeships.  There is a lot of potential associated with our new housing and planning regulations, the new NZEB targets and the retrofit program.  We need to focus our resources on these to bring with us all those involved in the construction sector overall.  It is not just a matter of having regulations but of developing the real culture behind them.  The Deputy is coming from a perspective that acknowledges that we must think through the whole process and have everybody included.  That comes with good regulations.  Three or four Governments have been made many changes over the years at a reasonable pace, and we are prepared to make more in conjunction with our European colleagues when it comes to the products.  I believe we are on the path on which the Deputy wants us.  I am aware he has been involved in consultation, and I look forward to continuing the conversation with him whether we are in opposition or government, or working together or on opposite sides of the House.

My understanding is that most countries in Europe are moving ahead while Ireland is for some reason stirring a pot with regard to embodied carbon in materials, particularly construction materials.  The Dutch have been working on this since 2012.  They have various standards and procurement processes in place that work to take out the embodied carbon.  What I am hearing from the Department &mdash; I do not like saying this &mdash; is kind of spin.  It looks like the Scandinavians, French and English are already on board and that there is a misconnect somewhere.  When I mentioned environmental product declarations, EPDs, to the departmental officials, they did not know what I was talking about.  My fear is that they are not even at this point yet.<\/p>  <p>  I have a second question, on planning and climate action transition.  This State has an horrendous legacy when it comes to the planning strategy on public transport and the welfare of commuters.  During the 1940s and the 1950s, we virtually removed all rail links and completely removed trams from Dublin.  However, one of the many tangible benefits of EU membership for many Irish people has been the EU Structural Fund.  Unfortunately, since the 1990s we have continued to spend funding on road-building at the expense of public transport.  Portugal has an economic status comparable to ours but it invested heavily in public transport and its network, both inner-city and intercity, is now far ahead of ours and it has underground and fast intercity connections.<\/p>  <p>  Our current model does not serve society.  Most people have to purchase cars to move from A to B in Ireland.  They are then subject to all the expenses entailed by car ownership, which leads to lower quality of life.  Even in our capital, not to mention our commuter counties, the public transport network is not fit for purpose.  People face long commutes within the city.  It can take an hour and a half, or sometimes two hours, to move within the city.  Last year, the members of the Eastern and Midland Regional Assembly, of which I was a member, made policy to provide for sustainable public transport.  This policy included opening the Navan rail line and extending the airport metro to the south-west quadrant of the city.  Unfortunately, unelected decision makers seem to have forced the Minister to repeal this democratic process.  Does the Minister of State believe it is appropriate that elected public representatives at regional assembly level should have sustainable planning policies overturned by unelected officials?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000091#ZZZZ00200","speaker":"1574"},{"type":"speech","time":1591815300,"counter":290,"content":"<p>There were two points and I will address the first comment first.

The national planning framework and the ten-year investment going with the first half of that has a 2:1 split in terms of spend on public transport versus roads.  Everybody agrees that where it is at all possible, it is better to have public transport and invest in that in order that people can have the choice to use it.

I can only imagine now that he has gone to the Minister to tell him about his Pauline conversion to investment in social housing and all the great things we can expect to see over the next period.  I say this with the greatest of respect to Deputy Durkan, as his was a very impressive contribution.<\/p>  <p>  Energy efficiency measures in the built environment are what might be termed low-hanging fruit in reaching our stated European Union emissions targets.  The Minister of State knows the built environment accounted for 12.7% of Ireland's greenhouse gases in 2017 and retrofitting our domestic housing stock will be a fundamental part of building a new and sustainable economy.  Even if every new building constructed from now was carbon-neutral, Ireland would still fall short of the emission reduction targets unless the existing building stock was upgraded comprehensively.  Specifically, it is estimated that 70% of current buildings, many of which were built before the introduction of regulations relating to energy efficiency, will still be in use in 2050.<\/p>  <p>  Currently, the average Irish dwelling emits 104% of the EU 27 averages, mainly as a consequence of reliance on more carbon-intensive fuels.  According to the Environmental Protection Agency, such emissions from homes were projected to increase by 14% over the 2018-20 period under the \"existing measures scenario\".  This, however, may increase further due to Covid-19 and the increased number of people staying at home for longer periods.  As it stands, over 80% of Irish homes and other buildings have a building energy rating of C or worse, and under the stated transition plan these will need to be brought to a B rating or cost-optimal equivalent.  In short, we will need a massive State-led retrofitting programme over the next decade, as the House would acknowledge, to get our emissions from the built environment down to more sustainable levels.<\/p>  <p>  The Government's own climate action plan has set a target of 500,000 retrofits by 2030, which is an average of 50,000 per year, with most backdated to the second half of the decade.  However, with all due respect, we know the Minister of State's party has a habit of missing and revising targets, and this target does not go nearly fast or far enough.  For example, the cross-party climate action report signed up to by the Minister of State's party suggested increasing retrofitting to 75,000 buildings per annum.<\/p> <p>The Climate Change Advisory Council recommends that 100,000 homes per year should be retrofitted, a target that we ensured was contained in my party's recent general election manifesto.  Does the Minister of State have plans to revise the current target upwards?  Would he expect to see that target being revised upwards in any new programme for Government that may emerge?<\/p> <p> The quality of retrofits and the delivery model is just as important as the quantity.  In this regard, I ask the Minister for his response to the recent EU Court of Auditors report referred to by Deputy Murnane O'Connor which was highly critical of the Government for failing to target EU funds towards projects that are \"most likely to realise energy savings\".  The report specifically singled out the Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme in the Irish case, as referred to earlier, stating that energy ratings did not improve in more than half of the households renovated by that scheme in 2017.  That is a troubling indictment of the Government's capacity to deliver the required retrofitting programme but it is hardly surprising given the track record and the piecemeal approach that puts the reliance almost entirely on the private market which fails to deliver either cost or energy efficiencies.  In contrast, in our manifesto, my party committed to rolling out a public retrofitting scheme to all local authority housing as was advised by the chair of the Climate Change Advisory Council.  Through this street-by-street approach, homeowners could avail of subsidised home insulation while local building contractors would be able to benefit from the efficiencies of scale in terms of price and delivery.  Given the EU Court of Auditors findings, will the Minister reconsider, and does he expect the next Government, to reconsider the current delivery model?<\/p> <p> Regarding funding, the transition statement states, \"The revenues from the increased carbon price will also be used to help to achieve the aggregation of retrofit works called for in the Climate Action Plan.\"  On that issue, I bring to the Minister of State's attention a public consultation of which he will be aware that carried out last year by the Department of Finance on the issue of how to utilise carbon tax revenues.  As he may be aware, the consultation process found that, \"The predominant view ... is that the additional carbon tax revenues should be ring-fenced for the purposes of enhancing the current SEAI grant scheme for household energy efficiency improvements ...\", while the option of returning the proceeds by way of dividend as initially proposed by Fine Gael, and the Green Party, received a negative response overall.  Can the Minister confirm if he expects the next programme for Government to commit to ring-fencing revenues raised from carbon taxation for the retrofitting of homes, as my party has proposed, or will he revert to the dividend model as initially promoted by some parties in this House but on which some of them now appear to be back-tracking?<\/p> <p> Finally, as John FitzGerald has stated, there is an urgent need to increase the capacity to deliver the necessary retrofit programme without it impacting on the delivery of increased numbers of houses.  As stated earlier, this Government has overseen a national housing crisis and, consequently, building affordable and more public homes has to remain a top priority for the next Government.  The elephant in the room, however, is the chronic labour shortages in the construction sector which have driven up costs and delayed the speed of delivery of housing and retrofitting projects.  According to the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, SCSI, and PwC Ireland construction and market monitor for 2019, 80% of survey respondents reported shortages of plumbers, carpenters, bricklayers and surveyors while more than 60% cannot get enough electricians and civil engineers.  In 2019 alone, more than 40% of Engineers Ireland's new members came from abroad, something that has been described as unsustainable by the director general of Engineers Ireland, and even more so now in the context of Covid-19 and all that flows from that.<\/p> <p> There are also an insufficient number of apprentices coming on-stream.  I know that is an area in which the Minister is particularly interested, as I am also.  For example, only 30 people registered for apprenticeships as plasterers in 2017, and I do not believe the situation has improved much since then.  That is in part due to the uncertain career opportunities provided by our current apprenticeship model as well as the low pay which prevails.<\/p> <p> Covid-19 has presented us with an opportunity - to use the unfortunate phrase - to kill two birds with one stone and go some way towards solving our unemployment, housing and climate crises in one strategic swoop.  I have repeatedly called for a new deal for a new generation as part of our Covid-19 economic recovery plan.  That would, could and should include State-backed training and employment in climate apprenticeships to deliver a just transition to a new sustainable society.<\/p> <p>More than 100,000 new, long-term, local jobs could be created as part of a large-scale, State-led retrofitting programme and zero-emissions home building programme.  As a State, we should have this kind of ambition.  It is the kind of ambition our young people expect to see from this House.  Has the Minister of State held any discussions with the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection or Minister for Education and Skills with regard to the shortage of construction workers and how Government intends to address this shortage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000092#AAAAA00800","speaker":"1599","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1591817100,"counter":305,"content":"<p>There were four main questions.  I will give the Deputy a short answer; we can talk about it further afterwards.  There is approximately &euro;3 billion set aside to reach the retrofitting targets set out in the national development plan.  The climate plan aims to retrofit a minimum of 500,000 houses with that funding.  This includes social and private housing.  As to whether that will be revisited, I am sure any future Government will revise that target.  It certainly should add to it if it possibly can.  Again, that was a ten-year target rather than a 20-year target, but there is real money committed to it.  It needs to be implemented because if offers a major chance to deliver success in this area.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the recent report of the European Court of Auditors on the better energy warmer homes scheme, that scheme is not fully under the aegis of my Department.  We are involved in it to a degree but we are not in charge of it.  With regard to our part, we implemented changes more than a year ago.  The report was only published in the last month but a lot of the auditing work was done more than a year ago.  We made changes at that point so the scheme already works much better.  Naturally, we will make more changes to it if we can but I confirm that the delivery model has already changed.<\/p>  <p>  On the use of carbon taxes, all parties had different view on this in their manifestos.

From the point of view of social housing, I believe it was greater than 4,000 but I stand to be corrected.  I will get the exact figure for the Deputy; I have it somewhere in my notes.<\/p>  <p>  The court's biggest criticism of the scheme is that no BER was calculated before work started.  It seems obvious that this should have been done.  That was rightly changed more than a year ago.  For the past 12 months, we have been able to monitor whether the retrofits under the scheme have been successful.  The purpose of the scheme was to make people's homes more comfortable and more affordable to run from an energy point of view, as well as achieving a higher BER for homes and making them healthier places to live.  There is more than one way to assess its success.  It was also based on low-cost interventions.  Phase 2 will involve a much greater spend.<\/p> <p>The average cost of the early stage of that scheme from 2013 to 2017 or 2018 was approximately &euro;3,200 per house so it was not going to have a massive impact on anybody's house.  It involved small, low-cost improvements.  The second phase is a greater investment of over &euro;22,000 or &euro;23,000 in most cases, which should have a much greater impact.  There is a guaranteed BER rating taken at the start and at the end to show the progress.  In some work there is a difficulty with that, often involving a delay, but we are clear in the voids programme over the last couple of years that a BER rating must be included for before and after to be able to monitor the work, the progress and so forth.  We have made the changes that the audit is seeking.  They are in place already.  However, as I said, improvements can always be made.<\/p> <p> The Deputy referred to the EU fiscal rules.  There are EU fiscal rules that constrained what the country could spend overall and also our ability to borrow.  In fairness, I tried to make a point earlier but I was short of time.  When we took office in 2011 we were unable to borrow.  Nobody would give us any money.  We must remember that.  The figures then showed we were over &euro;20 billion overdrawn each year so there had to be major structural reform of our public finances, which was achieved.  The benefits of that can be seen now.  We are now in a position to borrow a large amount of money to invest in the recovery due to Covid-19 this year, next year and the year after that.  The Deputy is saying that we should have had money in the years from 2011 to 2014, but nobody had money and nobody would give us any money.  When we could get our hands on it, fiscal rules or not, we spent the money on housing in a sustainable way.  Now we must build on that and add more to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000094#CCCCC00400","speaker":"1505","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1591817700,"counter":309,"content":"<p>The investment that has gone into the retrofitting of social housing is very welcome.

The statistics show in general that 45% of housing is now using heat pumps compared to 4% a couple of years ago.  There has been a major change because of our regulations.  Local authority housing is being built.  It is funny that Members continue to say we are not building local authority housing, yet they ask questions about how many houses have that.  There is proof that they are being built and they have a very high rating, and rightly so.  We were committed to that.

At this stage we should not be building any social housing that is connected to those types of fossil fuel home heating.<\/p>  <p>  My final question relates to the national planning framework which is in the climate action statement.  There is a clear need for much more compact growth and using brownfield sites.  The target in the national planning framework is for 50% of overall growth in housing by 2040 to be in our five cities.  A key lever in dealing with brownfield sites and vacant sites is the vacant sites levy, so my question is about that.  Just over half of local authorities have a vacant sites register with valuations.  It is 17 out of 31 of the local authorities.  That is most unsatisfactory.  There is also the fact that only four local authorities have collected vacant sites levies totalling slightly less than &euro;1 million.  Is the Minister of State satisfied with the rate of collection of vacant sites levies?  Does he agree that we must have much stronger legislation on vacant sites and that we could also provide supports at national level with teeth or legal back-up to support local authorities in their collection?  Would the Minister of State like the legislation in that area to be revised and strengthened?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000095#DDDDD00400","speaker":"1550"},{"type":"speech","time":1591817700,"counter":312,"content":"<p>First, I wish to correct the answer I gave earlier about the number of social housing units.  It was almost 4,500 in 2018.<\/p> <p>It was 4,453 at a cost of &euro;13 million.  In 2019, it was 3,763.  The 2020 figures are much less as one would expect but hopefully they will get much better before the year is out.  The figures for 2017 were 5,400.  There has been a fair bit of improvement.  The number of units were much higher in the early phase of the scheme back in 2014.  It has got better with a greater spend and is more successful.<\/p> <p> If we are going to achieve our targets in sustainable development, climate change, provision of public transport and many other services, we need to have compact growth.  Our target is to achieve 40% growth in all areas on brownfield sites and 50% in all cities and large towns.  It is a good target but it means difficult choices.  The Deputy referred to the difficulty with the strategic housing development process.  I do not agree with him that it eliminates local planning authorities.  The result is a higher density of housing in many areas.  If we are going to achieve compact growth, it will involve, regardless of the planning process to get there, a higher density of housing required on brownfield sites.  That is very difficult when trying to implement that in existing communities.<\/p> <p> I agree there needs to be much more conversations and work with existing communities as to how one matches these two together.  The best way is probably through the provision of extra services and benefits.  Essentially, with more brownfield sites developed, one will bring forward more benefits such as community services and facilities.  That is a conversation we will need to have.  If we are to achieve targets, it means different types of developments.  It can be difficult on the edge of cities with low density development.  This has to be balanced.<\/p> <p> I do not believe the vacant site levy is the No. 1 tool to drive compact growth.  It was in place.  We made changes to it in the planning legislation two years ago which increased the rate of the levy.  I would not judge it just on its collection rate.  Very often the conversation around a vacant levy about to be imposed generates work on a site and gets things moving.  It is meant to be a tool to get people moving on a site, regardless of density or what is built on it, to get activity.  In many cases, it has done that.  In others, it has not.  I agree local authorities need to update the register.  However, it is not meant to be the tool to achieve compact growth.  It is part of a toolbox.  There are other tools which we could use better in terms of working with people who own the land to put it into use, provided we agree with the plans.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000095#DDDDD00500","speaker":"1505","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1591818300,"counter":314,"content":"<p>While this is primarily about the climate transition we need to make, given that the Minister of State is here, I want to raise one urgent issue.  It would be good to get his response to it.<\/p>  <p>  Threshold is the latest group today to appeal to the Government to extend the eviction ban for a number of months.  I argue it should be extended for the foreseeable future.  Some of us have been saying the eviction ban should remain in place until we address the housing emergency.  Will the Minister of State say anything about not allowing that eviction ban to expire at the end of this month?  As Threshold pointed out, a point which many of us have made over the past number of weeks, people on reduced incomes or who have lost their jobs have built up rent arrears.  Others affected include those on housing assistance payment who might have not been able to manage top-up payments or those who are just being threatened by vulture funds with eviction for spurious reasons because the Government failed to close loopholes which allow them to do this.<\/p>  <p>  For all of those reasons, and after everything people have gone through, we do not need a slew of evictions coming down the track after the eviction ban is lifted at the end of this month.  The Government should give that certainty in order that people do not stumble from one extremely difficult situation in terms of a public health emergency into another one, that of facing eviction.<\/p>  <p>  I will mention an example that I have cited here before of how nothing really happens.  The Government was accusing other people of spin.  I was not joking when I said the party's real title should be \"Spin Gael\".  For the past three years, I have raised the case of one block of apartments in D&uacute;n Laoghaire where there have been four successive attempts by vulture funds to evict people on spurious grounds.<\/p> <p>Half of that block has been sitting empty for two years because the landlord sees it as more beneficial for its agenda to leave apartments sitting empty while people desperately need them.  People are facing eviction if the Minister of State does not extend that no-eviction clause immediately.  Their case is with the Residential Tenancies Board.  It has happened through no fault of their own and there are many like them.  The Minister of State should step in and stop those evictions.  In my mind, he should take over that whole block using a compulsory purchase order in order that those people are safe and the ten units that have been sitting there, outrageously empty, for two years could be used by desperate people on the housing list.<\/p> <p> As a by-the-way response to the Minister of State's comments about the Government's success with housing, the facts are pretty awful.  The latest figures in Rebuilding Ireland about housing directly built by local authorities show that the Government built less in 2019 than in 2018.  Local authority housing output is getting worse.  The State built 1,238 houses in 2018 and only 1,088 in 2019, but in Dublin the situation is worse.  In 2018, the four Dublin counties built 634 council houses, a pathetic number in and of itself.  In 2019, that fell to 228.  In D&uacute;n Laoghaire, the number went from 120 in 2018, for a housing list of 5,000, to 17 in 2019 for that housing list.  I will tell the Minister of State a little secret: fewer than 17 will be built next year.  It is getting worse, not better.  This is relevant to whether we can take seriously the Government talk about doing something about the climate emergency and about a 7% annual emissions reduction target.  The Government produces plans and there are many promises and a lot of spin, but we do not see the delivery, as is the case with local authority housing.  I do not see how the Green Party can imagine for one second that it will get a 7% annual emissions reduction with the approach the Government has, which is not serious at any level.  I will not list everything, although there are such facts as the Government wanting to expand the herd, to continue with the liquefied natural gas plant, to kowtow to the fossil fuel industry about the fossil fuel ban and so on.<\/p> <p> In the area of housing, it is blatantly obvious that the market cannot deliver.  If there is one thing that the Government should have learned from the pandemic, since it was forced to learn this, it is that when the market has to shut down and the State intervenes, it is capable of doing so.  The Government does not pass off responsibility but does it itself.  That is what is needed if we are to retrofit the housing stock in this country.  The State has to do it by establishing a State construction company, marshalling the resources and having a planned approach to at least 100,000 retrofits a year.  Even though the Government says we are only the party of protest, we have, along with the Government in fairness, though ours is much more ambitious, gone to the trouble of having a costed retrofit programme for the next ten years in our manifesto.  It is expensive but it will save us significant fines and emissions, and it will improve the quality of housing for hundreds of thousands of our citizens who are, in many cases, in chronically damp, poorly insulated homes where their quality of life suffers as a result.  It does not surprise me that we have such high asthma rates in this country when one considers that 86% of people live in houses that have a building energy rating of C or worse.  Most are much worse than that.<\/p> <p> We are not even touching the problem because we are essentially leaving it to the market, rather than the State doing it.  Now is the time to change approach because there are sadly now hundreds of thousands of young people without jobs, possibly for the foreseeable future.<\/p> <p>If we really went out to recruit apprentices and tradespeople to a State construction company where they were paid decently and were guaranteed that they would have security of employment, the Government would actually get them into the construction sector to retrofit the houses at the scale we need to do.  The State, however, would have to give that certainty to people.  Why does the Minister of State think half the people that were in construction ten years ago left?  It was because the boom slump caused by the private market dumped them on the scrapheap, and they said \"I am never going back to construction\".  That is what happens in this industry because of the way the Government ran it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000096#EEEEE00200","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1591819200,"counter":317,"content":"<p>That is not the way we ran it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000098#GGGGG00200","speaker":"1505"},{"type":"speech","time":1591819200,"counter":318,"content":"<p>It is.

On the last point, I totally agree with a pay-as-you-save scheme for the retrofits.  That could be run by the State or some energy companies offer the same thing as well.  A retrofit target task force has been set up across all the different Departments looking at how best we use the allocation of &euro;3 billion over the next number of years to deal with this.  Hopefully they will report quite soon, and the next Government, whoever may be in it, can make the decisions about how best to do that as well.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett referred to apprenticeships and changes there.  Thankfully, a number of years ago we made major changes around the whole apprenticeship model and the offer of apprenticeships.  We have seen a massive uptake of apprenticeships across many different sectors, along with nearly 40 new types of apprenticeships.  There is a major opportunity there to convert people over, upskill them, have skills conversion and so on, to be able to tackle housing retrofitting.  Regardless of whether it is State or private, it can be done.  I totally agree with the Deputy on that as well.<\/p>  <p>  To be honest with the Deputy, I do not do spin here because we cannot.

I do not like it when Deputy Boyd Barrett constantly says that but he will keep doing it and I will keep defending against it.  Factually, however, whether he likes it or not, it is proven that there are over 10,000 new social houses in the system this year.  The Deputy is obsessed with one form of delivery, one form of build.  My obsession is with getting people family homes.  I am not obsessed with who builds them but with getting them.  Since we started Rebuilding Ireland over 100,000 families are now in homes that they would not be in if we were doing Deputy Boyd Barrett's schemes because that many would not have been built.  The Deputy keeps saying he does not want HAP and the private sector but he has never given me a solution for the more than 40,000 families that are HAP houses today.

The issue of minimum density at the edge of town and greenfield sites has caused significant problems outside of the M50 concerning the supply of housing.  The imposition of such densities necessitates the construction of apartments at locations where they are just not viable.  The application of these densities by An Bord Plean&aacute;la is unlawful and it undermines the statutory standing of every county development plan, as no specific minimums have been set out in the specific planning policy requirement, SPPR, or in the ministerial guidelines.  I tabled a parliamentary question with the Minister of State in early May and the response I received was confusing to say the least.  I put it to the Minister of State the SPPR that is relied an by An Bord Plean&aacute;la in applying such minimum densities is the SPPR 4 of the building height guidelines.  I will quote the relevant extract: \"the minimum densities for such locations set out in the Guidelines issued by the Minister under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended), titled 'Residential Development in Urban Areas (2007)' or any amending or replacement Guidelines\".

Development at net densities less than 30 dwellings per hectare should generally be discouraged. <\/blockquote> <p>It is clear that no specific minimums have been provided in either the specific planning policy requirements, SPPR, or the guidelines of 2009, so the Minister will appreciate how I was totally confused when I received his response to the parliamentary question raised wherein he confirmed that achieving densities of at least 35 dwellings per hectare is essential in catering for the more diverse range of households.  It seems that the Minister is inferring in his response that the minimum is 35 dwellings per hectare, but neither the SPPR nor the guidelines make any reference to such a minimum.<br\/><br\/>Can the Minister confirm to the House that there is no such minimum provided in the guidelines for outer urban green field sites?

As the Minister of State is aware, the High Court action taken by Friends of the Irish Environment and the appalling delays in issuing planning judgments by An Bord Plean&aacute;la have contributed to bringing about chronic levels of uncertainty for many workers and contractors involved in peat harvesting.  These workers are not just in Bord na M&oacute;na and the ESB; they are also in parts of the horticultural sector.  The just transition commissioner, Mr. Kieran Mulvey, notes that, in effect, the decision terminated the usage of peat for the generation of electricity and had the domino effect of effectively closing down the harvesting of bogs over a wide area of several midland counties, including parts of Roscommon and east Galway.<\/p>  <p>  I have already called for the next Government to commit to introducing legislation that would exempt peat operators from requiring planning permission when extracting peat from sites in excess of 30 ha.  Bord na M&oacute;na has also made it very clear that urgent legislative changes are required if we are to avoid an annual repetition of the tiresome and delaying processes of the kind that workers and the company have just been through with An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which in my mind is a law unto itself.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State is aware that such exemptions in the form of statutory instruments were put in place by him and the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment in January 2019, before they were struck down by the courts.  I still think that is something that needs to be revisited and reintroduced in much stronger terms.  Mr. Mulvey also noted in the first report recently that if the just transition funds or projects for the region are to be used to their maximum value and to achieve the best medium and long-term effects, a whole-of-region approach will be necessary between the local authorities, Departments and State agencies.  For this to happen, he says, a greater degree of planning, co-ordination and co-operation is necessary.  This will involve key tourism infrastructure, transport, remote working hubs, business and innovation centres and cross-county planning.  Perhaps the Minister of State could provide me with an update on how this whole-of-region and cross-county planning is progressing within his Department.<\/p> <p> I am deeply concerned by the view put forward by Friends of the Irish Environment when they took the High Court challenge in 2019.  They clearly stated that stopping all peat extraction is a no-brainer, with absolutely no thought to communities, livelihoods or anything else.  This clearly conveys the worrying mindset that is at play here.  Does the Minister of State see this becoming a reality?  Every attempt to take even a minimal amount of peat would end up requiring planning permission.<\/p> <p> Going back to the planning difficulties, Growing Media Ireland, GMI, has been in contact with me several times on this issue.  It has submitted what it sees as a legal and fair resolution to the challenges.  According to GMI, almost all agree that planning Acts have never worked well for recurring work like peat harvesting, quarrying or dredging, maintenance of flood relief drains and so on.  In fact, there appears to be a legal consensus that licensing is logically a better fit than planning control.  Would the Minister of State accept this?  Would he also accept that the 18-month exemption proposed in the regulations that were quashed last year should be removed so as to reduce delay in the processing time required to assess licence applications?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000100#JJJJJ02900","speaker":"1592","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1591821000,"counter":388,"content":"<p>Some of the Deputy's questions are subject to an ongoing planning situation so I cannot comment specifically on one case.  The Deputy asked about An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the length of time it takes to make decisions.  In general, a major programme of reform has been implemented in An Bord Plean&aacute;la over the last couple of years and it is now reaching much higher targets on turnarounds and making much quicker decisions.  This is very positive for anyone involved in planning decisions, regardless of which side of the debate they are on.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la will continue to reach higher targets with increased levels of staff, computerisation and IT equipment.<\/p>  <p>  The other issues the Deputy mentioned cross over two Departments.  On the whole issue of peat extraction, there are various requirements depending on the size of the holding and the number of hectares.  There was an attempt to make changes in 2018 and 2019.

I have been listening to the whole Chamber and the one thing no one has brought up is infrastructure.  The Government has failed rural Ireland with infrastructure.  I will start with the area where I was elected first, the Adare-Rathkeale district.  On a promise from Government, they are waiting 30 years for a storage plant in Askeaton.  No more houses can be built there because there is no infrastructure and no commitment, including from the current Government, has been fulfilled for storage plants.  I will move on to Adare and mention Irish Water, a failed identity.  Only for the persistence of my colleagues in the Adare-Rathkeale district, they were going to resurface a road and put in footpath in Adare without putting a sewer line down through the middle of the street because Irish Water would not commit.<\/p> <p>It delayed the process by eight months.  It is only due to the persistence of the Adare Rathkeale councillors that the sewer line was laid and the reconstruction of the road completed.  There is tunnel vision and no forward thinking.<\/p> <p> The Minister of State spoke of building 800 houses here and 300 there.  There is no infrastructure in Limerick.  People in Oola are waiting for a sewerage system and the county council is refusing planning permission applications because there is no infrastructure.  People cannot move home. <\/p> <p> On conservation in our towns and villages, many voids and vacant buildings in County Limerick could be used to rehouse people if some common sense were shown.  However, legislation and regulation are preventing this.  A building contractor, of which I am one, who wishes to build a house must pay &euro;17,000 for a site in order to make a profit.  A site in rural Ireland will cost a minimum of &euro;50,000.  A sewerage system will cost another &euro;15,000.  Getting plans from an architect or engineer costs another &euro;3,000.  That is only for the plans, not for building a house.  Irish Water might charge another &euro;3,000 and county council fees could be another &euro;5,000.  The list of council amenities includes libraries and footpaths, but none of these is provided in rural areas because the Government has forgotten rural Ireland.  It has not provided any money or infrastructure for rural Ireland and has not kept any commitments to it.  I could keep the Minister of State here all night listing the failures of his Government and its predecessors to provide infrastructure in rural towns.  Building houses in the cities is possible because the Government is providing funding for infrastructure but raw sewage is flowing into the sea because of the lack of infrastructure.  The Government has forgotten rural Ireland.  It needs to invest in it and relax conservation legislation, so that people can retain facades and roof structures and rebuild streets.  I know it can be done because I am a contractor.  I do it every single day, as do the people I employ.  The Government penalises people in rural Ireland.  There is no Internet connectivity.  These are the people who kept us going with food when the pandemic hit.  The Government must think about infrastructure and let people build at home.  Under the 2040 plan, if I live in Kilmallock and work in Shannon, I would lose my planning permission unless I have an emissions impact study.  That needs to be revised.  The Government must invest in rural Ireland and must be constructive so that people who wish to do so can come home to their families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000101#KKKKK00300","speaker":"1499","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1591821300,"counter":391,"content":"<p>I will make two quick comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000102#LLLLL00200","speaker":"1505"},{"type":"speech","time":1591821300,"counter":392,"content":"<p>We do not have time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000102#LLLLL00300","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1591821300,"counter":393,"content":"<p>It will take ten seconds.

The targets for acquisition and social housing have been reached in Galway because they was set so low.  At something more than 100 units, one would have to reach it.  Meanwhile, the Government is exceeding its targets for the housing assistance payment, HAP.  It is putting people into HAP tenancies and rewarding local authorities for exceeding their targets, which is not sustainable.  There is a major housing crisis and a task force is in place, but there is no real progress.  The only progress we are making is in building private houses alongside public houses on public land.  That approach is totally wrong and I will never agree with it.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State took exception to Deputy Boyd Barrett's language.<\/p> <p>I am in agreement with him regarding cynicism.  I welcome the opportunity to talk about transition statements on climate change regarding local authorities, but we will have to put a little perspective on it that might explain my cynicism.  We had the Rio de Janeiro conference 28 years ago in 1992, then we had the Kyoto Protocol in 1997, then we had the Paris Agreement, which set binding targets, then we had at least five Bills in Ireland in five years, and I think we are getting another one.  I will not read them all out.  Our emissions rate has gone up and we have failed to reach our targets.  The Minister of State should forgive my cynicism.  When I look at local authorities, in particular in Galway, I note there is no biodiversity officer.  Could he explain why Galway does not have a biodiversity officer?  We finally got a biodiversity action plan.  It has the year 2014 in the title but I do not think it was passed in 2014.  The plan goes to 2024.  There are supposed to be annual reports and a mid-term review but I cannot find any of them.  Perhaps I am wrong.  I will be the first to come in and say &quot;Sorry&quot; if I am but I cannot see them.  We need to make language mean something.  We have all these action plans and we are, supposedly, trying to comply with our obligations under various international conventions and national legislation and we are utterly failing.<br\/><br\/>I repeatedly said to the Minister of State that I did not come in here to be negative.  I am a very practical, pragmatic woman.  I see a housing crisis and I see a solution, and the State must be an integral part of that, build public housing on public land and send a message to the market that it is serious about sorting out the crisis.<br\/><br\/>I cannot read any more climate change plans.  The latest one was the biodiversity plan from the intergovernmental panel and it was absolutely frightening.  I referred to the most recent report in a speech I made in the D&aacute;il a year and a month ago.  I stated then:<\/p><blockquote>\tThe most recent report by Intergovernmental Science Policy Platform leaves little room for doubt ... The report finds that approximately 1 million animal and plant species are now threatened with extinction, many within decades, more than ever before in human history. <\/blockquote> <p>I tried to use my time efficiently.  There are so many issues I could refer to, but we know that this is the biggest threat facing us and we need to take positive and serious action.  We declared an emergency.  Members might recall how we declared it.  The debate was on a report from the all-party committee on climate action and the Government motion was to note it.  Fianna F&aacute;il and various other parties tabled amendments to the motion and it was on the basis of an amendment that the climate emergency was declared.  The Minister who was present and my Galway West constituency colleague, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, were taken completely by surprise that the motion passed.  That is how serious the Government was regarding the issue.  It took the children on our streets to make us do something.<br\/><br\/>I can only zone in on one or two things in my remaining time and tonight I have chosen to zone in on biodiversity in Galway, which is a beautiful city.  We have the River Corrib and Galway Bay.  The area is full of streams and rivers.  We have a biodiversity action plan but nobody to implement it.  How serious is that?  Is the Minister of State or the Department aware of that?  What action has it taken?  There is an funding emergency for local authorities.  All of these plans are worth nothing if they do not have resources and money.  What is the Minister of State doing about that in relation to the Covid crisis and what has happened with rates?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000102#LLLLL00900","speaker":"1577","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1591821600,"counter":400,"content":"<p>I want to ask the Minister of State two questions.  The first relates to solar energy.  Under the process, first, one has to get planning permission and then has to get a grid connection.  That can be cost effective or cost prohibitive depending on the upgrade of lines and other issues.  However, before any of that one has to pay &euro;7,500 to the ESB just to make the application and then one has to apply to the renewable electricity support scheme by way of a competitive auction.  This system is designed so that only large solar development companies have the resources to do it.

We made this mistake with wind energy and we have reaped the whirlwind.<\/p> <p> The Minister is looking at microgeneration of less than 1 MW.  I know many farmers who want to get involved in this.  I ask the Minister to do three things, namely, to make the scheme simple, usable and cost-effective.  That is the first point.<\/p> <p> The second point I want to raise is on the report of the European Court of Auditors on the better energy warmer homes scheme.  The report states that, in practice, projects did not define any energy saving objective or report on energy saved and, for more than half of the supported households, the scheme did not improve energy ratings.  We have a national retrofit plan, on which I have two short questions.  First, what is now in the plan to show we have learned from the mistakes we made with the scheme and we will not make similar mistakes again?  Second, according to the report of the European Court of Auditors, only 27% of the funding allocated to the better energy warmer homes scheme had been spent by the end of 2018.  We are halfway through 2020 and almost at the end of the scheme.

That would be the handiest way to do respond as I can cover both Deputies' questions.<\/p>  <p>  The better energy warmer homes scheme is not operated by my Department and I cannot give the Deputy details on it.  I will ask the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, to contact Deputy Harkin about it.  Our Department is involved in the scheme and draws down funding for the social housing aspect of it.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Harkin asked what changes have been made to the scheme.  The report that came out this week has been discussed at length today when it was raised by other Deputies.  The study was carried out approximately a year ago but the report was only published in the past month.  We made changes on foot of the audit statement issued a year ago because it was common sense to record the building energy rating of a home before starting work.  That seems like a simple measure but it was not done.  That was changed.  The issue with the report was that one could not judge if a retrofit had improved a house because the BER was not recorded before the work started.  The BER is now assessed before and after the work, which should solve that problem as we will be able to monitor the benefits of the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The Department's use of the better energy warmer homes scheme in the early years was for low-cost interventions of approximately &euro;3,000 per house under phase 1.  While these did not deliver major changes, they did bring some changes.  Phase 2, which has been well funded, provides for increased interventions costing more than &euro;22,000 per house and should deliver much better results.  Apart from that, &euro;3 billion has been set aside for retrofitting social and public housing in the coming years.  This is an important area.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Harkin referred to solar energy and the renewable electricity support scheme.  My Department does not handle the relationship with the ESB on connections but I will raise the matter with the Minister, Deputy Bruton.  The Deputy is correct, however, that the scheme needs to be made easier to work with.  Changes have been made over the years but the scheme needs to be constantly adapted.<\/p>  <p>  I am responsible for regulations on micro-energy and exemptions.  I gave a commitment a couple of times in the past year to bring forward new exemptions to facilitate microgeneration and solar power infrastructure on farm buildings, houses, etc.  Those regulations are being worked on and we are close to being able to bring them before the House for discussion and implementation.  They should make things easier.  I am committed to microgeneration.  I have visited G&uuml;ssing in Austria, which I believe the Deputy also visited some years ago.  This small district shows what can be achieved with microgeneration and how to bring the community along.  We should encourage more of that and we will do so.<\/p>  <p>  I will have to believe Deputy Connolly that there is no biodiversity officer in Galway.  I do not know whether a person has been appointed but I will check for the Deputy.  I want to be clear on this.  As a councillor, the Deputy was a director of Galway and her colleagues are also directors of local authorities.  Councillors need to ask those questions and do their jobs because they are directors of the company that runs the county and city, as are Deputies in this place.  We will disagree on some matters but we will certainly agree that councillors needs to do their job as directors.

It is clear that climate change remains one of our greatest challenges, and at 20% of Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions, transport has a significant role to play in our decarbonisation effort.  While transport emissions fell by 2.4% in 2017, indicative figures from the EPA show a small increase in emissions in 2018.  As in all developed economies, transport is the sector with greatest emissions growth over recent decades, and globally transport emissions are proving the most challenging and costly to address.  Deeper action is needed urgently to decarbonise the transport sector.<\/p>  <p>  I welcomed the publication by the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment in July 2019 of a climate action plan to tackle climate disruption, which sets out a number of ambitious but necessary actions for my Department and the transport sector.  The European Green New Deal also sets its sights on a renewed ambition for transport emissions and signals a strong impetus to achieve the key aim of becoming the world's first climate-neutral continent by 2050.<\/p>  <p>  I will highlight a number of key emissions reduction measures undertaken by the Department.  These actions aim to build capacity and enhance services in our public transport systems, foster greater practice of walking and cycling, and promote a transition away from traditional fossil fuels in both the private and public vehicle fleets.  We are also providing that our transport infrastructure can adapt to cope with major weather events, which are occurring with more frequency due to climate change.<\/p>  <p>  In promoting the transition away from fossil fuels, the low-emission vehicle task force, co-chaired by my Department and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, continued its work throughout 2018 and 2019.  The first phase of work of the task force, which concentrated on electric vehicles, EVs, finished in 2018 and saw the addition of new EV incentives.  Two new schemes administered by my Department were included, namely, the electric small public service vehicle grant scheme and the electric vehicle toll incentive scheme.<\/p>  <p>  In response, we saw a marked increase in the number of EVs on Irish roads in 2019, albeit from a low base.  By the end of December, more than 15,500 EVs were under taxation in Ireland, more than double the number at December 2018.  EV numbers continued to increase in the first few months of 2020, with almost 19,000 on the roads by the end of April.  We do not, however, expect the same level of growth this year, due to the closure of car dealerships during the Covid-19 crisis.<\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, we are acutely aware that this transition needs to be accelerated even more.  The climate action plan set ambitious targets for the number of EVs in Ireland this decade, namely, 180,000 by 2025 and 936,000 by 2030.  Clearly these targets are challenging, but they are indicative of the scale of transformation needed in all sectors if Ireland is to reach its legally binding emissions ceilings in future years.  My Department has established a focused electric vehicle optimum policy pathway working group to consider a roadmap to achieving these EV climate action plan targets.  It expects to finish its work in the coming months and will publish its findings and recommendations to the Government shortly thereafter.<\/p>  <p>  The second phase of the low-emissions vehicle task force focused on other alternative fuels, including natural gas and hydrogen, particularly for the heavy-duty vehicle fleet.  Findings and recommendations were presented to the Government in October 2019 and are available on the Department's website.<\/p> <p> On the recommendations that pertain to my Department, the EV toll incentive scheme, has been extended to cover alternatively fuelled trucks and buses and work is under way to establish a purchase grant for alternatively fuelled trucks and buses to cover some of the purchase cost differential between a lower-energy vehicle and a fossil-fuelled one.<\/p> <p> We are pressing ahead with decarbonising the public transport fleet.  We committed that from July 2019 no more diesel-only buses would be purchased for the urban public service obligation bus fleets in the national development plan.  Work began in 2018 in the form of low-emission bus trials that examined technologies that include diesel, diesel hybrid, gas and electric buses to inform future purchasing decisions.  These trials concluded in 2019 and the findings have been published on the website.  A framework contract for hybrid buses has been initiated.  To date, nine hybrid buses have been delivered and are in service in Dublin.  I expect 100 buses to be delivered by the end of the year.<\/p> <p> For rail, a ten-year procurement framework for electric and battery-electric train units is being established to greatly expand the fleet and reduce its emissions.  In the medium term, the DART expansion programme will see the largest ever investment in the fleet, with prequalifying started and the electrification of the rail network across the greater Dublin area.<\/p> <p> While we are working towards making public transport cleaner, we are also working on improving services and infrastructure to encourage people to opt for alternatives that are more sustainable than cars with passengers for their journeys.  In 2019, almost &euro;450 million was invested in public and sustainable transport infrastructure, representing an increase of more than &euro;40 million on the 2018 investment.  A further &euro;4 million plus was invested in the smarter travel programme.  Funding in 2019 for rural transport services operated by Local Link totalled &euro;21 million, comprising rural transport programme funding of &euro;15 million and &euro;6 million PSO funding for Local Link regular services.  An additional 24 million public transport passenger journeys were made in 2019 by comparison with 2018 nationally.  Numbers of walking and cycling trips increased in Dublin city centre, accordingly to the NTA's canal cordon count.<\/p> <p> Looking to the future, &euro;8.6 billion has been earmarked for investment in public and sustainable transport measures to 2027.  This funding is to support projects such as MetroLink, BusConnects and the DART expansion programme.  Investment on this scale will transform the public transport network and enable more people to choose sustainable options as their preferred modes of transport.  In fact, the climate action plan has committed us to achieving an additional 500,000 public transport and active travel journeys daily by 2025.<\/p> <p> We must ensure that transport infrastructure can adapt to a changing climate where extreme weather events are becoming the norm.  It is clear that extreme weather can damage critical infrastructure, disrupt business-as-usual transport operations and potentially lead to unsafe travel conditions.  With this in mind, the publication of the various sectoral adaptation plans in October 2019 was a key milestone.  The adaptation plan for transport infrastructure, prepared by my Department, is a further important stage in our adaptation journey.  Identifying the vulnerabilities in the transport system is key, particularly where these interact with other critical systems, such as energy and communications, all of which support our society and economy from day to day.  Our transport agencies and infrastructure owners are proactively considering how to safeguard our infrastructure and operations, and my Department is closely engaging with them to make progress on the implementation of the actions in our plan.<\/p> <p> The next phase of our work is to ensure that resilience building is appropriately considered in new infrastructure investment as we implement Project Ireland 2040.  It will be crucial for us to work to promote a cohesive, all-of-government approach to the investment needed to adapt existing infrastructure networks and to retrofit our most critical assets.  Paradoxically, while the recent Covid-19 crisis has had a severely detrimental effect on our society, economy and communities, it seems to have had a positive effect on our transport emissions.  Early indications show that there was a decrease in transport emissions due to the dramatic fall in road traffic caused by travel limits, the closure of schools and certain businesses, and the move to working from home.  As the country starts to reopen, we must take this opportunity to review our transport habits and, where possible, make transitions towards sustainable travel.<\/p> <p>Public transport capacity will, admittedly, be limited in the short term as social distancing guidelines remain in place.  However, we are already seeing a movement in our cities and towns through the preparation, publication and implementation of Covid-19 mobility programmes to accommodate higher levels of cycling and walking, and to make active travel safer and more convenient.  Working from home may also be a policy embraced by more companies in future and it is likely to take more traffic off our roads.<\/p> <p> My Department will work with the National Transport Authority to ensure the positive changes in travel habits arising from the Covid-19 crisis will be encouraged and accommodated so more sustainable transport patterns can be maintained as we slowly move back to normal daily life.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000105#SSSSS00100","speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1591823100,"counter":410,"content":"<p>I am sharing time.  I will take five minutes, leaving two and a half minutes each for Deputies Cathal Crowe, Christopher O'Sullivan, O'Dea and &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.  I am thankful for the opportunity to say a few words on the matter.  Our transitioning, in terms of lowering of transport emissions, has been an abject failure so far with an increase from 2017 to 2018 of 1.7%.  Transport accounts for 20% of overall emissions and 39% of energy-related emissions.  We are at a crisis stage.<\/p>  <p>  We have been very slow in our procurement of alternative and more sustainable forms of transport.  That we have just nine hybrid buses is an indictment of us all and there is no move to the electrification of our railways.  My figure for electric cars was a bit lower than that of the Minister but I will assume his figure of 15,500 is correct.  In any event, we are dreaming if we think we can get to 1 million such vehicles by 2030, as there are only 100 fast-charging points throughout the entire country.  According to the researchers and the marine and renewable energy research centre at University College, Cork, pollution from cars during this period has decreased by 50%.  This might buy us a little time but in overall terms it will not make any significant contribution to our targets for 2030 and 2050.<\/p>  <p>  The entire transport budget must be repurposed to focus on bringing down our emissions but to do that we must of course acknowledge that the private car is a fact of life for many people throughout rural Ireland.  The public transport options are just not there and we must be conscious of that.  Equally, the kind of electric vehicles that are available and their cost are beyond some people, and I have already highlighted how infrastructure is not in place to support that form of transport.<\/p>  <p>  Through the Covid-19 period France promoted a 600 km pop-up greenway and cycle route but we have done nothing to that effect here.  There is anecdotal evidence that some shops have struggled to get bicycle stock because people have resorted to cycling.  We must press ahead and I hope the new Government, whomsoever it comprises, will refocus and prioritise the major challenges that exist.  The Minister has highlighted challenges in which, I am sad to say, we have not really made any gains over the past five years.  These include encouraging micro-mobility, facilitating it and incentivising it.<\/p>  <p>  In the immediate term, we will have major issues arising from Covid-19.  What plans are in place to use the private sector in this regard?  The Minister is aware of lobbying from the coach operators throughout the country, many of which are facing bankruptcy.  The double-decker buses in Dublin are usually able to take up to 67 people but they can now only take 17.  A four-carriage train can typically take 600 people but it can now take 75 people.  Could we use a little imagination and throw a bone to the private sector to help us in this regard to meet the challenges that social distancing demands?<\/p>  <p>  Before finishing and handing over to my colleagues, I will raise a matter I appreciate is not related to climate change.  In the past couple of days the Minister established a task force on aviation and its members were named today.  The Irish Aviation Authority is absent from the group, which seems most strange, and groups like IBEC, ISME, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland are also absent.<\/p> <p>It would not reflect aviation in Ireland if those organisations did not have a voice on it.<br\/><br\/>We need a pathway for opening aviation.  While no one is suggesting in any way that we should undermine the fragile gains we have earned in the fight against Covid-19, it is an issue that the Minister is expecting a pathway working group to report back on 10 July in terms of laying out a strategy for reopening aviation in Ireland.  I am at pains to point out that nobody wants to put at risk the gains we have made.  We want to ensure that testing, contract tracing and so on is in place but while the rest of Europe will reopen on 8 June, many more on 18 June with Spain, as an outlier, reopening on 1 July, it will be 10 July before the Minister, if he is still <i>in situ<\/i>, or his successor, will be in a position to act on that.

That 600 year old building has withstood sieges, famines, two or three burnouts and many battles but it is now facing its greatest challenge, namely, solvency and financial survival.  The Minister made a whistle-stop visit last year, which was so quick I did not get to meet him.  I was mayor of the county but he was gone in a flash.  We desperately needed to meet him then and we really need his intervention now.  Along with Craggaunowen, Knappogue and King John's Castle, Bunratty Castle is one of four Shannon Heritage sites in the mid-west.  Bunratty Castle and King John's Castle will open on 29 June but the other sites will remain closed for the rest of the year.  The crucial point for Bunratty Castle and King John's Castle is that they will close again on 31 August.  Senior management in the Shannon Group say they cannot afford to keep the sites open throughout the autumn and winter and the domestic tourism market alone will not be enough to keep them afloat and financially buoyant.  That is extremely worrying for the mid-west.  At a time we need to attract people to our region and delve into that domestic tourism market we are closing down our jewel in the crown - strategic sites.  How can we entice people to the mid-west on the one hand but on the other tell them that our key sites are closed and they should look elsewhere?  There will be a domino effect also from these looming closures on the many hotels, bed and breakfast premises and litany of bars and restaurants that depend on the 400,000 annual visitors to Bunratty Castle.<\/p>  <p>  In its end days the aviation task force set up by the Minister has to throw a ball of money at the aviation sector but also at Shannon Heritage as a subsidiary of the Shannon Group.  I was very disappointed when two nominees I proposed the Minister include, Gerry Clarke of the Shannon cabin crew and Allen Flynn, a prominent hotelier in Clare, were excluded from the task force.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister also needs to urgently examine addressing the imbalance in aviation.  Flights continue to leave from and land in Cork and Dublin airports but nothing is happening in Shannon Airport.  We need to return to 24-7 operations to keep the airport afloat, solvent and trading into the new year.  Deputy Willie O'Dea and I met staff in the airport the other day.  It is crucial that whatever trickle of air travel comes in and out of Ireland is shared equally throughout the country.  We cannot have workers laid off in Shannon while people who are far more junior in the hierarchy of staff are kept on elsewhere.<\/p>  <p>  The last point I want to briefly make is on bed and breakfast premises.  Under the business restart rules, they cannot avail of any supports because they are not rated premises.  The Minister will have to look at that.  They are losing out.  They are the poor relations in the equation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000108#VVVVV00200","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speech","time":1591823400,"counter":413,"content":"<p>Like my colleague, Deputy Crowe, I want to use my 150 seconds to make a special plea to the Minister, the Government and the incoming Government to intercede with Aer Lingus to persuade it to reverse the unfair, discriminatory and possibly illegal way it has treated its staff in Shannon Airport for the reasons outlined by my colleague.  The Minister may well say that Aer Lingus is a private company and beyond the remit of the Government but we all know there is significant interdependence between Aer Lingus, as the national carrier, and the Government.  As we speak, the Government is helping Aer Lingus by paying most of its staff wages, under the wage subsidy scheme, and that interdependence will continue.  The Government is not just a disinterested, hapless bystander.  The Government can and should intercede because the treatment of those workers in Shannon Airport has been nothing short of a disgrace.  They are looking to be allowed to return to work.  Shannon Airport, technically, is still in operation.  We saw that today with the emergency landing of a plane bringing in protective equipment.  Shannon Airport was the only airport in the country in which it could land.  The workers are there.<\/p> <p>They should be allowed to work part-time from 22 June to supplement their Covid payments.  That is their demand.  It is quite reasonable and should be acceded to.  I also want to criticise in the strongest possible terms the farcical and myopic decision of the board of Shannon Heritage to close some of the most iconic sites in the west of Ireland for all but six weeks of the foreseeable future.  Tourism in the region will be terminally damaged by this decision if it is allowed to stand.  The decision takes no account of the disastrous multiplier effect on the economy.  As the Minister will know, it is incumbent on the country to reboot the economy quickly in the wake of the Covid crisis.  Tourism is one of our most labour-intensive sectors.  It is probably the largest indigenous employer in the country.  I am sure that the incoming Government will, as part of rebooting the economy, try to promote tourism to the absolute best of its ability.  We do not want the mid-west to be excluded from that process.  I appeal to the Government to intervene in this matter, as it can well do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000108#VVVVV00300","speaker":"1492","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1591824000,"counter":415,"content":"<p>As tourism and transport are intrinsically linked and are both part of the Minister's portfolio, I will touch on both.  The Minister referred to public transport and electric buses in his statement.  Improved public transport will obviously lead to reduced emissions but it could also potentially open up the regions to sustainable tourism.  Such tourism does not exist at the moment.  I will take west Cork, where I am from, as an example.  It is a tourism hotspot but the only way a tourist can get there is by car.  That is not sustainable.  We need an improved public transport network in order that tourists can get there using public transport, thereby leading to a real reduction in emissions.<\/p>  <p>  The ironic thing is that, when one does get there, there are incredible options for low-emission, low-carbon activities.  Kayaking, hill walking and surfing all are zero-carbon activities.  Whale watching is another example.  The coast of west Cork is teeming with humpback whales at the moment.  It is another low-carbon activity but one cannot get to the coast by public transport.  That needs to change.  We need proper investment in public transport.<\/p>  <p>  I will move on to another form of green public transport, namely, greenway trails, to which Deputy MacSharry referred.  There has been a chronic lack of investment in greenway trails in my home county of Cork and particularly in west Cork.  West Cork is absolutely ripe for investment in greenway trails.  They are more than just a tourism attraction; they are actually a valid form of sustainable public transport.  The route from Bandon to Innishannon, along the beautiful banks of the River Bandon, would be perfect for a greenway trail, as would the route from Clonakilty to Inchydoney.  Inchydoney has one of the most iconic beaches in Europe and yet the only safe way to get there is by car.  That needs to change.  We need greenway trails.  The same could be said for the route from Baltimore, Skibbereen and Clonakilty to Courtmacsherry.<\/p>  <p>  I will finish on one very important point.  If we do not look after our tourism industry, there will not be a tourism industry post pandemic.  We need supports.  I recently held Zoom calls with the chambers of commerce and chambers of tourism in Clonakilty, Skibbereen, Bandon and Kinsale.  They are looking for clarity and for support.  I spoke to one hotelier who expects the extra costs for staffing, PPE and sanitiser to total approximately &euro;12,500 per month.  We need a proper system to support these business people in order that they can survive this pandemic and get up and running again.  More than anything else, they need clarity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000109#WWWWW00200","speaker":"1545"},{"type":"speech","time":1591824000,"counter":416,"content":"<p>I will try to get in as much as I can in the two minutes and seven seconds remaining.  Last Friday, the Government made a big announcement about opening up.  It was bringing things forward.  Amazingly, there was no mention of travel to the islands.  Singularly, it is still scheduled for 8 August.  Families have members living on the mainland want to go home but who do not have permission to do so.  Will the Minister tell us when the islands will be open to people to go back to their families, to those who own holiday homes on the islands to go to them and to tourists to visit?  The islanders want to find out.  It is terribly remiss of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport not to tell us.<\/p>  <p>  I join in the call with regard to tourist attractions.  We are told that people will be taking staycations.  There is a big danger that it will not be economic for Kylemore Abbey, for example, to open this year.<\/p> <p>The Minister was there recently.  It is a big opening.  There are massive overheads in running the place.  Due to the visitor numbers it will not get this year, it will be very uneconomic to open for small numbers.<br\/><br\/>I wish to discuss the transition.  People often talk about electricity when talking about transition.  Electricity is fine but the problem is that it requires massive infrastructure.  There is a simpler answer.  It is indirect electricity using surplus energy - surplus renewable energy where, with electricity, one is using whatever is on the grid at the time, and that is hydrogen.  I understand that a company on this island, in Ballymena, is examining producing hydrogen buses.  Another company in the same part of the world is examining producing the hydrogen.  Have there been talks about considering an all-Ireland approach to replacing all public bus vehicles on the island with hydrogen buses produced from renewable electricity?  As the Minister knows, one takes the H<sub>2<\/sub>, adds the O and one gets H<sub>2<\/sub>O, which is water, therefore one does not get any carbon emissions.  It is a huge opportunity for this island to act together.  That issue must be examined.<br\/><br\/>Unfortunately, I have gone 12 seconds over my time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000109#WWWWW00300","speaker":"1575","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1591824600,"counter":418,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputies Wynne and &Oacute; Broin.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the opportunity to address this important issue.  Transport will be central to our moving towards a low-carbon economy.  Over the past 30 years, the transport sector showed the greatest overall increase in greenhouse gas emissions at 137%, with road transport increasing by 143%.  In 2018, transport was responsible for 20% of Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions.  Those figures give a sense of the challenge.  They are also, in large part, an indictment of the failure of successive Governments to address this challenge properly.  It is clear that we cannot afford to continue down the path of emissions increasing year on year.  We must take people out of cars by providing alternatives that make sense.  The Minister's annual transition document highlights this on page 33, which states that the provision of meaningful alternatives to the private car is central to decarbonising the transport sector.  This is true, but it does not mirror the actions of this Government.  We must invest in public and active transport.<\/p>  <p>  We have a problem with car dependency across the board.  It is compounded by uneven regional development.  People who live on the east coast, in Dublin and in the commuter belt areas are acutely aware of the increase in road transport.  People in my constituency of Meath East most certainly are.  This is due to chronic underfunding of public transport, resulting in it being undesirable.  It takes too long.  One is sitting in traffic at Blanchardstown, The Halfway House or Glasnevin and it costs too much.  We need high speed, high volume bus routes running on quality bus corridors.<\/p>  <p>  We must also invest in rail.  Despite being ideally located next to the capital, County Meath does not have a rail line serving the vast majority of the county.  Navan is the highest populated town in Ireland that is not served by train.  Large urban centres such as Ashbourne, Ratoath and Dunshaughlin would benefit greatly from such a service, as would towns such as Kells and Trim.  Without it, thousands of commuters are forced to spend hours in traffic getting to and from work.  They prefer the car because it is more bearable.  Sinn F&eacute;in has consistently highlighted the urgent need for a rail line from Dublin to Navan, which would take thousands of cars off the road each day and bring massive benefits to commuters who could spend less time in traffic and more time with family and friends.  Will the Minister give an update on the Navan rail line and its potential to contribute to a low-carbon economy?  When will the review of this project be completed and when will the project be funded?  This must be part of an ambitious and transformative plan for public transport that serves to reorientate the transport system on the island of Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  We must improve electric car infrastructure and supports.  We need to have more people out of cars but we also must recognise that for many people a car will remain a necessity.  This is particularly true in rural Ireland, but is not unique to it.  Electric cars remain prohibitively expensive for most and the necessary infrastructure such as fast charging points is simply not in place.<\/p> <p>Has the Government any plans to make electric cars a more affordable and realistic option for people?<\/p> <p> On the issue of rural transport, large areas of my constituency currently rely on the Local Link transport scheme.  It is known as Flexibus in counties Meath, Louth and Fingal.  Flexibus provides a great bus service to people in rural areas who live off the main transport routes, young people who have no access to public transport and people with disabilities who need accessible transport.  It is a vital service that provides connectivity for large parts of rural Meath and for some of our most vulnerable citizens, the old, the sick, and people with disabilities.  Unfortunately, despite increasing demand and huge unmet need, its budget has remained static.  It is now faced with a funding shortfall which is putting services in jeopardy.  Meath Deputies met the NTA on this issue last Friday.  Will the Minister engage with the authority on this to ensure funding is made available to secure the future of this environmentally friendly public transport option?<\/p> <p> On the issue of private bus operators and taking people out of their cars, the Minister will be aware of the challenges now facing private bus operators who also provide crucial transport connectivity for citizens, including many school transport services.  Many of those bus operators have been left to fend for themselves with the Government gambling on whether they can make it through the current crisis.  If these services are not protected, it will leave a significant gap in our transport services, forcing people into cars.  This is another example of how Government policy states one aim but actually does the opposite.  Will the Minister intervene personally on the issue of private bus operators to ensure we have a healthy bus and coach sector post Covid?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061000110#XXXXX00200","speaker":"1507","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1591824900,"counter":420,"content":"<p>The Deputy is quite right about transport being a great challenge and the need to get people out of their cars.

There is a great deal more still to be done, however.  There is terrible congestion but to say we failed completely is somewhat unfair.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy has seen the targets for EVs.  This is an anti-pollution driven initiative and the targets are very ambitious.  Our intention is to hit them.  We have clearly stated we want to have 936,000 EVs on the road by 2030.  This is particularly to help the environment.  The Deputy claims an electric vehicle is out of the reach of some people's costs.  He is correct and it is difficult.  We have given out grants of &euro;5,000 and introduced other generous incentives for EVs, of which the Deputy should be aware, which include grants for chargers at home and lower motor tax.

With respect to the response of the Minister's Department and the taxi regulator to the taxi industry, most Deputies hear much concern expressed by taxi drivers about the lack of any active support, especially for those who may be able to return to work at a later stage in the Government's exit strategy but will not be able to work full time because of a lack of available opportunities.  Will the Minister outline what additional support he is considering to provide to taxi drivers to ensure the sustainability of their industry?<\/p>  <p>  A small but significant question that has arisen in recent days is the issue of protective screens separating taxi drivers from their passengers, and a requirement that they have such screens installed.  The NTA and the taxi regulator are considering that these screens have to be installed by certified installers.  Will the Minister confirm if that is the case and, if so, how will such a system operate?<\/p>  <p>  All previous speakers have spoken about the importance of public transport.  One of the most important reforms in the city of Dublin is BusConnects.

There is a much more ambitious project, which would take a rail line not only through Navan but on to Derry city, opening the entire north west, that may be more financially viable under the metrics the Government operates, and be of significant service to the people in that region.  Will the Minister update us on the electrification of additional rail lines, particularly, for example, through my own constituency, in Clondalkin and Lucan, and on to Hazelhatch and Kildare?

Deputy Wynne said that four weeks is too long.  Most task forces set up by my predecessors have taken approximately four years.  This one is urgent.  We have a group of 14 people who are the main stakeholders and we will always get people complaining, as Deputy MacSharry did, about being left out.  That always happens but we have people representing almost every stakeholder on the task force.  I appointed this task force.  It has recommended that it takes four weeks and we think that is a quick turnover for a conclusive and extremely in-depth plan.  It is completely up to the task force if it wants to publish an early report at two weeks.  That is fine by me.  It might even be two weeks.  One never knows.

Last week I was in here and everybody from the Deputy's region asked whether I would put a representative of Shannon on the task force.  I have done that.  I put the chief executive, Mary Considine, on the task force specifically to enable her to voice those difficulties, which I fully acknowledge are there for Shannon.  That is why she is there, and she is going to do that on the Deputy behalf and on behalf of everybody else as well.  There is also an ICTU representative, Patricia King, on that task force, which was announced earlier.  She will undoubtedly represent the airport's workforce as well.  That is quite a representation that they will have.  That is a good start.

I recall seven or eight years ago at a public meeting, confiding in the public that within ten years we would be looking seriously at electric cars for the future.  I was greeted with howls of derision, as well as scepticism of an incisive order and I am glad that we have at least progressed in that area.  While the targets are, I agree, ambitious, they are attainable.  All that is needed is a commitment and that has been made.  It will be realised and it will make a tangible, visible contribution to emissions reduction, to which everyone can make a contribution.  The public wants to be able to contribute in making that reduction themselves, and I think they will do it.<\/p>  <p>  The secret, as I stated during this morning's debate, is of where the electricity comes from and how it is generated.  As we move toward renewable energies. that is going to become obvious.  It is not going to be as easy to depend on mid-Atlantic generated wind energy because the structures are not there at the present time, and they certainly will not be within the next five year, to deliver on that particular project.  It would be a serious error on our part if we were to presume that in five years, we could rely on electricity coming from there.  The Arklow Bank is different.<\/p>  <p>  I am of the generation that started out walking to school and walking longer distances as well.  It was not such great fun at all, especially in inclement weather.  I have my doubts about how popular it is likely to become in the future either.  In addition, there are dangers to children walking to school in winter or summer, which I do not propose to got into now, that we have to bear them in mind.  There will be a need for transport, of one kind or another.  As we develop the technology, regarding the motor industry in particular, the biggest contribution we can make in respect of domestic travel is the electric car.  That is on our doorstep and we should avail of it and support it.<\/p>  <p>  The electrification of the rail system is something we all look forward to.  Naturally, in my own constituency there is the Maynooth line, which extends to Kilcock and beyond and electrification will be hugely important.  That is again dependent on emissions-free electricity.   It has a major role to play that everybody can contribute to and can point out themselves.  They do not have to be told about it.
