Currently just 300MW of electricity supply across the existing north south interconnector is permitted so as to ensure that electricity is securely provided to customers. The new north south interconnector will facilitate substantial increases in capacity transfers, thereby facilitating a more effective single electricity market.<\/p>  <p>  Interconnection helps ensure that only the most efficient and low carbon generation is brought onto the grid. The interconnector also substantially increases the capacity to connect up to an estimated 900 MW of renewables to our grid. Currently 30% of our electricity comes from renewables but as part of our strategy to meet our climate commitments we need to almost double that proportion. <\/p>  <p>  The North South interconnector has been subject to economic analysis and the benefit to cost ratio is very positive. The interconnector is expected to bring savings in the single electricity market of &euro;20 million per annum from its inception, rising to between &euro;40 million and &euro;60 million per annum by 2030. Much of these savings result from reductions in network constraints that will accrue from its delivery.<\/p>  <p>  The project has received planning consent in Ireland and Northern Ireland, however these decisions are the subject of ongoing legal challenges in both jurisdictions. The development of the interconnector including associated procurement activities are operational matters for EirGrid and ESB Networks.<\/p>  <p>  The Generation Capacity Statement (GCS) 2018 covers both Northern Ireland and Ireland, and is produced jointly between the System Operator for Northern Ireland and EirGrid. This is in line with their regulatory requirements to publish forecast information about the power system including an assessment of the balance between supply and demand. The Generation Capacity Statement is updated annually to ensure adequate capacity is available in the market on an all-island basis and to plan accordingly.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised that the increase in generation capacity as shown in the Generation Capacity Statement published by the Transmission System Operators does not impact on the need for the interconnector. It is also important to note that the increase in Northern Ireland generation capacity shown is likely to be temporary in nature. The main increase is from the assumed continued availability of the coal fired Kilroot generating units and two of the older less efficient Ballylumford units. The long term continued operation of these generators is not sustainable in the context of decarbonisation of the industry. <\/p>  <p>  In fact since the Generation Capacity Statement was published, the Utility Regulator for Northern Ireland granted derogation requests on 9 November to AES for the two Ballylumford units, totalling 250MW, from the requirement to give three years notice of closure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800068#WRC02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":97,"content":"<p>Question No. 89 answered with Question No. 77.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Energy Efficiency","counter":98,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800068#WRC03000"},{"type":"question","counter":99,"qnumday":90,"qnumall":"[53158\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800068#WRC03100","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"his views on the role that increasing energy efficiency in public, private and commercial buildings can play in reaching Ireland's climate commitments; the steps he will take to increase energy efficiency; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1237","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":100,"content":"<p>Energy efficiency has a crucial role to play in Ireland meeting its national and international climate commitments.

The new north south interconnector will facilitate substantial increases in capacity transfers, thereby facilitating a more effective single electricity market.<\/p>  <p>  Interconnection helps ensure that only the most efficient and low carbon generation is brought onto the grid. The interconnector also substantially increases the capacity to connect up to an estimated 900 MW of renewables to our grid. Currently 30% of our electricity comes from renewables but as part of our strategy to meet our climate commitments we need to almost double that proportion. <\/p>  <p>  The North South interconnector has been subject to economic analysis and the benefit to cost ratio is very positive. The interconnector is expected to bring savings in the single electricity market of &euro;20 million per annum from its inception, rising to between &euro;40 million and &euro;60 million per annum by 2030. Much of these savings result from reductions in network constraints that will accrue from its delivery.<\/p>  <p>  The project has received planning consent in Ireland and Northern Ireland, however these decisions are the subject of ongoing legal challenges in both jurisdictions. The development of the interconnector including associated procurement activities are operational matters for EirGrid and ESB Networks.<\/p>  <p>  The Generation Capacity Statement (GCS) 2018 covers both Northern Ireland and Ireland, and is produced jointly between the System Operator for Northern Ireland and EirGrid. This is in line with their regulatory requirements to publish forecast information about the power system including an assessment of the balance between supply and demand. The Generation Capacity Statement is updated annually to ensure adequate capacity is available in the market on an all-island basis and to plan accordingly.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised that the increase in generation capacity as shown in the Generation Capacity Statement published by the Transmission System Operators does not impact on the need for the interconnector. It is also important to note that the increase in Northern Ireland generation capacity shown is likely to be temporary in nature. The main increase is from the assumed continued availability of the coal fired Kilroot generating units and two of the older less efficient Ballylumford units. The long term continued operation of these generators is not sustainable in the context of decarbonisation of the industry. <\/p>  <p>  In fact since the Generation Capacity Statement was published, the Utility Regulator for Northern Ireland granted derogation requests on 9 November to AES for the two Ballylumford units, totalling 250MW, from the requirement to give three years notice of closure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800068#WRC08400","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Broadband Service Provision","counter":153,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800068#WRC08500"},{"type":"question","counter":154,"qnumday":112,"qnumall":"[53174\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800068#WRC08600","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the progress to date in completing the contract in locations (details supplied) with regard to the roll-out of 300,000 fibre connections by Eir; the number of homes that could not be connected in the area due to issues related to ducting and-or infrastructure; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1284","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":155,"content":"<p>In April 2017 my Department published an updated High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie.

The UK would no longer be subject to the corpus of EU law, known as the EU <i>acquis<\/i>. This would have profound political, economic, trade and legal implications for the UK, for Ireland and for the EU and other Member States.  <\/p><p>Extensive and detailed Brexit preparedness and contingency work is being taken forward, co-ordinated by officials in my Department, working closely with the Department of the Taoiseach, across all Government Departments and Agencies.  <\/p><p>Despite the European Union and the United Kingdom having settled a Withdrawal Agreement, the political situation in London is uncertain. We still hope for an agreed Brexit based on this deal, which was agreed by the UK Cabinet, and by 27 member states at the European Council. It includes compromises from both sides. However, we cannot take the UK ratifying it as a given and therefore it is only prudent for the Government to prepare for all scenarios. <\/p><p>Following an update last week on planning for Brexit, the Cabinet mandated that while work on Brexit preparedness for the central case scenario should continue, greater immediate priority must now be given to preparations for a disorderly Brexit and all Government departments should urgently take forward work on that basis.<\/p><p>As I stated in the D&aacute;il last week, on Thursday we will make public additional information on this planning.  This will be part of an ongoing process of public updates to take place over the coming months. <\/p><p>The Government has already taken a number of key decisions, based on a central case scenario, on measures to be put in place for the necessary checks and controls for trade on an East-West basis.  Many of these measures are required in the range of Brexit scenarios but will need to take place at an accelerated pace to prepare for a &lsquo;no deal&rsquo; Brexit. The recruitment of additional staff for customs and SPS controls, as well as ICT and infrastructure measures at our ports and airports has been sanctioned and implementation is under way.  Various contingency measures, such as the rapid recruitment and redeployment of staff, and the use of temporary facilities, are under active planning for a disorderly Brexit scenario.<\/p><p>Budget 2019 set aside &euro;115 million for a number of specific expenditure measures aimed at making Ireland Brexit ready. This includes &euro;25 million for essential customs\/SPS requirements including the recruitment of necessary staff in 2019, on the basis of the central case scenario. <\/p><p>Given that in a number of key areas for Ireland, the appropriate response and mitigation will be at the EU level, we are continuing to engage actively with the Commission on areas of priority for Ireland, including through a series of expert level meetings with the Commission and the EU27 on key issues on a weekly basis until mid-January.  <\/p><p>The EU Commission acknowledged the particular impact of Brexit on Ireland and Irish business in its contingency planning communication of 13 November. This communication also outlined some of the EU&rsquo;s plans for a no deal scenario, including in the areas of financial services, citizens&rsquo; rights, air transport, road transport, and customs\/SPS requirements. This has further informed our own domestic planning.<\/p><p>Ireland is also working closely with the EU and fellow Member States to discuss and progress areas of key concern, including facilitating the use of the UK as a landbridge post Brexit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800069#WRD03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Registration of Births","counter":192,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800069#WRD03700"},{"type":"question","counter":193,"qnumday":123,"qnumall":"[52768\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800069#WRD03800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the processing times for foreign birth registrations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":194,"content":"<p>Foreign Birth Registration, by its nature, can be a detailed and complex process often involving certificates covering three generations and several jurisdictions.

I have therefore consulted with the Central Bank on the matters raised by the Deputy.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank has informed me that, as at 6 December 2018, 175 life insurance undertakings and 876 non-life insurance undertakings are notified to operate in Ireland on freedom of services basis.  The Solvency II Directive, which entered into force 1 January 2016 sets out new, more comprehensive EU-wide requirements on capital adequacy and risk management for insurers with the key aim of increasing policyholder protection.  All insurance undertakings across the European Union must comply with the requirements of the Directive (with certain limited exceptions).  However, Solvency II does not apply to intermediaries or managing general agents who are authorised and supervised under the European Communities (Insurance Distribution) Regulations 2018, which transpose the Insurance Distribution Directive. <\/p>  <p>  Where an insurer, or insurance intermediary authorised in another Member State operates in Ireland through a branch or under the freedom to provide services (\"passporting\"), prudential supervision is the responsibility of the supervisory authority of the Member State which authorised the insurer. However, where such an insurer or insurance intermediary offers its products to Irish consumers, it is subject to the consumer protection regulatory framework in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the question of the number of insurers operating on a freedom of service basis  who have at one time not met their solvency requirements, the Central Bank  has indicated that in accordance with Section 33AK of the Central Bank Acts, it is  prohibited from sharing information about individual regulatory relationships.  Therefore I am not in a position to provide this information to the Deputy. However, the Central Bank has advised me that they actively engage with EIOPA and other national supervisory authorities in accordance with the Solvency II Directive. <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, in 2017, EIOPA (the pan-European authority with responsibility for oversight of the insurance industry) developed a cross-border platform of cooperation between National Supervisory Authorities. This platform provides all National Supervisory Authorities with the opportunity to discuss concerns in relation to specific undertakings, local markets and share general market developments. The Central Bank has advised me that they participate fully in the platform with other relevant supervisory authorities. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800070#WRE01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":217,"qnumday":136,"qnumall":"[52748\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800070#WRE01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the member states in the EU and EEA that have insurance compensation mechanisms in place to pay claims in cases in which an insurance company fails; if those compensation mechanisms apply to claimants in other jurisdictions in which the failed company is operating under freedom of services; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":218,"content":"<p>At the outset, the Deputy should note that currently there is no European harmonised framework of insurance guarantee schemes (IGSs) for the insurance sector. Member States have therefore adopted their own approach to such policyholder protection schemes, which show noticeable differences in design features, such as scope, coverage and funding. These differences in national IGSs, together with differences in insolvency laws, have led to a situation where policyholders across or even within the same Member States are not protected to the same extent in liquidation.<\/p>  <p>  I understand, based on a report published from various sources including the European Insurance and Occupational Pension Authority (EIOPA) and the EU Commission, that there are, 26 IGSs (or similar schemes)  established in 20 Member States: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Malta, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain and the United Kingdom. <\/p>  <p>  IGSs do not exist in the following EEA Member States: Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Slovakia, Slovenia and Sweden. <\/p>  <p>  Based on the available information, there are eight IGSs operating on the basis of the host-country principle, eight operating on the home-country principle and eight schemes with a combination of both. The remaining two schemes are undefined.<\/p>  <p>  The host-country principle applies when the domestic IGS covers policies or risks in that state only; in other words those policies in relation to risks in the state in question issued by domestically authorised insurers and those sold by insurers authorised in another member state who are &lsquo;passporting in&rsquo; to that state under freedom of establishment (branches) or freedom of services (FoS).  The Irish Insurance Compensation Fund (ICF) is a host-based scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The home-country principle applies when the domestic IGS covers policies issued by domestically authorised insurers sold in that state or in other member states via branches or FoS. The home-country principle does not require incoming insurers which operate via branches or FoS (inward FoS) to participate in the IGS. <\/p>  <p>  EIOPA are currently working to develop proposals for harmonisation of IGSs across the EU\/EEA. Officials from my Department and the Central Bank are working closely with their European-level counterparts on the issue.<\/p>  <p>  A final point for the Deputy to note is that in its review of the Motor Insurance Directive, the European Commission has proposed requiring all Member States to establish an IGS to cover the cost of insolvent motor insurers, including on a cross-border basis. We support this measure and are actively participating to ensure that the legislation is strong and in the best interests of Ireland, given the large insurance industry here and our previous experience with insolvent inward-FoS insurers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800070#WRE01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":220,"qnumday":137,"qnumall":"[52749\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800070#WRE01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of unrated insurance companies operating here; the number of those that are regulated here prudentially; the number regulated here under freedom of services; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":221,"content":"<p>At the outset I would like to say that as Minister for Finance, I am responsible for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation, and have no role in the day to day supervision of insurance companies.

I wish to advise the Deputy that no discussions concerning these guidelines took place between me and the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government or between the Department of Finance and outside agencies, either generally or in relation to the price of land associated with NAMA. <\/p><p>Furthermore, NAMA did not have any involvement in the drafting of the new planning guidelines for building heights, nor was it consulted by DHPLG prior to their publication. <\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that Section 9 of the NAMA Act provides that NAMA is independent in the performance of its functions and that I, as Minister, have no role in relation to its commercial operations or decisions. I wish to advise that I did not discuss the impact of the removal of height restrictions with NAMA. Nor did I discuss with NAMA any plans that its debtors and receivers may have had to dispose of particular assets. Under State aid rules, NAMA&rsquo;s debtors and receivers operate in the same manner as, and in competition with, other commercial market participants and therefore there is no question of NAMA debtors and receivers being provided with advance notice of proposed Government initiatives when such information is not available to the market in general. <\/p><p>I am advised that NAMA did not have any involvement in the drafting of the new planning guidelines for building heights, nor was it consulted by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government (DHPLG) prior to their publication. NAMA became aware of the draft guidelines in August 2018 when they were published by the DHPLG for public consultation. The finalised guidelines were published in December 2018. I wish to point out to the Deputy that decisions in relation to the disposal of properties are a matter for NAMA&rsquo;s debtors and receivers, acting with the approval of NAMA as secured lender. I am advised that the timing of such disposals is influenced by a range of factors, including current and prospective market conditions, the level of demand for the asset types involved and the availability and cost of finance to potential purchasers. <\/p><p>It is my understanding that the new planning guidelines do not imply that objectives within SDZ Planning Schemes will necessarily change nor do they imply a blanket lifting of height guidance.

This is based on the central case scenario of an orderly withdrawal, to include a transition period to the end of 2020, followed by an agreed future trading relationship between the EU and the UK. I am advised that Revenue&rsquo;s preparations are focused on facilitating trade on an East West basis. <\/p>  <p>  The Government approved the phased recruitment of 600 Revenue staff in September this year. Budget 2019 provides Revenue with an additional &euro;10 million pay provision for 270 staff for Brexit, for facilitation of trade and support of businesses and trade by Revenue in processing of applications for a range of simplifications available under the Union Customs Code (UCC) that will assist businesses in mitigating some of the challenges arising from Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  Since September 2018, Revenue has assigned 43 additional trade facilitation staff and plans are well advanced to have a total of 200 additional staff, across a number of functions, trained and in place by 29 March 2019. These posts are being filled from open, interdepartmental and internal Revenue competitions.  An open recruitment campaign for trade facilitation roles was undertaken by the Public Appointments Service (PAS) and attracted more than 3,000 applications.  This competition was advertised on the PAS website (publicjobs.ie) and also on the Revenue website to ensure that recruitment is from the widest pool of available talent and experience.  Revenue also held 6 internal competitions for existing Revenue staff at Higher Executive Officer, Executive Officer and Clerical Officer level for assignment to trade facilitation roles in Dublin Port and Airport and Rosslare.  Candidates were selected using methodologies such as on-line testing and competitive interviews to facilitate the identification of the best people for the posts. Recruitment for appointment to positions in Revenue is subject to the provisions of the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act, 2004 and is regulated by the Commission for Public Service Appointments (CPSA) and subject to the CPSA Codes of Practice.     <\/p>  <p>  The additional 200 staff, the majority of whom will be working on a 24 hour\/7-day week basis, will bring the total number of fully operational trade facilitation staff to over 300 by the end of the first quarter of 2019 as there were already c.100 in place at September 2018.<\/p>  <p>  It is planned to recruit the balance of 70 staff provided for in Budget 2019 during the period March 2019 to December 2019.  Revenue expect, in the context of the central case scenario, that they will require the additional 330 staff to be in position by the end of the transition period in 2020, and are engaged with the PAS in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  In line with the &lsquo;whole of Government&rsquo; approach to Brexit, we continue to prepare for the UK&rsquo;s exit.

It has been working on Brexit related issues since before the UK Referendum.

The Department of Finance and the Central Bank are continuing to engage with Euronext (formally the Irish Stock Exchange) and other relevant stakeholders including European Authorities to ensure that a settlement solution, that minimises disruption to the Irish market post-Brexit, is found.

Indeed, the Department of Finance has been to the forefront in assessing the impact of Brexit on our economy &ndash; commissioning joint research with the ESRI on the issue, including before the actual referendum. What is clear from this research, and other studies, is that the harder the Brexit the more negative the impact for Ireland.<\/p><p>My Department&rsquo;s forecasts underlying Budget 2019, published in October, incorporate, as a central scenario, that the UK will make an &lsquo;orderly&rsquo; exit from the EU. This central scenario involves a transition period being agreed that extends or replicates existing frameworks until end-2020, i.e. the UK is assumed to remain in the single market and customs union during this period. From 2021 onwards, the baseline forecasts assume that the EU and UK will conclude a free trade agreement. <\/p><p>My Department has also recognised the risk of a disorderly Brexit and has, therefore, set out an assessment of the potential economic impact of Brexit of the central (&lsquo;orderly&rsquo; exit) scenario and an alternative (&lsquo;disorderly&rsquo;) exit scenario. <\/p><p>i.  Central scenario = Orderly exit: transition period followed by a Free Trade Area (FTA);<\/p><p>ii.  Disorderly exit = Exit of the UK without a transition period or trade agreement -WTO arrangements apply with immediate effect. <\/p><p>The results of this analysis are outlined in the Budget 2019 Economic and Fiscal Outlook. The analysis shows that over the medium-term (i.e. after five years), under the central scenario, which is incorporated in the forecasts, the level of Irish output would be close to 2 per cent below what would be the case under a no Brexit situation. Under the &lsquo;disorderly&rsquo; exit scenario, the level of Irish output would be around 3&frac14; per cent lower than under the no Brexit situation.<\/p><p>This analysis explicitly recognises that these estimates may not capture the full impact and that they are more a minimum than a maximum. It also highlights that in the event of a disorderly Brexit, there would be further negative material impacts on Ireland, particularly in the early years, arising from issues such as regulatory divergence along with significant market volatility, further sterling depreciation, and disruption to trade with the UK. Further, these impacts would be have a disproportionate impact on Ireland relative to the rest of the EU.<\/p><p>Analysis carried out jointly by my Department and the ESRI has shown that, over the long-term (i.e. after ten years) in a no-deal Brexit scenario, the level of output would be almost 4 per cent below what it otherwise would have been in a no-Brexit scenario. The level of employment in Ireland would be 2 per cent lower, with the unemployment rate nearly 2 percentage points higher.<\/p><p>I note that a number of assessments of the economic impact of Brexit on the UK were published last<b><\/b>month. Overall, these assessments find that Brexit will have a more negative economic impact on the UK than previously assumed. It is not unreasonable to expect a commensurate impact on Ireland. In this context, my Department is currently updating its analysis of the impact of Brexit on Ireland. <\/p><p>While it is still Government&rsquo;s view that a &lsquo;no deal&rsquo; outcome remains unlikely, we are planning for all scenarios. It is imperative to boost the resilience of the Irish economy in order to minimise, in so far as is possible, any future disruption. Since the UK referendum in 2016, all of our national Budgets have been framed to prepare for the challenge of Brexit. The economic and fiscal policies, which we have pursued, mean that the economy is now in a better position to weather the impacts of Brexit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800070#WRE04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"VAT Exemptions","counter":253,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800070#WRE05000"},{"type":"question","counter":254,"qnumday":150,"qnumall":"[53122\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800070#WRE05100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if sports clubs that are registered charities can benefit from the VAT compensation scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":255,"content":"<p>The VAT Compensation Scheme for Charities has effect from 1 January 2018 but will be paid one year in arrears - in 2019, charities will be able to submit claims in respect of the VAT paid in 2018.

The Irish banks have made huge progress in this regard since the height of the crisis with NPLs at the banks in which the State has a shareholding reducing by 70% from &euro;54bn to &euro;16bn at end-June 2018. A major contributor to this has been the almost 136,000 mortgage restructures that have been put in place. <\/p><p>Despite this progress, the NPL ratios at the Irish banks remain at an elevated level and are well above the European average of around 4%. PTSB is a particular outlier and had a ratio of 16% even after the bank&rsquo;s loan sale &ndash; Project Glas &ndash; which was announced in July. Project Glenbeigh &ndash; PTSB&rsquo;s second NPL transaction of 2018 announced on 29<sup>th<\/sup>November, will achieve a further significant reduction in the bank&rsquo;s NPL ratio to below 10%. <\/p><p>It is important to reiterate that the protections in place for all borrowers before a sale, either by way of securitisation or otherwise, remain unchanged. Start Mortgages, who purchased the Glas portfolio in July, and Pepper, who now hold legal title to the Glenbeigh mortgages and who will act as servicer and administrator of the mortgages, are both regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland. When dealing with borrowers, these firms are required to comply with the Consumer Protection Code and the Code of Conduct for Mortgage Arrears. Furthermore, it has been confirmed in the case of this latest transaction that the terms of an agreed restructure will continue to be honoured.<\/p><p>In addition, earlier this year I asked the Central Bank to carry out a review of the CCMA to ensure it remains as effective as possible. The result of this review was published in October and it is encouraging to note that the key findings included confirmation that for borrowers who engaged with the process, the CCMA is working effectively as it is intended in the context of the sale of loans by regulated lenders.<\/p><p>In relation to the number of mortgage holders affected, PTSB confirmed in its press release that the mortgages involved were linked to 6,272 borrowing relationships where a borrowing relationship can be a single borrower or two or more joint borrowers. The following link to the bank's press release is included for the benefit of the Deputy:<\/p><p>. <\/p><p>Finally, I wish to highlight that I cannot stop loan sales, even by the banks in which the State has a shareholding. These decisions are the responsibility of the Board and management of the banks which must be run on an independent and commercial basis. The banks&rsquo; independence is protected by Relationship Frameworks, which are legally binding documents that I cannot change unilaterally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800071#WRF02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Meetings","counter":291,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800071#WRF03100"},{"type":"question","counter":292,"qnumday":163,"qnumall":"[53410\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800071#WRF03200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will report on his meeting with members of the Administration of the United States of America.","asker":"1253","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":293,"content":"<p>I travelled to the United States on Monday 10 December for a programme of high level meetings in Washington DC.

They offer a supportive learning environment to students who are unable to access the curriculum in a mainstream class, even with support, for most or all of their school day. <\/p>  <p>  Students enrolled in special classes should be included in mainstream classes to the greatest extent possible, in line with their abilities.<\/p>  <p>  Special school placements are provided for other students with ASD and very complex special needs who wouldn&rsquo;t manage in a mainstream school even for part of the week.

To this end the Department and the NCSE have convened a working group to put in place a new working protocol to ensure that there is effective pro-active planning and timely delivery of specialist educational places for students in special classes and special schools.<\/p>  <p>  The focus of the working group is to guide the development of necessary placements in schools in the short, medium and longer terms to meet the anticipated needs of pupils and to ensure that any necessary school building or refurbishment and school transport considerations are resolved as early as possible so that placement options can be accessed where and when they are needed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800072#WRG04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs","counter":362,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800072#WRG04800"},{"type":"question","counter":363,"qnumday":189,"qnumall":"[52764\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800072#WRG04900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if a review pertaining to the reduction in paperwork requirements for special schools, particularly the personal pupil plans when requesting one extra SNA, will be implemented.

The selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. Under section 15 (2) (d) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally obliged to publish its enrolment policy.<\/p><p>Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process where a board of management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the Board refuses enrolment to a student.

Variables used in the compilation of the HP Index include those related to demographic growth, dependency ratios, single parent rates, education levels, overcrowding, social class, occupation and unemployment rates. This data is combined with pupil data, anonymised and aggregated to small area, to provide information on the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in the pupil cohort of individual schools.

As the deputy is no doubt aware broadband capacity can vary across geographical locations and is dependent on local infrastructure which can impact on the service that can be provided in individual schools.  <\/p>  <p>  The school referred to by the Deputy is currently in contract with an existing service provider, however, I have asked my officials to review the service and raise this matter with the existing service provider. If the service provided cannot be upgraded under the existing contractual arrangements, my officials will include this school in the next available mini competition. Through this process, and subject to current contractual arrangements,  it may be possible to provide improved service to this school, depending on the locally available infrastructure.<\/p>  <p>  The Department reviews the availability and quality of services and upgrades schools when the opportunity arises, in line with contractual and budgetary requirements. Currently, over 1,400 primary schools have been awarded download speeds of 30 Mbps or greater (the baseline download speed required under the National Broadband Plan). This represents more than one third of all primary schools which is a significant improvement in recent years, given that less than 100 primary schools were on those speeds in 2012. Further schools are likely to be upgraded to those speeds in 2018, through EIR's 300K Rural Deployment commitment. <\/p>  <p>  All post-primary schools and some special schools are now on high speed broadband through the Department's High Speed Broadband Programme, managed by HEAnet.<\/p>  <p>  The need to improve broadband connectivity to primary schools is recognised in the Digital Strategy for Schools 2015-2020, and access to high speed broadband is one of the indicators identified in the Digital Strategy Action Plan. An interdepartmental working group has been established to determine how best to address broadband connectivity to primary schools in collaboration with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, in the context of the National Broadband Plan and the Intervention Strategy, and proposed industry provision. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800073#WRH03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Apprenticeship Data","counter":408,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800073#WRH03500"},{"type":"question","counter":409,"qnumday":204,"qnumall":"[52921\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800073#WRH03600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of new registrations on craft based apprenticeships to date in 2018; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1327","askee":"1290"},{"type":"question","counter":410,"qnumday":205,"qnumall":"[52922\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800073#WRH03700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of new apprenticeship programmes introduced to date in 2018; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1327","askee":"1290"},{"type":"question","counter":411,"qnumday":206,"qnumall":"[52923\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800073#WRH03800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of new registrations on new apprenticeships programmes to date in 2018; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1327","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":412,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 205 to 206, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>The information requested by the Deputy is set out in the attached tabular statement.<table><tr><th>Apprenticeship Type<\/th><th><div>Number of Programmes started in 2018<\/div><\/th><th><div>Number of Registrations in 2018 (to end of November)<\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>New consortia led<\/td><td><div>8<\/div><\/td><td><div>556<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Craft<\/td><td><div>n\/a<\/div><\/td><td><div>4,703<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total<\/td><td><div>8<\/div><\/td><td><div>5,259<\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800073#WRH03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1351"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Apprenticeship Programmes","counter":413,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800073#WRH04200"},{"type":"question","counter":414,"qnumday":207,"qnumall":"[52924\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800073#WRH04300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of the actions he is taking to ensure a greater participation rate of persons with a disability in apprenticeships; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1327","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":415,"content":"<p>This Government is committed to making our national apprenticeship more accessible to underrepresented groups including those with disabilities.

My Department is strongly supportive of the promotion of positive mental health awareness in post-primary schools and centres for education. The Department adopts a holistic and integrated approach to supporting schools and centres for education and training in promoting positive mental health.<\/p><p>The Well-being Policy Statement and Framework for Practice 2018-2023 launched my Department in July 2018 provides an overarching structure encompassing existing, ongoing and developing work in the area of well-being including mental health promotion. It builds on the good work already happening in schools and centres for Education to ensure that best practice in whole-school\/centre well-being promotion is embedded across the system. It includes a Well-being Implementation Plan which identifies seven high level actions to guide the work of implementation as follows: <\/p><p>- Strengthen and align current structures within the Department and between the Department and other relevant Departments to ensure the coordinated implementation of this Well-being Policy Statement and Framework for Practice.<\/p><p>- Plan and provide for the national roll-out of a professional development process to facilitate all schools and centres for education  to engage with and embed a Self-Evaluation Well-being Promotion  Process which builds professional capacity and collaborative cultures, from 2018-2023.<\/p><p>- Provide for an aligned, comprehensive and easily-accessible programme of support for all schools and centres for education to address school-identification well-being promotion needs.<\/p><p>- Consider how the system is meeting current and future teachers&rsquo; learning needs relation to well-being promotion.<\/p><p>- Develop a research based framework for the evaluation of well-being promotion in schools.<\/p><p>- Improve use of supports for children and young people at key points of transition within and between education settings.<\/p><p>- Promote the well-being of school and centre for education personnel.<\/p><p>These high level actions are in turn each supported underpinned by a range of specific sub-actions for roll-out to schools and centres for education for roll-out during the course in 2019.<\/p><p>The promotion of well-being for all is central to my Department&rsquo;s mission to enable individuals to achieve their full potential. The Department&rsquo;s ambition is that the promotion of well-being will be at the core of the ethos of every school and centre for education.  This policy requires that a Well-being Promotion Process is developed and implemented, through the use of the School Self-Evaluation (SSE) process, in all schools and centres for education by 2023. This Well-being Policy Statement and Framework for Practice provides advice and direction for doing this. This national focus on well-being in education seeks to ensure that our children and young people realise their potential now and in the future, and are able build resilience and deal with the challenges they face in life<b>.<\/b>The Well-being Policy Statement sets out the evidence base for best practice in relation to well-being promotion.  Schools and centres for education are asked to adopt a whole-school, multi-component, preventative approach to well-being promotion that includes both universal and targeted interventions. A whole-school \/centre for education approach involves all in the community engaging in a collaborative process to improve areas of the institution&rsquo;s life that impact on well-being.  This will be achieved through the use of a self-evaluation process taking well-being promotion as its focus.  It will allow benchmarking practice against Indicators of Success and Statements of Effective Practice, and identify areas for development, implementation and review.  It is envisaged that schools and centres for education will engage with the statements and adapt and develop the best practice items as they meet the needs in their own school\/centre community.<\/p><p>A multi-component approach encourages schools to address areas, not only relating to teaching and learning, but also relating to other essential elements of well-being promotion including school\/centre culture and environment, policy and planning and relationships and partnerships.  Working preventively and providing for both universal and targeted approaches is described as providing a &lsquo;Continuum of Support&rsquo;.  Schools\/ Centres are encouraged to provide supports to promote the well-being of all within that community as well as providing some targeted interventions for children and young people presenting with vulnerabilities in the area of well-being.  These areas are embedded in the Well-being Framework for Practice. <\/p><p>Schools\/Centres for education will be supported in this work by a comprehensive national professional development programme currently being developed and a full national roll-out will commence in 2019 and run to 2023.  This will include facilitating the engagement of schools\/centres in the self-evaluation for well-being promotion process which will build professional capacity. <\/p><p>Work is underway to map the range of existing supports that schools and centres for education can already access with a view to ensuring that there is a comprehensive and easily-accessible set of resources available to support identified well-being promotion needs.  Existing close collaboration with the HSE, Health Promotion Service will continue.  A Well-being Steering Committee is in place which will oversee coordination of activity with other Departments. This group will link with the Youth Mental Health Pathfinder Project structures when progressed.  The Department engages in cross departmental collaboration in supporting the implementation of Healthy Ireland 2013-2025, Connecting for Life (2015-2020), Better Outcomes Brighter Futures 2014-2020 strategies.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800073#WRH05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1351"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Facilities","counter":428,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800073#WRH05700"},{"type":"question","counter":429,"qnumday":212,"qnumall":"[52963\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800073#WRH05800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will report on his Department&rsquo;s engagement with property owners and school authorities to facilitate increased use of school buildings in cases in which this is feasible for afterschool care and out-of-hours use to support local communities.","asker":"1298","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":430,"content":"<p>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that following consultation with relevant school authorities, Guidelines on the use of School Buildings outside of School Hours were published by my Department in October 2017.

My Department also engages with each of the local authorities to obtain the up-to-date data on significant new residential development in each area.  With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level.  <\/p><p>Where demographic data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:<\/p><p>- Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools;<\/p><p>- Extending the capacity of a school or schools;<\/p><p>- Provision of a new school or schools.<\/p><p>In April 2018, the Government announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the next four years (2019 to 2022). This announcement follows nationwide demographic exercises carried out by my Department into the future need for primary and post-primary schools across the country and the 4-year horizon will enable increased lead-in times for planning and delivery of the necessary infrastructure.<\/p><p>In addition to the new schools announced, there will be a need for further school accommodation in other areas in the future.  The requirement for new schools will be kept under on-going review and in particular would have regard for the increased rollout of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040. <\/p><p>A patronage process is run after it has been decided, based on demographic analysis, that a new school is required.  This patronage process is open to all patron bodies and prospective patrons. Parental preferences for each patron, from parents\/guardians of children who reside in the school planning areas concerned, together with the extent of diversity currently available in these areas, are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of this process.<\/p><p>All new schools established since 2011 to meet demographic demand are required to prioritise enrolments from the designated school planning area(s) which the school was established to serve.  Therefore, only parents of eligible children residing in the relevant school planning area(s) can express a preference with regard to the patronage of the new school. This does not preclude schools from enrolling pupils from outside of the designated school planning area, rather it reflects the need to accommodate in the first instance the demographic for which the school was established. <\/p><p>A new Online Patronage Process System (OPPS) has been developed to provide objective information to all parents and guardians which will allow them to make an informed choice in expressing a preference for their preferred model of patronage and language of instruction for their child&rsquo;s education. <\/p><p>The OPPS website allows parents to access the appropriate survey for their area, to input the details of the eligible child(ren) and to select their preferred patron and language of instruction. Eligibility to express a preference in the patronage process for primary schools to be established in 2019 requires that a child is due to start primary education in the 5 year period 2019 to 2023; and that the child is resident the relevant school planning area. It is important to note that the eligibility conditions for parents to express a preference with regard to patronage have not changed since the introduction of the OPPS. <\/p><p>In order to express a preference, parents are requested to submit their Eircode upon entry to the system in order to determine whether they are eligible to express a preference for patronage of the new school. As set out on OPPS website, if parents experience any issues with the site, including issues related to Eircodes, my Department can be contacted at . <\/p><p>The patronage process for new schools is overseen by an external independent advisory group, the New Schools Establishment Group (NSEG). Once the online system for patronage preferences closes, the Department completes assessment reports for the NSEG on each area.  <\/p><p>Following their consideration of the Department&rsquo;s assessment reports, the NSEG submits a report with recommendations to me for consideration and final decision. The assessment reports and the NSEG recommendations for all such patronage processes are made available on my Department's website.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800074#WRJ02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Student Grant Scheme Eligibility","counter":453,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800074#WRJ02900"},{"type":"question","counter":454,"qnumday":224,"qnumall":"[53084\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800074#WRJ03000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the supports in place for applicants for the special rate of postgraduate grant awarded via SUSI who are long-term unemployed but had a short period of temporary employment in the year of assessment; the options available to a student who is only informed he or she has not qualified for a special rate grant after the course has begun and first term fees have been paid via a standard SUSI grant and who is unable financially to complete the course of study due to having been rejected for the special rate grant; if a student will be considered eligible to apply for a special rate postgraduate grant in the following year if, having begun the course, he or she opts to defer study and reapply in the following academic year; the way in which a potential applicant who is long-term unemployed, with the exception of a short period of temporary casual employment, can be supported to access the special rate of postgraduate grant; and if the Minister will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1432","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":455,"content":"<p>The decision on eligibility for a student grant is a matter for SUSI to determine.

The working week for SNAs is defined in paragraph 2.5 of their contract as follows: &quot;You will be required to work normal classroom hours including class break periods and in addition to attend before and after school in order to help with the preparation and tidying up of classrooms, reception and dispersal of children etc. The hours of work will normally be from [xxxx] to [xxxx] daily during term time.&quot;<\/p><p>This standard contract has been designed to be flexible to cater for the different spectrum of working hours across all the various schools including primary, post-primary and special schools. No set hours were agreed but instead, full-time SNAs are expected to work for the normal school hours in the school that they are working in, and in addition to be available for a period of time before and after school in order to help with reception and dispersal of children and preparation and tidying up of classrooms etc. These times are set locally by the school management and will vary from school to school depending on the requirements of the school.<\/p><p>In addition, all SNAs were required to be available for a number of days at the start and finish of each school term not exceeding 12 in total. Under the Croke Park Agreement it was agreed to introduce greater flexibility to the use of these 12 days.

This was agreed with the Unions representing SNAs (F&Oacute;RSA and SIPTU) when the contract was devised in 2005.

In tandem with that, it seeks to ensure there will be joined-up services and supports at local level to support individuals on their journey into and in employment. The Strategy's six strategic priorities are:<\/p>  <p>  1. Build skills, capacity and independence;<\/p>  <p>  2. Provide bridges and supports into work;<\/p>  <p>  3. Make work pay (the Make Work Pay Report was launched in April 2016 and many of its recommendations are already being implemented);<\/p>  <p>  4. Promote job retention and re-entry to work;<\/p>  <p>  5. Provide coordinated and seamless support; and<\/p>  <p>  6. Engage employers.<\/p>  <p>  The Strategy includes a range of practical measures to increase employment opportunities for people with disabilities, including those who wish to be self employed.  For example, action 2.10 of the Strategy includes a number of measures to assist people with disabilities to become self employed, this includes supporting and promoting self-employment as a viable option for people with disabilities, including equal access to mainstream supports and schemes.  These supports are provided through the Local Employment Office network which come under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation.<\/p>  <p>  Implementation of the Strategy is monitored by a working group under the direction of an independent chairperson (Mr Fergus Finlay). This group is tasked with monitoring the progress of the six strategic priorities of the strategy, and with the assistance of representatives and stakeholders from the disability sector, ensures that each Government Department is fulfilling its obligations and meeting its targets. <\/p>  <p>  In his first Report, the independent chairperson noted that progress had been made on the implementation of a strategic priority 2: &ldquo;Provide bridges and supports into work&rdquo; which includes action 2.10.  In addition, I can also advise that my officials, in cooperation with the National Disability Authority, and in consultation with the Strategy implementation group is in the process of developing a second three year action plan under the Strategy to ensure that the progress of implementation continues. <\/p>  <p>  Taking the above into account, the Strategy ensures that there is a coordinated, cross-government approach to support persons with disabilities to progress into employment, and  also that the appropriate supports and assistance are in place for those who wish to be self-employed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800076#WRL01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1359"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Strength","counter":552,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800076#WRL01400"},{"type":"question","counter":553,"qnumday":257,"qnumall":"[52946\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800076#WRL01500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of active garda&iacute; in December in each year to date in 2018.","asker":"1304","askee":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":554,"qnumday":264,"qnumall":"[52978\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800076#WRL01600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of active garda&iacute; per year in December up to and including December 2018; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1304","askee":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":555,"qnumday":265,"qnumall":"[52979\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800076#WRL01700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of active garda&iacute; by division; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1304","askee":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":556,"qnumday":266,"qnumall":"[52980\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800076#WRL01800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of active garda&iacute; by division and rank; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1304","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":557,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 257 and 264 to 266, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the distribution of personnel and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter.

It is carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na primarily in accordance with the provisions of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012-2016 and is, as I am sure you will agree, a very important task which must be done thoroughly and correctly. My Department has no role in the processing of individual vetting applications.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding sharing of vetting between organisations, vetting checks are conducted by the Garda National Vetting Bureau for each new vetting application received to ensure that the most recent data available is taken into account. This is because once there has been any significant lapse of time between one employment and another, the original vetting disclosure must be reviewed to take account of any changes in information, such as more recent criminal convictions. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Data Protection Acts require that any sensitive personal data which employers use in regard to their employees must be current, accurate and up-to-date. Importantly, the general non-transferability and contemporaneous nature of the current process also helps to protect against the risk of fraud or forgery in the process. <\/p>  <p>  However, the Act provides for the sharing of vetting disclosures in certain circumstances by registered organisations; a facility which is of assistance in the health and education sectors, for example, in reducing the need for multiple vetting applications. Section 12(3A) of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 (as amended) provides that two or more relevant organisations can enter into a joint written agreement in relation to the employment, contracting, permitting or placement of a person to undertake relevant work or activities, thereby providing for only one of the organisations being required to conduct vetting in respect of that person.<\/p>  <p>   In general, the vetting process is working well and I understand that there are no backlogs or delays in Garda vetting at present. This efficiency has been achieved by the deployment of the e-vetting system which facilitates the on-line processing of applications for vetting from registered organisations. The current turnaround time for vetting applications submitted by organisations utilising the e-vetting system is 5 working days for over 85% of applications received. Individual applicants can track the process of their application online using the e-vetting tracking system, details of which are contained in the email received by applicants when completing their application online. Furthermore, in circumstances where there is such a sustained reduction in processing times, the issue of vetting &ldquo;transferability&rdquo; is largely obviated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800076#WRL04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Naturalisation Applications","counter":576,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800076#WRL04500"},{"type":"question","counter":577,"qnumday":270,"qnumall":"[53111\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800076#WRL04600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if an application for naturalisation by a person (details supplied) can be examined; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1257","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":578,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that Section 17 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, provides that an application for a certificate of naturalisation shall be in the prescribed form and accompanied by the prescribed fee.

The Act was signed into law on 30 December 2015.<\/p>  <p>  New administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service within the Mental Health Commission (a body under the Department of Health), must be put in place before the substantive provisions of the Act can be commenced. <\/p>  <p>  A high-level Steering Group comprised of senior officials from the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Health, the Mental Health Commission (MHC) and the Courts Service, together with the Director of the Decision Support Service, is overseeing the establishment and commissioning of the Decision Support Service (DSS) and this work is ongoing. The Steering Group meets approximately once a month to monitor progress.<\/p>  <p>  A number of provisions of the Act were commenced in October 2016 in order to progress the setting up of the Decision Support Service.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 (Commencement of Certain Provisions) Order 2016 (S.I. No. 515 of 2016), brought Part 1 (Preliminary and General) and Part 9 (Director of the Decision Support Service) of the Act, other than sections 3, 4 and 7 in Part 1 and sections 96 and 102 and Chapter 3 in Part 9, into operation on 17 October 2016.  These provisions were brought into operation in order to enable the process of recruitment of the Director of the Decision Support Service (DSS) to begin. Ms &Aacute;ine Flynn was appointed Director of the Decision Support Service on 2 October 2017.<\/p>  <p>  The commencement of Part 8 of the Act, which provides a legislative framework for advance healthcare directives, is a matter for the Minister for Health.  The Minister for Health, under the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 (Commencement of Certain Provisions) (No. 2) Order 2016 (S.I. No. 517 of 2016), brought some provisions of Part 8 of the Act into operation on 17 October 2016. The provisions commenced in Part 8 were the definition of &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; in section 82; the definitions of &ldquo;code of practice&rdquo; and &ldquo;working group&rdquo; in section 91(1); and section 91(2).  The commenced provisions provide for the establishment by the Minister for Health of a multi-disciplinary group to advise in relation to codes of practice on advance healthcare directives.  The multi-disciplinary group has been set up and has and is currently finalising its recommendations. <\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Health commenced the remainder of section 91 on 17 December 2018 (S.I. No. 527 of 2018) to enable the Director of the Decision Support Service to progress the preparation of the codes of practice as soon as the multi-disciplinary group submits its recommendations to the Director. <\/p>  <p>  The key preparations are being put in place under the oversight of the Steering Group to allow for further commencement orders for the provisions of the 2015 Act to be made when the DSS is ready to roll out the new decision-making support options.  The Director of the DSS is working in a very determined way to get the necessary staff resources, processes, IT system, expert panels, codes of practice and regulations in place in order that the DSS can be up and running as quickly as possible.  There are many complex strands to this work, including involvement of multiple organisations.<\/p>  <p>  Every effort is underway to ensure that the DSS has all necessary capacity to open for business as soon as possible.  While the DSS has been working towards being operational and ready for the commencement of the main provisions of the Act in early 2020, the situation will be kept under review as the preparatory work on implementation moves forward.<\/p>  <p>  In April 2018, the MHC engaged the consultancy firm BearingPoint to support the development of a detailed, costed plan to establish a fully operational Decision Support Service.  The contract also includes ongoing project management support for the design and establishment of the organisation, business processes, IT systems and risk management framework.<\/p>  <p>  The MHC has received sanction for the recruitment of a number of staff for the DSS and also a number of staff to provide shared services for the MHC and DSS.  The MHC proposes to recruit these staff on a phased basis between now and 1 January 2020.<\/p>  <p>  The National Disability Authority is currently finalising its work on the suite of draft codes of practice in relation to non-healthcare matters which are required to be prepared under section 103 of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015.<\/p>  <p>  In June 2018, my Department recruited an external legal expert to assist in the preparation of draft regulations in relation to decision-making assistance agreements, co-decision-making agreements, certain matters relating to decision-making representatives, and enduring powers of attorney.  These regulation-making powers are provided for in sections 10(4), 31, 45(3), 45(4), 46(3) and 79 of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015.

I can however confirm that my officials are available to assist any interested groups who wish to take advantage of the availability of the grant aid scheme.  <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that CCTV systems installed for the purposes of crime prevention and as aids to policing in areas to which the general public routinely have access, such as town centres, fall into two distinct but complementary categories, namely Garda CCTV systems and community-based CCTV systems.  Neither may be established without authorisation by the Garda Commissioner under section 38 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, among other requirements.<\/p>  <p>  Community CCTV is governed by section 38(3)(c) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (CCTV) Order 2006 (SI No 289 of 2006).  This legal framework requires that any proposed community CCTV scheme must:<\/p>  <p>  - be approved by the local Joint Policing Committee,<\/p>  <p>  - have the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner, and<\/p>  <p>  - have the prior support of the relevant local authority, which must also act as data controller.<\/p>  <p>  This is the legal basis for all community CCTV schemes, regardless of how they are funded.<\/p>  <p>  Specifically in relation to the role of local authorities, I would confirm that the requirements listed above are not conditions of grant funding per se, but rather are statutory requirements under section 38(3)(c) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and regulation 4(d) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (CCTV) Order 2006.<\/p>  <p>  In accordance with this legal framework, the large majority of local authorities have previously undertaken to act as data controllers in the context of specific community CCTV schemes.  This has been the case either in the course of the current grant-aid scheme administered by my Department, in connection with the previous grant-aid scheme operated by Pobal on behalf of the Department, or in connection with schemes funded independently by local authorities.  I understand from my Department's engagement with the Local Government Management Agency that the total number of local authorities which have undertaken the role of data controller for these purposes amounts to 28 out of the 31 local authorities nationwide.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to be aware that on 29 November this year the Data Protection Commission issued a note (available on its website www.dataprotection.ie ) confirming that there is a legal basis for community based CCTV and that the General Data Protection Regulation does not introduce new barriers in that regard.  In particular, the Data Protection Commission confirmed that:  &ldquo;Data protection legislation does not stand in the way of the roll-out of Community based CCTV schemes that have been authorised by the Garda Commissioner. Once the local authority in the administrative area concerned is willing to take on and deliver on its responsibilities as a data controller for the schemes concerned, there is no legal impediment under data protection legislation to the scheme commencing.&rdquo;<\/p>  <p>  The Data Protection Commission is currently conducting an audit of the practice, operation and governance of CCTV as part of a wider inquiry into surveillance through the use of technologies for law enforcement purposes.  The findings from the CCTV module of this process can be expected to be of assistance to all concerned and in particular to local authorities. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is also engaging on an ongoing basis with the Local Government Management Agency and the County and City Management Association, to clarify any queries arising and to assist in resolving any concerns.<\/p>  <p>  As regards funding for community CCTV, the Programme for a Partnership Government commits to supporting investment in CCTV systems. In furtherance of this commitment, a grant-aid scheme to assist groups in the establishment of community-based CCTV systems in their local areas is being administered by my Department.  Eligible groups, including community groups and local authorities, can apply for grant-aid of up to 60% of the total capital cost of a proposed CCTV system, up to a maximum total of &euro;40,000. <\/p>  <p>  There have to date been 27 applications to the scheme. 20 applications have been approved, involving approved grants totalling more than &euro;500,000.

The view was taken that there was little point in introducing legislation in the Oireachtas in 2016 if large parts of that legislation would have to be repealed or substantially amended within a relatively short time after its enactment. In my view, this outcome would not have been in the interests of either consumers or businesses.<\/p>  <p>  Regrettably, progress on the EU legislative proposals has been slower than originally anticipated. While the Justice and Home Affairs Council agreed a general approach on the digital content proposal in June 2017, a difference of opinion between the Council and the European Parliament on whether goods with digital elements or &lsquo;smart goods&rsquo; should be regulated under the digital content or the sales of goods Directives delayed progress in the subsequent trilogues. A general approach on the sales of goods proposal was agreed at the recent Justice and Home Affairs Council on 7 December.  I am glad to be able to report that the general approach achieved on this proposal is expected to pave the way for agreement on the digital content proposal. While there is still some way to go, there is now a good prospect that both Directives will be adopted before the end of the current term of the European Parliament in April 2019.

Information on the Fund and how to apply was provided by my Department with the support of Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland. Expressions of Interest were sought for funding commencing in 2019. <\/p><p>My Department received 307 Expressions of Interest for this Call for funding. However, 6 Expressions of Interest were received after the deadline and as such were deemed ineligible. Decisions on the 301 remaining Expressions of Interest received were made in September 2018 and were communicated to the lead partners of all consortia. Only those applications that met all of the eligibility criteria and met the minimum threshold of the selection criteria were invited to submit a full application.  However, this does not prohibit those applicants from applying for funding in future calls under the Disruptive Technologies Innovation Fund (DTIF).<\/p><p>In total, 45 consortia were invited to submit a full application to be received by 12.00 noon on 5th November. 44 consortia submitted applications ahead of this deadline. One application was received after the deadline of 12 noon on 5 November 2018 and that application was deemed ineligible.<\/p><p>From early November 2018, a panel of international experts has assessed the 44 detailed applications and interviewed each consortium that submitted a valid application. On completion of this evaluation, 27 projects were deemed to have met the minimum threshold of the selection criteria. The remaining 17 applications were deemed to have failed at least one of the selection criteria and as such were deemed ineligible to progress to funding. <\/p><p>In summary, 301 valid Expressions of Interest were received of which 45 were invited to full application.  44 valid applications were received of which 27 have been deemed fundable following assessment by a panel of international experts.  All 27 fundable projects have been approved in principle for funding.<\/p><p>Enterprise Ireland is supporting my Department in the administration and post-award management of the projects being funded. In line with standard practice in Enterprise Ireland, the 27 approved projects will be subject to further scrutiny and detailed grant conditions will be communicated by Enterprise Ireland in formal &ldquo;letters of offer&rdquo;. It is anticipated that the earliest letters of offer would issue early in 2019. <\/p><p>In terms of Exchequer funding available, there is &euro;20m available in 2019, &euro;30m in 2020, &euro;40m in 2021 and &euro;90m in 2022 (i.e., a total of &euro;180m between 2019 and 2022).  The first tranche of 27 projects announced in December 2018 involve a maximum exchequer commitment of &euro;78m.  This assumes that each project proceeds as planned and that the required enterprise co-funding is put in place.  Enterprise partners in each consortium will claim DTIF funding retrospectively following certification by Enterprise Ireland of work completed.<\/p><p>In terms of co-funding, the following were the requirements set down for the first Call:<\/p><p>- Enterprise partners in a consortium can be funded to max of 50% of their costs from the DTIF;<\/p><p>- Research Performing Organisations (RPOs &ndash; including universities and colleges) can be funded up to 100% of their costs;<\/p><p>- RPOs cannot account for more than two-thirds of the DTIF (exchequer) funding in any project.<\/p><p>Public bodies (other than eligible RPOs) are also allowed to participate as part of a consortium but are required to be self-financed for this first call under the DTIF and as such will not receive funding.<\/p><p>In terms of county location, my Department received over 300 Expressions of Interest with multiple partners ranging from 2 to 15 partners and for most of the 27 successful projects, partners within each consortium are based in different locations across the country. No regional criteria were included in the first Call and no regional analysis has been undertaken or is available from the Expressions of Interest received. The table below shows the 27 fundable projects and the locations of the enterprise partners in each consortium.

These occupations lists are reviewed twice yearly to keep pace with rapid labour market changes and to be proactively identifying and addressing shortages as they arise.  <\/p>  <p>  In order to have an occupation considered for addition to the HSEOL, or removed from the ICEL, there would need to be a clear demonstration of current recruitment difficulties and shortages across the EEA  that the difficulties are not as a result of other factors such as salary, employment conditions or lack of upskilling opportunities.  Organisations in the sector would need to provide the necessary data to substantiate their claims.  A detailed evidence-based case requesting the addition of an occupation to the highly skilled list would then need to be put forward by the relevant lead Department for the sector, to my Department for review and consideration. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has commenced the second 2018 review of the lists of occupations for employment permits with a public call for submissions from stakeholders and interest groups requesting changes to the lists. The closing date for receipt of submissions was Friday 2nd November 2018. Submissions have been received in respect of a range of occupations including many from the construction sector, and those submissions and other relevant research and data are now being examined.  <\/p>  <p>  A detailed submission made to my Department by the Construction Industry Federation is under active consideration as part of this process, in consultation with officials in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government who also sit on the Interdepartmental Group on Economic Migration.  I have also met with CIF Representatives recently to discuss the labour and skills challenges in the sector and engagement is ongoing with my officials.  Any proposed changes to either the Highly skilled or Ineligible lists, will be brought to me by my officials early in 2019.<\/p>  <p>  In light of the changing economy and as we continue towards near full employment, it is imperative that the employment permits system is correctly oriented to meet the State&rsquo;s labour market needs.  To that end, I recently published a report reviewing the economic migration policies underpinning the current employment permits system to ensure our policies are fully supportive of Ireland&rsquo;s labour market needs, be they skills or labour shortages in certain sectors.  The report confirms that our employment permits system is largely robust with some adjustment required to ensure continued responsiveness, setting out recommendations to be addressed over the short, medium and long term that will ensure that our employment permits system will play its part in supporting Ireland's labour market needs.  <\/p>  <p>  The Employment Permits section has experienced high levels of demand for employment permits so far this year which has contributed to increased processing times for applications.  In response to these delays a number of operational changes, streamlined processes and ICT solutions have been implemented. Additional staffing resources have also been assigned to the section and a fast track training programme has been devised.  As a result of the implementation of these changes, processing times are now reducing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800078#WRN03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Data","counter":679,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800078#WRN03600"},{"type":"question","counter":680,"qnumday":305,"qnumall":"[52845\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800078#WRN03700","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of persons by Civil Service grade working in the employment permits section of her Department in each of the years 2014 to 2017 and to date in 2018; and the annual funding allocation to the employment permits section in 2019.","asker":"1229","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":681,"content":"<p>In answer to the question posed by the Deputy the number of persons by civil service grade working in the Employment Permits Section of my Department in each of the years 2014 to 2017 and to date in 2018 is set out below in tabular form.  <table><tr><th><\/th><th>To date <\/th><th>2018<\/th><th>End <\/th><th>2017<\/th><th>End <\/th><th>2016<\/th><th>End <\/th><th>2015<\/th><th>End <\/th><th>2014<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Grade <\/td><td>Head Count<\/td><td>*FTE<\/td><td>Head Count<\/td><td>*FTE<\/td><td>Head Count<\/td><td>*FTE<\/td><td>Head Count<\/td><td>*FTE<\/td><td>Head Count<\/td><td>*FTE<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Principal Officer<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>AP<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>HEO<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>2.5<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>2.5<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>1.9<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>2.5<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>1.5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>EO<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>7.5<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>SO**<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CO<\/td><td>24 (+2***)<\/td><td>24.1<\/td><td>23<\/td><td>21.3<\/td><td>17<\/td><td>16.8<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>11.6<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>13.1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total<\/td><td>36 (+2***)<\/td><td>36.1<\/td><td>37<\/td><td>33.8<\/td><td>29<\/td><td>27.7<\/td><td>25<\/td><td>23.1<\/td><td>26<\/td><td>23.6<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>* Full time equivalent<\/p><p>** The Staff Officer grade was amalgamated with the Executive Officer in January 2017.<\/p><p>*** Vacancies which will be filled on 7<sup>th<\/sup>January 2019.  <\/p><p>Staffing resources are an ongoing priority to ensure my Department&rsquo;s continued ability to facilitate the wide mission and volume of work in a range of challenging areas.

The EU is working towards achieving a region-to-region Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with ASEAN by first concluding FTAs with individual ASEAN members.  The first of these was signed with Singapore in October 2018 while negotiations for a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between the EU and Vietnam were concluded in December 2015.   <\/p>  <p>  Following a Court of Justice of the European Union Opinion (2\/15) which provided clarity in respect of the areas of EU Commission and Members State competency in the EU-Singapore FTA, the EU Commission proposed a revised approach to Free Trade Agreements, which EU Trade Ministers have agreed.  This new trade architecture involves splitting FTAs into separate &ldquo;Trade&rdquo; and &ldquo;Investment&rdquo; Agreements on a case-by-case basis.  In June 2018, the EU and Vietnam agreed to separate the Free Trade Agreement, as originally negotiated, in line with this new trade architecture.  The translated texts of the Agreements are currently awaiting examination by Lawyer Linguists, however, there is no confirmed timeline for the completion of this process.<\/p>  <p>  Insofar as ratification is concerned, some EU trade agreements are 'EU-only' meaning that all the policy areas they cover fall under the sole responsibility of the EU institutions.  Other agreements may be presented as 'mixed' where they have areas of shared responsibility between the EU and Member States.  The EU-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (FTA) covers areas that fall under the exclusive competence of the EU, while the EU-Vietnam Investment Protection Agreement (IPA) covers areas of joint competence shared between the EU and its Member States.  <\/p>  <p>  The areas covered in the EU-Vietnam FTA fall under the exclusive competence of the EU such that Member States in Council approve and conclude the Agreement, with ratification by the European Parliament.  The EU-Vietnam IPA, on the other hand, is a mixed competence Agreement and, while the Office of the Attorney General will be formally consulted, it is the view of my Department that a vote in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann will be required, in due course, to decide on ratification of the IPA.  <\/p>  <p>  The EU-Vietnam FTA can be applied once it has been approved by the Council of the EU and ratified by the European Parliament as well as by Vietnam.  The FTA will eliminate over 99% of tariffs on EU exports to Vietnam, 65% of these tariffs will be liberalised at entry into force of the FTA with the remainder phased out over a 10-year period.  The FTA also covers non-tariff barriers to trade and other trade related issues such as public procurement, competition, services, investment, intellectual property rights, regulatory issues, and sustainable development.  I support the application of the EU-Vietnam FTA so that Irish firms may benefit from the new business opportunities provided for by the Agreement.  <\/p>  <p>  Mixed agreements only enter into force once each individual EU Member State has approved it in line with its own national procedures.  In this regard, given the request by Belgium for an Opinion (1\/17) from the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) on the compatibility of the Investment Court System in CETA with the European Treaties, my Department awaits the CJEU opinion on this matter which will inform the Department&rsquo;s plans for ratification of the EU-Vietnam IPA. <\/p>  <p>  I should also note that one of the most important aspects of the EU's Common Commercial Policy is that, alongside protecting European businesses and consumers, it is promoting the EU's principles and values such as high social and environmental standards.  In this regard, the Chapter on Trade and Sustainable Development in the EU-Vietnam FTA aims to promote sustainable development, by focussing on trade and investment related aspects of labour and environmental issues, contains commitments to respect multilateral labour and environmental agreements, and seeks to ensure that labour and environment standards are not lowered in order to attract trade.  Furthermore, the FTA involves the establishment of an EU-Vietnam Committee on Trade and Sustainable Development comprised of representatives of both Parties to oversee its implementation.  <\/p>  <p>  In February 2018, EU Commissioner for Trade Cecilia Malmstr&ouml;m announced a new 15-point plan to enhance implementation of EU trade and sustainable development chapters.  This includes ensuring that countries comply with their commitments through more assertive enforcement; facilitating the monitoring role of civil society; and making EU resources available to support implementation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800079#WRO00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Supports","counter":708,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800079#WRO00700"},{"type":"question","counter":709,"qnumday":315,"qnumall":"[53190\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800079#WRO00800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if she is satisfied with the uptake of grants by businesses to tackle the challenge of Brexit.","asker":"1224","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":710,"content":"<p>My Department and its agencies are providing extensive supports, including grants, to enable companies to prepare for Brexit and succeed into the future. <\/p>  <p>  For 2019, I have allocated an extra &euro;8 million to the enterprise agencies and regulatory bodies under my Department for various Brexit supports and grant schemes.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the effectiveness of these supports, a recent survey of 2,400 Enterprise Ireland (EI) clients found that 85% of them are taking Brexit-related actions.  This is a substantial increase from 38% this time last year, and is a positive indication that companies are undertaking Brexit preparedness actions.  I am satisfied that businesses are increasing their preparation efforts for Brexit, and that EI&rsquo;s suite of grants is helping them to achieve this.<\/p>  <p>  In the first 6 months of this year alone, 43% of the 1,600 most exposed EI client companies received grant aid.  It is important to note that each company has individual needs, which is why EI encourages its clients to choose from the full suite of supports that it makes available. <\/p>  <p>  For instance, EI&rsquo;s Be Prepared Grant offers SME clients a grant of up to &euro;5,000 to assist them in preparing an action plan for economic shocks such as Brexit.  148 Be Prepared Grants have so far been approved with a strong pipeline in place for new applications.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, EI&rsquo;s Strategic Consultancy Grant can support the cost of hiring Strategic Consultants to assist in the development and\/or implementation of strategic initiatives. 920 projects have received funding to date under the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that EI grants are demand-led. EI has undertaken a number of promotional initiatives to raise awareness of their comprehensive range of grants and supports.  This includes eleven Brexit Advisory Clinics held throughout the country in 2018. <\/p>  <p>  Representatives from all the enterprise agencies under my remit were present at the Government&rsquo;s series of six &ldquo;Getting Ireland Brexit Ready&rdquo; seminars, which were held recently around the country, and spoke to attendees and informed them of the range of grants and supports available.<\/p>  <p>  Local Enterprise Office (LEO) funding has been increased and is being used to assist micro-enterprises in becoming more competitive and better able to cope with the changing environment in which they are operating.  There were 622 Technical Assistance for Micro Enterprise (TAME) Grants approved by the LEO Network from 1 June 2017 &ndash; 13 December 2018.  These grants help LEO Clients to tackle the challenges of Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  InterTrade Ireland (ITI) is working to minimise the impact of Brexit on north-south trade.  In Budget 2019, ITI received an additional &euro;1 million in capital funding. ITI&rsquo;s Start to Plan vouchers offer 100% financial support up to &euro;2,250 towards professional advice in relation to Brexit matters.  This support can assist businesses get advice on specific technical and specialist advice on issues such as movement of labour, goods, services and currency management.  So far in 2018 ITI has approved 644 vouchers.<\/p>  <p>  While I am encouraged by the fact that businesses are engaging in high numbers with these and other supports on offer, not everyone is engaging.  With Brexit around the corner, I want businesses to know we are here to help.

The enactment of the Children and Family Relationships (Amendment) Act 2018 was necessary to correct typographical and technical errors in the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015, to enable the subsequent commencement of Parts 2 &amp;amp; 3 of the Act.<\/p>  <p>  Officials in my Department are working towards putting in place a number of important administrative and operational arrangements that are essential for the implementation of Parts 2 &amp;amp; 3.  This includes the establishment of the National Donor-Conceived Person Register (the &ldquo;Register&rdquo;), the purpose of which is to vindicate the rights of a donor-conceived child to access information on their genetic heritage.  This is based on the principles of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child concerning the right of a child to an identity and internationally regarded as best practice.  However, as the Register will contain personal and potentially sensitive information about the various parties to a DAHR procedure, and particularly about the children born as a result of the procedures, robust data protection measures must be put in place prior to the establishment of the Register.<\/p>  <p>  The commencement of Parts 2 &amp;amp; 3 of the Act also requires consent forms relating to the parties to a DAHR procedure (donors and intending parents) to be prescribed by regulations.  The Department is liaising with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel in relation to the drafting of those regulations.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the appointment of authorised persons to ensure compliance of DAHR facilities with their obligations under this Act also needs to be finalised. It is my intention that Parts 2 &amp;amp; 3 of the Act will be commenced as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  The provisions in Parts 2 &amp;amp; 3 are interconnected with provisions in other areas of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015, particularly Part 9 which includes provisions for the registration and re-registration of the birth of a donor-conceived child.  As such, officials from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Health and the General Register Office are working together to ensure that the appropriate legislative, regulatory, and operational mechanisms are in place to allow for the earliest possible commencement of all of the relevant legislation that will allow for birth registrations of donor-conceived children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800079#WRO03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Substance Misuse","counter":732,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800079#WRO03100"},{"type":"question","counter":733,"qnumday":323,"qnumall":"[52686\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800079#WRO03200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of adults who have been deemed appropriate for treatment for substance use to date in 2018;

Approval and funding has been provided for the additional staff required to facilitate this service expansion. <\/p>  <p>  While the hospital group has experienced difficulties recruiting the necessary staff to facilitate the expansion in hours of operation, I am pleased to note that five staff (Grade IV Admin, Porter, Senior Cardiac Physiologist, Senior Radiographer and Staff Nurse) have now been recruited on an 8am to 8pm working day basis. Furthermore, the recruitment of a cardiologist to facilitate an increase in the operating hours of the existing cath lab is also being progressed by the HSE. <\/p>  <p>  A mobile cath lab has been deployed at the hospital since October 2017 to conduct diagnostic cardiac procedures. <\/p>  <p>  In July, I requested the HSE to proceed with next steps on the provision of a modular cath lab at UHW, and to revert to my Department with proposed timescales and costings. In September, the HSE submitted an options appraisal to the Department setting out alternative options for the location and operation of a second cath lab at UHW. <\/p>  <p>  I have decided to proceed with the provision of a second cath lab in University Hospital Waterford in order to address waiting times at the hospital and to provide a better service for the people of Waterford and the South East. I am committed to increasing capacity for interventional work through the addition of a second lab. My understanding is that both labs will have the capability to do interventional work. <\/p>  <p>  It is intended that the cost of progressing the project to design, planning and construction stages will be considered in the context of the HSE&rsquo;s Capital Plan for 2019, which is currently being finalised. <\/p>  <p>  A National Review of Specialist Cardiac Services is currently underway. The aim of this Review is to achieve optimal patient outcomes at population level with particular emphasis on the safety, quality and sustainability of the services that patients receive by establishing the need for an optimal configuration of a national adult cardiac service.

3 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 contain provisions relating to the regulation of donor-assisted human reproduction (DAHR) procedures carried out in the State, including dealing with the rights of children born as a result of those procedures. The enactment of the Children and Family Relationships (Amendment) Act 2018 was necessary to correct typographical and technical errors in the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015, to enable the subsequent commencement of Parts 2 &amp;amp; 3 of the Act.  <\/p>  <p>  Officials in my Department are working towards putting in place a number of important administrative and operational arrangements that are essential for the implementation of Parts 2 &amp;amp; 3. This includes the establishment of the National donor conceived Person Register (the &ldquo;Register&rdquo;), the purpose of which is to vindicate the rights of a donor-conceived child to access information on their genetic heritage. This is based on the principles of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child concerning the right of a child to an identity and internationally regarded as best practice. However, as the Register will contain personal and potentially sensitive information about the various parties to a DAHR procedure, and particularly about the children born as a result of the procedures, robust data protection measures must be put in place prior to the establishment of the Register.<\/p>  <p>  The commencement of Parts 2 &amp;amp; 3 of the Act also requires consent forms relating to the parties to a DAHR procedure (donors and intending parents) to be prescribed by regulations. The Department is liaising with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel in relation to the drafting of those regulations. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the appointment of authorised persons to ensure compliance of DAHR facilities with their obligations under this Act also needs to be finalised.

the regulation and audit of their use; the extent of use of these devices in Ireland and the availability of services for women affected by mesh-associated complications, including through the tabling of several Parliamentary Questions.  <\/p><p>In responding to these questions and in recognition of the complexity of the matters arising, I requested the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) to prepare a report for me on the clinical and technical issues involved in ensuring both:<\/p><p>a) the safe and effective provision of mesh procedures in urogynaecology and<\/p><p>b) an appropriate response to women who suffer complications as a result of undergoing such procedures.<\/p><p>The Report, entitled<b><\/b><i>The Use of Uro-gynaecological Mesh in Surgical Procedures<\/i>, has now been presented to me and was published on the 21<sup>st<\/sup>November 2018 on the Department of Health website.<\/p><p>The report provides a brief background description of mesh implant devices, including the complications associated with their use; and summarises international best practice in the use of mesh procedures in the clinical management of SUI and POP. A range of recommendations for action by the HSE in collaboration with other stakeholders is identified, to provide assurance that the use of mesh implants and the care of women requiring aftercare in Irish hospitals is in line with emerging evidence and best practice internationally, based on expert advice received and review of international experience.<\/p><p><b>Methodology<\/b><\/p><p>Preparation of the report has involved consultation and engagement with national and international bodies, including the Health Products Regulatory Agency (HPRA); the relevant professional training bodies, the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecology (IOG) and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI); the Continence Foundation of Ireland (CFI) and the Health Service Executive (HSE), as well as colleagues in other jurisdictions.  The report has been informed by review of international reports and safety reviews of mesh surgery which have been published in recent years. The report has also been informed by the personal experiences of women who have suffered complications following mesh surgery.<\/p><p>I wish to acknowledge the bravery, commitment and dignity shown, by the women that met with me and by those women who have written to me concerning this issue, in sharing what were harrowing, deeply personal experiences. <\/p><p>It is important to note that the views of the many women who have undergone mesh procedures and have had satisfactory outcomes, with minor or no complications, have not been formally sought and so are not reflected in this report. Also, following the implementation of a pause in mesh procedures by the HSE in July 2018, as described in Section 2, a number of women whose procedures were postponed made representations to the Department expressing concern at the impact that this has on them personally as they await treatment for the distressing symptoms of SUI, reflecting another important group of women affected directly by this issue.<\/p><p><b>Report Findings<\/b><\/p><p>The report makes a number of overall findings, in addition findings are presented which relate to informed consent, aftercare of women with complications, clinical and professional issues and information issues. The findings are:<\/p><p>Overall Findings<\/p><p>- Mesh implant devices are certified as compliant with relevant European Union (EU) legislation and no market action against mesh devices for the treatment of SUI or POP has been taken by any of the European device regulatory competent authorities.<\/p><p>- There is an extensive evidence base supporting (i) the use of the mid-urethral sling (MUS) devices in the treatment of SUI and (ii) the use of abdominally placed mesh in the management of POP. A significant majority of patients benefit greatly from these procedures, with reduced long-term complications and improved functional outcomes compared to non-mesh procedures.<\/p><p>- Mesh procedures should be performed by trained personnel, in patients who are appropriately selected and counselled and when appropriate multidisciplinary expertise and clinical governance mechanisms are in place.<\/p><p>- Transvaginal placement of mesh for the treatment of POP is no longer regarded as appropriate first line treatment. Its use is restricted by clinical guidance in some jurisdictions. Regulatory restrictions on its use are in place in Australia and New Zealand.<\/p><p>- Mesh devices are associated with significant and severe complications in a minority of women, which are of concern given the difficulties of mesh implant removal.<\/p><p>- Many other health systems, including the United Kingdom (UK), Australia and the Netherlands have implemented specific measures in recent years to ensure appropriate use of mesh procedures in the treatment of SUI and POP and to ensure appropriate aftercare for women suffering mesh complications.<\/p><p>Informed Consent <\/p><p>- As would be usual with many surgical conditions, standardised information resources were not available at national level to ensure that all patients receive consistent information about the benefits and risks of mesh devices, to advise of other treatment options and to support informed consent processes.<\/p><p>- Many women reported that they were not informed of other treatment options; they had not been informed that their surgeries involved the use of mesh; they were not informed of mesh complications; and they were not made aware of the difficulties associated with mesh removal or with the treatment of long-term mesh complications. <\/p><p>Aftercare of Women with Complications<\/p><p>- Structured treatment or referral pathways were not evidently in place for the minority of women requiring specialist, multidisciplinary care for serious complications following mesh surgery. <\/p><p>- Some women reported considerable difficulty in accessing timely, compassionate and appropriate specialist aftercare for complications. <\/p><p>- Some women reported that individual clinicians responded to their personal concerns in an inappropriate manner which greatly added to their distress. Women also reported feeling that they were not believed, or that their clinicians minimised or did not understand the severity of their complications.  <\/p><p>Clinical and Professional Issues <\/p><p>- Governance mechanisms are not in place at national level to provide assurance that mesh surgeries are carried out in accordance with agreed international best practice and clinical guidance. <\/p><p>- There is no mandated professional clinical guidance at national level to guide the use of mesh implants in the management of SUI or POP or to guide the management of women with complications. <\/p><p>- Communication mechanisms currently in place at national level between the HPRA, healthcare providers and professional bodies do not provide assurance that the findings and recommendations of safety reviews such as those circulated by the HPRA in recent years regarding mesh implants are systematically analysed and acted upon where appropriate.<\/p><p>Information<\/p><p>- There are significant gaps in knowledge about current practice in Ireland regarding the use of urogynaecological mesh implants. <\/p><p>- Routinely collected clinical information at national level does not provide the capacity for monitoring or audit of mesh surgeries for the treatment of SUI and POP.<\/p><p>- Based on international experience, there is under-reporting of adverse events relating to mesh surgeries by clinicians to both the HPRA and to the National Incident Management System (NIMS) operated by the State Claims Agency (SCA). <\/p><p><b>Recommendations<\/b><\/p><p>Nineteen recommendations in total are identified throughout the report in response to the findings above:<\/p><p>- Patient Information and Consent &ndash; 2 recommendations<\/p><p>- Aftercare for Women Suffering Complications &ndash; 5 recommendations<\/p><p>- Clinical and Professional Recommendations &ndash; 8 recommendations<\/p><p>- Information Recommendations &ndash; 5 recommendations<\/p><p>These include recommendations about the development of patient information and informed consent materials to ensure appropriate patient selection and counselling, ensuring clinical and professional standards of practice are met by ensuring that all surgeons have undergone appropriate surgical professional training and ensuring that appropriate multidisciplinary expertise is available in units carrying out mesh procedures, the development of clinical guidance for the management of SUI and POP, the development of information resources to monitor the ongoing use of mesh devices and to permit long-term research and audit of practice, ensuring the reporting of mesh related complications, and ensuring timely, appropriate and accessible care pathways for the management of women with complications. <\/p><p>Full implementation of the report&rsquo;s recommendations will provide significant assurance that all patients presenting for treatment for SUI and POP and all women who develop mesh-related complications receive high quality, patient centred care in accordance with accepted evidence and supported by robust clinical governance mechanisms. <\/p><p><b>Actions to date<\/b><\/p><p>A number of important interim system actions to address the safety and effectiveness of mesh implant use have been progressed in advance of completion of the report.<\/p><p>1.  <i>Pause on all uro-gynaecological mesh procedures<\/i><\/p><p>On July 24<sup>th<\/sup>, 2018, the HSE was requested by the CMO to pause all uro-gynaecological mesh procedures, in cases where it is clinically appropriate and safe to do so, pending confirmation by the HSE of the implementation of recommendations relating to (i) professional training requirements, (ii) patient information and consent and (iii) the development and maintenance of a national data set for all mesh procedures carried out in HSE funded hospitals. The request to institute a pause in vaginal mesh procedures was considered proportionate and necessary to address public and patient concern about the ongoing safety of mesh devices as comprehensively as possible.<\/p><p>2.  <i>Development of patient information and consent materials<\/i><\/p><p>Prior to this request, in May 2018, the HSE had been requested to begin work immediately on the development of national standardised patient information and informed consent materials and the clarification and development of treatment pathways and appropriate referral services for women suffering serious complications.<\/p><p>3.<i>Learning Notice on mesh devices <\/i><\/p><p>A Learning Notice concerning mesh devices in uro-gynaecological procedures was circulated by the National Women and Infants&rsquo; Health Programme (NWIHP) on 26<sup>th<\/sup>June 2018 to all maternity hospitals and acute hospitals with gynaecological services to highlight the importance of appropriate patient selection, adequate information and consent and also to inform the service providers that a Response Group has been convened to propose remedies for and address the provision of aftercare for complications. This learning notice has been posted on the NWIHP website.<\/p><p>4.<i>Synthetic Mesh Devices Group<\/i><\/p><p>A Synthetic Mesh Devices Advisory Group has been convened by the NWIHP which includes three patient representatives, as well as representatives of the HPRA, the IOG, the RCSI, the CFI and all Hospital Groups, to advise on and progress all the interim recommendations as advised to the HSE in May 2018 and in July 2018.  To ensure that the spectrum of views of women affected by mesh safety concerns is represented, the three patient representatives include Ms Melanie Power, representative of Mesh Survivors Ireland; as well as a woman who has had a successful outcome of mesh surgery for the treatment of SUI and a woman who is on the waiting list for surgery (currently paused).<\/p><p>I am informed that a work programme for the development of appropriate patient information resources and consent materials, the clarification and development of treatment pathways and appropriate referral services for women suffering from mesh-related complications including access to specialist diagnostic facilities such as translabial scanning is being progressed through this Group. The work being progressed by the HSE will include identifying the appropriate specialist clinical expertise and facilities required at hospital group level and nationally to provide comprehensive aftercare services. Pending the completion of this, the HSE will also examine the need to look at sourcing services from abroad to address any immediate shortfalls identified, either through utilisation of the treatment abroad scheme or by commissioning services from abroad. <\/p><p><b>Next Steps<\/b><\/p><p>As requested by the CMO in July 2018, the pause in the use of mesh procedures for the management of SUI and POP in HSE-funded hospitals is ongoing, in cases where it is clinically appropriate and safe to do so, pending confirmation by the HSE of the implementation of recommendations.  <\/p><p>The Department of Health has written to the HSE to request that it prepare a detailed Implementation Plan for the complete set of recommendations set out in the CMO&rsquo;s Report, working in conjunction with other stakeholders. <\/p><p>As promised at my meeting with Mesh Survivors Ireland on June 14<sup>th<\/sup>2018, I provided the group with a copy of the CMO&rsquo;s Report on the date of publication and a date will be arranged for a further meeting with the group in the near future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800085#WRU00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vaccination Programme","counter":1046,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800085#WRU00900"},{"type":"question","counter":1047,"qnumday":437,"qnumall":"[53251\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800085#WRU01000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if a person and 400 plus girls here suffering adverse health effects from Gardasil relating to a treatment clinic (details supplied) will receive compensation in relation to same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1048,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive is committed to providing accurate information for parents about diseases, the vaccines to prevent them and potential side effects to allow them to choose whether or not to give consent to vaccination.  <\/p>  <p>  The HSE's National Immunisation Office has developed a comprehensive range of materials for parents, schools and medical practitioners as part of the immunisation programme.  All the information provided to parents about vaccination takes into account the available licensed documentation for each vaccine, the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) and Patient Information Leaflet (PIL).  <\/p>  <p>  The Patient Information Leaflet provides information on the vaccine, its uses and on any precautions that require advice from a healthcare professional before it is administered.  Therefore, like other countries providing school immunisation programmes, the Patient Information Leaflet is replaced by an information leaflet which provides the same information on the potential side effects of the vaccine in a manner that ensures that it is easily understood.<\/p>  <p>  The information is presented in clear and simple language which has been approved by the National Adult Literacy Agency, ensuring that it can be understood by all adults.  The Health Information and Quality Authority guide &lsquo;Communicating in plain English&rsquo; (2015), developed in partnership with NALA, states that &ldquo;one in six people find reading and understanding everyday texts difficult: for example, reading a health leaflet, bus timetable or medicine instructions&rdquo;.  <\/p>  <p>  Prior to all school immunisations, parents receive an information pack in a sealed package with an information leaflet, consent form and cover letter. The information packs for all immunisations are standardised nationally.  The information booklets include information on all the known potential side effects that can occur after each vaccination (as is the case with the HPV vaccine, Gardasil). Parents are also given contact details for their local immunisation office and advised to speak to a member of the school immunisation team if they have any further questions.<\/p>  <p>  It is not the case that parents are being denied the information on the Patient Information Leaflet.  In fact, the HSE parent information leaflet refers parents to the HPV website (hpv.ie) where links to additional information including the licensing documentation, the Summary of Products Characteristics and the Patient Information Leaflet for each vaccine can be found.  The HPV website has been endorsed by the World Health Organisation. <\/p>  <p>  The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is responsible for monitoring the safety and quality of all medicines including vaccines that are licensed in Ireland.  The HPRA operates a national adverse reaction reporting system, which members of the public and healthcare professionals are encouraged to submit any suspected adverse reactions to.  All Reports received by the HPRA are routinely transmitted to the European Medicines Agency's adverse reaction database for inclusion in global signal detection and monitoring activities.  <\/p>  <p>  The HPRA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) continually monitor adverse events relating to vaccination.  Gardasil is one of the most closely studied and monitored medicinal products.  The vast majority of reports received by the HPRA have been consistent with the expected pattern of short term adverse side effects for the vaccine, as described in the product information.  The most frequently reported side effects are local redness and\/or swelling at the point of injection and fever.  Fainting has occurred after vaccination with Gardasil, especially in adolescents.  Mild and temporary reactions to any kind of vaccination are not unusual. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to reiterate that all medicines, including vaccines are subject to on-going review and evaluation of all available data from a range of sources, including systematic scientific literature review, to consider any impact that their data may have on the overall assessment of the benefits and risks of a medicinal product.  Taking into account the totality of the available information, the benefits of the HPV vaccines continue to outweigh their risks.

The Forestry Programme, with a budget of &euro;500m, aims to increase afforestation levels in Ireland over its lifetime  by offering landowners a choice of 12 Grant and Premium Categories (GPCs) under a voluntary scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The National Forest Inventory (NFI) published a couple of months ago shows that the national forest estate is still expanding and has now reached 11% of the total land area, with a wide variety of forest types present. The total forest area has increased from 697,842 hectares (ha) in 2006 to 770,020 ha in 2017. The national forest estate is an important and expanding store of carbon, at 312 million tonnes. Based on the NFI data, Ireland&rsquo;s forests have removed an average of 3.8 Mt of carbon dioxide equivalents per year from the atmosphere over the period 2007 to 2016. This carbon resource has proven to be of pivotal significance in Ireland achieving its Kyoto target under the first commitment period of 2008-2012.<\/p>  <p>  It is worth noting that the Irish climate is ideally suited to growing trees and Irish forests have high rates of carbon sequestration. Ireland&rsquo;s forest policy is based on the principles of sustainable forest management and the balancing of environmental, economic, and social benefits of forests. This includes the promotion of a variety of tree species for afforestation. Although restrictions are in place around the type of land that can be planted and broadleaf species must be established on at least 15% of the grant-aided area, landowners can choose from a list of over thirty approved tree species. Afforestation of all types, sustainable forest management and the use of harvested wood products all have important roles to play in climate action irrespective of the species used.<\/p>  <p>  This Government is very committed to new afforestation and have set aside a budget of &euro;105m in 2019 to help fund new plantings and meet our stated targets under the National Forestry Programme. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800086#WRV04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fishing Industry","counter":1137,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800086#WRV04300"},{"type":"question","counter":1138,"qnumday":468,"qnumall":"[52716\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800086#WRV04400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his views on a matter (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1318","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1139,"content":"<p>Sprat is a short-lived species and an important prey fish for many marine species therefore it is a vital species to the ocean food chain as well as an important source of income for inshore fishermen. <\/p>  <p>  Sprat in Irish waters is not a species subject to fishing quotas or Total Allowable Catches established under EU regulation. Scientifically, relatively little is known about the sprat species. The International Council of the Exploration of the Seas (ICES) considers sprat to be a data limited stock which means that more detailed data is required in order to form a full understanding of the state of the stock. <\/p>  <p>  Available scientific information is that sprat in Ireland spawn from January to June with a fishery normally taking place from October to Christmas. This is a fortuitous situation, allowing some degree of reproductive output as the fishery takes place after the fish have been able to spawn. <\/p>  <p>  The Marine Institute, in cooperation with the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, have participated in a three-year research project which was partially funded by Industry, in order to address the lack of accurate information in respect of the sprat stocks in waters around Ireland. The aim of this project was to develop an accurate and detailed understanding of the stock structure of sprat around Ireland and the data collected will also contribute to the ICES assessment of the vulnerability or otherwise of sprat in the waters around Ireland. This project commenced in 2015 and is due to be completed in 2019. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to this research project, the Marine Institute, in close cooperation with Industry, participated in a number of observer trips in the sprat fishery in 2017 and 2018 the purpose of which was twofold:<\/p>  <p>  - To obtain biological information on the resource itself and on any other fishery bycatch, i.e. herring, juvenile mackerel, etc.<\/p>  <p>  - To obtain information on any bycatch this fishery might have of protected, endangered and threatened species, under the European maritime and fisheries fund (EMFF) marine biodiversity scheme such as marine mammals, seabirds and listed fish species.<\/p>  <p>  A risk assessment of fisheries interactions in Special Areas of Conservation (SAC) including for Harbour Seals in Kenmare Bay by the Marine Institute, noted that the risk posed by pelagic fishing on harbour seals through by-catch and disturbance of haul out locations was low. <\/p>  <p>  The Observer programme greatly increased the number of trips on board vessels fishing Sprat from about 2 trips per season to 15 trips in 2017. In 2018, sampling effort (7 trips) was focused on the south coast as the northwest had been well covered the previous year. Bycatch information from these data is preliminary and will be analysed once sufficient sampling over area and season has been achieved. The reason for fewer observer trips in 2018 is that the programme was concentrated in the South west where trips are logistically more difficult due to greater diversity of vessels and ports as well as longer trips.<\/p>  <p>  A public consultation process to examine the arrangements for trawling inside the six nautical mile zone and inside the baselines ended on 11 June 2018.<\/p>  <p>  Over 900 responses were received in relation to the public consultation and these have been carefully examined.

IFI also has to regard EU legislation, most notably the Habitats Directive under which salmon habitats are protected. <\/p>  <p>  Scientific and management assessments of each of the distinct stocks, including the river Feale, are carried out every year with IFI engaged in extensive stock monitoring which feeds into the SSC's annual reviews. The SSC analyses data from the previous five years and an average of the 5 years of data is used to estimate expected returns for the coming year. The use of a 5 year average ensures that a good or bad year does not have a disproportionate impact on the stock assessment in any single year.<\/p>  <p>  The SSC uses a number of data sets in assessing the salmon stock on the river Feale. The stock is assessed using the fish counter located at Scartleigh dam. In addition, the commercial catch in the Feale and the rod caught salmon killed figure below the counter are added to fish counter numbers to calculate the total annual salmon return to the river. <\/p>  <p>  This is the consistent methodology used each year by the SSC and has underpinned the status of the river as \"open for harvest\" over recent years. The average of the most recent 5 years of data 2014-2018 used for this years review has, however, demonstrated that the river is regarded as below its established conservation limit. This has resulted in the proposal to close the river to all harvest fishing (either commercial or rod and line), in line with the conservation imperative. It is proposed to open the Feale for catch and release angling. <\/p>  <p>  The counter is a one channel counter operated on the crump weir which was installed to assist fish passage over the large weir. I am advised that this counter provides consistently accurate data. A new camera was installed early in the summer of 2017 for counter verification purposes.

The new north south interconnector will facilitate substantial increases in capacity transfers, thereby facilitating a more effective single electricity market.<\/p>  <p>  Interconnection helps ensure that only the most efficient and low carbon generation is brought onto the grid.

This effort is being overseen by the Climate Action and Environment area of my Department, which is headed up at Assistant Secretary level. <\/p>  <p>  Since my appointment I have met with the SEAI, EirGrid, the ESB and the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) and I have emphasised the importance of prioritising the climate action agenda and increasing our ambition in this area. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, officials in my Department are working closely with ESB Networks, EirGrid and the CRU to ensure that renewable electricity projects are connected as soon as possible to the electricity grid and that the current deadlines are met in order to maximise their contribution to the 2020 target.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800088#WRX04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Exploration Licences","counter":1263,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800088#WRX04400"},{"type":"question","counter":1264,"qnumday":510,"qnumall":"[53001\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800088#WRX04500","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the status of the review under way regarding the option to give him the legislative basis on which to screen mineral exploration drilling under EIA directive; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1216","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":1265,"content":"<p>A regulation, amending the Minerals Development Acts and which provides the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment with the statutory authority to undertake screening for Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), in line with EU Directive 2011\/92\/EU as amended by Directive 2014\/52\/EU, was signed on  28 September 2018.

This is being achieved via a combination of commercial investment and a State led intervention. <\/p>  <p>  The NBP State led Intervention focuses on areas where industry investment has not been demonstrated. <\/p>  <p>  Under EU State Aid Guidelines, it is a requirement that Member States thoroughly evaluate commercial plans so as to ensure that State Aid is confined to those areas of well-defined market failure, where investment is unlikely to occur in the near future. <\/p>  <p>  In March 2015 my Department published and issued a request for supplementary information to operators on commercial plans for investment in high speed broadband. In October 2015 my Department published the process to assess commercial operators' investment plans. Plans received from commercial operators were subsequently assessed under these published technical, deployment and financial criteria. Both the request for supplementary information and the criteria for assessment of commercial plans are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.broadband.gov.ie. <\/p>  <p>  Following this exercise, my Department published the High Speed Broadband Map in December 2015. The Map sets out the extent of planned commercial investment in high speed broadband (BLUE and LIGHT BLUE on the current map), and the areas where commercial operators have indicated they will not be investing (AMBER on the current map).<\/p>  <p>  Between November 2016 and March 2017, my Department received and assessed plans from eir regarding proposals to roll out high speed broadband to 300,000 premises in the AMBER area on a commercial basis. <\/p>  <p>  In the context of this assessment, my Department also engaged with the European Commission on State Aid implications, and consulted with ComReg regarding pricing on eir&rsquo;s proposed network.<\/p>  <p>  My Department concluded that the proposal represented a credible investment plan to provide high speed broadband to 300,000 premises that at the time were included in the intervention area. On the basis that eir had provided credible plans for investment there was no basis for a State intervention for those premises. In April 2017, my Department signed a Commitment Agreement with eir regarding its their deployment. <\/p>  <p>  The NBP High Speed Broadband Map was amended to reflect eir&rsquo;s deployment, as well as the moving of some 84,500 premises into the AMBER area, as it had become clear that commercial operators were unlikely to deliver high speed broadband services to them.<\/p>  <p>  The Intervention Area therefore changed from 757,000 (at end 2015) to 542,000 (April 2017). Following that development, the Intervention Area was finalised for the duration of the procurement process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800088#WRX05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Warmer Homes Scheme Data","counter":1270,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800088#WRX05100"},{"type":"question","counter":1271,"qnumday":512,"qnumall":"[53079\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800088#WRX05200","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the number of households that have availed of the warmer homes scheme in each of the years since its commencement, by county or local authority; and the number and value of grants in each year issued by each local authority.","asker":"1222","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":1272,"content":"<p>The Warmer Homes scheme has been in operation since 2000 and provides free energy efficiency upgrades to low income homeowners living in or at risk of energy poverty.

Heating controls are an excellent way to control a household's energy usage and improve comfort. The grant for heating controls has now been increased to &euro;700 and no payment is now made for boiler upgrades. At the same time grant levels for external wall insulation and the introduction of a new grant for the installation of a heat pump, which is a renewable heating system were announced. Taken together, all of this is a concrete demonstration of the Government's commitment to support householders to move away from fossil fuel technologies. There are currently no plans to reintroduce a grant for boiler replacements under this scheme.  <\/p>  <p>  The Warmer Homes scheme is also funded by my Department and operated by SEAI. This scheme is a free energy upgrade scheme for low income homeowners.

The provision of mobile telecommunications services is subject to a requirement to secure a wireless telegraphy licence to access the required radio spectrum. The award of such licences, including the application of qualifying terms and conditions such as quality of service and minimum population coverage, and the associated monitoring of compliance by licensed providers with those terms and conditions is a matter for the statutorily independent Communications Regulator, ComReg.<\/p>  <p>  With respect to the quality of mobile telephony service in other countries, comparisons between Member States and within regions can be problematic for many reasons, including the fact that the technical characteristics of mobile phone networks that determine coverage and capacity will vary between operators and locations.

The Programme for Government specifically included a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce. The Taskforce worked with key stakeholders to produce a report in December 2016, available on my Department&rsquo;s website, containing 40 actions to alleviate some of the deficits.

Following close engagement with stakeholders at the inaugural National Stakeholder Forum 2017, an additional 23 new measures were identified for delivery in 2018.

Notwithstanding this, over 90% of all energy used in Ireland in 2017 was from fossil fuels. <\/p><p>Details of the proportions of electricity generated from oil, gas, coal, wind, solar or other renewable sources are available in Table 8 <i>&ldquo;<\/i>Growth rates, quantities and shares of electricity generated by fuel&rdquo; on page 29 of the report.<\/p><p>There are no specific international requirements on the composition of electricity generation in the fuel mix. The EU Renewable Energy Directive 2009\/28\/EC set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020. Ireland is committed to achieving this target through meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heat and 10% of transport from renewable sources of energy. The SEAI analysis states that 10.6% of Ireland's overall energy requirements in 2017 were met from renewable sources. This avoided 4.1 million tonnes of CO2 emissions and &euro;439 million of fossil fuel imports. Ireland achieved 30.1% of electricity, 6.9% of heat and 7.4% of transport energy requirements using renewable energy sources in 2017. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800090#WRZ01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Waste Management","counter":1359,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800090#WRZ01500"},{"type":"question","counter":1360,"qnumday":546,"qnumall":"[53463\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800090#WRZ01600","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the extent to which landfill sites are being replaced with alternative means of waste disposal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":1361,"content":"<p>European, national and regional waste policy are all predicated on the management of waste in line with the waste hierarchy, whereby the prevention, preparation for re-use, recycling and other recovery of waste are preferred (in that order) to the disposal of waste.

Building on the strategy and a number of recently completed projects which have already improved public transport capacity and quality, the National Development Plan 2018-2027 identifies a number of major investments in public transport for Dublin.  The NDP commits to delivering the new Metrolink, the DART Expansion Programme, and BusConnects Dublin. <\/p><p>Planning of these major public transport investment projects is underway and is scheduled for delivery progressively over the lifetime of the NDP.  <\/p><p>Meanwhile, in the shorter term, a range of other measures are being undertaken that will help ensure the more effective functioning of public transport services in Dublin.  These include: <\/p><p>- improving timetables to intensify the frequency of passenger services, as has happened this year on both PSO bus and rail networks;  <\/p><p>- expansion of the PSO bus fleet, which has increased by approximately 17% in recent years and will increase again next year;<\/p><p>- extending trams on the Luas Green Line and increasing the number of trams on the line too; and<\/p><p>- providing upgraded cycling and walking infrastructure, and a number of significant projects are due to commence construction in 2019. <\/p><p>The NTA meets regularly with the relevant local authorities and public transport service providers to monitor and react to traffic issues in Dublin and to identify and implement service improvements.

Kerry.<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased to note that the service in question has successfully availed of the Early Years Capital funding strand provided by my Department.<\/p>  <p>  Clearly the 2018 Early Years and School Age Capital programmes have concluded, and their budget has been allocated in full.  Work in my Department is currently being finalised to prepare for the Capital offering for 2019 and an announcement is expected to issue on this shortly.  Following this, I will invite services to submit an application under the measure, should they be in a position to meet the specified programme criteria.<\/p>  <p>  Services who are concerned about their future sustainability can also avail of a range of supports offered by my Department.  I would advise the service in question to contact both Pobal and Kerry County Childcare Committee, outlining in detail the current situation and the challenges they face.  Pobal has a dedicated team that assess services facing crisis situations, and upon reviewing the particulars of the case, they may be in a position to offer valuable operational guidance and support. <\/p>  <p>  I note that the service provider is aware of the recent report circulated from Mercer which was commissioned by the National Childhood Network in conjunction with Crann Support Group.  I have been unequivocal in my support for better pay and conditions for staff in the sector. Early Learning and Care practitioners, in pre-school setting and elsewhere, play a critical role for families and they deserve to be recognised, valued and respected for this.<\/p>  <p>  However, my Department is not the employer of early learning and care sector staff and cannot set wage levels.  I have supported a range of measures to improve pay and conditions however using the tools available to me.  In particular, my Department has seen a 117% increase in investment in the sector over the last four budgets.  Twice as many children are receiving Government childcare subsidies than were doing so three years ago.  The number of services is remaining relatively the same, so this increased investment should be seen in staff working conditions.  The 7% increase in ECCE capitation this September and the &euro;55 million in Programme Support Payments which will, by the end of next year, have been paid to services over a three year period, are particular features of the increased investment.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware of the difficulties reported by providers in recruiting staff. I am seeking continued investment to address this issue and to address the wider issue of attracting and retaining staff across the early years sector.<\/p>  <p>  The evidence from the latest Pobal report shows an 8% increase in staff in the sector in this year alone and a continued growth in the proportion of staff with specialised third-level qualifications in Early Learning and Care.  Turnover of staff in the sector has also decreased by 3%, but it remains unacceptably high and it is the case that more must be done to retain early years staff to ensure high quality services to our children.<\/p>  <p>  Under First 5, a Whole of Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families, published last month, my Department and the Department of Education and Skills have committed to delivering a new Workforce Development Plan for the early learning and care sector.  The Workforce Development Plan will examine and address the impact of a rapidly changing policy and practice landscape in the sector on future skills requirements, so that Government can ensure that a high quality workforce is in place over the next decade. Work on the plan will begin early in 2019.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800092#WRBB01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child and Family Agency Staff","counter":1476,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800092#WRBB01400"},{"type":"question","counter":1477,"qnumday":585,"qnumall":"[52898\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800092#WRBB01500","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if all Tusla CEOs to date have been appointed through open competition; and if not, the methodology used to select the winning candidate in each case.","asker":"1259","askee":"1358"},{"type":"question","counter":1478,"qnumday":586,"qnumall":"[52899\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800092#WRBB01600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if an open competition for the post of Tusla CEO is being run by the Public Appointments Service; and if not, the reason therefor.","asker":"1259","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1479,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 585 and 586 together.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla, the Child and Family Agency was established on the 1 January, 2014, following the enactment of the Child and Family Agency Act, 2013.

It is often the case that new evidence is provided with an appeal and that, as a result, the original decision may be revised by the Deciding Officer or Designated Person.  This was the case in 37.1% of favourable appeal outcomes in 2016, 37.6% of such outcomes in 2017 and 31.5% of such outcomes to the end of November 2018.<\/p><p>Where the decision was not revised by the Department in light of the appeal contentions, further evidence is often provided by the appellant as the appeal process proceeds and in addition, the Appeals Officer may gain insights when they meet the appellant in person at oral hearing which may influence the outcome of the appeal.<\/p><p>All claim decisions taken by the Department&rsquo;s Deciding Officers and Designated Persons are appealable to the Chief Appeals Officer.  In any year about 85% of all claims are awarded by the Department and just 1% are appealed.  Nevertheless, the Department is concerned that these cases are dealt with as quickly as possible.<\/p><p>Accordingly, significant efforts and resources have been devoted to reforming the appeal process in recent years.  As a result, appeal processing times in respect of all schemes improved between 2011 and 2017 from 52.5 weeks for an oral hearing in 2011 to 26.4 weeks in 2017 and from 25.1 weeks for a summary decision in 2011 to 19.8 weeks in 2017.  The corresponding processing times for the period January to November 2018 are 30.1 weeks for an oral hearing and 25.1 weeks for a summary decision.<\/p><p>The time taken to process an appeal reflects a number of factors including that the appeals process is a quasi-judicial process with appeals officers being required to decide all appeals on a &lsquo;de-novo&rsquo; basis.  In addition, appeals decisions are themselves subject to review by the High Court and decisions have to be formally written up to quasi-judicial standards.  Other factors that influence appeals processing times include the quality of the initial decision &ndash; in this respect the Department has changed the decisions process in respect of medical schemes, in order to provide more information to the claimant.

The first refers to the percentage of the population who were &ldquo;unable to afford a meal with meat, chicken or fish every second day&rdquo;.  In 2017, the latest year for which data is available and which was released by the CSO earlier this week,  this was 1.7%, down from 4.2% in 2013 when the effects of the recession were most felt.   The second refers to the percentage of the population who were &ldquo;unable to afford a roast once a week&rdquo;.  In 2017, this was 5.3%, a decrease from the 2013 figure of 8.1%.  <\/p>  <p>  The primary role of the social welfare income supports provided through my Department is to sustain an adequate standard of living and to prevent poverty, including food poverty.  The Irish social welfare system is relatively successful in this role.  The 2017 Survey on Income and Living Conditions data, released by the CSO this week, show that social transfers (excluding pensions) reduced the at-risk-of-poverty rate from 32.3 per cent to 15.7 per cent, representing a poverty reduction effect of 51 per cent.  Ireland continues to be one the best performing EU member states in this regard, and this reflects the Government commitment to protect core weekly welfare rates during the recession.<\/p>  <p>  Difficulty in meeting regular ongoing needs may result from a family encountering exceptional once-off expenditures.  In this regard, under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, my Department may make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.<\/p>  <p>  My Department also administers the Fund for European Aid for the Most Deprived (FEAD) which provides food and basic consumer products to people most at risk.  In 2017, through a network of charitable partnership organisations, the Department distributed almost 1,000 tonnes of food to over 96,000 people in communities throughout the country, either in the form of food parcels or as meals prepared by charitable organisations.  The Department's FEAD budget for 2018 is &euro;8m, of which &euro;4.5m is allocated to ongoing food distribution with the remainder allocated to the distribution of material assistance in the areas of homelessness, school kits and new migrants. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the School Meals programme provides funding for a breakfast for all children and lunch for up to 90% of children in DEIS schools for the entire school year from September to June.  Breakfasts are also now available in some school outside DEIS.  Funding towards school meals is being provided in over 1,580 schools and other organisations, supporting over 248,000 children at a cost of some &euro;54 million in 2018.  I was also pleased to announce, as part of the Budget 2019 package, the introduction of a pilot scheme to provide hot school meals.  The pilot, which will run from September 2019, will fund up to 36 schools to provide hot school means to up to 7,200 children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800093#WRCC02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Working Family Payment Applications","counter":1560,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800093#WRCC03000"},{"type":"question","counter":1561,"qnumday":613,"qnumall":"[52737\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800093#WRCC03100","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"when a decision will issue on an application by a person (details supplied) for a working family payment; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1366","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1562,"content":"<p>Working Family Payment (WFP) is a weekly tax-free payment which provides additional income support to employees on low earnings with children.<\/p><p>An application for WFP was received from the person concerned on 12 October 2018.<\/p><p>WFP is not payable while an applicant is a Qualified Adult (QA) on their spouse's Jobseeker's Allowance.

It is not necessary for anyone to contact the Department on this matter.  <\/p>  <p>  Work on examination of the social insurance records of the pensioners concerned commenced in September.  As social insurance records are unique to individual pensioners, this manual examination phase is expected to continue to the end of the year.  To date, over seventy temporary staff members have been recruited to work on this phase.  Further recruitment will take place in January 2019 when the first pension reviews are expected to get under way, following enactment of enabling legislation.

The estimated cost of extending illness benefit to the self-employed would be &euro;40m in the first year rising to &euro;331m by 2071.  The review shows that when considering the increased equalised contributions for the 20 year period beginning in 2018 PRSI Class S would need to increase by 20% to 4.8%, in the absence of exchequer subventions.<\/p>  <p>  The review indicates that, where the four benefits examined are extended to the self-employed, the class S rate of PRSI contribution would need to increase substantially in order to ensure that the benefits are delivered in a revenue neutral manner.  It estimates that when expenditure on the additional benefits is considered over the entire projection period, PRSI rates would need to increase by 94% under a scenario of no subvention from the exchequer.  This is equivalent to an increase of the Class S contribution rate from the current 4% rate to 7.8%.<\/p>  <p>  This increased contribution is attributable to the costs of extending these additional benefits to PRSI class S contributors.  It does not take account of the value to PRSI class S contributors of access to the range of existing benefits, and in particular State pension contributory.  The consultants estimated that the typical cost of State pension (contributory) on its own is of the order of 10% to 15%, depending on other factors including rate of average earnings and date of commencing paying PRSI.  Adding in the other benefits referenced the total class S rate of contribution to ensure revenue neutrality would be of the order of 20% per annum.<\/p>  <p>  Self-employed workers who earn &euro;5,000 or more in a contribution year, are liable for PRSI at the class S rate of 4%, subject to a minimum annual payment of &euro;500.  This provides them with access to the following benefits: State pension (contributory), widow&rsquo;s, widower&rsquo;s or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s pension (contributory), guardian&rsquo;s payment (contributory), maternity benefit, adoptive benefit, paternity benefit and treatment benefit.  Entitlement to invalidity pension was extended to the self-employed from December 2017.  As you aware extension of jobseeker's benefit was announced in Budget 2019.<\/p>  <p>  This compares favourably with employees who, in general, are liable to the class A rate of 4%.  In addition their employers are liable to PRSI at the rate of 8.6% on weekly earnings up to and including &euro;376 or at the rate of 10.85% where weekly earnings exceed &euro;376.  Accordingly the combined rate of PRSI rate paid in respect of class A employees is 12.6% or 14.85%, depending on the level of weekly earnings.  These class A employees are entitled to the full range of social insurance benefits. <\/p>  <p>  While the very short term financial position of the SIF is more favourable than that envisaged in the actuarial review it should be noted that the medium and long terms trends still are valid.<\/p>  <p>  The findings of the Review will play an important role in informing the overall debate on policy developments in relation to the SIF in the years ahead, including the financial sustainability of the Fund given the expected demographic challenges and consideration of extending the scope of benefits for workers generally, including the self-employed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800094#WRDD03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Pension (Non-Contributory)","counter":1627,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800094#WRDD03500"},{"type":"question","counter":1628,"qnumday":635,"qnumall":"[53243\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800094#WRDD03600","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the procedures in place to identify persons on non-contributory pensions who can benefit from the total contributions system being introduced for the post-2012 contributory pensioners; when they will be reviewed; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1284","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1629,"content":"<p>On 23 January last, the Government agreed to allow pensioners, born on or after the 1st September 1946, affected by the 2012 changes in rate bands, to have their state pension (contributory) entitlement calculated under an interim &ldquo;Total Contributions Approach&rdquo; (TCA).

This approach is expected to significantly benefit many people, particularly women, whose work history includes an extended period of time outside the paid workplace, while raising families or in a caring role.  The TCA will ensure that the totality of a person&rsquo;s social insurance contributions - as opposed to the timing of them - determines their final pension outcome.  The HomeCaring Periods can be claimed for any year in which they occurred - they are not limited to years since 1994.<\/p>  <p>  People whose pensions were decided under the 2000-2012 ratebands were subject to a significantly more generous regime than those who qualified before or afterwards, as a Yearly Average of only 20 contributions per year (out of a maximum of 52) could attract a 98% pension.  The effect of those changes, as it impacted upon those new pensioners since 2012, will be familiar to anyone who followed the debate on this matter over the last 6 years.  If pre-2012 pensioners were also allowed avail of HomeCaring Credits, their arrangements, as a group, would continue to be significantly more generous than those of post-2012 pensioners.  There would also be a very significant cost which would be expected to be of the order of several hundred millions of euros each year.

For new claimants, weekly allowance rates were reduced from &euro;204.30 to &euro;100. <\/p><p>It is expected that this report will be made available early in 2019 and the results of the research will feed into the review being conducted by my Department.<\/p><p>I am committed to ensuring my Department operates effective measures to support young people in finding and securing sustainable jobs.

The NPPR charge, which has since been discontinued, applied in the years 2009 to 2013 to any residential property in which the owner did not reside as their normal place of residence.<\/p><p>The self-assessed charge is set at &euro;200 per annum and liability for it falls, in the main, on owners of rental, holiday and vacant properties.  Section 6 of the 2009 Act, as amended, provides that the owner of a liable property who fails to pay the charge, in addition to being liable for the charge, is liable to pay a &euro;20 late payment fee in respect of each month or part of a month in which the charge, any late payment fee, or any part of such charge or fee, remains unpaid.<\/p><p>Part 12 of the Local Government Reform Act 2014 also deals with the collection of undischarged liabilities relating to the NPPR charge.  The Act provided for a period from 2 March 2014 to 31 August 2014 during which time no new late penalties were applied to existing liabilities.  If payment was not made in full or if settlement terms were not agreed by the end of that period, an additional late payment fee of &euro;120 per liability date applied on 1 September 2014.  As the charge applied in each of the years from 2009 to 2013, there were five liability dates &ndash; 31 July 2009 and 31 March for each of the years 2010 to 2013.  In addition to this late payment fee to be applied per liability date, the entire NPPR liability is then increased by a factor of 50% and frozen.<\/p><p>Under the Act, it is a function of a local authority to collect NPPR charges and late payment fees due to it, and all charges and late payment fees imposed and payable to a local authority are under the care and management of the local authority concerned.  In this regard, application of the legislation in particular circumstances is a matter for the relevant local authority.<\/p><p>In July 2009 my Department issued guidelines to local authorities to assist in implementing the Act. Included in these guidelines was advice on how property where the owner was deceased was to be treated.  In effect, if probate on a property had not yet been granted, the property was to be treated as if it had no owner as there would be no person who would satisfy the definition of owner in the Act.  If probate had been granted then the charge would be a liability on the estate.<\/p><p>Subsequently section 19(f) of the Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 inserted section 4(7) into the Act to provide that where a person who is the sole owner of a residential property died, the personal representative of the deceased person would not be liable to the NPPR charge which fell due after the date of death of the deceased and before the date of issue of a grant of representation. <\/p><p>Under section 77 of the Local Government Reform Act 2014, my Department issued guidance to local authorities concerning matters relating to arrears of the NPPR charge and late payment fees to ensure that a consistent national approach is adopted.  The guidelines, which are available at , encourage local authorities to take a proactive approach to ensure that any outstanding NPPR liabilities are discharged in the most equitable, efficient and economically beneficial manner and include guidance in respect of dealing with hardship cases.  It is expected, in the majority of cases, that local authorities will collect the full NPPR charge liability from owners.  In some cases, this may be by means of arrangement by instalment.  Owners with queries may contact their local authority to discuss any matters they wish to clarify and to make any outstanding payments. <\/p><p>Should an initial claim of hardship be rejected by a local authority, the claimant should also be afforded, if requested, a further appeal to a more senior officer in the local authority.  Ultimately, should a subsequent appeal be unsuccessful the complainant should be notified as early as is possible.  Claimants should also be informed that if they are still not happy with the determination they can appeal to the Office of the Ombudsman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800095#WREE02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Closed-Circuit Television Systems Provision","counter":1678,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800095#WREE02600"},{"type":"question","counter":1679,"qnumday":653,"qnumall":"[52736\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800095#WREE02700","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the annual amount of funding provided to each local authority to carry out responsibilities as data controllers for community CCTV schemes; the expected amount of funding that will be provided to local authorities to carry out this work in 2019; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1216","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1680,"content":"<p>My Department has no policy responsibility in relation to community CCTV matters and, accordingly, does not provide specific funding to local authorities in respect of their responsibilities as data controllers for community CCTV schemes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800095#WREE02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"NAMA Property Sales","counter":1681,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800095#WREE02900"},{"type":"question","counter":1682,"qnumday":654,"qnumall":"[52805\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800095#WREE03000","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the removal of height restrictions has a major upward impact on the site value of the lands and that the price obtained for land disposed of by NAMA recently is considerably less than what could have been obtained; and if his Department discussed the likely impacts with NAMA officials before they disposed of lands.","asker":"1367","askee":"1295"},{"type":"question","counter":1683,"qnumday":655,"qnumall":"[52806\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800095#WREE03100","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if NAMA had been informed of the forthcoming change to height regulations but continued to completion with such sales; if so, the reason NAMA was permitted to dispose of such sites at considerable discount to their subsequent revaluation; and if he was advised of these sales and-or disposals prior to the announcement on height restrictions.","asker":"1367","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1684,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 654 and 655 together.<\/p><p>I recently issued planning guidelines titled &rsquo;<i>Urban Development and Building Height&rsquo;<\/i>to planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la, under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended. <\/p><p>The guidelines were issued following a period of public consultation, which took place over August and September of this year, and after consideration of submissions received. <\/p><p>The guidelines set out national planning policy on building heights in relation to urban areas, as defined by the census, and arise from the strategic policy framework set out in Project Ireland 2040 and the National Planning Framework (NPF).<\/p><p>The guidelines:<\/p><p>- develop urban planning policy outlined in the National Planning Framework, in particular National Policy Objective 13;<\/p><p>- outline wider and strategic policy considerations and performance criteria that planning authorities should apply, alongside their statutory development plans, in assessing proposals for taller buildings; and<\/p><p>- support the accommodation of anticipated population growth and development needs, whether for housing, employment or other purposes, by building up and consolidating the development of our existing urban areas.<\/p><p>The ownership, sale of lands or financial aspects of same were not a consideration in the preparation or intent of these guidelines for planning authorities in the discharge of their statutory functions.

This programme has been developed by my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment. <\/p><p>Two Foreshore Leases have been granted in respect of offshore wind farms, the Arklow Bank Wind Farm and Codling I Bank Wind Park Farm, off the Wicklow coast, in 2002 and 2005.

The Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the performance of his functions under the Acts and the making of valuations for rating is his sole responsibility. I, as Minister, have no function in decisions in this regard. <\/p><p>The Deputy may be aware that, under the relevant legislation, there is a distinct separation of function between the valuation of rateable property and the setting and collection of commercial rates. The amount of rates payable in any calendar year is a product of the valuation set by the Commissioner of Valuation, multiplied by the Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV) decided annually by the elected members of each local authority. <\/p><p>Having a modern valuation base is very important for the levying of commercial rates on a fair and equitable basis across all economic sectors. The Valuation Acts provide for the revaluation of all rateable property within a rating authority area so as to reflect changes in value due to economic factors such as business turnover, differential movements in property values or other external factors and changes in the local business environment. <\/p><p>A valuation for commercial rates purposes is arrived at by estimating the <i>Net Annual Value<\/i>(NAV) of the property in question, at a specified valuation date. The term &ldquo;net annual value&rdquo; has a legal definition and is set out in section 48 of the Valuation Act 2001 as &ldquo;the rent for which, one year with another, the property might, in its actual state, be reasonably expected to let from year to year, on the assumption that the probable average annual cost of repairs, insurance and other expenses (if any) that would be necessary to maintain the property in that state, and all rates and other taxes payable in respect of the property, are borne by the tenant&rdquo;. This definition of Net Annual Value is applied to all rateable properties and on a nationwide basis.<\/p><p>Estimating the NAV of a rateable property is an evidence-based exercise. During a revaluation, the Valuation Office analyses relevant market rental transactions for all rateable properties in accordance with the legislation, best practice internationally as set out in published Practice Guidance Notes, well-established valuation principles and case law arising from the independent Valuation Tribunal and the higher Courts. The conclusions drawn from that analysis are applied to similarly circumstanced property using the &ldquo;comparative&rdquo; method of valuation which, as the name implies, employs direct comparison with other similar properties. <\/p><p>There are a number of avenues of redress for an occupier of rateable property who is dissatisfied with a determination of valuation made under the provisions of the Valuation Acts 2001-2015. Firstly, before a determination is made, there is a right to make representations to the Valuation Office in relation to a proposed valuation. Later in the process, if the occupier is still dissatisfied with the determination, there is a right of appeal to the Valuation Tribunal which is an independent body set up for the purpose of hearing appeals against determinations of the Valuation Office. There is a right of appeal to the Higher Courts on a point of law. Appeals are made on an individual case basis. However, the decision in one case can have relevance in other similar cases.<\/p><p>There is no provision in the legislation for taking a &ldquo;class&rdquo; or group appeal before the Tribunal, as each case is considered on its individual merits and by reference to the specific circumstances of the property. However, individual appellants can make arguments to the Valuation Tribunal in relation to their concerns about the overall valuation methodology adopted by the Valuation Office for a specific category of rateable property.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding this, I am informed that it is possible for a Test case to be heard by the Valuation Tribunal. In order to proceed with a Test case all parties involved must agree that such an approach is appropriate.  In addition, such a process must be entered into on the clear understanding that the determination of the Valuation Tribunal in the Test case would set a precedent which would without exception apply to the remaining cases identified as being part of the test case series and only these cases.  All cases involved would have to be similarly circumstanced.  A Test case would be identified and nominated through mutual agreement.  This particular case would then be heard by the Valuation Tribunal.  <\/p><p>The need for attention to detail and confirmation of such cannot be underestimated in the use of a Test case.  The determination of the Valuation Tribunal would be applied to the nominated Test case and all other cases identified as being part of the Test case series and only these cases.  The Valuation Tribunal would be advised in advance that the case being heard was a test case and would be relevant for these other cases. The right of appeal to the Higher Courts on a point of law for either the appellant or respondent still applies in a Test case situation.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800096#WRFF01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1265"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fire Safety","counter":1722,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800096#WRFF01100"},{"type":"question","counter":1723,"qnumday":668,"qnumall":"[53161\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121800096#WRFF01200","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if apartment owners whose homes have serious safety defects due to the way in which fire safety certificates were previously self-regulated will receive assistance to cover the costs of the necessary remedial works to make their homes fire safety compliant; and his plans to follow the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government recommendation to introduce a redress scheme to assist such homeowners who were unaware there were issues relating to the matter.","asker":"1255","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1724,"content":"<p>In the first instance, I would like to acknowledge the stressful circumstances which the owners and residents of buildings face when defects occur in their homes.<\/p><p>However, in general, building defects are matters for resolution between the contracting parties involved: the homeowner, the builder, the developer and\/or their respective insurers, structural guarantee or warranty scheme. It is important to note that while my Department has overall responsibility for establishing and maintaining an effective regulatory framework for building standards and building control it has no general statutory role in resolving defects in privately owned buildings, including dwellings, nor does it have a budget for such matters.<\/p><p>In the case of multi-unit developments, the legislative position is very clear in terms of where responsibilities rest.  Indeed, under the Building Control Acts 1990 to 2014 primary responsibility for compliance of works with the requirements of the Building Regulations, rests with the owners, designers and builders of buildings. Enforcement of the Building Regulations is a matter for the 31 local building control authorities who have extensive powers of inspection and enforcement under the Acts and who are independent in the use of their statutory powers. <\/p><p>It should be noted that when a building is constructed and occupied, statutory responsibility for safety is assigned by section 18(2) of the Fire Services Acts, 1981 &amp;amp; 2003, to the &lsquo;person having control&rsquo; of the building. The person having control is required to take reasonable measures to guard against the outbreak of fire and to ensure the safety of persons in the event of fire. In multi-unit developments, the &quot;person having control&quot; is generally the owner management company. Under the Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011, the owner management company must establish a scheme for annual service charges and a sinking fund for spending on refurbishment, improvement or maintenance of a non-recurring nature of the multi-unit development.<\/p><p>In the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower tragedy in June 2017, and in recognition of fears expressed for fire safety, my Department's National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management was asked to convene a Task Force to lead a re-appraisal of our approach to fire safety in Ireland.
