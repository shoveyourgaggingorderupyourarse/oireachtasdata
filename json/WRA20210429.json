Initially, this meant the adaptation or expansion of existing schemes to ensure support could be in place as quickly as possible. The first two such schemes to launch were the COVID-19 Business Loan available from Microfinance Ireland [MFI] and the COVID-19 Working Capital Scheme [WCS]. <\/p>  <p>  MFI provides vital support to microenterprises by filling the lending gap in the market by lending to businesses that cannot obtain loans from other commercial lenders. It lends to business that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by commercial lenders and applies interest rate charges for its lending which are not reflective of its credit risk. <\/p>  <p>  Subsidised rates of interest have been applied in respect of MFI&rsquo;s COVID-19 Business Loan with an interest rate of 4.5% available to all micro-enterprises where the application is made through the Local Enterprise Network or where referred by a bank or Local Development Committee. The new rate for direct applications to MFI is reduced to 5.5%.<\/p>  <p>  Under the terms of the SBCI COVID-19 WCS, the maximum interest rate that can be applied to a loan is 4%, which represents a significant saving when compared with other similar lending in the market. <\/p>  <p>  While these adapted supports were deployed as quickly as possible, work was also under way on the development of a tailored loan guarantee scheme to fit the specific needs of COVID-19-impacted businesses. Launched in September of 2020, the COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme [CGS] makes up to &euro;2b in lending available to businesses that have been negatively impacted by the pandemic. Where eligible, the scheme also allows for the refinancing of other COVID-19-related debt. <\/p>  <p>  The COVID-19 CGS was developed with the specific goal of widening the pool of participating lending institutions. To that end, the participating finance providers under the scheme include three banks, four non-bank lenders, and nineteen credit unions. The delivery of these schemes through commercial finance providers allows the Government to leverage existing lending infrastructure that these lenders have in place around the country, ensuring accessibility for impacted businesses. <\/p>  <p>  However, the operation of loan schemes through commercial finance providers also means that there is less scope to bring the interest rates down further than they are at present, as some interest must be charged by lenders if they are to cover overheads and capital costs if they are to continue to work with Government. <\/p>  <p>  Significant effort was made to achieve the lowest interest rates possible under the scheme, but there are capital requirements that the participating finance providers must meet, as well as costs to them in delivering the scheme. As such, there is a variation in interest rates depending on the lender and the details of the loan sought, though 96% of loans drawn under the scheme have been provided at interest rates of between 2.5% and 2.99%.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted also that each of the loan guarantee schemes described above allow for moratoria or interest-only payment periods, depending on the participating providers&rsquo; assessment. This should also help in providing a degree of flexibility for businesses approaching reopening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900069#WRB01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1505"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","counter":21,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900069#WRB01200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Waste Management","counter":20,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900069#WRB01100"},{"type":"question","counter":21,"qnumday":6,"qnumall":"[22424\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900069#WRB01200","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"his plans to introduce new extended producer responsibility schemes for the collection and processing of waste streams and to create stricter obligations within the existing schemes; the parameters of such schemes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1549","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":22,"content":"<p>The\u00a0Waste Action Plan for a Circular Economy outlined the\u00a0commitments to set up new Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR)\u00a0schemes for the waste streams covered by\u00a0the Single Use Plastics\u00a0 Directive\u00a0including tobacco products, balloons, wet wipes and fishing gear.\u00a0The\u00a0introduction\u00a0of EPR arrangements for other waste streams such\u00a0as\u00a0textiles, bulky waste, paint, medicines and farm hazardous wastes will also be progressed over the lifetime of the Plan.

Taxi and other small public service vehicle (SPSV) operators, who are particularly dependent on the hospitality and tourism sectors, have faced a particularly pronounced drop in demand for their services.<\/p>  <p>  It is in recognition of these difficulties that the Government has introduced a wide-ranging programme of supports with broad eligibility criteria for individuals and businesses which have been adversely affected by COVID-19. Many of these supports can be accessed by self-employed taxi drivers including liquidity and investment measures from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, as well as the Enterprise Support Grant and the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) from the Department of Social Protection. <\/p>  <p>  It is recognised that SPSV operators, like many self-employed individuals, face expenses such as insurance and car financing costs. That is why operators can avail of the Self-Employment Income Scheme. This allows recipients to earn up to &euro;960, net of expenses, in a given 8 week period without losing their entitlement to the PUP. Furthermore, individuals exiting the PUP may also avail of the COVID-19 Enterprise Support Grant, a once-off grant of up to &euro;1,000 which can be used towards the costs associated with reopening a business, including the purchase of cleaning materials and personal protective equipment. <\/p>  <p>  I remain committed to supporting the transition of the SPSV sector towards zero\/low-emission vehicles and I have increased the funding available to the Electric SPSV (eSPSV) grant scheme from &euro;1 million in 2020 to &euro;15 million in 2021. Furthermore, in view of the particular challenges faced by operators of older vehicles, I have doubled the amount payable under the scheme to &euro;20,000 for operators who scrap older vehicles and make the switch to full electric models. Additional amounts are available for those switching to vehicles which are both electric and wheelchair accessible.\u00a0 There has been a strong interest in the revised scheme since its launch in February with over 400 applications received to date.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has provided up to &euro;2.6 million to the NTA to enable it to waive standard vehicle licence renewal fees for 2021. In relation to age limits for taxis and hackneys, this is\u00a0a matter for the NTA as statutory regulator. I can confirm, however, that the NTA has extended age limits for taxis twice since the start of the pandemic and\u00a0I trust that the NTA will keep this issue under active review as the situation progresses<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the issue on insurance, I&rsquo;d like to inform the Deputy that the NTA has engaged with the insurance industry and will facilitate a suspension of SPSV insurance for those SPSV operators who decide to temporarily stop working and suspend their licences. Operators who suspend their licences will be able to either reduce their monthly premium or receive a refund from their insurer, depending on their individual arrangements with their insurer.<\/p>  <p>  The National Transport Authority, as statutory regulator for the sector, will continue to engage with the industry and communicate regularly with individual SPSV operators in relation to the ongoing impact of COVID-19.\u00a0 My Department and the NTA will also continue to engage from time to time with stakeholder groups, including driver representative groups. I am also due to meet with the Advisory Committee on SPSVs at its next meeting on Thursday 29 April.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900069#WRB04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rail Network","counter":55,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900069#WRB04800"},{"type":"question","counter":56,"qnumday":19,"qnumall":"[22404\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900069#WRB04900","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if no application for a rail order in respect of MetroLink will be made until such time as the feasibility study into the extension of the Metro to south-west areas of County Dublin has been completed.","asker":"1553","askee":"1465"},{"type":"question","counter":57,"qnumday":20,"qnumall":"[22405\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900069#WRB05000","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the reason the National Transport Authority and Transport Infrastructure Ireland business case proposal should be considered in the implementation of the transport strategy when that strategy never contemplated a city centre terminus nor the possibility that such a terminus could be in place for decades.","asker":"1553","askee":"1465"},{"type":"question","counter":58,"qnumday":21,"qnumall":"[22406\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900069#WRB05100","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the reason the National Transport Authority and Transport Infrastructure Ireland business case proposal should be considered in the implementation of the transport strategy when the clear outcome of the public consultation process was that there is currently no agreed southside solution to reach Sandyford, County Dublin.","asker":"1553","askee":"1465"},{"type":"question","counter":59,"qnumday":22,"qnumall":"[22407\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900069#WRB05200","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the criteria used by the National Transport Authority and Transport Infrastructure Ireland to select Charlemont as the preferred MetroLink terminus.","asker":"1553","askee":"1465"},{"type":"question","counter":60,"qnumday":23,"qnumall":"[22408\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900069#WRB05300","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the studies carried out by the National Transport Authority and Transport Infrastructure Ireland to substantiate the selection of Charlemont as the preferred MetroLink terminus location above other city centre locations such as St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green or O&rsquo;Connell Street.","asker":"1553","askee":"1465"},{"type":"question","counter":61,"qnumday":24,"qnumall":"[22409\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900069#WRB05400","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if the proposed construction of a tunnel beyond a city centre terminus to Beechwood and the proposed construction of a station at Charlemont effectively preordains a future decision to proceed with the National Transport Authority and Transport Infrastructure Ireland&rsquo;s preferred route of a segregated aboveground metro route along the Luas green line to Sandyford, County Dublin.","asker":"1553","askee":"1465"},{"type":"question","counter":62,"qnumday":25,"qnumall":"[22410\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900069#WRB05500","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the way in which expenditure on the partial construction of its preferred route of a city centre tunnel to Beechwood with a Charlemont station will be a valuable use of taxpayers&rsquo;

Once that consideration is complete I will bring the Preliminary Business Case to Government for its decision as is required by the Public Spending Code.

It is therefore appropriate that key business supports should remain in place until the end of June 2021.<\/p>  <p>  As the revised plan is implemented, the EWSS will play an important role in getting people back to work as public health restrictions are eased, thereby reducing the numbers dependent on social welfare payments over time, including the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP).<\/p>  <p>  Consideration is being given to the fact that continued support could be necessary out to the end of 2021 to help maintain viable businesses and employment and to provide businesses with certainty to the maximum extent possible. Decisions on the form of such support will take account of emerging circumstances and economic conditions as they become clearer.<\/p>  <p>  The Government will continue to assess the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the economy and I will continue to work with Ministerial colleagues to ensure that appropriate supports are in place to mitigate these effects.<\/p>  <p>  For those businesses who may need additional support during this period, I would draw attention to the comprehensive package of other business and employer supports that have been made available since the July Stimulus Plan and Budget 2021 - including the Covid Restriction Support Scheme (CRSS), the Credit Guarantee Scheme, the SBCI Working Capital Scheme, Sustaining Enterprise Fund, and the Covid-19 Business Loans Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The Government remains fully committed to supporting businesses and employers insofar as is possible at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900070#WRC01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Yield","counter":73,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900070#WRC01300"},{"type":"question","counter":74,"qnumday":30,"qnumall":"[22422\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900070#WRC01400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the expected size of the tax base upon which the new non-recycled plastic tax being introduced to provide additional own resources to the European Commission is based; the rate at which it will be applied in 2021 and 2022; the expected payments to be made each year; the way in which it is planned to pay for same; and the way in which it is planned to apply this tax in the sectors in which the waste arises.","asker":"1549","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":75,"content":"<p>On 21<sup>st<\/sup>July 2020, Heads of State and Government reached agreement on the Post-2020 Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) and Next Generation EU (NGEU), totalling &euro;1.82 trillion.

In this regard the\u00a0Action Plan for Insurance Reform\u00a0sets out 66 actions across several policy areas, including my Department, with 95% due to be completed by the end of 2021. At its most recent quarterly meeting in March, the Cabinet Sub-Group on Insurance Reform, which oversees the implementation of the Action Plan, reflected upon the considerable progress made in the first three months of this year. \u00a0Achievements to date include:<\/p>  <p>  - The creation of an\u00a0Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market\u00a0within the Department of Finance, which has been engaging extensively with stakeholders since its inception;<\/p>  <p>  - The publication of new\u00a0Personal Injuries Guidelines\u00a0by the Judicial Council, which came into force on 24 April, a number of months ahead of schedule;<\/p>  <p>  - The launch of a public consultation on proposals to reform the\u00a0Personal Injuries Assessment Board.<\/p>  <p>  It is worth noting that the new Personal Injuries Guidelines significantly reduce award levels for many categories of common injury, particularly those of soft tissue, and provide further details on how these should be assessed. These also provide guidance in relation to injuries previously not included in the Book of Quantum and will be used by both the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB) and judiciary. Therefore, in addition to the lower awards and legal fees, the new Guidelines should provide more certainty to claimants and insurers, and as such reinforce the benefits of using the PIAB for claims settlement. This in turn should further reduce the costs of claims, particularly legal fees.\u00a0 A reduction of the cost of claims should assist in lowering the cost of premiums, and Minister of State Fleming met with insurers earlier this month to press them on this issue. This was a fruitful series of engagements, with many insurers indicating that they would begin lowering premiums this year in response to the new Guidelines. I welcome this commitment and believe that consumers, small businesses and other groups should start to see the benefit of this as soon as possible. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, Minister of State Fleming and I look forward to continue working with colleagues and stakeholders to implement further aspects of the Action Plan, with a view to improve both the cost and availability of insurance for all consumers, businesses and community groups.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900070#WRC02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","counter":86,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900070#WRC02600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Risk Management","counter":85,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900070#WRC02500"},{"type":"question","counter":86,"qnumday":34,"qnumall":"[22431\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900070#WRC02600","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will address a matter regarding flooding at a location (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1487","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":87,"content":"<p>The location referred to by the Deputy is within the Feale Catchment Drainage Scheme which is under the auspices of the OPW.<\/p>  <p>  The River Feale at this location is designated as a Special Area of Conservation.

Ireland fully supports this statement.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In addition to this, in response to the adoption of this law, the EU adopted Council Conclusions on 28 July 2020 expressing grave concern over the national security legislation for Hong Kong. These conclusions restated the EU&rsquo;s support for Hong Kong&rsquo;s high degree of autonomy under the &ldquo;One Country, Two Systems&rdquo; principle, expressed its solidarity with the people of Hong Kong, and set out a coordinated response package of measures in various fields, including asylum, migration, visa, and residence policy; controls on\u00a0exports of specific sensitive equipment and technologies for end use in Hong Kong; and\u00a0the operation of Member States&rsquo; extradition arrangements and other relevant agreements with Hong Kong.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In line with these Conclusions, the Government on 13 October agreed to suspend Ireland&rsquo;s Extradition Agreement with Hong Kong, which clearly signals Ireland&rsquo;s concerns in relation to the rule of law in Hong Kong and the erosion of judicial independence promised under the One Country Two Systems principle.<\/p>  <p>  The matter has been discussed at the EU Foreign Affairs Council on a number of occasions this year.

One of the competencies proposed is 'Communicating and using language' which means being able? to understand, interpret and use different forms of? communication including gesture, expression, spoken? language (English, Irish and other languages), printed? text, broadcast media, and digital media.Phase one of the consultation on the draft Primary Curriculum Framework is complete.  Phase two will take place in Q4 2021 during which the NCCA  will be working with children, teachers, school leaders and parents, so there will opportunity for the NCCA to have continued engagement with children and teachers who use ISL in schools and to learn from their experiences.

This course develops students' ability to understand ISL in live, and in recorded situations, to produce the language and to interact with other signers in a simple way and on familiar topics. A link to the course is available at: <i>.<\/i><\/p><p>Currently, there are four modules on Sign Language available as part of the Leaving Certificate Applied Programme. This course introduces students to Irish Sign Language and aims to develop their expressive and receptive communication skills. The course also develops awareness and appreciation of the Irish deaf community and its culture. There are four modules in this course. Deaf students may take all four modules instead of the Gaeilge and Modern Language courses.

Since February this year, employment services staff\u00a0are returning to their roles in activation, leading to an increase in the numbers of systematic engagements with jobseekers.\u00a0 Under current Level 5 public health restrictions, these engagements\u00a0continue to be\u00a0carried out by phone.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  This week, my Department has issued weekly payments valued at &euro;119.9 million to 403,095 people in receipt of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP). This is in addition to the 183,096 people who were on the Live Register at the end of March.<\/p>  <p>  The jobs of many persons currently on PUP\u00a0 will return once restrictions ease, and sectors of the economy gradually re-open, \u00a0as they did during previous easing of restrictions during 2020.\u00a0 However, others will require assistance and support to return to employment, reskill and to find new jobs My Department is currently developing a\u00a0 service delivery model for systematic engagement with PUP recipients with a view to\u00a0 providing this service to those PUP recipients at most risk of not returning to previous employment, in the near future.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Under the July Jobs Stimulus, my\u00a0Department, \u00a0along with the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science is\u00a0supporting initiatives to assist people, whose employment\u00a0has been affected by the pandemic, \u00a0get back to work. <\/p>  <p>  These include:<\/p>  <p>  - Expanding the caseload capacity of Intreo Centres,\u00a0with the assignment of 100 job coaches to provide enhanced employment\u00a0services and supports. Recruitment for these posts is almost complete,\u00a0with an additional 85 job coaches now in place in these new roles.<\/p>  <p>  - Increasing\u00a0the benefit of the JobsPlus recruitment\u00a0subsidy to employers who hire young people. Under this scheme an employer\u00a0receives the JobsPlus subsidy of &euro;7,500 once they employ a young person\u00a0(under 30 years of age) who has been unemployed for just 4 months. A\u00a0higher subsidy of &euro;10,000 is paid for recruitment of a person who was long-term unemployed (over 12 months). <\/p>  <p>  - Providing access to additional full-time and part-time\u00a0education, including targeted short-term courses, with over 35,000 new\u00a0education and training places for those currently unemployed.<\/p>  <p>  - Providing incentives to employers to take on more\u00a0apprentices, with the provision of a grant of &euro;3,000 to employers for each\u00a0new apprentice recruited.<\/p>  <p>  - Facilitating access to the Back to Education Allowance\u00a0and Back to Work Enterprise Allowance to those displaced by the pandemic\u00a0and in receipt of PUP, by waiving the usual qualifying period of 3-9\u00a0months.<\/p>  <p>  Persons\u00a0in receipt of PUP who wish \u00a0to pursue short term or\u00a0part-time study, can continue to receive\u00a0 a PUP payment, while\u00a0undertaking these courses. \u00a0There are many options and supports available to\u00a0those wishing to pursue short-term or part-time training or education, without a qualification period and without affecting their existing PUP entitlements.<\/p>  <p>  Anyone of working age, including PUP recipients may contact their local Intreo Centre to avail of employment services, discuss eligibility for schemes and further education and training opportunities. Employment Services staff can help those who have lost their jobs find a new one, retrain, or develop new skills, in particular for emerging growth sectors.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  My Department is at an advanced stage in developing a new Work Placement Experience Programme for those out of work for at least six months, including time spent on PUP, regardless of age. This programme will seek to encourage\u00a0businesses to provide jobseekers with the necessary workplace skills to compete in the labour market\u00a0and to help break the vicious circle of &ldquo;no job without experience, no experience without a job&rdquo;. I expect to launch the Programme in the near future, as soon as public health restrictions allow.<\/p>  <p>  Work is nearing completion on the Government's\u00a0 National Economic Plan and my Department&rsquo;s Pathways to Work Strategy. \u00a0These strategies will set out how an expanded Public Employment service will utilise its increased capacity to deliver effective public employment services in a post COVID labour market with increased demands for such services amongst those who have permanently lost jobs arising from the pandemic. In addition, Pathways to Work will also set out strategies to respond to pre-COVID labour market challenges, namely underemployment and under participation in the labour market amongst certain groups. <\/p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies matters for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900072#WRE05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Treatment Benefit Scheme","counter":226,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900072#WRE05800"},{"type":"question","counter":227,"qnumday":83,"qnumall":"[22478\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900072#WRE05900","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if she will address the case of a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1593","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":228,"content":"<p>Qualification for\u00a0the Treatment\u00a0Benefit Scheme is based on satisfying certain PRSI conditions.\u00a0 In order to qualify a person needs to have\u00a0at least 260 PRSI contributions paid at either Class A, E, H, P or S,\u00a0since first starting work, and also have 39 contributions paid or credited in the relevant contribution year on which the claim is based.\u00a0<\/p><p>The person concerned does not currently qualify for treatment benefit.\u00a0 Although she has the 260 required total paid contributions, she does not have the 39 paid or credited contributions in the relevant tax years.<\/p><p>She does not qualify as a\u00a0dependent spouse\u00a0as her weekly income exceeds &euro;100 and she is in receipt of a contributory state pension in her own right.<\/p><p>I hope this clarifies matters for the deputy.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900072#WRE06000","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance","counter":230,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900073#WRF00200"},{"type":"question","counter":231,"qnumday":84,"qnumall":"[22506\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900073#WRF00300","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the reason a carer&rsquo;s allowance was not backdated for a person (details supplied); if the issue of arrears will be addressed; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1487","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":232,"content":"<p>Carer's allowance (CA) is a means-tested social assistance payment made to a person who is habitually resident in the State and who is providing full-time care and attention to a child or an adult who has such a disability that as a result they require that level of care.<\/p><p>I confirm that my Department received an application for CA from the person concerned in respect of her mother on 5 January 2021 and her father on 2 March 2021.

Residents may now be facilitated to receive four routine visits per week. This will be possible following two weeks after the full vaccination of approximately 8 out of 10 of all residents in the nursing home. Otherwise, two visits per week should be facilitated. The duration of visits should be appropriate to the needs of the resident and should not be less than one hour. Where there is high vaccine coverage, 2 people may visit at a time but there is no requirement to limit the number of nominated visitors.<\/p>  <p>  If a visitor is fully vaccinated and is visiting in a room with a resident who is fully vaccinated with no other person present, they do not need to wear masks or avoid physical contact.<\/p>  <p>  A copy of the latest guidance can be accessed at www.hpsc.ie.<\/p>  <p>  Although the situation in nursing homes has greatly improved, the risk associated with COVID-19 remains very real. There is still a risk of introduction of infection, including the possibility of a new variant of COVID-19, against which the vaccine may be less effective. Therefore, caution remains appropriate. At all times vigilance on the general infection prevention and control measures must be maintained and public health advice must continue to be followed, including when visiting, to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and protect those living in our communities.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I have written to HIQA and all nursing home providers to emphasise the need to ensure visits take place to the greatest extent possible in line with the new guidance.

This plan outlines a three phased approach for the proposed restoration of services across Community Services, Acute Hospital Operations, Cancer Services and Screening Services. It sets target times for their safe return and details the conditions and challenges that will have to be met. Every phase of the plan has been informed by clinical guidance and putting patient and staff safety first. Decisions in relation to the type and volume of activity will be made at site level based on local COVID-19 numbers, available capacity and guidance from national clinical leads.<\/p>  <p>  The schedule outlined in the plan for resumption of services will be regularly monitored by the HSE and updated as appropriate, dependant on public health advice and healthcare capacity.<\/p>  <p>  Patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling.

The HSE has advised that a total of 657,415 virtual outpatient consultations took place in 2020 from March to December (when reporting process commenced).

Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975 specifying the conditions covered by the LTI Scheme, including mental illness in a person under 16 years of age.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the Scheme or the age limit in relation to mental illness at this time.

The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, people who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be eligible for a medical card.\u00a0In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE. In certain circumstances the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from illness. The HSE afford applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting documentation to determine whether undue hardship exists and to fully take account of all relevant circumstances that may benefit them in assessment, including medical evidence of costs and certain expenses. <\/p>  <p>  In circumstances where an applicant is still over the income limit for a medical card, they are then assessed for a GP visit card, which entitles the applicant to GP visits without charge. Further information on the medical card scheme and the application process are available at www.hse.ie.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, persons may also be entitled to claim tax relief on the cost of their medical expenses. This includes medicines prescribed by a doctor, dentist, or consultant. Relief is at the standard tax rate of 20%.

Priority markets are agreed with Industry each year and quarterly meeting are held to update against these priorities.<\/p><p>The success of our pigmeat market access is reflected in the CSO trade statistics which show that Ireland exports pigmeat to some 60 countries with\u00a0the top five destinations of\u00a0the United Kingdom, China, Japan, Denmark and Germany. Cumulatively, these five destinations accounted for some 80% of pigmeat exports in volume terms in 2020. The value of pigmeat exports have also increased by almost 12% since 2017 with volumes remaining largely stable and averaging 278.000 tonnes annually over the same period.<\/p><p>My Department continues to engage\u00a0with all relevant stakeholders.\u00a0My colleague Minister of State Martin Heydon T.D. chaired the newly established pig roundtable which held its inaugural meeting on 28 April.
