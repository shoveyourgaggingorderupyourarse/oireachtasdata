It has very serious ramifications for the future of the EU and our island.  We all agree that hard borders should not be re-introduced between North and South and that the common travel area should remain.  There have been positive soundings about these but there have been mixed messages about how this special relationship between Ireland and the UK will be handled.  It is most unfortunate that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland was excluded from a recent Cabinet committee on Brexit set up in London.  What the Tory Government does is outside our control but if the way it treats Northern Ireland is an indication of how it will treat the Republic of Ireland under special treatment, it does not give much cause for hope.<\/p>  <p>  I want to focus on what the Irish Government needs to do because this is having a detrimental effect on businesses.  It will have a detrimental effect in the medium and long term on businesses across this island.  Preparations should be started to allow companies to be shielded and to give them comfort during what will be a very uncertain two year-period while negotiations take place.  Companies that are reliant on exports need to be given the necessary supports to give them the confidence to ride out the storm of this uncertainty over the next two years.  Through no fault of their own, good businesses that have been built up over the past number of decades are facing hugely uncertain times.  While there have been many soundings about being prepared, very little action has been taken to show that we are actually prepared.  <\/p>  <p>  We have already seen the impact of the dramatic drop in sterling on businesses here.  Some companies have already closed while others are at the edge of the cliff working at a loss and hoping that sterling will rise again.  I spoke to a business in my region in the prepared consumer food sector that is working on a net margin of between 4% to 5%.  It is now suffering a loss of between 20% and 25%.  That is not sustainable.  We know that the small and medium-sized sector employs over 780,000 people, particularly in rural Ireland, and is the backbone of employment in the regions.  IBEC has called for a currency crisis fund to be set up but it appears its request has fallen on deaf ears.  A total of 42% of our tourism market comes from the UK and the impact of the fall in sterling will reduce this dramatically.<\/p><p>Some predict it will be reduced by as much as 10%.  Last week's budget underscored the seriousness of Brexit and the threat it poses to Ireland.  It was just tokenism against the greatest threat that has faced the Irish economy for many decades.  I am worried about the businesses that depend on exports.  Will the Minister confirm that the Government will make a fund available to help shield Irish companies from Brexit and assist them in working through the uncertainties over the next two years until we all, eventually, know what will be the real outcome of Brexit?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102000003#A00200","speaker":"1250","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476961500,"counter":8,"content":"<p>The Government recognises the enormous challenges that face Ireland as a consequence of Britain's decision to leave the EU, including for farmers and exporters, as a result of the currency changes the Deputy mentioned, for the tourism industry, which is so dependent on visitors from the UK, for the service industry and for individuals.  As the Deputy said, what the British Government decides to do is a matter for it.  However, we can control what we do and we can prepare.  The Government's sub-committee on Brexit, of which I am a member, met this week.  The sub-committee discussed the very important actions that have been taken.  There is additional funding in the budget for the employment of extra staff by IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland to ensure our message is heard overseas.  Notwithstanding the performance of tourism, it was decided to keep the VAT rate at 9% for tourism and hospitality, recognising the risk that there may be a fewer tourists coming from the UK.  We are rolling out a new low-interest loan scheme to farmers valued at &euro;150 million to help with cash flow.  There is a new business support scheme related to risk sharing under this development.  The Deputy may be aware that the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Doyle, arranged for a payment of just under &euro;1.57 million to one of the mushroom producer organisations under an EU scheme.<\/p>  <p>  We are acting to deal with the immediate consequences caused by the uncertainty and the fall in the value of sterling that have followed the vote.  We are also planning ahead.  The Taoiseach will visit Northern Ireland on 3 November and will meet all the party leaders and chambers of commerce.  We will establish an all-Ireland civic forum to discuss the consequences of Brexit.  It will be of particular relevance to Border communities which are most at risk from Brexit.  The next North-South Ministerial Council summit will occur on 18 November in Armagh, which will give us an opportunity to discuss the consequences of Brexit with the Ministers from the North and work out how we can work together to meet those challenges head on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102000004#B00200","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1476961500,"counter":9,"content":"<p>Although we were told that the budget would be Brexit-proofed, this has not proven to be the case.  During recent weeks and months, I have to spoken to business owners in my region.  It is not like when the Taoiseach tells the story of the man he met the night before who was having a pint.  I spoke with the owners of real businesses who are creating real jobs: one had created 100 jobs, another 170, and another 500.  Every one of them is dependent on exports and they have a real fear about the outcome of Brexit.  Our region has already suffered job losses during recent months and we do not want any more.  The Minister talked about the 50 staff recruited for IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland.  Most of these were recruited before Brexit happened.  The Minister talked about the retention of the 9% VAT.  It has been in place for many years.  I acknowledge that it was the Minister's Government that put it in place and it was a welcome boost to the industry at the time.  Everybody who works in the tourism industry has real concerns about Brexit here and now.  I will reiterate the question I asked at the beginning and perhaps the Minister will answer it this time.  Will the Government make a fund available to help Irish companies that are dependent on exports and vulnerable to currency fluctuations work through the uncertainties of the next two years so that, hopefully, they will be able to ride out these uncertainties and be in a stronger position after the two years' deliberations?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102000004#B00300","speaker":"1250"},{"type":"speech","time":1476961800,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I cannot give the Deputy a specific commitment today.  I am not in a position to make policy decisions on the hoof.  Some funds are already available.  For example, a payment has been made to a producer in the mushroom industry and, as part of the budget, a low-interest loan scheme to the value of &euro;150 million is being put in place for farmers.<\/p>  <p>  Falls in the value of sterling have happened before.  They can happen independently of any concern or decision around Brexit.  They work both ways.  For some companies, they can be devastating, moving them from a position of profit to one of loss.  For others, they can be a benefit.  If companies import from the UK, for example, their costs will be reduced.  Although it is not possible for every industry, the solution for most is to diversify and not be dependent on one market.<\/p>  <p>  I will leave the Deputy with a final thought.  Four times in its history, Ireland has gone down a different road from the UK.  In 1921, we became independent, which came with challenges.  In 1948, we left the Commonwealth and became a republic.  There were challenges associated with that.  In 1979, we broke the link with sterling, which came with challenges.  In 2002, we decided to join the euro without Britain and, of course, there were challenges with that.  On every occasion, we rose to those challenges and Ireland emerged stronger and more prosperous as a result.  We will ensure that the latter will also be the case on this occasion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102000005#C00100","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1476961800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>The Minister's colleagues in government have consistently refused to tackle and put a stop to the outrageous proposed increases in politicians' pay.  He will agree with me that we are all well paid.  Deputies earn a basic salary of &euro;87,258.  It is a wage that many workers would envy.  Indeed, it is a wage that the majority of workers will never earn.  Of course, the Minister and his ministerial colleagues take home much more - in excess of &euro;150,000 - but let us stick with Deputies.<\/p>  <p>  The proposed increases of more than &euro;5,000 would bring a Deputy's salary to over &euro;92,000.  That is unacceptable, in particular at a time when Deputy Varadkar, as the Minister for Social Protection, is telling pensioners that they are worth an extra fiver per week and young people who are out of work are worth even less than that, a mere &euro;2.70 per week.  He still has not told social welfare recipients when they will get their increases.  He might enlighten us in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  The issue is one of fairness.

Today, Sinn F&eacute;in is publishing a motion that will stop these unfair payments to Deputies, Senators, the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister.

The situation is as follows: there are no pay rises and no pay increases proposed for politicians.  There have been no pay rises and no pay increases for politicians since 2008.<\/p><p>What is happening in respect of Deputies is a restoration of some of the pay that was cut from their salaries as a consequence of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act.  With respect to Ministers, pay was cut by 35%.  We will not be accepting any restoration.  The Taoiseach's pay was cut by 40% and he will not be accepting any restoration.  The pay of Ministers of State was cut by 25% and they will not be accepting any restoration.  Therefore, the Deputy does not need to include any provisions in this regard in her Bill.  We will not be accepting any restoration because we earn more than &euro;100,000 and have special responsibilities as officeholders to hold the line when it comes to public sector pay across the board.<\/p> <p> For Deputies, the situation is slightly different.  The pay of Deputies is, as it should be, linked to that of other people in the civil and public service, specifically to the rank of principal officer.  Deputies should not decide their own pay.  A link was established between the pay of Deputies and that of principal officers some years ago and it should remain.  We do not want to go back to what Deputy McDonald wants, namely, a situation where politicians decide what they are paid.  The link between the pay of Deputies and principal officers will remain and if pay is restored for other public and civil servants in line with the Lansdowne Road agreement or any agreement that may replace it, it will apply accordingly.<\/p> <p> It is interesting to hear Deputy McDonald attempting to lecture me about what I am saying to pensioners and social welfare recipients in this jurisdiction.  Sinn F&eacute;in is in office in Northern Ireland, where it tells pensioners, people who are unemployed, carers and people with disabilities they are worth less than &pound;100 per week.  The Deputy's party tells lone parents in the North whose youngest child is six years of age that they should not be treated any differently from other lone parents.  Do not pretend to me, Deputy McDonald, that somehow your party is not in charge of that.

We now have serious accommodation and facilities problems at the college.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Justice and Equality is currently preparing a competitive tender for hotels to provide bedroom accommodation and classroom facilities.  I am anxious to ensure that the competition will be run within the county of Tipperary and that no excuse will be made for moving some of that work to Dublin or elsewhere.  I also want to raise the concerns of the catering and cleaning staff of the college, whom I met recently.  They have a hugely increased workload, are completely understaffed and they feel that they are being treated very unfairly.  There is a great deal of discontent, which has led to a threatened strike because staff are so overburdened.<\/p>  <p>  I would also ask the Minister to consider a more permanent accommodation solution.  The Office of Public Works, OPW, against Garda advice, purchased 200 acres of land in Clonmore, which is about eight miles outside Templemore.  This land was purchased at an outrageously high price.  The OPW paid in the region of &euro;5 million for it but it has become a green elephant.  Nothing has happened there since it was purchased.  There was a security patrol on it for years and now it is being leased as farm land.<\/p><p>There was a grandiose pie-in-the-sky plan to relocate the driving school, the firing range and the Garda mounted unit to this land.  It was never going to happen.  It is not going to happen.  I suggest that this land should be sold and that land available adjacent to the Garda College should be purchased to facilitate these plans.  Will the Minister confirm that the multi-tiered block of office accommodation will go ahead?  I understand that officials in the Department are attempting to invest &euro;2 million in that.  Will the Minister tell me what is the status of that project?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102000007#E02300","speaker":"1240","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476963300,"counter":50,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Lowry for his acknowledgement of the reinvestment in the Garda that is occurring under the leadership of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald.  I will give some examples of that investment.  We provided for 457 new vehicles in 2014 and 486 new vehicles in 2015.  More than 500 new vehicles will come on stream this year, compared to just 50 new vehicles in 2010 when the party opposite was in power.  We have provided an additional &euro;205 million to equip garda&iacute; with much-needed new technology and ICT equipment.  The number of civilian staff will be increased to provide support services and thereby allow garda&iacute; to concentrate on their front-line work.  The aim is to increase the strength of the force to 15,000, with Garda Reserve and civilian staff being in addition to that.  A big programme of investment in Garda stations is under way.  Anyone who passes Kevin Street Garda station on his or her way home today can take a look at what is being done there.<\/p>  <p>  On the specific question of the Garda College in Templemore, I assure Deputy Lowry that the Government is committed to the target, as set out in the programme for Government agreed by Fine Gael and the Independents, of increasing the strength of the force to 15,000 garda&iacute;.  The Government reopened the Garda College when it restarted Garda recruitment in 2014.  The T&aacute;naiste has secured funding for the recruitment of 800 garda&iacute; in 2017.  It is anticipated that this level of recruitment will continue until the strength of the force reaches 15,000 by 2021.  A major OPW programme of works to improve the accommodation and blocks in the Garda College in Templemore is necessary and well advanced.  Plans are being drawn up and the Minister is seeking funding from within her Vote to allow these works to proceed.  It is also acknowledged that further work may be required to provide additional facilities.  The Garda and the OPW are analysing the needs and precise requirements for the coming years.  We are confident that we can meet our target of putting 800 recruits through the college next year without significant additional works.  It is essential that we ensure An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the capacity to train larger numbers without any diminution in the quality of its training programme, to provide appropriate supervision to support newly qualified garda&iacute; and to ensure the victims of crime are well served.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Lowry will be aware of the crucial role the training college plays in the local community in Templemore.  It is a significant source of employment in north Tipperary and the surrounding region.  Templemore will be part of the significant investment programme that is under way in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as will funding for the new forensic science laboratory, which is a very important facility.  Budgetary increases have also been provided for regulatory bodies like the Charities Regulatory Authority and the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102000008#F00200","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1476963300,"counter":51,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister's comments.

Where would he lead this country if he were Taoiseach?  One aspect I wish to delve into is whether Deputy Varadkar is more Berlin or Boston in his attitude and thinking.  A key example is where Deputy Varadkar lies on the issue of how we care for caring in this country.<\/p>  <p>  We know now that Fine Gael does not want parents to care for their children in the home.  We know this through the introduction of certain measures, including the combination of tax individualisation and supports for alternative care, something we also support, but also by the discrimination or lack of any support for parents who raise children in the home.  In this way, Fine Gael is steering us in a Boston direction with all the downsides that brings.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Varadkar seemed to make it clear at the weekend that any further supports for parents in the home is out, that any supports for parents who might use childminders - again, they would be working in the home - is out and that any supports for grandparents who do that valuable and most important work is out as well.<\/p>  <p>  No doubt, Deputy Varadkar will come back to us and say that the Government has just put in a paternity leave and benefit Bill.  I very much welcome the fact that we now get two weeks parental benefit compared with getting nothing in the past.  As part of this fundamental question of whether we go in the direction of Berlin or Boston, I wish to cite the fact that in Germany, as in 30 other European countries, people have potential access to up to three years of parental leave for either the father or mother.  The Government maintains we are going all Scandinavian in the measures it is introducing, but I will outline the reality of what the Scandinavians do.  In Norway, they provide paid parental benefit of up to 59 weeks.  In Sweden they provide this leave for 480 days and have certain provisions to ensure the father takes up the leave.  In Denmark, they take 52 weeks of parental leave.  In case Deputy Varadkar makes the point that we have child benefit, those countries also have child benefit at &euro;50 higher than our level.  We are creating a system that amounts to going down the American corporation route to running our country.  Would Deputy Varadkar have anything more to offer if he were leading Fine Gael in government, or is that it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102000009#G00200","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1476963900,"counter":56,"content":"<p>In fairness their next leader could be Deputy Paschal Donohoe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102000009#G00300","speaker":"1225"},{"type":"speech","time":1476963900,"counter":57,"content":"<p>Has Fine Gael locked us into a system that discriminates against parents in the home through our tax system and the provisions we have made?

I think that distinction was created by Mary Harney, someone I admire very much individually and as a politician.  I have always taken the view that the attempt to create a distinction between a vision of Boston on the one hand and Berlin on the other to be somewhat bogus and a little outdated.  It is somewhat outdated in many ways that the Green Party is still thinking in that way.  There is a serious difference between a Christian Democrat Berlin and a Social Democrat Berlin, just as there can be a major difference between a Boston run by Republicans and a Boston run by Democrats.<\/p>  <p>  I am unsure whether Deputy Ryan knows much about American companies, but I had the pleasure to visit Facebook recently, which is an American company that provides four months paid paternal leave to all employees.  That is quite extraordinary and is very much to be welcomed.  This is an American company that no doubt Deputy Ryan would like to characterise as something rather different.<\/p>  <p>  Our view, as a government, now and for the future, is that it is the role of government to support families and to enable them, as much as possible, to make the best choices for themselves, their families and their children.  How do we make that real?  What policy decisions have we taken to show we are serious about that?  First, we have introduced the second year of free preschool.  That saves parents, on average, &euro;4,000 per child per year.  As Deputy Ryan acknowledged, we have introduced paid paternity leave and paternity benefit for the first time.  That started in September and the uptake from those measures has been rather encouraging.<\/p><p>I will be publishing those statistics soon.  It is our intention to extend that and provide an additional two weeks of parental leave which can be shared by either parent.  That requires legislation and funding but we have made a commitment to do that.  We have also brought in free general practitioner care for children younger than six years and we intend to extend that to all children younger than 18.  In the budget one of the increases that perhaps went unnoticed was an increase in maternity benefit and paternity benefit.  As the Deputy is aware, we are going to bring in a radical and new programme to subsidise the cost of child care, for all parents, for young children and for parents, subject to a means test, of older children.<\/p> <p> We have also increased the home carer&rsquo;s tax credit which was not acknowledged by Deputy Ryan.  There is a tax credit for home caring parents worth &euro;1,000 a year which allows income up to &euro;5,000 to be sheltered from any taxation.  That was increased by &euro;100 or 10% in the budget and that increase takes effect in January, long before the child care measures in September.  We are supporting the home caring parents first, before the child care measure comes in.  As the Minister for Finance has indicated it is our view that in the coming years, and I am sure this would be true for anybody in Fine Gael, should the economy allow it, we would continue to increase the home care tax credit to recognise the value of parenting at home and we will continue to expand the child care subsidies to support families to make the decision to go for one or two incomes should they choose to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102000009#G00800","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476964500,"counter":63,"content":"<p>There is a difference between Boston and Berlin so it is perfectly valid to use that in a question because in Boston, as in the rest of the United States, there is no statutory right to leave to help parents, whereas there is in Germany and Scandinavian countries.  The Minister gave me no answer as to what fundamentally he would do differently.  He seems to agree with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, about the measures the Government has announced, which absolutely discriminate at scale against parents who decide that their best approach, whatever way, is to raise children at home.  Fine Gael seems to have nothing for that.  It gave a &euro;100 increase in the tax credit.  The total value of that is approximately &euro;7 million as set out in the budget.  The Government has given four times as much for sheep welfare as for the welfare of those parents raising children at home.  That speaks about where the Minister stands.  I hear the Minister promise possible increases in that tax credit.  I would like to see the provisions that are given to one parent given to all.  Let us treat parents equally, as they do in Scandinavia.  The Minister is not going in that direction, he is going in the Boston direction.  That is a mistake and it is wrong.  I would oppose the Minister&rsquo;s leadership of Fine Gael if that is the direction he wants to go in.

The reported changes to the scheme on foot of the Central Bank concerns do not make the scheme any more workable.

I understand that in times gone by it was common for the budget debate to span many weeks.  Perhaps the fizz has gone out of the bottle somewhat since the weeks before the budget have become the time for the primary debate rather than the weeks afterwards.  There are few surprises on budget day that have not been flagged in advance and focus groups tested.  Some items are withdrawn and added before and after the budget.  This is the first budget adopted in what is termed a time of new politics.  I welcome the new politics and I find it normal and democratic.  The old days of winner takes all and an absolutist rule by a majority Government do not reflect a fair exercise of the mandate of 158 Deputies elected to the Chamber.  Although the last Government had the biggest majority in the history of the State, few would suggest it was a good Government, as last February's election showed.  For decades in the North of Ireland we saw how an inbuilt majority could scupper every piece of legislation from the other side of the House.  In 40 years of Stormont, the only piece of Nationalist legislation to be passed was the Wild Birds Protection (Northern Ireland) Act 1931.<\/p>  <p>  Minority governments are commonplace across Europe.  Recently, I was privileged to visit the Danish Parliament with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  The Danish Government serves with only one third of the seats in the Parliament.  Our near neighbour, the National Assembly for Wales, also has a minority arrangement.  Earlier this year, after our Government had been formed but before the Welsh Government had, it studied the confidence and supply arrangement which we have in place for guidance.  I hope it was of some assistance.  The Scottish and many other parliaments also have such arrangements.  However, some D&aacute;il Members struggle with our new arrangements.  Some show withdrawal symptoms from the overly adversarial days of the past.  Some seem to seek the Punch and Judy show and a binary arrangement in which one side must lose in order for the other side to win, including some in the media, some Deputies and some Ministers.<\/p><p>I was struck, in particular, by the performance of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, last week when he devoted most of his allocated speaking time for his Department's brief to engage in scathing invective in respect of my party.  His origins are in the Fine Gael Party and perhaps he has gone native or reverted to type with the increased zeal of the convert.<\/p> <p> In any event, that episode and the new reality remind me of debates in the early days of democracy, with the gradual realisation that peace was preferable to war and pooling sovereignty delivered better results.  Early political philosophers such as Locke, Hobbes and Rousseau rejected the idea that the state of nature is a state of war and moved on from that.  They also noted that, in the absence of co-operation, life in the wild is not attractive.  Life or, as in this case, ministerial careers or Government terms could, in the word's of Locke, be \"poor, nasty, brutish, and short\".  However, we have moved on.<\/p> <p> Turning to the substance of the budget, just one and a half of the 12 minutes for which the Minister, Deputy Ross, spoke on the budget were devoted to his brief.  The remainder of his contribution was partisan in nature.  Perhaps that is because only three pages of the 207-page public expenditure document contain details on transport issues.  The Minister had nothing about which to talk.  In the three pages on transport, there are two sections on roads projects, although little detail is provided, and one short section on public transport, which principally consists of re-announcing pre-flagged Luas works that are already under way.  Considering the importance of climate action to this House and the world in general and in view of the gridlock which sometimes surrounds this city and which is worsening as the economy - thankfully - begins a slow recovery, the paucity of any big picture, or even a small one, in respect of public transport planning in the budget is shocking.<\/p> <p> The greater Dublin area strategy for the next 30 years was announced during the election interregnum but there is no hint of it within the budget.  My constituency of Kildare North is the home of the commuter belt, with tens of thousands of people travelling daily from towns such as Sallins, Naas, Clane, Kilcock, Celbridge, Maynooth and Leixlip by multiple modes of transport.  However, the infrastructure needed to support them, make their lives easier and commutes shorter and increase their quality of life and work options is not being provided.  Where in this budget is there any provision for the interconnector rail tunnel, the much-needed metro, a new circle line, the next Luas extensions, the electrification of rail lines, the extension of quality bus corridors or incentives to promote cycling, pedestrianisation, connectivity and wider forms of sustainable transport?  There is none.  Despite the Minister sneering during last week's speech about the metro being on the way, it is not happening.  If the Minister of State read the detail of the budget, he would see that not a single cent can be spent on the metro - not even on an investigation - in all of 2017.  That is not to mention multiple road schemes - such as the critical Sallins bypass, M7 widening in my constituency and many related projects - that are not flagged at all.<\/p> <p> There are few new measures in the energy and environmental provisions.  Some colleagues on the left have highlighted that there is no apparent money to wind down Irish Water.  Apart from the never-ending debate on whether we should pay for water, is it not time for us to decide what to do with Irish Water?  There needs to be a little imagination in this regard.<\/p> <p> Energy in Ireland is lost wholesale as power plants, factories and many other heat sources literally pump power into nearby watercourses instead of usefully capturing it.  So much heat is poured down the drain or pumped into the River Liffey, the temperature of which is 7o Celsius higher than it should be for a river of its size.  There are more innovative solutions across Europe.  For example, district heating captures excess heat and water and pumps them directly into households as a form of heating, comprising one third of the energy mix.  These and many other innovative solutions could and should be explored instead of interminably debating costs and charging.  Let us decide what we will do about this situation.<\/p> <p> Turning to jobs and enterprise, the greatest challenge facing this island now and for the foreseeable future is Brexit.  Many claims were made in advance about how the budget would be Brexit-proof and would contain many measures to address the situation.  However, there are precious few.  Brexit is the greatest challenge we face.  In the coming 12 months, which will be the lifetime of this budget, many decisions will be made in British boardrooms and institutions on whether they will relocate or stay put.  With a little bit of creativity, we could have had a Brexit package that included a number of measures to target and attract foreign direct investment to our shores, for example, a work visa programme, office space, fast-tracking inquiries of interest, share ownership packages for employees who were relocating, transport infrastructure and the well-rehearsed arguments on accommodation, energy and quality-of-life issues.  Our personal taxation rate is comparable with the rest of Europe, if on the high side, but we do not enjoy the services that other countries do.  As to capital gains tax for entrepreneurs, it is 10% under the &euro;1 million threshold.  This is welcome, but the UK's 10% threshold is &pound;10 million.  This makes it more difficult to relocate capital to Ireland.<\/p> <p> Brexit offers opportunities but there has been a lack of imagination in that regard.  The same can be said in terms of energy and climate action.  I hope that these issues and those relating to transport will be addressed because they are critical.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102000017#Q00300","speaker":"1323","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476968400,"counter":138,"content":"<p>In May, Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael came to an agreement to enable the formation of a Fine Gael-led minority Government.  As part of this arrangement, Fianna F&aacute;il committed to facilitating the passage of three budgets, subject to progress being achieved on a number of our core policy priorities.  In taking a responsible approach to government formation, Fianna F&aacute;il, unlike many other political parties in the D&aacute;il, has sought to ensure that the needs of the people who voted for us last February are reflected in the annual budget.<\/p>  <p>  The budgets of the previous Fine Gael-Labour Government were repeatedly found by the ESRI to be regressive.  A core objective of Fianna F&aacute;il in entering into the current confidence-and-supply arrangement was to ensure that budgetary policy was reshaped in the direction of fairness.  Under this agreement, we secured a commitment that available resources would be allocated on the basis of at least a 2-1 split in favour of public spending over tax cuts.  This has been exceeded in budget 2017 with a 3-1 split between spending on services and investing in our citizens at every stage of the life cycle and reduced taxation.<\/p>  <p>  Despite these improvements, this is not a Fianna F&aacute;il budget and we did not get everything we wanted.  However, we have secured a major departure from the policies of the previous Fine Gael-Labour Government and considerable progress on a number of our core policy objectives.  The confidence and supply agreement has underpinned a shift in budgetary policy by moving away from a policy of tax cuts that result in the greatest gains going to the well-off in favour of a greater emphasis on investment in key public services, increases in social welfare payments and helping families with the cost of living.<\/p>  <p>  Despite the relatively limited scope for increased public spending and reduced taxes, this budget will bring some relief to hard-pressed families.  The reduction in the first three rates of USC by 0.5% is consistent with Fianna F&aacute;il's pre-election commitment to reduce the burden of this tax on low and middle-income earners.  This will ensure that working people will see some of the benefits of a growing economy reflected in a modest improvement in their disposable incomes.<\/p>  <p>  Self-employed people often find themselves paying more in tax than a PAYE worker earning the same amount in income.  The increase in the earned income tax credit for the self-employed to &euro;950 represents an important move towards the eventual equalisation of the tax treatment of the self-employed with PAYE workers.  It is to be hoped that further progress towards full equalisation will be realised in future budgets.<\/p>  <p>  Securing greater investment in third level education was a key objective for Fianna F&aacute;il in the budget negotiations.  Therefore, we welcome the increase of &euro;36.5 million in funding for higher education in 2017.  However, the increased resources provided in the budget can only be seen as first step, particularly as many of those involved in the sector have stated that third level requires an additional &euro;100 million per year in investment and in light of the long-term funding challenges set out in the recent Cassells report.<\/p>  <p>  While the additional funding for social housing announced in the budget is to be welcomed, there is a need to develop a concrete strategy to underpin the significant and necessary expansion in social housing provision.  There is a concern as to whether local authorities have the capacity to deliver on social housing targets.  In light of the limited output on the part of local authorities in recent years, additional staffing and expertise may be required to drive the substantial increase in output.<\/p>  <p>  The low level of investment in public transport is disappointing, especially in view of the increase in passenger numbers on bus, rail and Luas services owing to increasing numbers of people returning to employment as the economy continues to improve.  My colleague, Deputy Lawless, referred to this matter.  It is regrettable that budget 2017 does not provide any capital investment to progress key public transport projects such as metro north and the DART expansion programme.<\/p><p>The level of investment in public transport in Dublin must be increased significantly, particularly when we consider that <i>per capita<\/i>spending on transport here is considerably below that enjoyed by London and Manchester, cities we compete with for foreign direct investment and jobs.<br\/><br\/>Fianna F&aacute;il does not agree with every measure contained in the budget. Home ownership is an important objective of public policy.  As such, we included in our election manifesto a proposal for a deposit saving scheme to assist first-time buyers to reach the deposit needed to purchase a home.  Several experts have given their view that the first-time buyer's tax rebate announced in the budget will do little to stimulate the much-needed increase in supply but will, instead, serve only to drive up house prices further.  Given the uncertainty surrounding the impact of this measure, it is necessary to carry out an independent assessment of the likely implications of the tax rebate on the housing market.  I understood a number of changes in the scheme have already been agreed for implementation in the Finance Bill.<br\/><br\/>The budget will see an increase of &euro;5 per week in core welfare payments.  Under the confidence and supply arrangement, Fianna F&aacute;il secured agreement on increases to the State pension.  We also welcome the increases in weekly welfare payments to carers, the disabled and the unemployed.  Excluding the State pension, these represent the first increases in weekly welfare rates since 2009 and will go some way to ensuring the social welfare payments these groups depend on to maintain their income keep pace with the modest inflation that has occurred over the past seven years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102000018#R00200","speaker":"1360","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476969000,"counter":140,"content":"<p>Will the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, confirm in his response whether the Finance Bill has already been published?  A great amount of detail about it was given on &quot;Morning Ireland&quot; earlier, with reference in particular to changes to the housing tax relief scheme.  I have been waiting three and a half days for an opportunity to speak in this House on the budget measures only to discover that the Bill to effect their implementation may already have been published.  It would be the height of disrespect to Members to have measures finalised before the debate on them concludes.  I notice, too, that if the Central Bank makes a recommendation, it will generally be taken on board, but not a blind bit of notice is taken of recommendations from Members.<\/p><p>Regarding the tax relief for first-time buyers, I am concerned that the provision whereby eligibility reverts back to the first mortgage drawdown will impact negatively on people who build their own homes.  In other words, first-time buyers who are about to move into their self-build home having drawn down the last tranche of their mortgage will not qualify.  That is unfair.  The last drawdown should be the defining criterion according to which a first-time buyer qualifies or does not qualify for the scheme.  As it stands, the provision reverts back to July of this year.  I hope that will be changed so that anybody who has a last drawdown after July will qualify.  In the case of self-builds, it is only when the last mortgage drawdown is complete that people can move into their home.  I will be pushing for that change and have already spoken to my party's finance spokesman, Deputy Michael McGrath, about it.<\/p><p>I welcome the modest increases in welfare payments provided for in the budget.  However, there is a real sense that the disability sector has been let down by budget 2017.  It should be a priority in future budgets that the sector receives special treatment.  We have a Minister of State with a specific interest in disabilities and I hope that is reflected in future provision.  The measures to assist the sector are welcome but underwhelming.<\/p><p>My colleague mentioned funding for roads, which is under the remit of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross.  Together with several colleagues, I recently brought forward a Topical Issue matter requesting that funding for local improvement schemes be recommenced in 2017.  The Minister stated clearly in his reply that this would be done.  I hope that promise will be adhered to because it is very important for those of us living in rural areas.<\/p><p>In regard to the rent allowance, I have brought to the attention of the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Leo Varadkar, and the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, that the increases in Kerry were in the region of 5% while the increases in other counties were upwards of 15% to 20%.  I compared Kerry and Galway as being two very similar counties in terms of population, size, tourism and so on.  The <i>daft.ie<\/i>report for the first quarter of 2016 gives the average rent in Kerry as &euro;623, with a corresponding figure for Galway of &euro;618.  However, the rent allowance increases in Galway were substantially greater.  When I checked last Friday on <i>daft.ie<\/i>, six properties were available in Tralee, a town facilitating 30,000 people, all of which were outside the rent allowance boundaries.  Something must be done to address this problem.  Will the Minister of State instruct his officials to ring the relevant social welfare officers in Kerry to ask how they are dealing with the rent allowance crisis there?  People cannot find a suitable qualifying property and the situation is getting worse week after week.  Nobody seems to be listening to us.<\/p><p>I hope somebody in Government will take on board the points I have raised today.  I hope, too, that the legislation is not already published, because that would mean my proposals have no chance of being taken on board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102000019#S00200","speaker":"1321"},{"type":"speech","time":1476969000,"counter":141,"content":"<p>Deputies Charlie McConalogue and Lisa Chambers will share time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102000019#S00300","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1476969000,"counter":142,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to discuss this financial resolution.  As my colleagues noted, Fianna F&aacute;il has taken a very responsible approach in recent months, taking into account the challenges facing the country and the need for stable Government.  We are aware, too, of what the alternatives to such an approach might be when we see what has happened in Spain, which still does not have a government despite the major challenges facing that country.  We were keen to be in government following the election and fought hard for that outcome.  Having accepted that we did not have the required support, we decided to seek to offer the most effective Opposition there has been in this House in the context of the unique circumstances that presented after the election.<\/p>  <p>  We have taken the same approach to the budget, our concern being to ensure it was framed in a way that was significantly different from what was rejected by the public in the election and from the approach taken by the previous Government.  Although that Administration had a difficult job to do in hard times, in carrying out that responsibility it placed the burden and pressure on the people who could least afford it.  Our approach is very different from that of other parties and Independent Members on the Opposition benches.  Despite having huffed and puffed for five years in the previous D&aacute;il and having put themselves before the people and sought a mandate for their platform, when the opportunity arose to form a new Government, they headed for the hills and were nowhere to be found for several weeks or even months.<\/p><p>Anytime they were found, their sole contribution was to peep up and canvass for Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael to go into government, neglecting the platform and the canvass they had undertaken in the election campaign.  A very dim view has been taken by many people who voted for them in terms of the value of the vote that they cast.  Some members of the public will simply cast an opposition vote.  I remember canvassing a person during the general election and fighting hard for his vote.  He told me that he would not be able to vote for me on that occasion, despite the fact that he wanted to give me a number two.  He said he was voting for another party but that he would never want that party to be in government.  He said that its members were great at opposition and at shouting, so he was going to vote for them.  He liked the way they shouted but he was not voting for them to go into government.  Maybe they were true to that particular person's vote but that was the exception.  People who actually voted for one party or another, or for an Independent, ultimately wanted to see the mandate they were giving to that person implemented in government.  That is the approach that my party took.  That is also the approach that the public wanted my party to take, as well as other parties who failed to live up their responsibilities and who continue to huff and puff now.  They failed and showed their true colours because when they got the opportunity to take on responsibility, they would not do so.<\/p> <p> Regarding the influence Fianna F&aacute;il has brought to bear on this budget, the ESRI has shown that this is the first budget in the past five or six years which is progressive in nature and which gives the small benefits of the improving economy to those who most need them.  That is the direction that has been taken although I would have a number of problems with many measures in the budget.  Certainly, in terms of the steer of the budget, it is important that it is going in that direction.  In several previous budgets under the last Government, the ratio of expenditure increases to tax reductions was 50:50.  Indeed, in the first year that there was a little money available to spend, we saw the top rate of tax being reduced by 1%.  That happened three budgets ago while at the same time there was massive pressure on our public services.  In this particular budget, the expenditure to taxation ratio was 3:1.  Furthermore, the tax measures are targeted at those who are most under pressure.  The general thrust of this budget is a welcome departure and is starting to reflect the views of the public.  Fianna F&aacute;il is making every effort to exert whatever pressure it can to ensure that the fairness in public services that we seek to achieve is reflected in public policy, albeit from the Opposition benches.<\/p> <p> As my party's spokesperson on agriculture, I wish to refer to a number of measures in the budget relevant to farming.  There are some welcome measures in the budget, particularly the &euro;25 million fund for a new sheep scheme.  There has also been a welcome increase in the funding for the rural development programme, RDP.  However, it must be pointed out that the form and record of the Government on the beef data and genomics programme, BDGP and the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, under the RDP, is not good.  In both cases, we have seen an underspend over the past two years, which were the first two years of the reformed CAP programme.  The upshot is that farmers have been missing out on much needed income.  The uptake of those schemes was less than what was expected because the schemes were closed prematurely and there was also a delay in commencing them.  Fianna F&aacute;il will be pushing in every way possible to ensure that the RDP allocation is spent in full.  We will also work to ensure that the aforementioned schemes are reopened and brought up to capacity.  In respect of the BDGP in particular, we will seek to ensure, in the context of the underspend from the first two years, that a payment of &euro;200 per cow is made to support our suckler herd, if at all possible.  That is our objective in terms of the RDP underspend and the BDGP.  <\/p> <p> The loan fund is a new departure which will be welcomed by some.  It is certainly is something which, at EU Commission level, will be seen as a financial instrument that is available to farmers to deal with income volatility.  However, it is crucial to ensure that it does not draw from single farm payments or from payments to the various agricultural schemes.  While the loan facility is something that farmers will certainly avail of, particularly those who are under financial pressure, there must be a separate scheme or payment for the tillage industry.  The Government has indicated in recent days that the loan fund should be the preferred avenue for providing support to tillage farmers, even those who have actually lost their crop this year.  I would draw a very strong distinction between those farmers who have actually harvested their crops, although they are under pressure for the fourth year in a row, and those farmers who have not been able to harvest their crop.  The former need our support but the latter are in a crisis situation.  They have not gone away.  They are still out there, dealing with the after effects of the very bad weather this year.  They have either not harvested at all or if they have done so in the past few weeks, they have harvested a crop that is worthless.  They do not have the cash flow or income to be able to meet their outgoings.  This is not confined to specific parts of the country and affects only a minority of tillage farmers, but for them it is a crisis.  If they are to be able to continue in the sector, the Government must provide an emergency or crisis fund to support them and to acknowledge the tremendous difficulty they find themselves in.<\/p> <p> I wish to touch on the issue of the challenges facing the mushroom sector.  The Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine met the EU Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr. Phil Hogan, this morning.  My party spokesperson on horticulture and food, Deputy Jackie Cahill, raised the matter of the mushroom sector with the Commissioner.  As a party, Fianna F&aacute;il will continue to push this issue.  The particular and very immediate pressure on the mushroom sector demands a response from Government to ensure that the sector can survive and pick up again.  There is a good future for the mushroom industry in the longer term but it is under very significant pressure at the moment.<\/p> <p> There are several other issues on which I look forward to achieving progress and following up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102000019#S00400","speaker":"1244","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476969600,"counter":144,"content":"<p>I welcome this opportunity to contribute to the debate on budget 2017.  There is no doubt that the budget was a test for the minority Government.  It was a hurdle that had to be overcome but many in the media and the public generally thought that the Government would fall at this particular hurdle.  I very much welcome the fact that we have come through this budget in tact.  It was an important point in terms of ensuring the stability of our Parliament, making sure that our country continues to be run properly and efficiently and that Parliament continues<i>in situ<\/i>.  It also marks an important turning point in terms of how we conduct the budgetary process.<\/p><p>We will look back on this particular budget in years to come as a point in history when we really changed how we how we did our business and when things were done very differently in terms of how we put our budgets together.  It is a huge privilege to have played a role in that, to have been here for that budget process and to see it completed.  It will be fully completed in the next few weeks.  In terms of the budget process in question, I sat on the new Committee on Budgetary Oversight, the first of its kind in this country.  That committee allowed for cross-party influence and participation in the budget process, which is not the norm and which had never been done before.  The idea behind that was to take away the big-bang effect of budget day and to ensure that there would be no surprises.<\/p><p>It was intended that when all parties came into the Chamber on the day of the budget announcement, they would have made an input into the budgetary process and would know what was contained in the budget for the coming year.  It was intended that the public would be aware as well.  The thinking behind this process was that it would give parliamentarians from across the board an opportunity to analyse the budget, to contribute to it and to critique it properly, rather than being landed on budget day with new measures they had no sight or sound of in advance.  I think this is a welcome and positive transformation in the budget process.  Although the amount of time available to the Select Committee on Arrangements for Budgetary Scrutiny was quite truncated this year, we had an opportunity to hear from the Minister and from many stakeholders and organisations that assist the Department of Finance in its deliberations.  It was hugely helpful for the committee to have informative debates and discussions with the Economic and Social Research Institute, the Nevin Economic Research Institute, the Department of Finance and the Ministers, Deputies Donohoe and Noonan.  One of the things I have taken from the process is the respect that was evident across the committee room for the differing views of Deputies from all parties and none.  It was okay to have differing views on the matters being discussed.  All views were taken on board and given due credit and credence.  I think that marks a huge and positive change in how we conduct our business.<\/p> <p> It is generally accepted by the public and in this House that the mark of Fianna F&aacute;il can be seen on the budget and that the party's input is evident in the outcome of the budget.  During the general election campaign earlier this year, we advocated very strongly for increased investment in public services to be prioritised over tax cuts at all times.  We carried that perspective into the negotiations on our confidence and supply agreement with Fine Gael.  It was at the heart of the interactions between Deputies Calleary and Michael McGrath and Deputies from the other side of the House during the budget negotiations.  The outcome of that process can be seen in this budget.  We pushed for a 2:1 split between expenditure increases and tax cuts, but we achieved a 3:1 split.  That shows we have listened to the views of the public in this regard.  The public did not want cuts in taxation to be imposed left, right and centre at the expense of good public services.  They wanted the wriggle room that is available in the public finances for 2017 to used to prioritise investment in public services that have been decimated in recent years.  I am glad the budget reflects the will of the people, and the majority of Members of this House, in this respect.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Party is proud to have played an instrumental role in ensuring the achievement of a 3:1 split.<\/p> <p> After the budget has been announced, we normally wait to see what the ESRI has to say about it as an independent body that analyses the effects of budgets on citizens.  Although the increase in household spending power as a result of this budget will be modest and minimal, I am pleased that for the first time in many years, the benefits of a budget in terms of increased spending power will be felt by the lowest income earners, first and foremost.  I think that represents a marked change on the past five or six budgets.  It is extremely positive that this change has come about.  I believe it can be attributed to the involvement of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party in the budgetary process.<\/p> <p> It was important to address a number of key issues in this budget.  It was clear that we had to do something to help people to access affordable child care of an appropriate quality.  I commend the Minister, Deputy Zappone, on the work she has done in this regard.  I would also like to mention the contribution of my party's spokesperson on children and youth affairs, Deputy Anne Rabbitte, in this area.  The child care measures in this budget amount to a start, but they do not address all of our concerns.  This budget was never going to address all of our child care concerns, but it is a positive step.  I welcome the Government's decision to invest money in allowing families to access affordable child care of a certain quality.  We have a long way to go in that regard.<\/p> <p> I welcome with caution the first-time buyers' initiative.  It has become increasingly difficult for people in my peer group in their 30s and 40s to buy their first family homes.  The feeling among many such people is that buying a house is now out of their reach.  They are concerned that they may never aspire to own their own homes.  I am glad to see that this issue is on the minds of the Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann because it needs to be addressed so that the pressure on prospective house buyers can be alleviated.  Having said that, I share some of the concerns about the incentive scheme that is being introduced.  It seems to have already started to increase the price of new-build houses.  It is clear that developers are aware that people are going to get tax rebates when they purchase new houses and are accordingly adding sums of money to their prices.  We really need to have a look at this scheme.  We should be open to reassessing it on an annual basis to ensure it continues to be fit for purpose.  We should be willing to give it a chance and see whether it works and it does what we hope it will do.<\/p> <p> It is important to remember that this was a modest budget.  It was not a giveaway budget or a budget to fix all problems.  When we speak in here or among the public, we should not be lauding ourselves for managing to find &euro;5 to give to pensioners.  While this increase is welcome, it is clear that &euro;5 is not a lot of money.  I do not think anybody who stands up in this Chamber should be hugely proud of giving &euro;5 back to pensioners or other social welfare recipients.  This modest amount of money is an indication of the direction in which we want to go as a country and an acknowledgement of the fact that the income and spending capability of pensioners, in particular, has diminished significantly in recent years.  That has led to increased poverty, stress and anxiety among people who receive the State pension.  While I welcome this positive initiative, I emphasise that we have much more to do in this regard.  I am pleased that we have taken a step in the right direction by increasing the State pension.<\/p> <p> I welcome the increased budget of &euro;12 million in my own portfolio of defence.  I understand some of that money will be spent on capital investment in our Defence Forces.  It is worth noting that we have one of the lowest defence spends in the developed world.  It represents 0.35% of GDP, which in a European context is an exceptionally low proportion of a country's overall budget to be assigned to defence.  While I do not dispute that other pressing issues, such as the housing crisis, homelessness and health care, need to be addressed, I reiterate that if we are to have the properly functioning and professional Defence Forces we need, we must ensure they are properly funded.  I have repeatedly reminded the Minister that Defence Forces numbers have decreased.  We are now well below the 9,500 full-time serving members we are supposed to have.  I have repeatedly asked the Minister to address this.  I certainly believe some of that budget needs to be spent on addressing the numbers in our Defence Forces, which are continuing to decrease.<\/p> <p> By any standards, last week's budget was a good one for this country in terms of the direction in which we are going and the policy changes we are making.  As a country, we have refocused our efforts to ensure we have good public services, a fair society and a working economy.  These are the priorities and clear objectives of any parliament.  I welcome the fact that this budget, as I have said, benefits people on the lowest incomes first and foremost.  I think it is one of the proudest aspects of the budget.  I am pleased that the Fianna F&aacute;il Party has made valuable contribution in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102000020#T00200","speaker":"1336","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1476970200,"counter":146,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Topical Issue Matters","time":1476970200,"counter":147,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102000021#U00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1476970200,"counter":148,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 29A and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Jan O'Sullivan - the need to announce the patrons of the nine new post-primary schools that are due to open in 2017 and 2018, including the school in Limerick city's south-west environs; (2) Deputy Pat Casey - the retention of Ardmore film studios as a centre for film production; (3) Deputy Thomas P.

It is very important to families living in Limerick city.  Limerick city is unique in that it has a central application system for entry to post-primary schools.  It does not apply in other parts of the country.  One of the nine schools that is to be announced in the near future is in the south western side of Limerick and is due to open in 2017.  Therefore, it needs to be on the list of schools to which parents can apply for their children to attend from September 2017.  The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, will know I have been raising the issue by way of parliamentary questions, and I have a written answer to a question from 5 October which causes me concern.<\/p><p>I am a former Minister for Education of Skills and the timetable, as I understood it when I left office, was that the patronage of the new schools was to be announced in the second week of September.  The Department was well aware of the urgency of the issue, particularly regarding the Limerick school, given that the central application system does not apply in other parts of the country.  This is the third week of October and we still do not have an announcement of the patronage of the schools.  The written answer I received was as follows:<\/p><blockquote>Applications received are currently being assessed by my Department...  The final assessment reports will be forwarded for the consideration of the new schools establishment group, NSEG, which will submit a report with recommendations to\u00a0me for consideration and final decision.<\/blockquote><p>I am concerned about this given that I would have thought that at this stage the recommendations would have gone from the NSEG to the Minister for a decision.  Schools in Limerick are holding their open days.  Parents are attending these open days and will very soon have to fill in a school application form in which they will rank their preferences from one to nine, usually.  This is a very important decision for parents.  On the south side of the city, there is one large school which is always oversubscribed.  Therefore, parents will have to decide whether they will put the school down as their first choice, knowing they may not get it.  If they do not get this school, they may end up with the choice at the very bottom of their list, given that most of the schools they may have put down as their second or subsequent choices will already be filled by parents who have made those schools their first choice.<\/p><p>People in the House who do not live in Limerick do not deal with the system.  It is a very specific system that applies in Limerick, and this is why it is so urgent we know the patronage of the school very quickly.  If the Minister is not ready to announce the patronage of all nine schools, I urge him to at least announce this one, given that it is the most urgent.  The other school that will open in Limerick is to be on the eastern side of the city.  Given that it will not open until 2018, there is no particular urgency about it, although parents would like to know who the patron will be, as do parents in the other seven parts of the country where new schools are to be opened in 2017 or 2018.  Obviously, the schools are needed, and would not be coming on stream if the demographic pressures did not exist in those parts of the country.  From my knowledge of Limerick, I know there is real stress on parents who are worried their children will not get a place anywhere near where they live.  In this part of Limerick, parents are sending their children out into the country on buses or across to the other side of the city, given that the one school in the area is so oversubscribed.  The same is true of the other side of the city, which is due to get a new school in 2018.  I urge the Minister to make a decision on the patronage of the school now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102000031#EE00600","speaker":"1325"},{"type":"speech","time":1476976200,"counter":293,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising the question, which gives me the opportunity to set out the process by which it is decided who will operate a new school.  Since 2011, new schools are established only in areas of demographic growth.  My Department uses a geographical information system to identify the areas under increased demographic pressure nationwide.  The system uses a range of data sources in carrying out nationwide demographic exercises to determine whether additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary levels.  As the Deputy will recall, the outcome of such demographic analyses was the November 2015 announcement that four new primary school and nine new post-primary schools would open in 2017 and 2018 to cater for increased demographic needs.<\/p>  <p>  When it is decided that a new school is required to meet demographic needs in an area, the Department runs a separate patronage process to decide who will operate the school.  It is open to all patrons and prospective patrons to apply for patronage of a school under this process.  The criteria used in relation to patronage of a new school place a particular emphasis on parental demand for plurality and diversity of patronage.  Parental preferences for each patron, together with the extent of diversity available in the area, are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of the process.<\/p>  <p>  In April 2016, applications were invited for the patronage of the nine new post-primary schools to be established in 2017 and 2018, including the new post-primary school to serve the Limerick city and environs in the south-west area.  The closing date for receipt of applications for this process was 8 June 2016.  Patrons submitted with their application a parental preference template in which parents had been requested to declare their preference for their child to be educated through that patron's school model and also their preference with regard to education through the medium of English or Irish.  The assessment process is at a very advanced stage in the Department.  As the Deputy will appreciate, the process is detailed and rigorous, and numerous applications have been received in respect of each of the nine proposed new schools.  The new schools establishment group is an external independent advisory group set up to oversee the process.  The new schools establishment group is meeting next week and a report with its recommendations should be submitted to the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, shortly thereafter for his consideration and final decision, and I will also receive it.  He will then announce who is the successful patron of each school.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of the common applications system which operates in Limerick, the Department has been liaising with the Limerick Education Centre in this matter and understands that post-primary school opening days and nights are ongoing.  The assessment reports and recommendations of the NSEG will be available on the Department&rsquo;s website following the announcement.  I will look into the particular school and if the Deputy would like to meet me, it would be no bother.  I would be delighted to sit down with her and see if we can push it forward as soon as possible.  I understand the necessity of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102000031#EE00700","speaker":"1351"},{"type":"speech","time":1476976200,"counter":294,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply and for his offer at the end of his contribution.  At least there is some progress and some definite information in that the NSEG is meeting next week.  I assume it will make decisions at the meeting and immediately send its recommendations to the Minister, and that the Minister, as is the norm, will go along with the recommendations.  I hope we will have news by the end of next week.  If, by any chance, the NSEG is not in a position to make a decision on all the nine schools, I urge that it make a decision on the school in question, given that it is the most urgent one.  I ask the Minister of State to convey this to the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, and the Department.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State can imagine what it is like for parents.  Every year, when they have to fill in these forms, public representatives in the area have very stressed parents coming into our offices.  These parents say they do not know what to do, given that if they put down a certain school as their first choice they may not get it and their children may have to travel long distances to school.<\/p><p>Given that a new school is coming on stream, pressure will be eased in the part of the city that has been under the most pressure.  Knowing that the school is coming on stream is a help in itself, but parents also need to know its patronage before it can be placed on their lists.

Yesterday, we received by e-mail the announcement that Ardmore Studios were being placed for sale on the open market.  This raises serious questions for Enterprise Ireland and the Government about the development of the film industry in Wicklow, given the industry's significant jobs potential for our county.<\/p>  <p>  As most people are aware, Ardmore Studios are the birthplace and foundation of the Irish film industry.  Ardmore is an amazing success story that should be built on, not sold.  The 18-acre site is crucial to the development of the film industry in Wicklow and, indeed, the nation.  Productions at Ardmore have won 14 Oscars and many BAFTA, Golden Globe and Emmy awards, including for such well-known films as \"Braveheart\", \"My Left Foot\" and \"Excalibur\" and, in the modern television era, \"Moone Boy\", \"The Tudors\" and \"Penny Dreadful\".<\/p>  <p>  The film industry is key to the economic development of Ireland, with up to 500 jobs associated with Ardmore when it is at full capacity.  It has been at full capacity for the past two years, earning profits of &euro;1.5 million and &euro;1.6 million, respectively.  Significant public investment by successive Governments and Wicklow County Council has been made in the site for decades and the industry has grown through section 481 tax measures.<\/p>  <p>  The Government, through Enterprise Ireland, has a 32% shareholding in the site according to yesterday's RTE business news.  What is the reason behind the Government's sale of the site?  The announcement of the sale as a going concern is worrying because there is a substantial risk that it will be sold to the highest bidder, who could be a developer and have nothing to do with the film industry.  Will the Government confirm that the sale is conditional and Ardmore will be retained as a film production centre, with no ifs or buts about it?  I just want a simple confirmation that the site will remain for the film industry.  Film production is a national strategic industry and the Government, through Enterprise Ireland, should retain a direct shareholding interest in it via Ardmore.<\/p>  <p>  Following the civil war and at the beginning of the determined efforts by Se&aacute;n Lemass to modernise the Irish economy, Emmet Dalton, friend and comrade of Michael Collins, convinced his old civil war enemy, Se&aacute;n Lemass, to invest in the film industry and build a studio at Ardmore on a 37-acre site, which opened in 1958.  If Se&aacute;n Lemass could be convinced by Emmet Dalton that the State should be involved in the film industry, it is ironic that a Fine Gael-led Government could be about to see that dramatic partnership end.<\/p>  <p>  As a representative of a key shareholder, will the Minister of State confirm that the sale of the studios will be conditional on its continuance as a centre for film production?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102000032#FF00500","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speech","time":1476976800,"counter":300,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  Clearly, my thoughts are with the workers and families affected by the announcement.  I hope that all employment rights will be adhered to if it comes to the closure or sale of the studios.<\/p>  <p>  The sale of Ardmore Studios is a commercial decision by the owners of the studios.  In this regard, Enterprise Ireland only has a minority stake in Ardmore Studios, which is a legacy issue as a result of an equity investment and a loan by NADCORP, a predecessor State agency.  The balance is owned by a company that is owned by its shareholders.  This means that the Government holds only a minority share.  It is worth noting that a significant part of the site being sold is zoned for film production purposes only.  This is the information that we received recently.<\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland supports certain types of companies in the creative sector in areas such as animation and digital content.  It provides these companies with a range of supports appropriate to their stage of business and is committed to supporting them to internationalise.<\/p>  <p>  Today, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, concluded a two-day Enterprise Ireland trade visit to Cannes and the Cote d'Azur region of France.  Twenty-three Irish companies were represented and travelled to France to build business relationships with their current and prospective counterparts in four key sectors in the region.  Seventeen companies from the Irish film sector were part of this group and included companies such as Soho Moon, Bandit Films, Irish TV and Treehouse Republic.  Building on its commitment to this sector, Enterprise Ireland was supportive of the establishment of Animation Ireland, a trade association for the leading Irish animation studios working together to promote Ireland's world class sector internationally.<\/p>  <p>  Wicklow has been home to Ardmore Studios since 1958 and the recent establishment of another state-of-the-art studio, Ashford Studios, demonstrates the region's suitability as hub for the indigenous and international film industry.  The regional presence of the Wicklow Film Commission is an additional support for film makers exploring options for filming in the area.<\/p>  <p>  The mid-east regional Action Plan for Jobs has a number of actions to support the film sector.  These include a feasibility study and business plan for the development of a film industry cluster in the county; activating a film industry network to contribute towards the development of an audiovisual cluster; piloting a one-day workshop in film industry-related training; building on the success of the film sector by providing supports and incentives and developing ancillary services; and the provision of film industry-related training programmes in partnership with third level institutions in the area.  In this regard, Wicklow County Council, education and training providers and the film industry development group are working with the Wicklow local enterprise office to progress these actions.<\/p>  <p>  I must apologise to the Deputy, as I am taking this question and the information has been given to me quickly.  According to it, the decision was a commercial one.  Enterprise Ireland only has a minority shareholding.  I do not know the exact figure and will not pretend to know, but either the Minister, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, or I will revert to the Deputy on this matter.  It is being investigated and we are in contact with whoever needs to be contacted because this has unquestionably been a blow to the area.  I am unsure as to the Government's involvement, given that this is a commercial decision and Enterprise Ireland only has a minority stake.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102000032#FF00600","speaker":"1351"},{"type":"speech","time":1476976800,"counter":301,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for taking this question.<\/p><p>However, the response I have had is very disappointing on a personal level.

As we all can see, she is not in the Chamber.  This raises more suspicion, which is not a word I use lightly, as to what is going on.  The State does not have a small shareholding in this industry; it has a 32% stake.  I fully agree with the Minister of State in regard to the Action Plan for Jobs.  There is reference, on pages 5 and 7 of that document, to the unique opportunity Wicklow offers to develop and build on the film industry, with a specific reference to the two studios involved.  The State is selling its shareholding in the largest film studio in the country with absolutely no conditions attached.  That is totally unacceptable.<\/p> <p> In my capacity as a Member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for Wicklow, I contacted IBI Corporate Finance yesterday to request a copy of the prospectus of sale in order to study it.  My request was refused point blank and I was told to contact Ardmore Studios directly.  I then spoke to the CEO of Ardmore Studios, who likewise denied me a copy of the prospectus.  What is going on here?  I have serious reservations about the Government's role in this sale.  It is disappointing and unacceptable that members of the Government do not know what is happening with the State's stake.  As I said, I am annoyed that I was asked yesterday to defer this matter on the basis that the Minister would be here today, only to find her absent.

Is the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, aware of plans by the Health Service Executive to cut primary care services in the Louth-Meath area?  The HSE has instructed management in the health service to save &euro;1.5 million by way of staffing cuts between now and the end of the year.  These measures will lead to serious cutbacks in services provided by occupational therapists, physiotherapists, public health nurses and, in particular, home help support staff.  Is the Minister of State aware that last Friday week, the HSE called a meeting at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Louth at which it informed management there that the contracts of nine full-time clerical and administrative staff and one part-time clerical worker were to be terminated with immediate effect?<\/p>  <p>  It beggars belief that at a time when we are seeing services, especially primary care services, cut to the bone, further cuts are being made just as we come into the winter months.  I know of many elderly people throughout Louth and east Meath, people who are sick and frail and have serious mobility issues, who are currently receiving only 15 minutes of home help twice a week, if they are lucky.  These are people who need help to get out of bed and get washed and dressed every morning.  Now the service will be further cut.  That is totally unacceptable and amounts to neglect of patient care.<\/p>  <p>  The sacking of nine full-time clerical and administrative staff and one part-time worker at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda will have an adverse effect on patients.  If there are insufficient numbers of clerical and administrative staff, there will be delays in patients getting notice of appointments, receiving referrals and obtaining doctors' and consultants' letters.  It beggars belief that this is being done.  Moreover, Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital is one of the worst in the country for overcrowding, being often top of the list in this regard.  Yesterday, for instance, 29 patients were on trolleys there.  I am calling on the Minister to reverse those cuts as we approach the winter.<\/p>  <p>  The situation is compounded by the fact that 18 beds assigned to services for the elderly in Louth have been closed and lie empty because of nursing staff shortages.  I realise there is an overall nursing recruitment plan in place but a significant part of the problem in my constituency is the serious delays by the HSE management nationally, not locally, in approving the filling of staff vacancies.  It was known for months before the 18 beds were closed that there was a need to recruit staff.  Those approvals were left on a desk or shelf gathering dust in the full knowledge of the crisis we were facing.  It was only when it was brought into the public domain several weeks ago that the beds were closed that there was an undertaking to fill the roles.  Will the Minister implement a fast-tracking process to fill these vacancies?  The delay in so doing is compounding the problems in the Louth-Meath area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102000033#GG00300","speaker":"1333"},{"type":"speech","time":1476977400,"counter":306,"content":"<p>I am taking this issue on behalf of the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, who apologises for having to attend another engagement.  The HSE has advised that Louth primary care services have not applied staffing cuts during 2016.  Department officials have, however, been advised by the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, RCSI, hospital group that its cost containment plan for the Louth hospital group, which comprises Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital and Louth County Hospital, included the release of 9.5 agency staff from various administrative and clerical roles within the two hospitals.  Senior management in the hospitals sought to retain two of those agency staff for a short period to facilitate an efficient transition of work duties to other staff within the hospitals.  At this time, 7.5 agency staff have been released, with the final two to follow at a later stage.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that community health organisation area 8, which includes Louth and Meath, is projected to run &euro;1.5 million in excess of available funds for primary care services for 2016.<\/p><p>This overspend is across the six counties of the CHO.  Each service manager has been tasked with exploring ways in which efficiencies and savings can be achieved.  As I have already advised the Deputy, Louth primary care has not applied staffing cuts during 2016.  The HSE has advised that where vacancies arise, applications are made by individual service departments to fill them.<\/p> <p> Significant additional resources have been invested in recent years in primary care and disabled services with a view to enhancing therapy service provision.  In particular, additional funding of &euro;20 million was provided in 2013 to strengthen primary care services and to support the recruitment for prioritised front-line posts.  Over 260 additional posts for primary care teams have been filled as part of this initiative.<\/p> <p> More recently, &euro;4 million was provided under the HSE's national service plan 2016 to focus specifically on addressing speech and language therapy waiting lists in primary care and social care for children up to 18 years.  This funding is facilitating the HSE to appoint 83 new full-time and recurring posts in primary care to address waiting lists, prioritising the longest-waiting children.  I am advised that three posts have been allocated to Louth under this initiative.<\/p> <p> Alongside services provided through primary care teams and networks, Louth has a Community Intervention Team, CIT, in place to facilitate early discharge from hospital.  The 2016-17 winter initiative provides for the expansion of CIT services in Louth and Meath with the potential to support additional patients through the winter and during 2017.  <\/p> <p> I also understand that there has been increased investment in addiction services across the Louth and Meath area during 2016, with three additional clinical posts coming on stream.  Additionally, there have been improvements in podiatry and dietetics services as part of chronic disease management.  Furthermore, budget 2017 provides additional funding of &euro;18.5 million for the further development of primary care services.  This funding will support the Government's commitment to a shift towards primary care so that we can provide better care close to home for communities around the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102000033#GG00400","speaker":"1307","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476978000,"counter":308,"content":"<p>The first question I asked was whether the Minister for Health would reverse the &euro;1.5 million in cuts to primary care services.

I have never heard of anybody who had a contract terminated with immediate effect going home to his or her family and saying, \"I was released from work today\".  They were sacked.<\/p>  <p>  I will go back to the questions and hopefully the Minister of State will give me an answer this time and not just the usual HSE spiel.  Does the Minister intend to implement a fast-tracking process for the filling of nursing vacancies within the HSE?  The filling of those vacancies was not approved by senior HSE management which has resulted in the closure of 18 beds in the elderly services in County Louth.  Will the Minister give a commitment to introduced a fast-tracking process?<\/p>  <p>  On the issue of recruitment more generally, is there any forward planning at all?  Does the HSE put any thought into the age profile of its staff and planned retirements?  Is there any sort of planning at all?  This crisis was allowed to develop due to inaction by HSE senior management at national level and, as a result, the patients and the staff suffer.  The staff suffer greatly.

Carlow town has a population of approximately 23,500.  The total population of the county is around 55,000.  The ambulance base has been located in the grounds of the former mental hospital in Carlow, St. Dympna's, for the past few years.  It has 15 rostered paramedics, five advanced and ten ordinary.  The base is one of the busiest in the south east.  The structure itself is a prefabricated building which has been in place for the past 15 years.  In the past while, however, the structure has become totally outdated.  There are issues with sewage and vermin, there is no running hot water and there is no place for the paramedics to make a cup of tea.  The base is used 24 hours a day, seven days a week, but is totally unsuitable.  Paramedics who are on a shift from 7 a.m to 7 p.m., for example, and who are back at the base in Carlow, cannot even make a cup of tea.  If they get soiled while on duty, there is nowhere for them to have a shower or change their clothes.<\/p>  <p>  Last October, I was given a written guarantee by the authorities regarding the base.  In a letter from the HSE, I was assured that a logistics and estates manager was involved in ongoing discussions with the HSE's estates section with the aim of identifying a suitable alternative site or suitable accommodation within the St. Dympna's campus as a matter of priority.  The campus at St. Dympna's is huge with a lot of available space.  However, as and from Monday morning next, the paramedics who work out the Carlow base are being moved to Kilkenny.  It is totally unacceptable to expect paramedics in a town the size of Carlow to work out of Kilkenny.  There should be an alternative site in Carlow made available to them.  I was also told that work was ongoing to provide an alternative and upgrade the existing structure.<\/p><p>If this work is going to be done, why not move the personnel to another part of the Carlow base?<\/p> <p> I have two questions for the Minister of State, whom I thank for being here.  Can she assure me that the base in Carlow will be maintained after this work has been completed?  It is essential that the Carlow base is maintained and I want an assurance to that effect.  There are serious concerns about the effect the decision to move these paramedics to the base at St. Luke's hospital in Kilkenny, which is at least 40 minutes from Carlow town and the north Carlow area, will have on patient care and welfare in the Carlow ambulance service area.  Can the Minister of State to give me an assurance that this move will not have a knock-on effect on the care and welfare of patients in County Carlow?  I will repeat my two questions.  Can the Minister of State tell me whether the base in Carlow town will be maintained indefinitely?  Can she comment on the effect this move will have on the welfare and care of patients in the Carlow area?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102000034#HH01100","speaker":"1268","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476978600,"counter":320,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Deering.  I am responding to this matter on behalf of the Minister.<\/p>  <p>  The National Ambulance Service, NAS, has confirmed that following a health and safety audit, an issue was identified in the shower and changing facilities used by staff at the Carlow ambulance station.  Works are planned to take place to rectify the issue concerned and this is being treated as a priority by the NAS.  Discussions are under way with staff with a view to addressing how services in the Carlow area can best be provided while the planned works are under way.  Patient safety will be the overriding priority in these discussions.  The director of the NAS has assured me that services in the Carlow area will not be compromised during this period.<\/p>  <p>  The NAS has undergone a significant process of modernisation in recent years.  A number of significant service innovations and developments have taken place, including: the establishment of the national emergency operations centre; the delivery of enhanced technology to improve response times; the development of an intermediate care service to provide lower-acuity hospital transfers, thereby freeing up more emergency ambulances for more urgent calls; and the establishment of a permanent emergency aeromedical support service.  We are looking at alternatives to the current care model, which requires every patient to be brought to an emergency department.  These alternatives include providing clinical advice over the phone to callers and referring them to other care pathways as appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  This reform programme is taking place against the backdrop of the HIQA review of ambulance services, which was published in late 2014, and the NAS capacity review, which was published earlier this year.  The capacity review, which was undertaken by a UK-based consultancy firm, Lightfoot Solutions, examined overall ambulance resource levels and distribution against demand and activity.  The review found that the NAS faces a major challenge compared to ambulance services elsewhere because population density in Ireland differs significantly from that in many other countries.  The population outside the greater Dublin area is widely dispersed, with a relatively large number of people living in rural areas.  This means response time targets are much more difficult to achieve because of longer driving distances.  The report endorses the existing policy of dynamic deployment, whereby vehicles are strategically located where they are most likely to be required, rather than statically deployed and located at a particular station.<\/p>  <p>  The implementation of the recommendations of the capacity review will require a multi-annual programme of phased investment in ambulance manpower, vehicles and technology. In that regard, the Deputy can be assured that increased funding will be available to the NAS for 2017.

I note that just two of the 158 Members of the House are present.  I have put my views on Syria on the record of this House on several occasions, most recently this morning at an Oireachtas committee meeting.  It is important for all Members be given time to reflect on the widespread concern expressed by Irish citizens about the situation in Syria, particularly the siege and bombardment of Aleppo.  The harrowing images on our television screens and in our print and digital media, especially the reports from Aleppo, have rightly created a sense of outrage inside the Oireachtas and across Ireland.<\/p><p>It is important to be absolutely clear that what is happening in Syria is a direct continuation of the events taking place there since March 2011.  Assad's response to the emergence of a protest movement was to resort to the mass murder of his people.  Schools, hospitals, food markets and bakeries have all been targeted for air and artillery strikes.  The regime slogan was clear.  The call was to side with Assad or the regime would burn the country.  I do not doubt the determination of those involved.  Their actions have made clear that they want to run the country or leave no country left to run.  This is a regime which the United Nations commission of inquiry has accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity.  This is a regime which has used and continues to use chemical weapons against its people.  This is a regime that the UN Secretary General said was responsible for countless killings and the maiming of children as well as for the arrest, arbitrary detention, ill-treatment and torture of children.  This is a regime that has consistently undermined the efforts of the UN and the international community to end the conflict.<\/p> <p> Ireland has been supportive throughout of a Syrian-owned and Syrian-led solution to the conflict.  The Syrian people must have the freedom to exercise their rights, including the democratic right to choose their national leaders.  These principles were set out clearly in Geneva in 2012 and have guided my interventions on Syria in Brussels and at the UN in New York, including for my address to the general assembly and at bilateral meetings with our international partners.<\/p> <p> One regrettable aspect of the conflict is the manner in which terrorists and extremists, sometimes with support from regional actors, have coalesced and used the chaos and instability to promote their radical ideologies.  The conflict has attracted violent extremists affiliated with militant groups, including Daesh, Jabhat Al-Nusra, Hezbollah and many others.  On a recent visit to the Golan Heights, I was able to see clearly the parts of Syria now held by some of these Islamist factions.<\/p> <p> In addition to Syria's long-standing divisions, we are seeing wider regional tensions being played out.  Irrespective of which group is perpetrating the violence, it is the people of Syria who continue to suffer.  It is appalling to see what is happening to the ordinary civilians of that country as this conflict continues to worsen.  The only way to end the scourge of terrorism and extremism is by resolving the conflict through a political process and restoring the legitimacy and authority of the Syrian state across all of Syria.<\/p> <p> I know that many Irish people are outraged at Russia's actions in Syria and its support of the Assad regime.  I share this disquiet.  Russia has vetoed resolutions at the UN Security Council to restrain this conflict, end the regime's illegal restrictions on humanitarian access, support efforts at a political resolution and provide legal accountability for the victims of the Syrian conflict on five occasions.  Use of the Russian veto has protected the Assad regime, while repeatedly denying the Syrian people the legal protections provided under international law.  I deplore this abuse of the authority which Russia enjoys at the United Nations.<\/p> <p> The military intervention by Russia since September 2015 has been a self-declared mission to defeat terrorism.  However, all the evidence is that Russia has adopted the same view of terrorism as the Assad regime, namely, that opposition to the regime amounts to terrorism.  Russia has claimed that it is attacking terrorists in Aleppo.  The UN special envoy, Staffan de Mistura, has said that there may be between 800 and 900 fighters in eastern Aleppo out of an estimated total population of 275,000.  There is no logic in the massive attacks we have all been witnessing if the aim is to target a handful of terrorists.  Hundreds of civilians in Aleppo have died.  All the hospitals in eastern Aleppo have been repeatedly hit by military attacks, as have the civilian rescue services.<\/p> <p> I do not even understand what Russia hopes to gain from the survival in power of an ally who has destroyed his country.  Syria will need many years and immense funding to recover from this conflict.  Russian support to Syrians other than Bashar Al-Assad has been sadly limited.  The actions go far beyond what might be judged as errors or collateral damage and appear to be either reckless or deliberate and in violation of the rules of war.  It is a matter of the gravest concern to me that a permanent member of the UN Security Council with a duty to the United Nations to uphold international law and the principles of the UN Charter could condone or engage in the bombardment on Aleppo.  As the EU stated on Monday, this bombardment may amount to a war crime.<\/p> <p> I wish to set out what I believe can be done to resolve this conflict and bring the agony of the Syrian people to an end.  First, all sides must act immediately to restore the cessation of hostilities.  Russia must use its influence on Assad to compel him to end his violence against the Syrian people.  The illegal and systematic denial of humanitarian access must end.  All sides must engage meaningfully in negotiations to achieve a Syrian-owned and Syrian-led political resolution based on the formation of a sovereign unity government.  Finally, there must be accountability for victims of this barbarous conflict.<\/p> <p> We count on Russia to fulfil the vital role it has chosen as a member of the international Syria support group to de-escalate the conflict and renew the political process.  Today's brief pause in the bombing of Aleppo is simply not enough.  Ireland stands ready to play a positive role.  My EU colleagues and I spoke on Monday with the UN special envoy, Mr. de Mistura, underlining our continuing and strong support for his efforts to stem the destruction of Syria and her people.  Today, the Taoiseach will be discussing the response of the European Union to the crisis and the EU approach to Russia to end this horrific violence at the European Council.  I continue to press for accountability in order to provide the victims with the hope of redress and in the hope that it will deter those involved from worse atrocities.  This approach has been behind our interventions at the UN in New York and Geneva.  We will not let these crimes be forgotten.<\/p> <p> There will need to be continued European and Irish support in Syria for many years to come.  Ireland's response to the Syrian crisis and the plight of the Syrian people over the past five years has been unprecedented, providing more than &euro;62 million in humanitarian assistance to Syria and the region to date.  This support has been channelled through a range of partners, including NGOs, UN organisations and the International Red Cross and Red Crescent movement, which are best placed to respond, often by linking with local civil society organisations to get aid to those most in need.<\/p> <p> We have resettled hundreds of Syrians across Ireland, including in my home town, some of whom are survivors of torture by the Assad regime.  We will accept thousands more.  Together with our EU partners, we remain engaged through the EU in the international Syria support group.  As I stated in my address to the United Nations last month, Ireland remains strongly committed to supporting the efforts of the United Nations to achieve both an end to the crisis and a sustainable peaceful resolution.  We will reinforce this point in a debate on Aleppo at the UN General Assembly in New York today.  The Syrian people continue to face great hardship and danger.  Their struggle for liberty and dignity is far from over, but they can continue to count on the support of Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102000035#JJ01100","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476979200,"counter":331,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his remarks.  I welcome this debate and I thank the Whip's office, the Business Committee and the Ceann Comhairle's office for answering my call for a debate on Syria to which all Members might contribute.  It is important that all Members get an opportunity to express their complete outrage and revulsion at what is happening in Syria and the depravity unleashed on the people of that country, especially on those in eastern Aleppo, during the past five years.<\/p>  <p>  This conflict has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives since the beginning of 2011.  Millions have been displaced.  That was a long time ago.  March 2011 was when the previous D&aacute;il was formed.  For people to be living in a state of war for that long and under such horrific condition is unthinkable.  Unfortunately, the savagery reported from Syria probably rivals anything in the history of human conflict.  My principal fear is that, like so many other conflicts in human history, it is perhaps only afterwards that the total story will emerge.  In the cases of Rwanda, Yugoslavia and the Holocaust, it was only afterwards that the full picture emerged.  I truly believe that when historians look back at this decade, the conflict in Syria will be the glaring stain on this decade and era.<\/p>  <p>  As a small country, sometimes our impact and influence on international events is limited.  Regardless, we have a duty to do what we can do.  Our obligation, as Members, is to ensure that the country is working at optimum level in this regard and that we are doing what we can do.<\/p><p>We have a proud record of punching well above our weight on the international scene.  We need to continue that.  I welcome the sentiments expressed in the Minister's statement and his efforts to date.  I know he feels deeply about this matter, as do the citizens of this country.  This has shocked and appalled people.  We need to do what we can.  I welcome the fact that we have allocated over &euro;60 million in aid to assist victims of the conflict in and around Syria.  That figure might surprise many people.  It is a large sum of money and it is going to some of the most desperate people in the world.  I welcome the recent allocation of additional aid that the Minister described to me in this House a week ago.<\/p> <p> Another way to help is to make our voices and protestations heard as clearly as possible on the global stage.  The role of Russia in Aleppo needs to be questioned.  I welcome the fact that the Russian ambassador was called in but it is time for him to be called in again to explain what he has done since the first meeting.  The Minister must demand that there be an immediate cessation of the aerial bombardment of eastern Aleppo, not for eight or 11 hours over the next four days, as reported in the news today, but permanently.  The weakest, most vulnerable people, children, toddlers, babies, old people, the sick and those with disabilities are the victims of the actions of the Syrian regime and Russia in eastern Aleppo.  We cannot stay silent on this.  I welcome our moves and actions to date but we need to continue making our voice heard.<\/p> <p> In a response to a recent letter from Senator Ray Butler, the ambassador seemed to say that our concerns are part of a western mass media agenda.  That does not appear to be the response of an ambassador who shares the concerns of the Irish people.  What is the point of having an ambassador here who does not take the concerns, outrage and revulsion of the Irish Government, the people and the D&aacute;il seriously, no matter where he comes from?  Expulsion of ambassadors from countries which are complicit in war crimes should be part of our foreign policy.<\/p> <p> I welcome the debate and look forward to hearing the views of other Members.  I call on the Minister to keep up his efforts and to continue to do everything he can to help this desperate situation, which will be viewed as a stain on this era.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102000036#KK00200","speaker":"1318","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476979800,"counter":333,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Deputy Lahart.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102000037#LL00200","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"speech","time":1476979800,"counter":334,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement, to which I listened intently.  It is a damning and trenchant statement.  It would be appropriate for him to put his views and those of the Government to the Russian ambassador face to face.  I met the Russian ambassador yesterday to put to him the concerns of my party and my constituents about the actions in Syria.  I spent almost an hour and a half at the Russian the embassy.  It would be worthwhile for the Minister to do likewise.  I accept that he has made public statements about the opportunities he has used to raise the concerns of the Government and the Irish people.<\/p>  <p>  We have to consider the scale of what is happening in Syria.  Since March 2011 over 250,000 Syrians have died in this conflict and over 1 million have been injured.  Almost 5 million are displaced within the country and a further 13.5 million - among them 6 million children - are displaced outside of it.  It is difficult to grasp this scale, particularly in the modern era when we can see on television, YouTube, Facebook and Twitter what, for example, the doctors and the Syrian citizens in Aleppo are putting up with.  To those who say we are overly critical of Russia, over 90% of the fatalities in Syria come from aerial bombardment.  The only people who have planes in this conflict are the Syrian Government and the Russian airforce.  The standing down of the Iraqi army after the second Iraq war led to the creation of Islamic State, IS, and brought about its militant views, increasing the number of Islamic terrorists in the region.  The current Syrian problem happened when, after the Arab spring  in 2011, a 13 year old boy was tortured, butchered and his body mutilated and returned to his family for daring to spray-paint protests about the Assad regime on a wall in Syria.  Hundreds and thousands of people came onto the streets demonstrating against the brutality of the Assad regime.  IS saw an opportunity and moved from Iraq to Syria where it created its caliphate.  Ireland is not neutral in the fight against IS.  No one could even remotely understand the level of brutality and barbarism it inflicts on innocent people, minorities and Christians.  It is a disgusting group.  I would not even call its members human - they are subhuman.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with the Minister that our priority has got to be to do everything we can to bring about an immediate ceasefire.  My party circulated to all parties a motion which it intends to move in the next week or two in private member's time looking for cross-party support to call for an immediate ceasefire and a condemnation of the Syrian regime and the Russian military.  Others may not sign that because they do not believe it is as critical as it should be of America.  The country with the most influence over the Assad regime is Russia.  Assad will listen to Russia which is hand in glove with his regime.  Those on the far left and in Sinn F&eacute;in who believe our motion is too critical of Russia are missing the point.  It aims to talk to the people who can influence Assad.<\/p>  <p>  The eight-hour ceasefire yesterday was a start.  The Russian ambassador informed me that six corridors for civilians to leave Aleppo would be opened and managed by the Russians.  Two further corridors would be opened to allow what is termed the terrorists to leave.  Within the group the Russians refer to as \"terrorists\" is the Free Syrian Army and those whom we would see as moderates and a genuine opposition to the Assad regime.  We are not talking about the Al-Nusra Front or Islamic State.  We are talking about people who have taken up arms against a brutal regime.<\/p><p>That is what we are talking about.<\/p> <p> This debate is important.  People one talks to on the streets will say that Ireland has an influence in this area.  The Minister knows that.  He is our Minister.  We have got to work with the people as best we can to stop this horrendous humanitarian crisis, which is probably the worst in modern times.  I remember the former Yugoslavia.  I remember Srebrenica as a younger person.  On the scale of things, this conflict is a much greater crisis and all pressure must be brought to bear to ensure it is ended as swiftly as possible.  The problem is that, time and again, the Russians have used their veto at the United Nations.  Zeid al-Hussein, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, stated that the UN Security Council should, without further delay, adopt criteria to restrain members from using the veto when there are serious concerns that war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide have been committed.  I agree with that statement.  Russia has hidden behind this veto to allow what is happening on a daily basis in Syria, and it cannot be allowed to continue.<\/p> <p> In ten, 20 or 50 years from now, how will the United Nations explain to people looking back on this the reason we stood by and allowed this conflict to happen?  The roots of the problem go a long way back.  I refer to the Arab Spring and everything that happened from that, and in regard to Islamic State.  This is not about the Islamic State.  This is not about trying to topple Bashar al-Assad either.  This is about trying to stop the murders of innocent men, women and children and the deliberate targeting of hospitals, schools, bakeries, medical centres and infrastructure with the heaviest weaponry, and the best and newest technology, being used to inflict massive damage and to wipe Aleppo off the map.  That is what is happening.  They are doing that to take the pressure off the Damascus regime and ensure that Assad remains in place, but that is a debate for another day.<\/p> <p> I appeal to the Russians, as I did yesterday when I met the ambassador, to take on board the view that the Irish Government, the Irish Parliament, the D&aacute;il and the Seanad find this action unacceptable and that Russia can and should use the influence it has with Assad to ensure an immediate ceasefire takes place and that humanitarian aid and medical supplies can get into Aleppo.<\/p> <p> I thank the Government for allowing this debate.  I look forward to a further debate on the issue by way of a Fianna F&aacute;il motion, which we will move within the next two weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102000037#LL00400","speaker":"1228","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476980400,"counter":337,"content":"<p>I thank my colleague, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, for sharing time.  He referred to the intention to wipe Aleppo off the map, a point I will take up in my contribution because, as many people know, Aleppo is an ancient city.  It is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world.  In that regard, the tragedy taking place in Aleppo is even more poignant.<\/p><p>Deputy Darragh O'Brien outlined some of the statistics with regard to the conflict but they worth repeating.  Before the brutal war in Syria the population was approximately 22 million, but the picture is very different now after four years of that brutal civil war.  Twelve million people have been forced from their homes: that is more than half the population.  Since March 2011, more than 250,000 Syrians have been killed, and more than 1 million have been injured.  A total of 4.8 million Syrians have been forced to leave their country and 6.5 million are internally displaced, making Syria the largest displacement crisis globally.  This year, an estimated 13.5 million people, including 6 million children, are in need of humanitarian assistance.  Of those, 5.47 million are estimated to be in difficult to reach areas, including close to 600,000 people in 18 besieged areas.  According to current figures, 11.5 million Syrians require health care, 13.5 million need protection support, 12.1 million require water and sanitation, and 5.7 million children need education support, including 2.7 million who are out of school in Syria and across the wider region.  Approximately 2.48 million people are food insecure, while more than 1.5 million need shelter and household goods.  That is a litany of appalling statistics.<\/p><p>Our own aid agency, Tr&oacute;caire, has said that the reality in Aleppo is relentless bombing, dwindling supplies, including medical supplies and doctors and nurses, starvation and fear.  Besiegement is not a necessary consequence of conflict, but in this case it is a deliberate policy to exhaust every coping mechanism.  The Syrian Government, with Russian support, is using this brutal siege to force the surrender of fighters in eastern Aleppo by any means necessary.<\/p><p>The siege of Aleppo has caused an international outcry, with a number of countries and groups accusing both Syria and Russia of war crimes in connection with attacks on medical facilities and aid convoys.  Syrian President Assad spoke in the past week of the need to clean Aleppo.  In July this year, <i>The Guardian<\/i>of London, in an editorial article, stated: <\/p><blockquote>The Syrian government and its Russian allies are resorting to a tactic of siege and starvation that has been used before in Syria, but they are now doing it on a much larger scale, and openly.  Their announcement of &ldquo;humanitarian corridors&rdquo;, [which Deputy O'Brien spoke about] for civilians and rebels who would want to flee the area must be exposed as a cynical ruse.  It is no surprise that Aleppo&rsquo;s population is not rushing towards these exit corridors, which have not in any case materialised on the ground.  The Assad regime&rsquo;s promises are incredible.  The Syrian government has demonstrated time and again how little it cares for international humanitarian law.  Its machine of repression makes no distinction whatsoever between armed combatants and civilians.<\/blockquote><p>In these last months, the people of Aleppo are being subjected to what, by any fair definition, must be described as a war crime.  Some days ago, my party leader stated:<\/p><blockquote>Civilians are not being killed accidentally because of a conflict - they are being deliberately and repeatedly targeted.  This death and destruction is no accident.  It is the primary strategy of the Syrian Government and the Russian military.<\/blockquote><p>Posted on the AI Jazeera website some time ago were images of Aleppo taken in July 2010, and again in December 2014.  In the words of a recent headline in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, this historical city is about to disappear.<\/p><p>Kheder Khaddour, a senior researcher at the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut, stated:<\/p><blockquote>Aleppo is not a goal in itself, but territorial gains are limited to the aim of fragmenting the opposition forces before any political settlement is reached.  The regime and its allies know that it would be impossible to defeat the armed oppositions and reclaim all the Syrian territory.  They have opted for a strategy which isolates rebel-held areas from one another.  By consigning the opposition to &ldquo;islands&quot; - isolated pockets of rebel-held territory surrounded by regime-held territory - the regime makes opposition forces vulnerable to repression and siege and dependent on regime allies to access further humanitarian supplies.<\/blockquote><p>Clearly, Aleppo has no strategic significance of itself, but it has been targeted for splintering and division for political purposes by the ruling regime and its allies.<\/p><p>The question we must ask in this House is whether we will say to Russia in particular that the barbarism it is facilitating is unacceptable.  The Syrian war has become one of the worst modern day humanitarian crises.  Everyone here is appalled by the conflict in Syria, and in particular in Aleppo.  Realistically, what can we do?  To date, only 500 refugees have been admitted to this State under the resettlement programme and under relocation, and to date we have taken just one unaccompanied minor from Syria.  The slow pace is unacceptable, and the Government must step up and do more.  We must honour our commitment and ensure that we provide the safest haven for those fleeing the ravages of this almighty war and conflict.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102000038#MM00200","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speech","time":1476980400,"counter":338,"content":"<p>Like other speakers, I welcome the fact that two hours was set aside to allow us discuss the deteriorating situation in Syria.

Instead of getting bogged down in pontificating our own world view, attempting to smear other Deputies and parties and somehow questioning their humanity, I hope that in this debate, we speak as one to condemn the violence and destruction and that, as a group of Irish parliamentarians, we can in some small way help in the humanitarian response and ultimately aid and assist efforts to find a negotiated solution to the conflict.<\/p> <p> This savage war has left approximately 8 million people displaced people inside Syria, 4.5 million refugees beyond Syrian borders, over 1 million people injured and more than 400,000 people killed.  As Sinn F&eacute;in's spokesperson on foreign affairs since 2012, the war in Syria has been to forefront of my work.  From the very outset of the war I have condemned the brutal reaction of the Syrian regime to the democratic protests that ultimately led to the outbreak of this conflict and I condemned the foreign interference, which has bankrolled armed groups and elongated the conflict.  Long before Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin began using the suffering and violence in Syria as a political football in an attempt to smear Opposition parties, I was speaking out against Turkey and Saudi Arabia's funding, arming and support of extremist jihadist groups in Syria.  I was speaking out against Russia and Iran's military support of the Syrian army and instead called on them to use their influence to broker a ceasefire and initiate a peace process.  Their current actions in Aleppo and the use of barrel bombs and bunker-busting bombs on heavily-populated civilian areas, including hospitals and food markets, are criminal.<\/p> <p> When I visited in Iran in January 2014 with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, I personally raised the case of the besieged Palestinian refugee camp of Yarmouk.  I appealed to the Iranian foreign affairs Minister to use his influence to lift the Syrian army's siege of this camp and to open humanitarian corridors so that aid could reach those desperately in need of it.  I have also strongly criticised the USA's decision to directly and indirectly intervene in the war.  Sinn F&eacute;in also opposed the lifting of the EU arms embargo on Syria at the end of May 2013.  We opposed it because we felt that flooding the country with more weapons of destruction would only cause more violence and bloodshed and not bring peace.  Our political analysis has, unfortunately, stood the test of time and was correct.<\/p> <p> So let us be clear: Sinn F&eacute;in stands in complete opposition to this war.  We oppose all forms of imperialism.  The aerial bombardments in Syria need to stop, as do the shootings, the mortar attacks and the tank shelling.  This includes the Syrian and Russian bombardment of Aleppo and the Turkish and NATO aerial bombing of other areas of Syria, including Turkey's invasion of Syria.  I cautiously welcome the pause in the bombing in Aleppo and the opening of exit corridors, though we have information today that it has broken down.  While this brief respite is welcome, I echo the UN's frustration that aid has not been allowed into besieged areas.  The UN has rightly stated that unilateral ceasefires after long sieges can only be truly helpful if they are combined with humanitarian access for those who do not want to leave.<\/p> <p> I also want to strongly condemn the intensification of Turkey's military attacks and bombardment of Kurdish areas in northern Syria.  Turkish jets and artillery have been bombarding areas north of Aleppo since Wednesday in a blatant attempt to attack and provoke Kurdish forces and civilians.  These are the same Kurdish forces who took on and bravely fought Daesh and liberated vast areas that Daesh and its offshoots had occupied.  Rather strangely, I have not heard a single EU member state condemn Turkey's attacks on these areas or on Kurdish fighters, which continue as we speak.  It seems the second biggest army in NATO is beyond criticism from European capitals and European leaders.<\/p> <p> I echo the UN's condemnation of the complete lack of adherence to the norms of international law by the warring parties in Syria.  Syrians, like people all over the world, have a right to live in peace free from fear, attack, foreign mercenaries and outside interference.  They also have a right to democracy and the highest standards of human rights.  The real and only way to stop the conflict is through inclusive dialogue and round-table peace talks that have the potential and credibility to lead to a real peace process.  World leaders need to use their influence and diplomacy to secure a ceasefire and bring all sides in this civil war to the table for discussions on a peace process with credible outcomes.  World leaders should be rational and smart enough to know their bombs will not bring peace to Syria.  They cannot bomb Syria into peace.  Their military interventions will not help establish democracy and respect for human rights in the country.  Darkness cannot drive out darkness - only light can do that.  Hate cannot drive out hate - only love can do that.  They were the words of Martin Luther King.<\/p> <p> The images and videos that we have all seen are truly disturbing and heartbreaking.  Two of the most powerful images have been of Omran Daqneesh and Alan Kurdi.  Omran, a five year old boy from Aleppo, was photographed sitting in an ambulance, shocked and bleeding after an air strike from Syrian or Russian planes hit his family home.  His ten-year old brother died from injuries he sustained in this brutal attack.  It deeply showed the human price of this brutal war.  There are many more like him stuck in Syria today, scared, frightened and praying for an end to this brutal war that has robbed them of their childhood.<\/p> <p> Alan Kurdi was a three-year old Syrian Kurd who drowned in the Mediterranean Sea as he tried to escape this same violence and destruction and find sanctuary in Europe.  The image of his lifeless body, washed up on the beach, brought immediate mass outpourings of grief and shame in Europe, but how has the EU handled the refugee situation since that awful death?  Many of the countries who have been most opposed to taking in refugees, who have put up fences and razor wire, are the same countries who are directly involved in this war.  Some are the main providers of weapons and are making huge profits from providing this death and destruction.  That is the shame of Europe.  We know that when there are huge increases in aerial bombardments there will be huge increases in those fleeing these areas and seeking protection in Europe.  The countries that have supplied the weapons that have forced these people to flee are the same ones telling them they are not welcome and to go back to their destroyed country.<\/p> <p> Ireland should be a leader in its response to the refugee situation.  We should be a leader in assisting the humanitarian response in Syria and neighbouring countries but we should also be opening our country to the vulnerable and desperate refugees that are fleeing Syria.<\/p><p> Only 69 Syrians have come to Ireland from Greece, and no Syrians have arrived here from Italy.  That is embarrassing, shameful and wrong.  I believe we can do more.  We have the support of the vast majority of Irish people, but they want to know how we will manage these refugees.  It is important that we explain to the people how we will do that.  We have had significant amounts of incredibly generous support from the Irish public to house and support refugees.  The Government needs to be up-front about how it is responding to the refugee crisis, and involving communities and NGOs, not hiding refugees in hotels or direct provision centres on the outskirts of towns.<\/p> <p> Ireland has a part to play in increasing international pressure to end the war, but we also have humanitarian and moral responsibilities to be a leader in responding to the refugee crisis, and this is were we can make a real difference.<\/p> <p> In September 2015, the Government committed to taking a total of 4,000 displaced persons by way of resettlement, particularly from Lebanon, and relocation from the front-line states, Greece and Italy, through the Irish Refugee Protection Programme, IRPP, and yet by the end of September 2016 only 486 refugees have been resettled so far and only 69 had been relocated.  I asked today for a note of explanation from the Minister because people are asking us what is the problem.  The system is broken but we cannot explain.  I have listened to Ministers and others try to explain, but we are not getting those answers.<\/p> <p> The International Organization for Migration, IOM, has reported that the number of refugees arriving in Europe has fallen sharply this year but routes have grown more deadly.  From January to the end of September 3,501 refugees died trying to enter Europe.  That is nearly a 20% increase on the same period last year.<\/p> <p> Four adults and a child were found inside a container in Rosslare port on Sunday night.  Thankfully, it is reported that they are healthy and are not seriously harmed from their harrowing journey.  They are apparently Kurds from Iraq who were fleeing persecution and have requested asylum in Ireland.  This shows the stark and urgent need to implement safe and legal routes for refugees to get protection in Ireland.  Sadly, under the Dublin regulations, they probably will not be allowed stay in Ireland.  The asylum system is broken and must be urgently fixed.  That is the note I will end on in relation to Syria - our system for helping many of those who are fleeing the conflict in Syria is broken and we need to fix it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102000038#MM00300","speaker":"1309","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476981600,"counter":341,"content":"<p>The now six year old conflict in Syria is the world's gravest humanitarian crisis since the Second World War.  The numbers are easy to throw out but difficult to grasp: 8 million displaced people inside Syria, 4.5 million people under siege or inaccessible, 4.5 million refugees beyond the Syrian borders, 1.5 million people injured and 250,000 people killed.<\/p>  <p>  Syria has become a free-for-all, in an open house.  Parties involved in the war there have received political, military and operational support from Russia, Iran, North Korea, Algeria, Iraq, the United States, France, the United Kingdom, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and others.  We have seen the Syrian Administration's barbaric treatment of its own population.  We are seeing large-scale breaches of international humanitarian and human rights law.  In particular, we see civilian populations exposed to indiscriminate attack, loss of life and the destruction of essential infrastructure services and basic medical care.  This breaches all of the rules established well over 100 years ago, by the Red Cross and Red Crescent.  It breaches all of the basic rules of humanity's treatment and what we know about these kinds of situations and how to help, in particular, the civilians caught in this war.<\/p>  <p>  The Labour Party joins other parties in the D&aacute;il in calling, at a minimum, for compliance with the humanitarian rules of warfare and for aid agencies to be allowed reach civilians in desperate need of help in Aleppo.  There has been some progress with the announcement from Russia to the United Nations that it will stop bombing eastern Aleppo for 11 hours a day for four days, but that is not nearly enough.  There needs to be time and space to organise a full-scale medical evacuation and the provision of medical support, and a deal is needed to permit UN aid convoys to move from western Aleppo and from Turkey, to get food into the besieged zones.<\/p>  <p>  Syria is rightly understood as being one of the cradles of human civilisation, particularly in the western world, the known world and the pre-Christian world.  One is talking about a country with a great ancient civilisation reduced to rubble and laid low.<\/p>  <p>  Apart from the immediate humanitarian aspects of this crisis, it has another dimension I want to mention because it touches us all in Europe.  I refer to the fact that the mounting tensions between the US and Russia have stymied United Nations and other efforts to broker a ceasefire.  Worse, even if the US and Russia are not on the brink of direct conflict over Syria, the world seems to be well on the way towards entering a new Cold War.  Indeed, relations between Russia and the United States have not been so bad in a generation, since the end of the Cold War.  Both countries now have a vital role in resolving the Syrian conflict, but they are at odds in their analysis and they profoundly mistrust each other's motives and intentions.  There can be no dialogue between them without some basic level of trust and understanding.<\/p>  <p>  In truth, the dispute between them has little enough to do with Syria.  Russia believes that it has been treated unfairly since the 1990s, that, unlike its smaller neighbours, it was never welcomed into a new community of nations but remained instead the principal focus of Western distrust.  One can put it down to US over-reach and insensitivity, to Russian nostalgia for Soviet greatness or, most likely, to a mixture of both.  Russia still claims Washington betrayed a promise when German unity was being negotiated that NATO would not take advantage of this opportunity and expand eastwards.  We know that the West Germans made such a promise to Gorbachev, and that when President George H. Bush heard about this, he said, \"To hell with that!\", and \"We prevailed, they didn't.  We can't let the Soviets clutch victory from the jaws of defeat.\"<\/p>  <p>  Whatever about who promised what, the facts are that NATO has added 12 eastern European countries since then, in three rounds of enlargement.  In 1999, Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic joined against strong Russian opposition.  Then came Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia.  The three new Baltic states had formerly been part of the USSR itself.  Most recently, Albania and Croatia signed up to NATO membership.  NATO has also officially recognised four aspiring members: Bosnia-Herzegovina, Georgia, Macedonia and Montenegro.<\/p>  <p>  This incorporation into NATO of countries formerly in the eastern bloc has been a major cause of increased tension between East and West, as we knew it would be back in 1990.<\/p><p> Arguably, the subsequent aggression against Georgia and Ukraine, and now Syria, was fuelled at least in part by ongoing resentment about continuing NATO expansion to the very borders of Russia.  Although Russia was left on the periphery of a post-Cold War Europe, it has fought its way back.  For a time it retreated from the world stage, but now it is back with a vengeance, and eager to restore a global role.  It is extraordinarily knowledgeable and has very deep ties with countries like Syria and the whole region.  On the other hand, the West prefers to focus on current Russian revanchism, on the stance of Mr. Putin, who described the collapse of the Soviet Union as \"the greatest geopolitical catastrophe\" of the 20th century.<\/p> <p> I quoted earlier the analysis of George H. Bush, whose reputation is as one of the more thoughtful members of his family, and the quality of analysis deteriorated subsequently.  The \"end of history\" people, on both sides of the US congressional aisle, trumpeted the victory of western ideology and economics - they seemed incapable of distinguishing between the two.  There was the simplistic notion that, when it came to the Middle East, all the West had to do was to guide the aims and goals of the Arab Spring, directing it towards an inevitable western style liberal democracy.  That analysis has proven to be totally disastrous.  Looking at Syria, it is a country very rich in resources, with an enormously well-educated population, as we know from the stories that have been recounted of the different refugees.  I am sure all of us have met people from Syria, many of whom now live in my constituency.  We can also look at Iraq, Egypt, Libya and Yemen.<\/p> <p> At this stage there is not much point in allocating blame between the initial strategic errors of the West and Moscow&rsquo;s more recent aggression in Georgia, Syria and Ukraine.  At this stage people are displaced, disappearing and dying in their tens of thousands.  It seems clear that Russia can and will use its role to shape a variety of conflict zones around the world.<\/p> <p> I would like to be able to assert with some confidence that the leadership in Russia and in Syria will some day be called to account for their war crimes against civilians but in an increasing bipolar world is there any point in claiming such a thing when the United States has yet to submit to the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court?<\/p> <p> In a world where all onlookers are again being herded into taking sides in the conflict between these two superpowers and where many in the EU are again stressing their connections to NATO, our function as a neutral country is to remain unaligned and to insist that the EU's foreign and security policy is framed and acted on in a genuinely independent way, highlighting the shared values of European countries and of European civilisation historically with all the countries of the Near and Middle East and rejecting any siren call to become involved in the struggle between two hegemonies for global dominance.  We must use all available diplomatic means and forums to raise this issue.  We have to co-operate with like-minded states in the European Union and in the UN.  We have to work towards an end to aerial bombardment, a genuine cessation of violence, an internationally enforced no-fly zone and humanitarian aid access throughout that country.<\/p> <p> I worked in many post-conflict zones long before I became a Deputy.  I worked with people who worked in refugee camps, particularly in Africa, following what happened in the Horn of Africa 20 and 30 years ago and what happened in Rwanda.  Ireland has played, and is playing, a very significant role and is being of significant help in designing humanitarian relief that will bring relief to the people who need it.  We are doing that quite proudly as a non-aligned, neutral country, being neutral militarily but a member of the European Union.  Neutrality does not mean we are indifferent but it puts us in a fairly powerful position to be an influencer for the good in what is truly a dreadful situation, notwithstanding the fact Ireland is a small country.<\/p> <p> I was very happy that the previous Government, of which I was a member, reached agreement with the Taoiseach last year - he has confirmed and upheld this on a number of occasions - that over a few years Ireland would receive approximately 4,000 people who have been driven out of their country and have become refugees as a consequence of the conflict.  I reiterate something the people often do not understand.  Almost all the people who are refugees from a war zone want to go back home, provided they have a home to return to.  It takes time to pick up the pieces in a post-conflict situation but most people go home, provided they have some place to return to.<\/p> <p> In offering protection and shelter to 4,000 people, I said at the time, and I say it again now, we should offer assistance to families with children, in particular.  Children are very vulnerable.  A great number of people are living in tents along various borders in different parts of Europe.  We have taken on a responsibility in regard to people in Italy and in Greece.  Through various agencies, such as Goal, Tr&oacute;caire and other development agencies with a strong presence in Ireland, a good deal of work is being done but, clearly, it is nearly enough.<\/p> <p> In fairness to the Ministers involved, they have been working to identify the people who will come to Ireland but what is wrong that it is not possible to identify these people who are facing into a very cold winter?  Many people have walked hundreds of miles.  They are not in good shape.  Members with medical backgrounds will know it is not a great recipe for avoiding pneumonia, whether among small children, older people, pregnant women or people who have previously been ill.  Just as we have seen the Naval Service reach out in the Mediterranean and do a job of which we are all very proud, we can encourage the people in the EU in this regard.  The bureaucracy appears to most right thinking people to be pretty monstrous.  There is much politicking involved in that bureaucracy but it is our job to try to solve it.<\/p> <p> It is possible to expand the aid budget further.  I am sure the Minister would be willing to do that.  There was only a very minor change in the budget but if we can identify and bring some of the people out of the difficulties they are in, in turn many of those people will return home when this conflict has ended to rebuild what we all hope to see, a new and peaceful Syria.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102000040#OO00200","speaker":"1253","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476982200,"counter":343,"content":"<p>When I proposed that we would have this debate in the absence of the Bill from Fianna F&aacute;il, I did so in order to allow this House to reflect on what the people and the Government can do in terms of intervening in a conflict that is utterly horrendous.  Words fail me to describe the barbarity of what has gone, and continues to go, on in Syria on a daily basis.  I was disgusted by the response of the leader of Fianna F&aacute;il's in accusing us of being Russian apologists.<\/p><p>In one way it was slightly amusing because we are normally accused of being Trotskyites, which is supposed to be an even dirtier word than Russian apologist.  Trotsky was the one person who stood out and led a movement against Stalin and the barbarism of the Soviet Union in its heyday and ended up with an ice pick through his head for his efforts.  It is ironic that we are accused of that on the one hand and called Russian apologists on the other.<\/p> <p> In his opening statement, the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, said, \"We have resettled hundreds of [refugees] ... We will accept thousands more.\"  I have to ask the Minister the obvious question.  When will this happen?  This conflict has gone on for five years.  The Mediterranean has been turned into an open graveyard.  Many of the Deputies in this House have visited various refugee camps.  I was in refugee camps in Athens during the summer.  I met people from Aleppo who would have a huge amount to offer this country.  They are mathematicians, scientists, teachers, nurses and all sorts of people with their children who would love to come to Ireland but were not asked to come.  They were asked to fill out forms according to European Union regulations and were given options of various countries.  Most of them had never heard of Ireland.  Nobody from Ireland is going around asking them if they would like to come to our country except for the odd visitor like me.  Most of them are being asked if they will go to Germany, Turkey and elsewhere.  We have to make a concerted effort to open our doors to those refugees.  That is all I will say on that issue.  We should probably revisit it again.<\/p> <p> I direct my comments on this to the question of clarity and what is happening in Syria.  I have had history lessons and heard a lot of different opinion in this House.  Deputy Darragh O'Brien said the only people with planes and bombs in this conflict are the Assad regime and Russia.  That should be put to bed straight away.  In July, 140 civilians, including children, were killed by American and French bombs from the sky in a town called Toukhan Al-Kubra.  It was not the first time and it probably will not be the last that French and US military were used to bomb civilians in this conflict.  The emphasis is rightly on Aleppo now.   Nobody is more appalled by the treatment of the people of Aleppo than those of us on this side of the House who started out at the beginning of the Arab Spring by declaring our complete support for that uprising.  We have consistently continued to do so.  The uprisings in Syria, Tunisia and Egypt, which spread like wildfire through the Arab populations, gave us hope for the first time in over a century that somehow the Middle East could regain its respect and decency on the planet.  It has been used as a football by every regime from America, Britain, France, Germany, Turkey and Israel.  It has been used as a political, strategic and economic football which has culminated in the conflict in Syria.  It goes right back to the division of the region after the First World War but, most important, it started with the invasion of Iraq by George W. Bush which hundreds of thousands of people in this country and millions across the planet protested against.  We were called over the top and hysterical when we said this would not stop at Iraq, that it would spread the conflict, increase sectarianism and give an excuse for regional powers and strategic interests to invade and infest many countries with their rotten murderous machines.  This is what is being played out in Syria.  It is the military intervention of imperialist powers who are conducting a proxy war in the Syrian region.  It is the people of that region that are suffering very dearly for it.  We should be telling the international community to stop selling arms to Israel, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the rotten, despotic regimes arming groups engaging in the conflict internally, to stop the bombing on all sides by the US and France and to stop lying.<\/p> <p> This is not just about Russia and Russia's role in it.  It is about international imperialist interference in the situation.  They should cease fire, get the hell out and leave the Syrian people to sort out their own issues.  If they had done that in the first place, we may have had a chance to support ideologically, from the outside and with humanitarian aid, those who were prepared to stand up to the Assad regime and those who engaged in the Arab Spring.  We are now in the horrors of a really desperate conflict which is continuing.  The Minister should be doing three fundamental things: calling for a halt to the sale of arms, opening the doors to the refugees, and stopping the use of Shannon Airport for military planes and personnel to land and refuel which assists them in carrying out whatever functions they carry out, whether in Mosul, Syria or beyond.  It has to stop.  It has been a demand of the population of this country in maintaining our neutrality.  Neutrality is not just a word; it is also actions.  Our actions in continuing to allow the use of Shannon Airport in such a way fly in the face of neutrality.<\/p> <p> If we remember the enthusiasm of David Cameron to roll into Syria and bomb the bejesus out of it when the conflict started, this will be a reminder that it is not just about Russia but about the imperial interest of the West which it has always had in the region and which it continues to have.  It is about influence, power and the dynamism of the big powers of this world.  The one power we have something to say about and could influence is that of Saudi Arabia, which is engaged in a terrible conflict in Yemen.  It is not that long ago that we flew the flag at half mast for the Saudi king when he died.  Let us fly the flag at half mast for the Syrians who are being butchered every day.  Let us open the borders, let them in and let them work, live and contribute to this society.  As was said by the previous Deputy, some day they will be able to go home to a country they love which was once beautiful and peaceful.  Until we do that, we are talking through both sides of our mouth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102000041#PP00200","speaker":"1367","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476982800,"counter":345,"content":"<p>What is happening daily in Aleppo can only be described as an ongoing atrocity.  Four hundred people were people killed in September, which amounts to 13 people a day.  It is an atrocity being carried out by Russia and the Putin regime with the aim of prolonging the existence of a brutal dictatorship that does not have the support of the majority of the population.  This is the aim of the Russian intervention in general and it is having some success.  What is happening is horrific and has to be condemned.<\/p>  <p>  Aleppo is emblematic of the nightmare facing the Syrian people in general.  Its people are torn apart with three different levels of conflict playing out on the ground.  There is a sectarian conflict that exists across the Middle East and is fuelled by imperialist intervention going back to 2003 and slightly before.  There is a battle of different regional powers - Iran, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Yemen all intervening with their own mechanism to do so.  There is also conflict between major imperialist powers on a world scale - Russia, the US, France and other European powers.  On the one hand, there is Russia backing the Assad regime and on the other hand, western powers are backing and indirectly funding what are often jihadist groups dressed up as moderate groups because they know that is what has to be done to access funding.<\/p>  <p>  The victims in all of this, as always in war, are the ordinary people.  It is incredible that 470,000 people have been killed in the past five years in Syria.  The number of internally displaced people is between 7 million and 11 million out of a population of 22 million.  It is the destruction of a country and society by this conflict.  It is people who are always the victims.<\/p>  <p>  I will take a moment to deal with an accusation that has been made twice and in a more muted form today, particularly by Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, that Anti-Austerity Alliance-People Before Profit Deputies are Russian apologists and are soft on Russia.  If Deputy Martin knew anything about our position on Syria, he would know that does not hold any water.  We have been very clear from the start about our opposition to the Assad regime, our support for those rising up against Assad and our opposition and condemnation of Russian imperialism and intervention.<\/p><p>The only explanation is that it is an utterly hypocritical intervention and a cheap attempt to score political points against his opponents on the left.  I looked up the number of times I spoke about Russia and condemned Putin in the European Parliament when I was a Member thereof.  In December 2011, I spoke about the mass protests in Russia against rigged elections, referencing my comrades in Russia who are dealing with extremely difficult and repressive circumstances in fighting against the Putin regime.  In September 2012, I condemned the imprisonment of the members of Pussy Riot and in October 2013 I condemned the detention of the Arctic 30 Greenpeace activists in Russia.  In December 2013, I spoke out on the Russian intervention in Ukraine and in February 2014 I spoke on the repression of LGBT people in Russia.  Also in that month I spoke out against what was happening at the Winter Olympics in Sochi, as well as the homophobia and exploitation that takes place in Russia.  I also checked the number of times Fianna F&aacute;il MEPs spoke out on what was happening in Russia during that period.  The total was zero.<\/p> <p> Members of Fianna F&aacute;il discovered this issue recently in order to make cheap political points against people on the left.  Why are they doing this?  It might be that they just do not know these things and Deputy Martin does not know what is our political position.  That is possible but I do not believe it is likely.  There are two issues here.  One is that Deputy Martin - who was a member of a Government that was closely aligned with US imperialism and that facilitated the use of Shannon Airport for the invasion of Iraq - is offended by the fact that not only do we oppose what is happening in and condemn the bombardment of Aleppo, the acts of Russian imperialism and the fact that 13 people are dying there each day, we also oppose what is happening in Yemen, where 13 people per day are dying as a result of Saudi Arabian airstrikes.  Saudi Arabia is one of the main recipients of US aid, including military aid, and is clearly an ally of the US.  It is given at least the implicit support of the US in those actions.  We also oppose the aerial bombardment of Mosul, in Iraq, that is currently taking place.  The problem is that we do not accept that just because one opposes Russian imperialism, one must take the side of western imperialism.  It is possible to say that one is opposed to all the different imperialist forces and take the side of ordinary people, be they Kurds, Palestinians or the ordinary people in Syria who are struggling for democratic rights.<\/p> <p> The other striking issue is that, for whatever reason - and this is dangerous because his party could be in government at some time - Deputy Martin has taken the decision to hitch Fianna F&aacute;il to the bandwagon of rising tension and conflict between the west and Russia.  That tension is occurring globally.  There is talk, some of it overblown, of the prospect of a new Cold War, but clearly tensions are rising significantly.  They are rising not because western powers care about the humanitarian actions of Putin or his lack of democracy but for geopolitical interests or reasons.  The Deputy has decided to do that in line with the Tory party in Britain, and it is extremely dangerous to try to contribute to that rising conflict.<\/p> <p> The fundamental problem here is imperialism.  It is correct to state that it is due to all the different imperialist interventions, post-11 September 2001, in Afghanistan and Iraq and the nightmare that has been created in the Middle East as a result, in which the Irish Government at that time, including Fianna F&aacute;il, was complicit.  However, one can go back further to the Sykes-Picot agreement and the drawing of lines in the Middle East to create artificial states deliberately containing national and ethnic minorities, in order to play the game of divide and rule for the benefit of western imperialist powers in terms of access to oil and resources.  Over and over again, it is ordinary people who have suffered.  There is an alternative.  It involves an end to imperialist intervention, landlordism and capitalism in the region, and using the resources that exist for the benefit of ordinary people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102000042#QQ00200","speaker":"1308","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476983400,"counter":347,"content":"<p>It would have been very difficult for Ireland to play a role in Syria.

We have been slower, we do not appear to have an appetite for it and we put very little energy into it, given the results.  Only one unaccompanied minor has arrived in this country in two years.  It beggars belief.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to staying neutral, in 2001 we facilitated the American invasion of Afghanistan by giving its forces the use of Shannon Airport for military purposes.  We also gave America the use of that airport for military purposes in Iraq in 2003.  There were problems in Afghanistan before the Americans invaded, but they became 100 times worse when they did.  There were also problems in Iraq before the Americans invaded, but they also became 100 times worse after that.  It is estimated that over 2 million civilians have died in Afghanistan and Iraq since 2001.  Almost 400,000 have been killed in Syria, which is nothing short of horrific.  Libya had problems before the western powers decided to invade, bomb the living daylights out of it and make it far worse.<\/p>  <p>  We all agree that what Assad has done is horrific and what Russia is doing at present is horrific.  However, where was the outcry when the US, France and Britain decided to arm the so-called moderate rebels in Syria?  Where was the outcry when the same countries decided to start bombing Syria in September 2014?  Did we have to wait for the Russians to start bombing it in September 2015 before we got angry?  At one stage 15 countries were bombing Syria - Australia, Bahrain, Netherlands, Belgium, France, Germany, Jordan, Canada, Morocco, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the UK, the US and Russia.  Iran was also involved.  What was it for?  The western forces have played a huge role in flooding Syria with arms.<\/p>  <p>  Where is the outcry about Yemen today?  A total of 3,500 civilians have been killed in Aleppo recently by Assad's forces and the Russians.  It is unthinkable.  However, 10,000 civilians have died in Yemen in the last year.  It is a mad war.  The US is supporting Saudi Arabia in a mad war, but I have not heard Fianna F&aacute;il give out about it yet.  I am surprised.

That is to simplify matters in a most dangerous way.  As a woman, I am outraged by the killing of people, including women and children, in Syria.  I believe every person in this Chamber is outraged but there is an onus on us to question and lead.  I agree with the comments by Deputy Wallace and others in respect of acting as a neutral country, using our moral power to call for a ceasefire and not taking sides but condemning the violence on both sides.  The US is in there funding and arming what are known as the rebels.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with some of the Minister's speech.  He pointed out that Syria is a sovereign country and should have the right to make its own decisions and I fully agree with him on that.  However, there is no sense of urgency in this Chamber nor in Europe.  I understand that this is the first time that Syria has been discussed despite the fact that the war is in its sixth year.  Once again, we have been forced by the people of Ireland who want us to lead and stand up and who say in the e-mails we have received that they want a ceasefire and for us to do everything in our power to help bring it about and then hold the Government to account for the 4,000 refugees at a minimum that we promised to take in.  The Minister has not explained to us why we have not taken those 4,000 refugees.  He referred in general terms to hundreds of refugees being taken in.  We promised to take in 4,000.  As I speak, our Taoiseach and the other leaders of Europe are having dinner in Brussels tonight and among other topics, will discuss the slaughter in Syria from the point of view of what to do about Russia and without recognising the complicit role played by Europe and the US, particularly the invasion of Iraq.

Aleppo is a city that has been totally laid to the ground and is like Ground Zero in New York.  It will be gone by Christmas.  Putin's gangster capitalist regime stands indicted.  The indiscriminate bombing, bunker bombs in civilian areas, deliberating targeting infrastructure to destroy water supplies, deliberately targeting hospitals and siege tactics to disrupt and deny food, water and medical facilities to civilians are all war crimes.  Other parties indicted include Daesh or ISIS and the Al-Nusra Front who are also guilty of war crimes.  They are forces that want to take society back to the Middle Ages.  Where they have succeeded in taking territory, particularly Daesh, they have unleashed barbaric horror on the civilian population.  Those using this conflict to fight a proxy war for influence and domination in the wider Middle East are also indicted.

We have to be neutral.  That is the message coming out of this Chamber and the Minister should take that on board.  All sides in the conflict should abide by international human rights law and put an end to all forms of bombing in Syria.  The Irish Government should formally make known to all governments that have engaged in the bombing of Syria the Irish people's revulsion at their actions.  The Irish Government should support the call from Prince Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, for the UN Security Council to without further delay adopt criteria to restrain members from using the veto when there are serious concerns that war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide may have been committed.

We have done that by allowing Shannon Airport to be used as a military air base, by signing up to a common European defence and foreign policy and by making ourselves subservient to the dominant European decisions made by France, Germany and the UK and saying it is a common policy to which we all sign up.  Where has our independence gone?  Where is our independent stance in the world in terms of what is right and wrong?<\/p>  <p>  There is no doubt that what Russia and the Syrian Government are doing to the Syrian people is wrong and appalling but, as has been said by other Members here, 15 countries have been involved in bombing Syria but it is only after Russia and the Syrian Government get involved that we get on our high horses and get indignant about it.  This is a sad reflection on the state of this country and our so-called foreign policy.  It is as if it is okay when the good guys do the killing but it is not okay when someone we do not like or someone the US tells us we do not like does it as well.

There has not been an ounce of condemnation by the Government or Fianna F&aacute;il here about that.

When the Americans bomb hospitals in Kabul, that is an accident and that is okay as well, even though M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res staff in the hospitals were in contact with the Americans telling them they were bombing civilian targets, yet they continued to bomb them.

This is most apparent in Aleppo.  This conflict has become a theatre of war in which Russia and other states are sponsoring and supplying either side.  Some of the sponsors are also being supplied with US military equipment.  The area has become a regional and international theatre of war.  How can this be?  Some of the EU states are half-hearted in their condemnation of Russia and Russian-sponsored bombing in support of Bashar al-Assad's regime.  The US and EU sanctions must be strengthened.  We must make greater efforts to put pressure on Russia and other international players to stop the conflict.<\/p><p>I will address the medical and humanitarian aspects of the conflict.  The bombing of Aleppo is disproportionate and indiscriminate.  Hospitals, medical personnel, schools and residential areas are all being targeted.  It is unheard of in war and is completely unacceptable.  To attack non-combatants, medical and civilian, must amount to a war crime.  Last week, 14 members of the same family, including eight children, were killed in an air strike.  Syria is the seat of civilisation.  It was the seat of language, science, astronomy and art.  Yet, it has been subjected to a completely unacceptable and savage war.  The carnage in Aleppo is all the more unbelievable when one considers that Bashar al-Assad is a medical doctor, trained in Damascus and London less than 30 years ago.  This is a blight on the medical profession, given the ethical and moral values which doctors receive during their training.  The principle of all medical practice is first, do no harm, <i>primum non nocere<\/i>.  Doctors have been involved in other very serious war crimes.  Radovan Karad&zcaron;i\u0107, a psychiatrist, was responsible for the massacre of 8,000 men and boys in Srebrenica on 11 July 1995.  Dr. Josef Mengele and 350 of his colleagues were involved in medical experimentation which was part of the holocaust to exterminate Jews.  In Syria, Bashar al-Assad and his allies are bombing fellow doctors and their facilities in Aleppo.  It is shocking to the point of disbelief.<\/p><p>Every war ends some time and in every conflict there are winners and losers.  However, in every conflict the civilians are the losers either by collateral damage or, as in Aleppo, because they are specifically targeted, along with medical personnel.  It is completely unacceptable.  Mosul may become the new Aleppo.  Every conflict ends in exhaustion, common sense or crippling hardship for the defeated.  Unfortunately, it looks like Aleppo will end with the latter.  All sides claim to have their god on their side, yet no god could condone what is happening in Aleppo.<\/p><p>Although Ireland has no economic or military power, it is a peacekeeping nation without a colonial past.  It has respected moral and diplomatic standing among the nations of the world, and we must bring this important leverage to bear on ending the conflict to bring the genocide to an end.  We must use our diplomatic expertise, which we have earned since the foundation of the State, to end the conflict.  We must also accept, as rapidly as possible, refugees from Syria.  We must take them to a place of safety so they can return to their nation when the conflict is over.  We need to take them from the area of conflict, bring them in, keep them safe, look after them and return them to their country at the end of the conflict.  It is extremely important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102000045#TT00100","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1476984600,"counter":357,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  We could say we should have had the debate some time ago.  We have taken our time in raising it in the House.  It is not before time that people have the opportunity to give their views.  The most urgent thing we need to do is to demonstrate Ireland's strong support for the people of Syria and to condemn unreservedly the indiscriminate and disproportionate use of force by the Russian air force and Syrian army on the citizens of Aleppo.  Over the past five years, there have been 17 major peace initiatives aimed at addressing the violence in Syria.  The result is close to 5 million refugees, 8 million internally displaced people and 400,000 dead.  Efforts to achieve a sustainable peace must continue and be redoubled and the international community must accept its share of the responsibility for the ongoing conflict.  Ireland must also play our part in pushing for such a road map to peace, particularly at EU level.<\/p>  <p>  If we have learned anything from Northern Ireland it is that building peace is not an easy process and requires great patience and compromise.  It requires ongoing effort.  Our Government, on behalf of the country, must be much more vocal.  We must begin a dialogue internationally on the responsibility to protect and the role we would play in such a principle.  The security of vulnerable regions of the world cannot be solely in the lap of Russia and the United States.  Yet, with each new report of the atrocities occurring within Syria, and particularly the humanitarian crisis which has taken hold in Aleppo, it is clear that these are primarily academic discussions, removed from the immediate reality of the impact of this conflict on so many people's lives.  If future peace initiatives continue to face the same challenges which have hindered previous attempts, the international community's response must be focused on securing the conditions necessary for an effective humanitarian response to take place.  In the immediate term, the greatest contribution Ireland can make is to focus our efforts on alleviating the suffering of the civilian populations, both inside Syria and among those who have fled.<\/p>  <p>  One of the greatest failings in the history of our State was our indifference to the refugee crisis that resulted from the Second World War.  We cannot allow ourselves to repeat the mistakes of our past by standing by as a crisis of the same scale continues to unfold and simply say that something should be done.  Every support must be given to the Irish refugee protection programme to ensure that, at a minimum, we meet our target of accepting 4,000 refugees into the State by the end of the year.  There was a commitment to do it, however progress has been extremely slow.  It is shameful and embarrassing that we have not delivered on the commitment.  There is a ground swell of opinion in the House, expressed today.  Members of the public are seeing the scenes in Aleppo and Mosul on their television screens every night and they feel helpless and disappointed that the international community has not been capable of responding adequately to the crisis.  At a minimum, they expect us to deliver on the commitments we have made on taking refugees, which are minor.  We should not drag our heels any longer.<\/p><p>It must be remembered that there are still approximately 57,000 people living in camps in Greece, many of whom are Syrians.  Recent reports suggest that the number of refugees and migrants making the journey across the Aegean Sea is increasing once more due to the recent instability in Turkey.  According to reports in <i>Der Spiegel<\/i>, however, there are only nine officers making decisions about the applications of 6,000 people on Lesbos.  Despite the EU's announcement that it would send hundreds of asylum experts to Greece, only three dozen officials have arrived on the islands according to the Greek Government.  What are we doing about this?  What attempts have been made to raise this matter at European level?  Why are we not more vocal on it?<br\/><br\/>In September, more refugees arrived on the Greek islands each day than migrants were deported in the entire month.  In light of this, we must review the number of refugees whom we are accepting to ensure we are doing our part.  There are a significant number of Syrians in Ireland.  Many of them have contacted their public representatives, including Deputies.  They are at their wits end concerning family members.  They cannot understand why we are not taking more immediate action and doing our part to support refugees.<br\/><br\/>I remain deeply concerned about the current arrangement with Turkey, particularly in light of recent events in that region.  We must work with our European partners to achieve a sustainable alternative in the processing of displaced people.  We may not be able to end the Syrian conflict, but it is surely within our grasp to raise this issue at every opportunity at European level, accept our share as a developed and relatively wealthy country and provide a safe haven for the many refugees who desperately need it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102000045#TT00200","speaker":"1222","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476985200,"counter":359,"content":"<p>It is deeply disturbing that, more than 100 years since the start of the First World War, nothing seems to have changed.  The big game still plays out.  There are different views of history, but Britain's fear of Russia moving south to cut off the former's access to the east was one of the factors that created the conditions that led to the lunacy of the First World War.  Russia is again extending south, this time into Syria, and carrying out what can only be described as war crimes in the city of Aleppo.  I read that, ironically, Ms Theresa May, the British Prime Minister, called today for European unity at the European Council in response.  I am unsure as to what response can be made militarily.  The problem with western and Russian intervention in the Middle East for the past 100 years has been that we have resorted to military means.  Throughout that period, this was done in American, Russian, French and British interests rather than in the interests of the region's Arab people.<\/p>  <p>  Most historians assess, and we in Ireland are in a unique position to do this, the seeds of the problem as having stemmed from the period after the First World War when the promise of Arab national rule, similar to the promise of Home Rule that we were given, was dashed with the creation of the Sykes-Picot agreement.  It divvied up the region, with France getting Syria and Britain getting Iraq.  Britain wanted the oil.  The French only realised afterwards that they had done a bad deal and the British had got the better wells.  This sounds trite and simple, but it is the underlining problem with how the region has been dealt with - that is the only way to put it - over the past 100 years.<\/p>  <p>  With the increased importance of oil in the 20th century and the ability of oil reserves to fund armaments and military development, the likelihood of Britain, America and elsewhere going to war in places such as Iraq to protect their oil interests is an underlying factor in what has destabilised and destroyed the country and people of Syria.  It is the deepest tragedy.  Although there are complex issues in Syria in terms of the civil war and the various factions, there is an underlying truth in that the West is looking after its interests in the region over a protracted period has laid the foundations for the tragedy we are seeing today.<\/p>  <p>  What are we to do?  In fairness to the Army, we are in the Golan Heights on a difficult mission.  When other countries pulled out, we were willing to place ourselves on the front line of peacekeeping.  We should commend our soldiers and continue with the work that we have done over the years in terms of trying to provide that neutral United Nations presence on the ground.  However, we must go further.  As other Deputies have mentioned, we are increasingly looking over our shoulders in terms of our own economic interests, for example, instead of looking back to our country's roots and traditions and to a time when we had a sense of affinity with Arab nationalism, be it expressed in Ba'athist nationalism or as an Islamic movement.<\/p>  <p>  Given our history, our tendency is generally to remain neutral in this most complex of areas.  In some instances, however, we must stand up for certain rights while being neutral.  We must stand up for the rights of those in Palestine, the Gaza Strip and, in particular, the West Bank who are being treated in the most despicable manner and who need friends, allies and recognition.  We should sometimes be willing to risk our short-term economic interests by saying the brave and difficult thing in support of the Palestinian people.<\/p>  <p>  We should step up to the plate and accept refugees from Syria in larger numbers and with greater urgency.  Friends of mine have visited the refugee camps in Greece.  They are pulling their hair out in despair wondering why they can walk down a pier in Piraeus and meet the finest people one could meet, people who would be a significant addition to this country and who are clearly declaring that they would like to move here, have good reasons for doing so, can speak English and can be of benefit to the country, yet those people are not being allocated places here or being processed in due time.  One can only suspect that a lesson is being meted out to refugees in Syria to the effect that they should not come across the Aegean Sea or else they will be stuck on a pier living in a tent for a year, two years, three years or Lord knows how long it will take us to get those people out of that horrible situation.  We should be standing up for our tradition.  We should be Samaritans in this moment and be willing to accept refugees far more quickly than we have been doing heretofore.<\/p>  <p>  We should remain neutral and not equate Islam with terrorism, which so many other countries seem willing to do.  I am glad that we have not gone down the French route.  My God, but they have a tradition of many years in the context of the Syrian crisis.  For them to make this equation because of their burkini and hijab disputes is a fundamental mistake and we should avoid making such an error.  It would not be fair.  Islam has good and peaceful exponents as well as people who follow a terrorist path.  We have shown our own ability to act as terrorists over the years.  We are not exactly as white as the driven snow when it comes to setting off bombs around the world.<\/p>  <p>  We must stand up for Irish citizens in Egyptian prisons.  We need to be willing to talk trade, give up trade or use whatever leverage we have to say, for example, that it is not right for a 17 year old boy to be in prison for three years.  This should be the case regardless of whether he is an Irish citizen, but because he is an Irish citizen, we have all the more an obligation to stand up for basic rights.  We should not take positions on the Arab Spring fight one way or the other.  We should just stand up for what is proper and what every legal court, including an Egyptian one, would agree, namely, that someone should not be kept in prison for two, three or four years without a fair trial.  We should stand up for such people.  All parties and countries would recognise that as justice.<\/p>  <p>  We should send aid and do whatever we can to support those in Aleppo.  Our aid agencies have a proud record.  Some have run into controversies in recent times, especially in Syria, but we should continue our support and increase our overseas aid.  The dramatic ongoing reduction in overseas aid as a percentage of GDP does not reflect where we should be placing ourselves on this matter.<\/p><p>If we are serious about helping people in Aleppo, we must be willing to give the necessary moneys for that purpose.  We are not doing that, however, and it was not done in the budget.

I thank my colleagues for their frankness and their passion in this important debate.  It is clear, having regard to the number of telephone calls, letters and e-mails received by my Department and my constituency office in recent weeks, that this is an issue that is deeply troubling to the Irish public.  The exchanges we have had this afternoon provide an important opportunity to address those concerns and to outline Ireland's position and the efforts we are making to support the Syrian people.  The use of violence by the Assad regime, its allies and other regional actors against civilians in Syria has been excessive, disproportionate and indiscriminate.<\/p>  <p>  The city of Aleppo has faced the brunt of that violence in recent weeks.  The pause today in the bombing offers a small reprieve for the citizens of that beleaguered city.  It is clear, however, the pause will soon come to an end and the people of Aleppo will once again sit in silence and fear awaiting the all too familiar sound of aircraft overhead.  The threat to the defenceless civilian population is unacceptable.  I again call on the regime and its allies to extend the pause and put in place a lasting cessation of hostilities.  I strongly emphasise that the end of the pause can never be an excuse for the Assad regime and its allies to justify renewing its totally unacceptable bombardment of the ancient city of Aleppo.  These atrocities must end and must be accounted for.<\/p>  <p>  I will try in the time available to me to address some of the specific concerns raised by colleagues.  I will, of course, get the note Deputy Crowe requested.  It is being drawn up as we speak and the Deputy will have it very early next week at the latest.  We have agreed to accept 4,000 refugees and asylum seekers from Syria.  I share the concern of many in this House that the process of bringing them here has not been as rapid as we would have expected.  I hope those numbers can now be facilitated.  I have no doubt the Syrian people who come here will be warmly welcomed by everybody in this House and by the public.  I am in regular contact with my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, to advance the reception programme.<\/p>  <p>  I am asked on a daily basis what people can do to help the Syrian people other than supporting the refugee programme.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, referred to the humanitarian support we provide.  Some 13.5 million people remain inside Syria and are in need of critical humanitarian assistance.  Ireland's response to their plight in recent years has been unprecedented, with more than &euro;62 million in humanitarian assistance allocated to Syria and the region.  That support will continue.  More than 2 million Syrian children have been forced out of school.  The conflict is now in its sixth year, which is the entire span of second level education here in Ireland.  Young people in Syria and those who are displaced in the region are on the verge of becoming a lost generation.  We will continue to direct our humanitarian aid to those most in need.<\/p>  <p>  I have repeatedly expressed my concern at the failure of the UN, particularly the Security Council, to act to protect the Syrian population.  The Secretary General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, has made clear his own frustration at the failure to uphold international humanitarian law and the impunity under international law for those committing crimes in Syria.  That action undermines the UN as well as weakening international law and fundamental rights.  Several speakers referred to what is being done in Syria as war crimes.  In particular, the attack on the humanitarian convoy was an act of barbarism.<\/p>  <p>  I look forward to opportunities for further discussion on this issue.  I told the Taoiseach two weeks ago that I am available at any time to participate in debates such as this and to inform the House as to what we are doing.  I will be in the Chamber for Question Time next Tuesday, which will afford us an opportunity to resume deliberations on these important issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102000047#VV00300","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1476985800,"counter":363,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at at 6.30 p.m. until 2 p.m. on Tuesday, 25 October 2016.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
