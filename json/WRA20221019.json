These impacts of climate change are already causing mass displacement, submerging national heritage sites, and causing entire communities to lose their way of life. At COP26, Ireland committed to more than double its climate finance to &euro;225million a year by 2025 to support developing countries, as well as pledging &euro;5million to support operationalising the Santiago Network to catalyse the technical assistance of relevant organisations, bodies, networks and experts, for the implementation of appropriate approaches to averting, minimising and addressing loss and damage at the local, national and regional levels, in developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. Looking to COP27, Ireland supports progressing dialogue on finance for loss and damage and encourages parties to maximise the value of the Glasgow Dialogue, seeing it as a valuable space for analysis of needs, gaps, and opportunities. Ireland is also ready to work with key stakeholders across the humanitarian, development, and climate sectors, including financial institutions whose existing work is relevant in this space. Through the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021, Ireland has closed the door on new oil and gas exploration activities. Ireland is committed to enabling sustainable climate resilient development using clean and renewable energy sources and will promote and support measures at an international level which avoid locking in further long-term fossil fuel consumption. To this end, Ireland joined the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance (BOGA) at COP26 to promote dialogue on the need for a managed and just phase-out of oil and gas production. As a core member, Ireland looks forward to actively participating in progressing BOGA priorities this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900069#WRB03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","counter":52,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900069#WRB03600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bus Services","counter":51,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900069#WRB03500"},{"type":"question","counter":52,"qnumday":63,"qnumall":"[52139\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900069#WRB03600","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if planning permission has been approved for the new BusConnects route due to travel down Highfield Road, Rathgar, Dublin 6; the number of stops in total that will be installed on this road; and if residents were given prior notice before construction work recently commenced.","asker":"1555","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":53,"content":"<p>As Minister for Transport, I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport.\u00a0 The\u00a0National Transport Authority (NTA) has statutory responsibility for the planning and development of public transport infrastructure in the Greater Dublin Area, including BusConnects Dublin.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Noting the NTA's responsibility in the matter, I have referred the Deputy's question to the NTA for a direct reply.\u00a0 Please contact my private office if you do not receive a reply within\u00a010 days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900069#WRB03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Driver Test","counter":54,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900069#WRB03800"},{"type":"question","counter":55,"qnumday":64,"qnumall":"[52156\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900069#WRB03900","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the number of HGV driving tests provided in 2020, 2021 and to date in 2022, in tabular form.","asker":"1453","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":56,"content":"<p>This is a matter for the Road Safety Authority.

They also note that it must be emphasised that ventilation should be delivered as part of a layered strategy of protective measures to control the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19. Along with these preventative actions, ventilation further reduces the risk of COVID-19 transmission in schools. The updated guidance for schools is also fully in line with the most recent guidance on non-healthcare building ventilation during COVID-19, published by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre on 20th January 2022 and general advice on preventing the spread of COVID-19 in non-healthcare settings published by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre 10 May 2022.<\/p><p>The ventilation guidance recognises that there is no &ldquo;one size that fits all&rdquo; and that ventilation is best managed at local individual school level. Consequently, to provide additional support in the context of Covid-19 the payment of a minor works grant totaling &euro;45m for primary schools and special schools, plus a once-off Covid-19 minor works funding of &euro;17m for post-primary schools, was issued in December 2021 to all recognised schools in the free scheme. Schools have been using this funding to address their ventilation requirements which can, where required and with the recommendation of their engineer or architect, include air cleaning filters (HEPA).

This means that, for the first time since 2017, the programme has been significantly expanded to an additional 322 schools. Those schools are now gaining access to targeted supports to address educational disadvantage. This\u00a0will add an additional &euro;32million to my Department&rsquo;s expenditure on the DEIS progamme from 2023, bringing the 2023 allocation to in the region of &euro;180million.<\/p>  <p>  Schools with the highest levels of concentrated educational disadvantage were identified for inclusion in the programme through the refined DEIS identification model which is an objective, statistics-based model. Schools were not required to apply for inclusion in the DEIS programme and the model has been applied fairly and equally to all schools.\u00a0The model uses information from the school&rsquo;s individual enrolment database and 2016 national census data as represented by the Pobal HP Deprivation index.\u00a0It also takes into consideration the significant educational disadvantage experienced by Traveller and Roma learners and by students residing in direct provision or emergency homeless accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  The underlying principle of DEIS is to provide supports to schools with the highest proportions of disadvantage. It is possible for two neighbouring schools to have a different profile in terms of proportion of students from disadvantaged backgrounds and the relative weighting of disadvantage apportioned in each.\u00a0 Each school has a unique profile based on its individual school enrolment. \u00a0A detailed paper on the refined DEIS identification model is available on gov.ie<\/p>  <p>  Schools that were not satisfied with the outcome following the application of the DEIS identification model to their school enrolment data were provided with the opportunity to have that outcome reviewed.\u00a0The DEIS appeals process was applied fairly across all appellants and the results are final.\u00a0My Department will continue to support schools to deliver high quality, inclusive teaching and learning to students and young learners.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the extension of the DEIS programme to new schools is just one phase of work in my vision for an inclusive education system which supports all learners to achieve their potential. While the DEIS programme supports those schools with the highest levels of concentrated educational disadvantage, I recognise that there are students at risk of educational disadvantage in all schools. Conscious of this, and recognising the need to target resources to those schools that need them most, the next phase of work will explore the allocation of resources to schools to tackle educational disadvantage. Part of this programme of work will involve consultation with all relevant stakeholders.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to this, following the National Census 2022 held on the 3rd April last it is envisaged that an updated HP Deprivation Index will be generated by Pobal and will be available in Q3 of 2023. My Department will engage with Pobal in relation to this process. The updated HP Deprivation Index when available can be considered by my Department to inform future resource allocation to tackle educational disadvantage. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900071#WRD02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs","counter":165,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900071#WRD02800"},{"type":"question","counter":166,"qnumday":101,"qnumall":"[52161\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900071#WRD02900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 82 of 12 October 2022, if she will clarify where it has been recommended in a professional report that a specialist placement is in the interests of a student with neurodevelopment diagnosis, if such a student is entitled to seek a placement in an ASD unit despite not having a specific ASD diagnosis (details supplied); if it is Government policy and that of the NCSE that only children with an ASD diagnosis can access ASD units, or if all children who have a professional report recommending a specialist placement are equally entitled to seek a placement in an ASD class; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1612","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":167,"content":"<p>I would like to thank the Deputy for the question and would like to advise the following:<\/p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide.<\/p><p>The NCSE have advised that ASD classes are organised to address the specific needs of students with ASD.

If such a decision is made, a complainant can appeal the Director&rsquo;s refusal to the Investigating Committee, which will then decide whether to uphold or quash that decision. This appeal process is referred to in section 42(4) and 42(4A) of the Act. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Where a complainant remains dissatisfied with how the Teaching Council has dealt with their complaint, they can consider taking judicial review proceedings, having taken any necessary legal advice. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900071#WRD05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":188,"content":"<p>Question No. 108 answered with Question No. 107.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":189,"content":"<p>Question No. 109 answered with Question No. 107.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":190,"content":"<p>Question No. 110 answered with Question No. 107.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":191,"content":"<p>Question No. 111 answered with Question No. 107.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Transport","counter":192,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900071#WRD05500"},{"type":"question","counter":193,"qnumday":112,"qnumall":"[52258\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900071#WRD05600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if a student (details supplied) who has missed nearly ten days of school this year due to lack of transport can be approved for a school bus ticket; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1579","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":194,"content":"<p>The School Transport Scheme is a significant operation managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department.\u00a0 In the\u00a0last school year over 121,400 children, including over 15,500 children with special educational needs, were transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;289m in 2021.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In July 2022, Government announced funding for the waiving of school transport scheme fees for the coming school year as part of a wider package of cost of living measures.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Ticket registration for the 2022\/23 school year closed on 29 July by which time almost 130,000 applications\/registrations were received for mainstream school transport.\u00a0This figure includes 44,299 new applications as well as roll-overs from the previous school year.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann has advised that the child referred to by the Deputy is not eligible for school transport under the terms of the school transport scheme however, there is available capacity on a school transport service.\u00a0 I am pleased therefore, to advise that the child referred will be issued a ticket on board a school transport service for the 2022\/23 school year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900071#WRD05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Schemes","counter":196,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900072#WRE00200"},{"type":"question","counter":197,"qnumday":113,"qnumall":"[52281\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900072#WRE00300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the reason that the DEIS status was not granted to a school (details supplied) despite approximately 80% of its student population residing in an area of extreme social and economic disadvantage; and if she will provide the school's ranking within the refined DEIS identification and its scores on the Pobal HP Deprivation index.","asker":"1466","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":198,"content":"<p>In March I was glad to be able to announce\u00a0a major expansion of the DEIS &ndash; Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools programme which means that, for the first time since 2017, the programme is being significantly expanded and eligible schools will now gain access to targeted supports to address educational disadvantage.

In excess of 3,450 primary and post-primary NQTs have had their registrations finalised by the Teaching Council to date with 35 further applications currently in progress.<\/p>  <p>  The Teaching Council recently made regulations allowing for the registration of 3rd and 4th year undergraduate ITE students under a new registration route, Route 5 (Student Teachers).\u00a0 Approximately 1,300 undergraduate student teachers have applied for registration under Cycle 1 of Route 5 registrations. Cycle 2 of Route 5 registrations commenced in early October.\u00a0 Once registered with the Teaching Council, such student teachers can be employed by a school to cover substitutable vacancies.<\/p>  <p>  Sub Seeker, a central portal for short-term substitute vacancies, was jointly developed by IPPN \/ NAPD in accordance with the Teacher Supply Action Plan and launched in December 2019. The portal matches available primary and post-primary teachers with short-term substitute vacancies.\u00a0 More than 11,800 teachers have registered with Sub Seeker to date.<\/p>  <p>  Significant additional posts have also been allocated to the primary substitute teacher supply panels in areas where significant challenges in sourcing substitution continue, bringing the total to 610 posts on 151 panels, covering approximately 2,800 schools.<\/p>  <p>  The supply panels work alongside the existing methods of sourcing substitute teachers, such as Sub Seeker, the national substitution portal service referred to above and schools can also make local arrangements to have their own regular substitutes to call on if needed.<\/p>  <p>  On a temporary basis for the 2022\/23 school year, Job-Sharing teachers may be employed to work in a substitute capacity in any school, during the period they are rostered off duty. \u00a0Teachers on Career Break may carry out unlimited substitute work for the 2022\/23 school year.<\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue, with the cooperation of the Education Partners, to develop and implement measures to address challenges faced by schools and to support the supply of teachers to our schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900072#WRE03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Staff","counter":225,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900072#WRE03100"},{"type":"question","counter":226,"qnumday":124,"qnumall":"[52454\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900072#WRE03200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of schools identified as non-compliant with the provisions of the 2015 Arbitration Agreement in relation to school secretaries and caretakers employed by the schools through the capitation grant scheme from 2019 to date in 2022, by county in tabular form; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1495","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":227,"content":"<p>Most schools hire secretarial and secretarial and caretaking services under grant schemes and responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school.

Safe practice is defined as the implementation of safeguarding measures necessary for working with young people in a manner that acknowledges their need to live in as normal an environment as possible. All children have the right to be cared for, fulfill their potential and be protected from harm.<\/p><p>Children who are in the care of the State under the Child Care Act 1991 are assigned an allocated Social Worker to carry out statutory responsibilities for the safety and welfare of the child. Once a child has been received into care, the most crucial task for the social worker is to find a placement that matches that child's needs. Children, depending on their identified need, may be placed in Foster Care, Residential Care, Special Care or other placement types. A key part of the social worker role is to develop, in consultation with the child and relevant others, a care plan which will guide the quality and safety of the child's placement. There are safeguards surrounding each child's care placement, whether foster or residential care, and all placements are supervised by a professionally qualified social worker. <\/p><p>Supervision levels are high in Residential Care, with staff-to-child ratios linked to the Risk Assessment for each child in the group setting.  In addition, each child in Residential Care has a Key Worker with responsibility for the child, and this staff member liaises directly with them and also co-ordinates health and social services.  A number of policies are in place to safeguard children while they are in Residential Care, such as Children First, and Missing Child from Care, while First Aid Responder training is mandatory for all residential care staff. While children in Residential Care have access to the same level of health care as children living in a home setting, Tusla continues to work with HSE Mental Health Services to strengthen supports and services for children in the care of the State.<\/p><p>Furthermore, Regulations and Standards govern the placement of children in care, including Foster Care and Residential Care.  These provide for the welfare of the child, the care practices, care records, accommodation and safety precautions.<\/p><p>The placement of children in Foster Care is governed by the National Standards for Foster Care 2003, and underpinned by the Child Care (Placement of Children in Foster Care) Regulations 1995 and (Placement of Children with Relatives) Regulations 1995. The placement of children in Residential Care is governed by the National Standards for Children&rsquo;s Residential Centres 2001, and underpinned by the Child Care (Placement in Residential Care) Regulation 1995, and the Child Care (Standards in Children&rsquo;s Residential Centres) 1996.  The placement of children in Special Care is governed by the National Standards for Special Care Units 2014, as well as the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Children in Special Care Units) Regulations 2017.<\/p><p>HIQA carries out announced and unannounced inspections of Foster Care Services, Statutory Children&rsquo;s Residential Centres, and Special Care Units. HIQA carry out these inspections against the identified Regulations and Standards. Tusla is the statutory regulator of Private and Voluntary Children&rsquo;s Residential Centres, and is therefore responsible for the registration and inspection of these centres in accordance with Regulations, Standards, and the relevant provisions of the Child Care Act 1991.<\/p><p>The foregoing sets out the safeguards in place with regard to all placements of children in Foster Care, Residential Care and Special Care. Tusla in discharging its statutory responsibilities under the Child Care Acts must have the best interests of the child as its paramount consideration. The Agency actively monitors every placement of every child in care to ensure its appropriateness to the needs of that child, and any concerns or breaches of Standards or Regulations are addressed in this context. <\/p><p>The death of a child in care is always a tragic event. There are however robust procedures in place to review the circumstances of the death and to identify any learnings that might arise. The State has well developed investigation and review mechanisms in place for when such tragic events occur. <\/p><p>In relation to any unexpected death, an inquest led by the coroner (an independent judicial office holder who investigates unexpected deaths) establishes the facts of each specific case and determines the cause of death of the person involved.  A post mortem may be requested by either a coroner or a doctor. The coroner will ask for a post-mortem in the case of a violent, sudden or unnatural death or as part of a criminal investigation, and may use its findings at an inquest. <\/p><p>Tusla has well developed structures and processes to review the circumstances of the death of a child in care and to identify learnings from these cases. All deaths of children in care are notified in line with an Incident Management Policy so that any learning can be shared to inform service improvements.  Tusla also notifies any child deaths of children in care to the National Review Panel and to HIQA in line with the<b><\/b>Interim Guidance for Tusla on the Operation of the National Review Panel (2021).<\/p><p>My Department is not responsible for collating statistics on the death rate of persons under the age of 18.

Information is sought at the point of registration on any additional supports that may be needed due to a disability. Education and training providers offer learning and other supports to apprentices during their training and many employers also provide accommodations in the workplace to apprentices with disabilities. Currently a total of 640 apprentices, or just under 3%, have declared one or more disabilities, and are receiving additional supports. A majority of these, 400 apprentices, or 62.5% of the total who identified as having a disability, identified themselves as having dyslexia. A further 25.5% identified other disabilities related to learning, while 12% did not specify what disability they had.<\/p>  <p>  One of the five overarching objectives of the Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025 is \"Apprenticeship for All\" by ensuring that the profile of the apprenticeship population will more closely reflect the profile of the general population. The Plan promotes general access, diversity, and inclusion in apprenticeship by suggested targeted supports to encourage participation from under-represented groups including those with disabilities, women and those from ethnic minorities. <\/p>  <p>  The expanding range of opportunities available within apprenticeship, as well as changing work practices in traditional areas, provide a step towards increasing opportunity for persons with a disability and other traditionally under-represented groups, however relying on a broader range of apprenticeships is not sufficient to provide equity of opportunity to marginalised groups.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Targets and interventions for specific groups will be detailed through an Equity of Access subcommittee of the National Apprenticeship Alliance to ensure that the voice of under-represented groups is integral to the development of the apprenticeship system. It is envisaged that the subcommittee will include representation that ensures links with second level, community education, youth justice programmes, broader FET provision and higher education are represented. <\/p>  <p>  The National Apprenticeship Office will increase the visibility of underrepresented groups in apprenticeship literature and promotional material to reflect the participation and positive experience of people from all backgrounds and communities, as well as the availability of assistive supports.<\/p>  <p>  The actions set out in the Plan build on the outcomes of the 2018 Review of Pathways to Participation in Apprenticeship which has already resulted in a significant widening of measures to support increased visibility of apprenticeships.<\/p>  <p>  Specific actions in the Action Plan include:\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  - An employer survey will determine baseline employer attitude and extent of knowledge of supports\u00a0available to employers for supporting employees with a disability.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  - Targets and interventions for specific groups will be detailed to ensure that the voice of under-represented groups is integral to the development of the apprenticeship system. <\/p>  <p>  - Targets for participation by under-represented groups, and additional specific actions to support those target groups will be set in conjunction with the Equity of Access      Subcommittee and will be monitored on an ongoing basis to ensure that interventions are effective in supporting increased diversity of the apprentice population.<\/p>  <p>  - An apprentice\u00a0bursary\/support scheme will be established to fund up to 100 apprentices\u00a0per year who are experiencing severe socioeconomic disadvantage and who\u00a0are from target groups, including lone parents, people with disabilities,\u00a0Travellers and Roma.<\/p>  <p>  - Access to apprenticeship programmes and pre-apprenticeship courses will be clearly labelled as\u00a0such, with progression routes into apprenticeship clearly identified and\u00a0information on these courses will be published on www. apprenticeship.ie.<\/p>  <p>  - All apprentice jobs are advertised on\u00a0www.apprenticejobs.ie, with information on apprenticeship now accessible from the CAO website. A dedicated apprentice guidance line has been established to support this initial period of increased visibility of apprenticeship to school leavers<\/p>  <p>  - Extending the bursary of\u00a0&euro;2,666 which is paid by SOLAS to employers of female apprentices in the 25\u00a0craft apprenticeships to encourage them to employ female apprentices to\u00a0all apprenticeship programmes with greater than 80% representation of a\u00a0single gender.\u00a0 This is being implemented with effect from 01 January 2022, and covers all new apprentice registrations from that date on eligible national apprenticeship programmes.<\/p>  <p>  As set out in the Programme for Government and elaborated in the Action Plan there must be clear, demonstrated engagement with apprenticeship by the public service to embed the apprenticeship model within the national employer base. A target of 750 new apprentice registrations per annum will be delivered across the public service by 2025. Apprenticeship provides an opportunity to target and widen the recruitment pool for both generalist and specialist roles within the public service and as a means to meeting commitments under the Comprehensive Employment Strategy such as increasing the statutory target of 3% of employees with disabilities in the public service to 6% by 2024.<\/p>  <p>  The Wage Subsidy Scheme (WSS) does not fall within the remit of the DFHERIS. However, I do recognise the intersection that is apparent between our policy objective of developing an inclusive and accessible apprenticeship system for all and the unintended consequences of the current lack of alignment between the WSS and Apprenticeship. <\/p>  <p>  The Wage Subsidy Scheme (WSS) is a financial employment support to private sector employers, the objective of which is to encourage employers to employ people with disabilities and thereby increase the numbers of people with disabilities participating in the open labour market.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Currently, the Scheme does not recognise those employees who are engaged in apprenticeship programmes. As such, DEASPs current criteria for accessing the WSS is incompatible with apprenticeships<\/p>  <p>  DFHERIS officials have engaged with DEASP counterparts to ensure that between the APA and the WSS, barriers will not arise to prevent or dissuade interested employers and candidates from pursuing their career goals through Apprenticeship.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised that DEASP will be carrying out a review of the Wage Subsidy Scheme this year as part of its commitments under the Comprehensive Employment Strategy. As part of this review DEASP will be conducting a consultation on the scheme from the perspective of employers and people with disabilities.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that\u00a0these measures and the\u00a0implementation process\u00a0for the Apprenticeship Action Plan overall will have a significant impact in ensuring\u00a0greater diversity in the apprenticeship population as a whole.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900074#WRG05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"question","counter":370,"qnumday":172,"qnumall":"[52066\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900074#WRG05800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his actions to increase the number of disability support staff in further and higher education institutions to reflect the increase in the number of disabled students; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1513","askee":"1624"},{"type":"question","counter":371,"qnumday":173,"qnumall":"[52067\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900074#WRG05900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the ratio of disability support staff to disabled students in further and higher education institutions from 2016\/2017 academic year to the 2020\/2021 academic year, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1513","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":372,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 172 and 173 together.<\/p>  <p>  The provision of disability supports and services for students, and the organisation, staffing and management of the disability support services, is a matter for each HEI.<\/p>  <p>  The Higher Education Authority have informed my officials that information on staffing levels of disability support services in HEIs is not collected.

In 2012, FATF expanded these requirements to domestic PEPs in line with United Nations Convention against Corruption.<\/p><p>This is reflected in Articles 20-23 of the Fourth Directive, which broadened the application of the EU regime to include domestic PEPs. This came into force in Ireland in 2018.<\/p><p>The definition of &lsquo;politically exposed person&rsquo; in the Directive specifies several categories of PEP &ndash; including, for example, heads of state, members of parliament, members of the governing bodies of political parties, supreme court judges, ambassadors and others. This definition is open: while the categories stated must be included, other persons may be considered a PEP on the basis of them holding a prominent public function.<\/p><p>Relevant entities (e.g. financial institutions) are obliged to: <\/p><p>(a) have in place appropriate procedures to determine whether the customer or the beneficial owner of the customer is a PEP; <\/p><p>(b) apply enhanced due diligence to business relationships with PEPs, including:<\/p><p>(i) obtaining senior management approval for establishing or continuing business relationships;<\/p><p>(ii) taking adequate measures to establish the source of wealth and source of funds that are involved in business relationships or transactions;<\/p><p>(iii) conducting enhanced ongoing monitoring of those business relationships.<\/p><p>These measures also apply to family members or persons known to be close associates of politically exposed persons. <\/p><p>The Central Bank of Ireland publishes guidance for financial institutions in respect of PEPs.

The completion of Phase One of the roll-out, envisaged before the end of this year, will result in fully operational Regional Fertility Hubs in each of the six Regional Health Areas across the country.<\/p>  <p>  Phase Two of the roll-out of the Model of Care will see the introduction of tertiary infertility services, including IVF, provided through the public health system. In this regard, funding was secured in Budget 2023 to support access to advanced AHR treatments, including, crucially, to allow the commencement of Phase Two of the roll-out of the Model of Care.<\/p>  <p>  This investment will facilitate the first steps to be taken towards the provision of a complete publicly-provided fertility service, which is the ultimate objective of Government. In particular, it will allow the historic development of the first National Advanced AHR Centre, delivering IVF and ICSI through a wholly public clinic. This is scheduled to open in the early part of 2024 and will provide a nationwide service, with all six Regional Fertility Hubs having equity of access for onward referral to it, via a shared care pathway. Subject to the provision of additional funding in future, it is envisaged that additional National Advanced AHR Centers will be developed and become operational on a phased basis elsewhere in the country.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The 2023 allocation will also be utilised to support the Regional Fertility Hubs in order to expand their scope of services next year by introducing the provision of IUI (intrauterine insemination), a significant, yet less complex and less intrusive, component of AHR treatment. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Separately, as an interim measure, I have instructed that some funding be made available to support access to advanced AHR treatment via private providers from September 2023. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  My officials, in conjunction with NWIHP, are now planning for the operationalisation of both the publicly- and privately- provided service, including the development of a national eligibility framework, as well as determining how the interim funding for private treatments will be provided to individual eligible patients. I expect that this process will involve, where appropriate, engagement with relevant stakeholder groups. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Overall, my Department and the Government is fully committed, through the full implementation of the Model of Care for Infertility, to ensuring that patients always receive care at the appropriate level of clinical intervention and then those requiring, and eligible for, advanced AHR treatment such as IVF will be able to access same through the public health system. The underlying aim of the policy to provide a model of funding for AHR, within the broader AHR regulatory framework, is to improve accessibility to AHR treatments, while at the same time embedding safe and appropriate clinical practice and ensuring the cost-effective use of public resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900077#WRK02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Abortion Services","counter":517,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900077#WRK02500"},{"type":"question","counter":518,"qnumday":221,"qnumall":"[52138\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900077#WRK02600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the research commissioned by his Department to inform the three-year review on the implementation of termination of pregnancy services has been completed; when this report will be made available to the public; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1579","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":519,"content":"<p>The Review of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 commenced in line with statutory and Government commitments in December 2021.

This includes ongoing work on the revision of the General Pharmaceutical Legislation, Orphan and Paediatric legislation, work to define\/set criteria for unmet need, creation of the Health Emergency Response Authority, Structured Dialogue Initiative, and Clinical Trials Regulation. There is a delay in the timeline of the proposals related to the revision of the General Pharmaceutical legislation with these now expected in early 2023.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Ireland welcomes and eagerly anticipates the actions that will emanate from and underpin the delivery on the aims of the Pharmaceutical Strategy for Europe, which is premised essentially on ensuring access to safe, affordable effective medicines for all European patients. <\/p>  <p>  The current action being taken by the EU Commission to review the general pharmaceutical legislation, and the orphan and paediatric legislation is a welcome opportunity to introduce potential streamlining and rationalisation of the regulatory processes. New and innovative medicines will continue to be a key element of improving health outcomes, but it is equally important to ensure continued access to older, off-patent medicines, especially in smaller Member States. There is an opportunity, as part of the Strategy, to streamline and simplify our medicines legislation to minimise regulatory hurdles to placing products on smaller MS markets. The opportunity to potentially enhance market and patient access, through exploration of technological adaptive solutions, such as electronic product and patient information, and multi-country packs is welcome. <\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health has established a Cross Departmental\/Agency Group with key stakeholders, with differing perspectives so as to be best equipped and informed to react holistically from a national perspective as the implementation of the strategy progresses.\u00a0The Group has already held three meetings with a fourth one planned in early December.\u00a0\u00a0To ensure all views are heard the Department of Health will engage further with key Stakeholders at a later stage as the implementation of the Strategy progresses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900078#WRL00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Services","counter":560,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900078#WRL00800"},{"type":"question","counter":561,"qnumday":235,"qnumall":"[52273\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900078#WRL00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to Parliamentary Question Nos. 227 and 228 of 28 September 2022, if he will provide a further breakdown of the total current HSE residential budget for disabled persons, including the number of individuals supported in residences directly funded by the HSE; the current budget for this provision; the number of individuals supported in residences funded through Section 38 and 39 organisations; the current budget for this provision; the number of individuals supported in residences through private providers; and the current budget for this provision, in tabular form.","asker":"1567","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":562,"content":"<p>As this relates to a service matter, I am referring it to the HSE for direct reply to the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900078#WRL01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":564,"qnumday":236,"qnumall":"[52274\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900078#WRL01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to Parliamentary Question Nos. 227 and 228 of 28 September 2022, if he will provide a further breakdown of the full current HSE residential budget for disabled persons, including the number of individuals and amounts of funding provided for residential funding allocated to the 2400 persons living in congregated settings and or group homes; and the amount of residential funding allocated to persons living in community homes of four persons or less, in tabular form.","asker":"1567","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":565,"content":"<p>As this relates to a service matter, I am referring it to the HSE for direct reply to the Deputy.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900078#WRL01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1484"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cost of Living Issues","counter":566,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900078#WRL01400"},{"type":"question","counter":567,"qnumday":237,"qnumall":"[52276\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900078#WRL01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the supports that the Government is putting in place to help support a vital service during the cost-of-living crisis (details supplied).","asker":"1466","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":568,"content":"<p>A significant fund of up to &euro;100m has been allocated this year to support community-based\u00a0service providers\u00a0who are such an essential pillar in the provision of Health services across country. \u00a0This fund is being made available in recognition of the challenges being faced by the sector in delivering and maintaining key health and social care services against a backdrop of increased inflationary pressures affecting energy, heating and related costs. \u00a0These organisations are funded through the HSE to deliver a range of health and social care services on behalf of the HSE to communities around Ireland.

The committee included representatives of all stakeholders, including advocacy representatives, and was chaired by Dr Siobhan Ni Bhriain on behalf of the chief clinical officer. The report acknowledged the additional funding made available to develop services in recent years. It advised on the development of seamless interfaces between agencies providing gender services. The committee agreed a job description for a consultant psychiatrist in child and adolescent psychiatry in CHO 7 and CHI to develop the service for those aged under 18 (and to replace the current system of psychological support provided by the Tavistock Clinic).

Further risk-based TB tests are also deployed as an effective means of finding disease and thus preventing onward spread of undetected infections.<\/p><p>In April 2021, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020\/689, of 17th December 2019, supplementing Regulation (EU) 2016\/429 of the European Parliament and the Council, came into effect. Annex IV, Part 2, Section 2 of this regulation requires that for herds to maintain their TB Free Status and thus their ability to trade on the open market, all animals, over the age of six weeks, moving into their herds must be TB tested either within the 30 days prior to movement or within 30 days after movement into their herd. By way of derogation, this 30-day pre or post movement test is not required if both the animals that are moving and the herds from which they are moving have been tested in the previous six months. The aim of these regulations is to prevent and control animal diseases transmissible to animals or to humans.<\/p><p>These regulations are directly applicable across all EU member states and are mandatory in natur. While my Department can discuss the mechanics of their implementation with stakeholders, as the competent authority we are mandated by the EU to proceed with implementation. The implementation of these regulations has been discussed with the Bovine TB Stakeholders Forum on several occasions. It is to be noted that the majority of animals being moved currently satisfy the requirements.<\/p><p>The Bovine TB Stakeholders Forum which comprises of representatives from across the agri-food sector, leading researchers and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, has agreed to the introduction of these mandatory requirements on a phased basis.<\/p><p>The first phase will come into effect on 1st February 2023.<\/p><p>For the first phase the requirements are that<\/p><p>- Cows of all ages, and males over the age of 36 months that are moving farm to farm or through a mart must be TB tested in the last 6 months and<\/p><p>- They must also be moving from a herd that has been tested in the last six months.<\/p><p>- If they do not fulfil both these requirements then they must then be tested, either within the 30 days prior to movement or within 30 days after movement into the new herd.<\/p><p>- Animals that require a test in the 30 days after movement will be restricted immediately to the herd into which they have moved.<\/p><p>- This means the animal cannot move from this herd other than directly to slaughter.<\/p><p>- This herd has 30 days to carry out a test on those animals.<\/p><p>- Once the animal tests clear the restriction on the animal will be automatically lifted.<\/p><p>- If after the initial 30 days, the animal is still alive and has not been tested then the herd will be automatically restricted, and no cattle will be allowed moved off the farm except directly to slaughter.<\/p><p>- Herds thus restricted may be allowed to move animals in during this period of restriction and may be allowed to move out calves, less than 6 weeks of age, but these calves are not eligible for export while the herd remains restricted.<\/p><p>- After 60 days if the animals in question have not been tested then the whole herd will be scheduled for a TB test.<\/p><p>- This in effect means that farmers, purchasing animals that require a 30-day post movement test will have up to 60 days to test or slaughter these animals without any further implications.<\/p><p>At present, no date has been set for implementation of the second phase, which will see the same requirements applied to all animals over the age of six weeks. The implementation of phase two will be discussed with the Implementation Working Group of the Bovine TB Stakeholders Forum after phase one has been implemented.<\/p><p>The implementation of the Bovine TB Eradication Strategy 2021-2030 is overseen by the Bovine TB Stakeholders Forum along with support from three working groups &ndash; a scientific group, an implementation group and a finance group to ensure that all aspects of the Strategy are addressed. The Bovine TB Stakeholders Forum and its working groups comprise of representatives from across the agri-food sector, leading researchers, farming organisations and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. Please see the attached document detailing the relevant organisations.<\/p><p>The three working groups report to the Bovine TB Stakeholders Forum. The minutes in respect of all TB Forum and working group meetings are available for reference on<\/p><p>gov.ie - TB Forum (<i>www.gov.ie<\/i>)<\/p><p>On-going discussions are being held by the Financial Working Group in respect of the overall TB programme to ensure that the programme is funded in a sustainable manner into the future. Ultimately, measures to reduce the incidence of the disease will reduce the cost of the programme to farmers and taxpayers.<\/p><p>The Scientific Working Group which is composed of Irish and International researchers with a specific expertise on TB, are continually reviewing TB related scientific knowledge along with providing independent objective reports to the TB Stakeholders Forum which informs the discussion of policy options.<\/p><p>The stated purpose of the Implementation Working Group is to consider the details and modalities for the policies set out in the TB Eradication Strategy 2021-2030.<\/p><p>Most actions set out under the current TB strategy have either been implemented or are advancing well towards implementation. To make substantial further progress on TB in the 2023-2025 period, additional steps to build on the current strategy will be needed. The Bovine TB Stakeholders Forum has recently agreed to implement further actions and discussions are on-going on the implementation of these actions.<\/p><p><b>TB Forum Representative Organisations<\/b><\/p><p>Animal Health Ireland<\/p><p>Bord Bia<\/p><p>Independent Chair of the Bovine Tb Forum<\/p><p>Independent Chair of the Finance Working Group<\/p><p>Independent Chair of the Implemntation Working Group<\/p><p>Independent Chair of the Scientific Working Group<\/p><p>Coillte<\/p><p>Dairy Industry Ireland<\/p><p>Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine<\/p><p>Independent Farmer<\/p><p>Irish Cattle &amp;amp; Sheep Farmers Association<\/p><p>Irish Cooperative Organisation Society<\/p><p>Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association<\/p><p>Irish Farmers Association<\/p><p>Irish Natura and Hill Farmers Association <\/p><p>Irish Wildlife Trust<\/p><p>Macra na Feirme <\/p><p>Meat Industry Ireland<\/p><p>National Parks &amp;amp; Wildlife Service<\/p><p>Ornua<\/p><p>Teagasc<\/p><p>UCD School of Veterinary Medicine<\/p><p>Veterinary Ireland<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900080#WRN02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":695,"content":"<p>Question No. 276 answered with Question No. 275.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":696,"content":"<p>Question No. 277 answered with Question No. 275.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":697,"content":"<p>Question No. 278 answered with Question No. 275.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":698,"content":"<p>Question No. 279 answered with Question No. 275.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":699,"content":"<p>Question No. 280 answered with Question No. 275.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":700,"content":"<p>Question No. 281 answered with Question No. 275.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":701,"content":"<p>Question No. 282 answered with Question No. 275.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":702,"content":"<p>Question No. 283 answered with Question No. 275.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":703,"content":"<p>Question No. 284 answered with Question No. 275.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Schemes","counter":704,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900080#WRN03000"},{"type":"question","counter":705,"qnumday":285,"qnumall":"[52135\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900080#WRN03100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the reason for the delay in payment under the ANC scheme for a person (details supplied); when they expect the cause of any delay to be resolved and payment to issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1451","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":706,"content":"<p>The person named applied to participate in the 2022 Areas of Natural Constraints Scheme on the 13th of May 2022.\u00a0The applicant has not yet satisfied all area eligibility requirements and is subject to a Basic Payment Scheme land error on his application.\u00a0The commonage parcel claimed by the applicant is currently under review and a\u00a0rapid field visit will be carried out to assist in this review.\u00a0 Following completion of this review, any payment due to the\u00a0applicant will issue as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900080#WRN03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Funding","counter":707,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900080#WRN03300"},{"type":"question","counter":708,"qnumday":286,"qnumall":"[52136\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900080#WRN03400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 226 of 12 October 2022, the total amount of co-financing provided by the State in relation to funding from the European Multiannual Financial Framework through Budget 2023; the total amount of co-financing provided through the EUMFF and the total spend in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1451","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":709,"content":"<p>The 2023 Estimates provide a gross Vote of &euro;2.14 billion for my department.
