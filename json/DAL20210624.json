Since 1 August 2020, the Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act 2020, and its successor, the Planning and Development, and Residential Tenancies, Act 2020, enhance tenancy protections where a tenant is in rent arrears due to Covid-19 and at risk of losing his or her home and make the necessary declaration.  Indeed, coincidentally, we were debating the extension of the protections in this very Chamber yesterday evening.<\/p>  <p>  Since August last, a landlord is also legally required to serve both the RTB and the tenant with both a 28-day warning notice - a notice period that has been increased from 14 days - seeking payment of rent arrears and also any related notice of termination that might ensue.  Otherwise, the notice of termination is unlawful.  I am stating that because it was a permanent change that we made last year in the legislation, with effect from 1 August.  That Bill did not have unanimous support at the time.  It was opposed by some in the Opposition, which, in fairness, was their right.  It is a permanent change.  It is most important that we are flagging rent arrears from the earliest opportunity as it arises.  <\/p>  <p>  On receipt of the warning notice, the RTB will acknowledge receipt to the landlord and the tenant and will provide information to the tenant to enable her or him to get advice from Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, on State income support, and will offer assistance to the tenant in obtaining this advice.  The aim is to ensure that early action is taken to address rent arrears, to the benefit of both the tenant and the landlord.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy correctly stated, the RTB received copies of 3,810 warning notices that landlords had issued to tenants in rent arrears.  That is something that would not have happened but for the passing of the Acts last year that I brought forward.  It also received copies of just over 1,120 notices of termination grounded on rent arrears.  To put that in context, it relates to almost 300,000 tenancies.  Perhaps I will expand on that and provide more detail on it, following the Deputy's supplementary question.  It is an important issue and one which we must keep an eye on.  I will speak more on it following the supplementary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400003#A00600","speaker":"1561"},{"type":"speech","time":1624521600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>My question was very specific.

The homeless figures for April 2021 show, for the first time in a long time, an increase the number of families with children in emergency accommodation.  We know that the single largest cause of family homelessness is landlords issuing vacant possession notices to quit.  In fact, looking at the most recent data from the RTB, they tell us that 49% of notices to quit are on grounds of sale and 24% are in cases of the landlord or landlord's family using the property.  There is a real concern among front-line homeless service providers that now that the general ban on evictions has ended, we are going to see a return to the pre-Covid monthly increases in homelessness.<\/p>  <p>  Specifically, I am asking the Minister that for those people who have notices to quit today, whether for rent arrears, sale of property or use of property by landlords, what is the Minister going to do to ensure that we do not see a month-on-month rise in homelessness, and in particular, family homelessness with children involved?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400003#A00700","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1624521600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>Homelessness is an absolute priority issue for me and the Government.

All of us would agree with that assertion.  The monthly figures will be published tomorrow.  I have seen the preliminary figures and the trend within them is good.  Having said that, it shows the challenge of the work that remains to be done in this space, particularly around the provision of permanent homes, and specifically for those to whom the Deputy has referred.<\/p>  <p>  Of those who received notices of termination, 475 tenants sought protection under the self-declaration.  I would ask any of those who have received a notice of termination to engage with the RTB and to look, in particular, at the protections that are there and the emergency rent supplement payments that are available.<\/p>  <p>  However, it is an area that we are going to watch.  Almost 300,000 tenancies were registered with the RTB by the end of 2020, and there were just over 1,120 notices of termination.

Obviously, there has been a lot of pressure on the second-hand market and the ability of sellers and purchasers to engage in normal sales activity, including physical viewings.  We had a situation that was far from ideal in respect of virtual viewings and biddings but those changes had to be made in the context of public health advice.

It is important to note that the limits introduced in 2011 also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and providing a degree of future-proofing.<\/p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support.

Those are 77 homes that were not in use and are now back in use.  This year, Clare County Council is targeting 119 vacant homes to bring back into use for people on the social housing list, with funding of &euro;1.7 million which the Government provided for Clare.  We need to and will build more homes but we need to better use the existing stock.  In less than two years, we will have brought back nearly 200 vacant homes in Clare for the use of our citizens and that is good.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400007#E01300","speaker":"1561"},{"type":"speech","time":1624524000,"counter":71,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

Clearly the fire escape issue is a difficult one but there are ways of getting around it.  The bigger issue is insurance.

Boots on the ground are what we need across the country if we are to tackle the biodiversity crisis.<\/p><p>From visiting our national parks in recent weeks, I want to pay tribute to our conservation rangers and staff in the NPWS across the country.  They have done an incredible job throughout the Covid pandemic.  Our national parks and nature reserves were open in order to provide refuge and solace to people throughout what has been an incredibly difficult 15 or 16 months.  They had to reconfigure our spaces and introduce different systems to manage social distancing.  The huge numbers who attended and visited our parks are testament to the great work that has been done by our staff.  I was in Connemara last week to see the fantastic work that was done there and the Minister and I were in Killarney National Park following the fires.  I pay tribute to our staff on the ground there who managed that difficult situation so well.<\/p><p>We know we are in a biodiversity emergency and that the additional rangers we will take on in the coming months will provide a valuable service, including in the area of west Waterford, which Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh has raised.  We have a major job of work to do and I am confident that with the additional resources provided through budget 2021 for the NPWS; we will be in a better place where we can meet those demands and manage our national parks in a way that is a safe and happy experience for visitors but that is also good for nature and biodiversity.  We are grateful to the organisations throughout the country that partner with our national parks to make them as good an experience for people as possible and to make them safe refuges for nature as well.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1624525800,"counter":106,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for that response.

That speed and those boots on the ground that the Minister of State talks about are vitally important.

Thankfully, as I said earlier, we are seeing significant improvements in that area year on year, with a significant reduction in homelessness.  It is still a high rate but the trend is good in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  All emergency accommodation, whether provided by local authorities, NGOs, voluntary bodies or privately, are required to comply with standards and these standards are monitored.  The national quality standards framework for homeless services is in place nationally for local authority and NGO-delivered services.  Local authorities also carry out inspections on facilities that are not covered under the framework.  This regime operates in parallel with, and is based on, the national quality standards framework.<\/p>  <p>  The standards and facilities teams in the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, DRHE, oversee all emergency accommodation in the region and seek to ensure that all relevant guidelines, policies and procedures are complied with in order to deliver a safe and comfortable place for people to stay.

Can we look at giving a capital gains tax break to a person selling a property to a first-time buyer?

It might make sense to double that exemption in rural areas, and perhaps within a 50 km zone, and increase the dimensions by 50% to 800 square feet in a rural area and 600 square feet in an urban area.  Many of those properties were quite small compared to modern standards.  Again, there would be less red tape for someone who is seeking to convert the property and, in some cases, build on such basic things as a kitchen or bathroom.  A person should be able to do so without having to go through the whole planning process.  Speed up the process, bring more of these properties into circulation and get people into homes.

If we are to achieve what the Government wants to continue to advocate and work towards, which is a peace settlement that results in two states living side by side, with security issues and sovereignty issues addressed, then we need to maintain a relationship, particularly now that there is a new Government in Israel.  We need to work to build consensus within the EU and within the international community in terms of how the international community works with the new Israeli Government and the Palestinian authority.  There is work to be done there as well.<\/p>  <p>  We must work to ensure we isolate and reduce the influence of Hamas and other terrorist groups in order that we can ensure good international politics and the right kinds of interventions result in both sides, through legitimate political leadership on the Israeli and Palestinian sides, working towards a negotiated peaceful solution with the support of the international community.  That is the objective we are after here.  Isolating, boycotting and targeting Israel at this stage would be counterproductive towards achieving those aims, and would potentially undermine Ireland's capacity to influence others to build the kind of consensus I believe is needed.<\/p>  <p>  That said, we will of course continue to raise these issues.  Ireland is probably the most vocal country in the European Union on this issue.  We have asked the commission to produce a toolbox to ensure we can use the leverage we have to the greatest extent possible to move relationships in the right direction.

I have been clear about the need to respect international humanitarian law, including the protection of civilians, particularly children, and the need for any response to attacks to be proportionate.<\/p>  <p>  In my address to the UN Security Council on 16 May, I made it very clear that children must never be made prisoners of history.  According to the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, of the 260 Palestinian fatalities in the recent conflict, 66 were children.  In Israel, two of the 13 fatalities were children.  In addition to the tragedy of these killings and injuries, no child anywhere should have to endure the trauma of an onslaught of rockets and missiles.  In my address to the Security Council, I called for violations against children to end.<\/p>  <p>  As I have stated, the ceasefire that came into effect on 21 May is welcome and we must do all we can to support it.  Tensions are still high in the region and there remains a responsibility on all parties to ensure the ceasefire is respected.  All unilateral actions that could increase tension must be avoided.  Responsibility also lies with the international community to support the ceasefire and encourage the parties towards a return to political engagement.  This is an effort to which I am fully committed.<\/p>  <p>  The focus now in the Gaza Strip is on recovery and protection.  On 19 May, I announced an additional &euro;1.5 million in emergency humanitarian support for the occupied Palestinian territory in response to emergency appeals from both the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, UNRWA, and UNICEF.

Notwithstanding commitments made, the situation on the ground is deteriorating.  Yesterday we heard deeply disturbing reports of an air strike on civilians in a crowded market, which, if deliberately targeted, would constitute a war crime.  An immediate ceasefire is urgently required.  In this regard, it is imperative that Eritrean forces leave Tigray immediately.  They have committed to doing so and it has not happened.<\/p>  <p>  I am alarmed by credible warnings of famine coming from UN organisations.  I am also concerned by ongoing attacks on humanitarian workers.  There is an urgent need for full humanitarian access, which is being partially but not fully facilitated.  Ireland joined recent international calls for a humanitarian ceasefire to allow for planting and to avert the risk of famine.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland continues to work on the UN Security Council to ensure it addresses the situation in Tigray.  Most recently, on 15 June, we called an informal meeting of the UN Security Council that focused on the humanitarian situation.  In April, Ireland led the negotiation of a council press statement on the situation in Tigray, which was the first time the UN Security Council spoke publicly on the ongoing crisis.  We have also used council thematic discussions on conflict and hunger, and on conflict-related sexual violence, to highlight these aspects of the crisis.  It is fair to say our role in bringing the crisis in Tigray to the attention of the council has been widely recognised internationally.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland continues to support a strong and constructive EU response to the crisis.  I underlined our real concern in this regard at the foreign affairs committee on 21 June.  EU foreign ministers will discuss Ethiopia again in July.  I continue to engage with key interlocutors on the situation, including in the region; in the Gulf, where I met a number of counterparts last week; and in the African Union.  I plan to visit Ethiopia during a visit to the Horn of Africa next month.

There are grave concerns about levels of malnutrition, particularly among young children and pregnant and breastfeeding women.

I repeat that we are talking about 33,000 children.  We continue to hear disturbing reports of the use of starvation as a weapon of war.

Although there have been some signs of willingness from the Belarusian authorities to move the two individuals arrested on 23 May, Mr. Roman Protasevich and Ms Sofia Sapega, to a less onerous form of detention, Ireland will continue to insist on their immediate and unconditional release.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland, the EU and our like-minded international partners are united in calling for the regime to end the repression against its own people and for the Belarusian authorities to co-operate fully with international investigations into the forced landing of the Ryanair aircraft.  Ireland played a constructive role in the successful adoption of an EU-led resolution at the Human Rights Council that gave the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights a mandate to investigate human rights violations in Belarus.  Her team is scrutinising more than 2,000 reports of human rights violations and we support this work.<\/p>  <p>  The EU will also seek a mandate renewal for the UN special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Belarus during the 47th session of the Human Rights Council.

It was escorted by a military aircraft and when the plane landed, the passengers were kept on it for quite a period while military police came on and took certain passengers off before arresting them forcefully.  That is not acceptable and really focused the EU's attention on the intervention that is necessary in the context of what is happening in Belarus.<\/p>  <p>  I suspect there will be much pressure for the report to be accurately concluded and be made public.

The Air Navigation (Carriage of Munitions of War, Weapons and Dangerous Goods) Order 1973 prohibits the carriage of munitions of war through Irish airspace or through Irish airports on civilian aircraft unless an exemption has been granted by the Minister for Transport.  Statistics on such exemptions are published on the Department of Transport&rsquo;s website.  The process in place around the granting of such permission by the Minister for Transport is robust and includes seeking the advice of my Department on any implications for Ireland's policy of military neutrality.  Permissions are only granted where no such concerns arise.  With regard to foreign military aircraft, permission must be sought from me in advance for landings.  Such flights are routinely required to meet strict conditions to ensure compatibility with Ireland&rsquo;s policy of military neutrality: that the aircraft is unarmed, carries no arms, ammunition or explosives, must not engage in intelligence gathering and does not form part of any military operation or exercise.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy refers to more than 220 occasions in 2020 when arms were transferred through the airport.  That is not quite the case.  These exemptions are sometimes for a personal protection detail where light arms are carried on the person.  For example, we met the Secretary of State Blinken a number of weeks ago and he came through Shannon Airport.  Jake Sullivan came through Shannon Airport also when we met him.  They would have had security around them, including bodyguards that were armed.  In order for that to happen they need to get an exemption for each member of their security personnel who carries a pistol on his or her person.  That is the exemption space we are talking about.  Those exemptions are not about carrying large volumes of munitions or arms through Shannon Airport.  The exemptions refer to light arms on the person, whether that is security personnel or whoever.  This is just to put it into context.  I checked this with our team before answering this question because I want to be accurate.  When exemptions are applied for, the only exemptions that are granted are, effectively, for light arms that are carried on a person.  This is obviously not the same as carrying large arms and munitions into a war setting.  That is not what is being facilitated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400016#O00500","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1624529400,"counter":181,"content":"<p>\"Munitions of war\" is a fancy term thought up by civil servants.

As Minister for Defence, of course it is my job to ensure that we look after the safety of our own personnel and our peacekeepers, that they are trained and equipped, and that they are not put into a theatre of conflict where the risk profile has not been fully examined first.  Mali is a dangerous part of the world.  It is a very complex country and we are there to try to help to bring stability to the Sahel region and to Mali in particular.

The rights of LGBTQI+ people are essential human rights and Ireland strongly advocates for their promotion and protection throughout the world, including in our relations with Hungary and Poland.<\/p> <p>On 15 June, the Hungarian National Assembly passed a bill with the official title \"Stricter measures against paedophile criminals and on amending legislation related to the protection of children\".  While ostensibly a child protection law, amendments added to the bill&rsquo;s original text mean this proposed legislation provides for measures with disquieting and far-reaching negative implications for Hungary's LGBTQI+ community.  The new law provides for restrictions on LGBTQI+ representation in media.  There is also a de facto prohibition on talks on LGBTQI+ issues in schools and educational programmes.  This means that only organisations approved by the minister of education will be able to provide such talks and school principals and teachers would need to secure special permission to undertake such lessons. <\/p> <p> Such legislation has no place in the EU.  It will lead to further marginalisation and stigmatisation of the LGBTQI+ community.  Under Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union, the EU is founded on shared values, including human dignity, freedom, equality and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities.  This law is fundamentally at odds with these values and I urge the Hungarian Government to reconsider the decision to introduce this bill.  At my meeting last month with the Hungarian foreign minister, I highlighted the importance of the EU demonstrating tolerance.<\/p> <p> The Government has publicly expressed its deep concerns regarding the anti-LGBTQI+ aspects of this new law.  At the most recent meeting of the General Affairs Council on 22 June, there was an Article 7 hearing on Hungary&rsquo;s adherence to the EU values enshrined in Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union.  Ireland actively participated in this hearing and the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, firmly articulated Ireland's views on this issue as well as on issues related to the rule of law in Hungary.  Ireland also supported a joint statement at the Council by the Benelux foreign ministers, which expressed grave concern at the law and its capacity to further stigmatise and endanger the safety of the LGBTQI+ community in Hungary.<\/p> <p> The embassy of Ireland in Hungary has actively supported statements of concern made locally by like-minded partners and has registered deep concern about this law and its implications for equality and human rights.  The embassy is also co-ordinating this year&rsquo;s statement by embassies in Hungary supporting the Budapest Pride parade, which takes place on 24 July.<\/p> <p> We also regularly raise our concerns on this issue with the Polish authorities.  In particular, I have written to my Polish counterpart to set out the concerns that have been expressed by Irish people and by the large Polish community living in Ireland.  I also underlined the shared commitments of Ireland and Poland to equality and non-discrimination as EU member states. <\/p> <p> The embassy of Ireland in Warsaw undertakes a number of initiatives to demonstrate support for the LGBTQI+ community in Poland, including participating in the Warsaw Pride parade and actively engaging with civil society groups in Poland supporting the community.  The ambassador also signs an annual open letter of support for efforts to raise public awareness of the issues affecting the LGBTQI+ community in Poland.<\/p> <p> As I said at the outset, the rights of LGBTQI+ people are human rights.  It is imperative that all member states continue to respect the values to which we have all signed up.

It is a natural extension of that to also be vocal around the need to protect and respect diversity and minorities in the context of sexual preferences and the LGBTQI+ community. <br\/><br\/>It was unfortunate.  There was an opportunity for sport, while it was under the international spotlight, to make a clear statement on the need to protect minorities and express a concern about an EU country moving in a different direction.

Some 76% of people sharing rented accommodation do not believe they will ever own their own home.  Tens of thousands of people are locked out of home ownership, trapped in over-priced rental accommodation or forced to move back home with their parents, who are beside themselves with worry that their children will ever own their own home.  Young couples are unable to save for a deposit because of sky-high rents, and single people are priced out of a market that only caters for two-income households.  Separated and divorced people are paying maintenance and rent while trying to save a deposit of 20% for a new home.  Families who lost their home after the crash are desperately trying to put an affordable roof over their heads.  Every day, I and, I am sure, the T&aacute;naiste and his Government colleagues receive calls and emails from people in these situations.  These are the casualties of ten years of Fine Gael housing policy.<\/p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste has sat at the Cabinet table for those ten years.  These stories and the hardship endured by the people I am discussing are his legacy.  In 2011, when he joined the Cabinet, the average price of a new home in Dublin was &euro;318,000.  Today, it is &euro;503,000.  During Fine Gael's time in office, house prices have increased by 88% across the State and by 99% in Dublin.  That is the T&aacute;naiste's legacy.  In 2011, the average cost of renting across the State was &euro;781 per month; today, it is &euro;1,256.  That is an extra &euro;6,000 per year on rent.  In Dublin, the position is even worse.  Average rents have increased from &euro;960 per month to &euro;1,745.  That is almost &euro;10,000 extra per year for rent for average renters.  The T&aacute;naiste's legacy is spiralling house prices and sky-high rents.<\/p>  <p>  When the T&aacute;naiste was elected leader of Fine Gael, he said he wanted to represent those who get up early in the morning to go to work.  The only people I see his Government representing are big developers and big landlords, throwing around sweetheart tax deals and land deals like confetti.  It has become increasingly clear that Fine Gael is not the party of hard-working people.  It is a party of privilege, a party of the very well-off and a party of ever-rising housing costs.  In fact, when asked about rising house prices last week, the T&aacute;naiste suggested that things were really not as bad as the Opposition is saying and that the solution was to saddle working people with increasing levels of mortgage debt.  Is he that out of touch?  Does he not understand the depth of the crisis that he has created?<\/p>  <p>  It is time for the T&aacute;naiste to accept that his housing record is one of failure, that ten years of Fine Gael housing policy has made the housing crisis worse and that if he continues to repeat the mistakes of the past, things will only get harder.  It is time to give renters and those seeking to own their own home a break.  Will the T&aacute;naiste now accept that the only way to deliver genuinely affordable homes for working people is to follow the advice of Sinn F&eacute;in, the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, and the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, and to double direct State capital investment in public housing, to deliver 20,000 social and affordable homes annually until this crisis is over?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400021#T00500","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1624532400,"counter":242,"content":"<p>The fact that the Deputy has to go out of his way to misrepresent what I say and to misquote me is emblematic of how dishonest and two-faced he and his party are when it comes to the issue of housing.  What I said was a statement of fact, but I did not say under any circumstances that I thought it was desirable that we should see house prices rise further or get back to the level they were at 14 years ago.  What the Deputy misquoted me as saying was absolutely incorrect and he should withdraw it from the record.  It is not the first time his party has deliberately twisted, misrepresented and deceived regarding comments made by Ministers in respect of housing, because that is the only way it can gain traction, particularly online.  It is a real shame that this is the way the Deputy behaves.  Quite frankly, it is beneath him to misrepresent things that Members say in the House for political purposes.<\/p>  <p>  I believe in home ownership and, thankfully, 65% of people in Ireland own their own home.  That has nothing to do with Sinn F&eacute;in.  It is due to policies and decisions made by my party, Fianna F&aacute;il, the Labour Party, the Green Party and others in bygone years.  However, it is not a reality for hundreds of thousands of people in the State.  For them, home ownership is a dream or a distant possibility.  That has to change, and I get that.  The Government gets that too and that is why we have taken actions to help people to buy their first home.  For example, the help-to-buy scheme has helped tens of thousands of people to secure a deposit to buy a home.  That was opposed by Sinn F&eacute;in.  The Rebuilding Ireland home loan helps people to get an affordable mortgage.  This is something we must build on and make more available to more people.  The rent pressure zones limit rent increases to no more than 4% in areas where rents are high and rising.  As the Deputy knows, that is currently under review to see if we can do more in that regard.  In contrast, Sinn F&eacute;in's local authorities and councillors in Northern Ireland voted to increase rents.  That is the type of hypocrisy we see from the Deputy and his party.<\/p>  <p>  Of course, the main part of the solution, and it is not the sole solution, is more supply of housing of all forms.  Social housing to help people get off the housing list does not just benefit people getting off the housing list but society as a whole because it frees up rental properties for others, reduces competition for private housing in the general housing market and helps first-time buyers.  That is why between 2016 and 2019, when my party held the housing brief, we increased the supply of social housing tenfold, from approximately 600 per year to 6,000 per year.  We are aiming to go higher under this Government and to reach more than 10,000 per year, if possible.  However, there are constraints, and the Deputy knows that better than most.  Cost rental has been initiated by my party.  On Enniskerry Road, we will see the first people occupying cost rental properties very soon.  That has nothing to do with Sinn F&eacute;in.  The Government is going to build on that and there will be far more cost-rental housing as well.  The shared ownership scheme, which Sinn F&eacute;in opposes here but promotes in the North, is helping people to buy affordable housing.<\/p>  <p>  There is also support for private investment in housing.  That is necessary because most people want to own their own home.  That means private housing, private enterprise and private developers, all of which Sinn F&eacute;in opposes and which it would essentially drive out of the housing market, thus resulting in less housing supply.  What was emblematic of Sinn F&eacute;in's approach was what it did in Donabate in Dublin Fingal, the county in which I live and not too far from my constituency.<\/p> <p>Sinn F&eacute;in, for ideological reasons, voted against more than 200 social houses because 600 private houses were going to be built on the same site.  The party was so ideologically opposed to private housing and homeownership that it was willing to vote against social housing as well.  Does the Deputy believe  homeownership should be higher?  It is now roughly 65%.  Does Sinn F&eacute;in think that percentage should be higher, or does it secretly believe in less homeownership?  Does the party want a higher percentage of housing in public ownership and a lower percentage in private ownership?  I would like to know that, because there has never been an answer to the question of whether Sinn F&eacute;in believes in increasing the percentage of homeownership and in more people owning their own homes.  I would love to hear the Deputy's answer in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400021#T00600","speaker":"1474","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624533000,"counter":244,"content":"<p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste.

Rent pressure zones, RPZs, pushed up rental costs.  The shared equity loan scheme, which we will debate later today, has been criticised by everybody, including councillors in the T&aacute;naiste's own party.  Sinn F&eacute;in is the only large party on the floor of the D&aacute;il that year after year has said that 8,000 affordable homes should be built annually.  To answer the T&aacute;naiste's question directly, half of those, 4,000 homes, would be affordable purchase for aspiring homeowners.  How many affordable homes has this Government delivered for renters and purchasers in ten years?  Not a single one through any Government scheme.

Last week, the T&aacute;naiste told this House that there were fundamental problems with two aspects of the deal, namely, ownership and governance.  Given that I have been telling the T&aacute;naiste exactly that for the past four years, I am quite curious as to when he finally saw the light.  His comments in the House last week were surprising in several respects.  First, it had been pointed out to him for years by myself and others that this deal is manifestly bad for the public.  Yet the T&aacute;naiste blithely ignored all those warnings.  Whenever I have raised concerns about ownership, governance and ethos, I have been fobbed off with assurances that a legal framework was all that was outstanding.  Work started on that legal framework in 2017.  Four years later, however, there is still no sign of it.<\/p>  <p>  There is a second reason the T&aacute;naiste's comments were unexpected.  He complained bitterly about the proposed 99-year lease, saying it was not satisfactory and that we should own the site.  It was his Government, however, that proposed a lease in the first place.  Back in 2017, officials in the Department of Health had to twist the arms of the members of the board of St Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group to get them to even consider a lease.  That is all laid out in the correspondence released by St Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group this week.  In July 2019, however, the T&aacute;naiste referred to the proposed lease himself in this House.  He said that St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group had agreed in principle to provide the State with a 99-year lease of the land upon which the new maternity hospital will be built.  The T&aacute;naiste framed it as a win for the State that St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group had agreed to provide a lease.  The St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group has been criticised for the curt letter it released this week, and certainly much of it does not stand up to scrutiny.  However, I can only imagine the shock and amazement of the St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group at the latest comments from the T&aacute;naiste.  <\/p>  <p>  This mess has the fingerprints of the T&aacute;naiste's party&rsquo;s fingerpri all over it.  The former Deputy and Minister for Health, James Reilly, announced the project in 2013, the next Minister in the Department of Health was the now T&aacute;naiste and he was followed as Minister by Deputy Simon Harris.  Finally, last year, the current Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, was given what can only be described as the poisoned chalice.  I am curious, therefore, given the longevity of this crisis, about what prompted the T&aacute;naiste to get to his feet in this House last week and express serious concern.  Was there something significant about the timing?  This is an issue that voters in Dublin Bay South care deeply about, and perhaps their concern has been a catalyst for some long overdue action.  In light of yesterday&rsquo;s debate, what steps does the T&aacute;naiste's Government now intend to take to ensure the new publicly-funded national maternity hospital is constructed on land owned by the State?  Will it now be guaranteed that the new facility will be fully owned and governed by the State?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400022#U03500","speaker":"1567"},{"type":"speech","time":1624533000,"counter":278,"content":"<p>I am sorry Deputy, but we are over time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400022#U03600","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1624533000,"counter":279,"content":"<p>Is serious consideration being given to Tallaght Hospital, St James&rsquo;s Hospital or anywhere else?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400022#U03700","speaker":"1567"},{"type":"speech","time":1624533000,"counter":280,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  Like her, I have been always interested in this project and I have always had concerns about it.  What prompted me, quite frankly, was a straight question from Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith.  I would not have answered that question had I not been asked it.  As the Deputy pointed out in her remarks, it might have been two or three years since I was last asked publicly or in this House to give my views on the new national maternity hospital project.  I am conscious that negotiations have been under way during that period, and I have been restrained in what I have said.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the position of the Government, this Government and, indeed, the previous Government which I led, it has always been one that has favoured co-location over integration, that has insisted that the new hospital, like the existing one, must be clinically and operationally independent and that any gynaecological or obstetrical procedure which is lawful in this State must be provided for in this hospital.  We want to own the hospital and, ideally, to own the land as well.  We also want proper representation on the board, and the governance aspect is as important as the ownership of the land, if not more so.  That is my position and it has not changed.<\/p>  <p>  For the record, in 2017 and 2018, two memos for information were brought to Government.  I checked this with the Cabinet secretariat.  No memo for decision was brought to Government, and no memo decision has yet been brought to Government.  Therefore, a Government decision on the lease and on the governance aspect has yet to be made.  It was not made by the previous Government and it has not yet been made by this Government.  Had it been made back in 2017 or 2018, I assume the project would have gone to tender by now.  However, it did not.  I reiterate that two memos for information went to Government and no memo for decision, and that still has not happened.  We are where we are in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to the development of this hospital.  It is planned for the St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital campus at Elm Park, and that is set out in the programme for Government.  We have not given examination to alternative sites.  What we must do now is to conclude the governance arrangements necessary to ensure protection of this public investment for the public good and, in particular, to ensure there is an absolute, legally binding assurance that all legally permissible obstetrical and gynaecological services will be provided in the new hospital as they are currently in Holles Street.<\/p> <p>There is universal agreement in this House that this must be done.<\/p> <p> The project is unprecedented and inherently complex because it involves relocating one voluntary hospital onto the campus of another, neither of which hospital the State owns or controls at present.  What is different now is that the State is going to invest hundreds of millions of euro in a new building on that campus, which changes things in my view and in the view of the Government.  We have clear legal advice that the draft legal framework ensures that all legally permissible medical services will be provided in the new hospital and we are having that double checked at present.<\/p> <p> On the 99 year lease, the Government was not satisfied with that which is why negotiations continued and why the idea of a further 50-year extension was proposed.  That matter is far from concluded.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400022#U03800","speaker":"1474","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624533600,"counter":282,"content":"<p>It is really a bit rich for the T&aacute;naiste to say he expressed serious concerns just because he happened to be asked a question here.

I want to help by coming up with solutions to help young families to get homes.  Today I want to raise the very important issue of mortgage affordability, particularly for first-time buyers.  As we all know, this country is in the middle of a housing crisis and while it is true that the main issue is the supply of affordable housing, another issue that can be addressed immediately is the very restrictive lending rules imposed by the Central Bank.<\/p>  <p>  In my home town of Dundalk the rental price for a three-bedroom family home ranges from &euro;1,300 to &euro;1,800 per month.  When for sale, those same houses are generally on the market for between &euro;200,000 to &euro;270,000.  A quick calculation indicates that the average monthly mortgage repayment for these homes would be between &euro;900 and &euro;1,200.  Under the current Central Bank rules, a young family is expected to save approximately &euro;2,000 per month towards a deposit as well as pay rent of up to &euro;1,800 per month.  The T&aacute;naiste will agree that this is not realistic.  If a young family can afford to and can demonstrate that they are paying rent at a higher level than a comparable mortgage, it is clear that they can afford such a mortgage.  A simple solution is to amend the rules to allow first-time buyers to include the rent paid for a period of three years as a virtual deposit on their mortgage application.  This would clearly demonstrate their ability to repay a mortgage and remove the draconian rules which mean they have to save for a deposit while also paying ridiculously high rents.  It does not add up and it does not make sense.<\/p>  <p>  The figures for my home town of Dundalk show that a young family hoping to purchase their first home would have to save an average of &euro;2,000 per month while paying rent of approximately &euro;1,500 per month, a total of &euro;3,500 per month.  This means that the family would need a gross income of approximately &euro;5,500 per month, or a gross annual salary of &euro;66,000, just to pay their monthly rent and save for a deposit.  This does not take account of other outgoings like food, utility and medical bills.  It is clear that this is not a realistic situation for young first-time buyers in Ireland.  At this rate they will be condemned to a lifetime of paying high rents, most likely to vulture funds.  The Government must act now to deal with this very serious issue.  People should be able to buy their first home but to earn &euro;66,000 means, in many cases, two people working.  <\/p>  <p>  The Government is looking for solutions to the housing crisis and I am not here to play a blame game.  Will the Government consider my suggestion regarding a virtual deposit?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400023#V00800","speaker":"1600"},{"type":"speech","time":1624533600,"counter":289,"content":"<p>The Deputy made some very good points in his remarks.  As the House will be aware, the objective of the Central Bank macro prudential mortgage lending rules is to mitigate systemic risk and promote financial stability, to increase the resilience of the banking sector and households to the property market and to reduce the risk of credit spirals from developing in future.  They are there to avoid a boom and bust in home values, people ending up in negative equity and a future banking crisis.  They are there to prevent the mistakes of the past being repeated.<\/p>  <p>  However, we must make sure that we are not fighting the last war when it comes to mortgages.  The mortgage rules have very much helped to keep a lid on house price inflation, which is a good thing but they have also driven up rents, which is not a good thing.  Like Deputy Fitzpatrick, I would know and would have been contacted by many people who are paying very high rents of between &euro;1,600 and &euro;1,800 per month.  They are struggling but are managing to pay them and yet they cannot get a mortgage of &euro;1,500 per month.  They cannot get a mortgage for a lower amount than they are currently spending on rent and they find that difficult to accept and so do I.  With this in mind, the Central Bank has indicated that it will carry out an in-depth review of lending rules over the course of this year and into next year.  I would encourage the bank to expedite that review and the public consultation that it intends to carry out, through which it will hear the voices of people who are caught in the rent trap in this way, paying higher rents than they would pay if they were able to get a mortgage they could afford.<\/p>  <p>  In assessing a borrower's ability to repay a mortgage, lenders can and do take account of applicants' existing financial commitments, including their rental payments.  However, there is a significant difference between a rental contract and a mortgage contract to purchase a home and this must be borne in mind.  A house purchase and associated mortgage contract usually has a more long-term character than a rental contract which leaves the house purchaser or mortgage borrower more exposed if there is a future shock to his or her income, house prices or interest rate, for a longer period.  <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank mortgage macro prudential measures apply certain loan to value and loan to income restrictions to residential mortgage lending by financial institutions.  In general, the maximum mortgage limits are 3.5 times the borrower's income and for first-time buyers, 90% of the value of the residential property.  For second and subsequent buyers, the maximum mortgage limits are 3.5 times the borrower's income and 80% of the value of the home.  However, banks have some flexibility at their discretion to provide mortgage loans in excess of the specified regulatory limits but it is a commercial matter for lenders as to whether they avail of this discretion.  For example, up to 5% of lending to first-time buyers can be above the 90% threshold and up to 20% of lending to second-time borrowers can exceed the 80% threshold.  Furthermore, up to 20% of lending to first-time buyers can exceed the 3.5 times income limit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400023#V00900","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1624533600,"counter":290,"content":"<p>All we will be doing this year and next is passing the buck.

Last Saturday night, I watched the news and the headline from the Fine Gael Ard-Fheis was the T&aacute;naiste announcing that Fine Gael was committing to building 40,000 houses every year.  That is great if the T&aacute;naiste knows of a way to do this, but as someone who has worked in the sector for many years, I asked myself what cunning plan our T&aacute;naiste has come up with.<\/p>  <p>  Besides the point of having even half of it as affordable or social housing, about &euro;10 billion would be needed with another &euro;10 billion needed from the private sector.  Can the T&aacute;naiste tell me how we will get over the obstacle that there are 200 quarries in a planning quagmire?  Can he tell me how the 14,000 or 15,000 houses that are on judicial review are going to get sorted?  Unfortunately, things are being challenged day in, day out.  Can the T&aacute;naiste tell me why the forward planning of Irish Water is not funded for the next four to five years?  I talk to Irish Water on a regular basis.  If that funding is not put in place, there will be a problem.<\/p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste might not know about a thing called DoneDeal.  If one looks around Dublin or in any other city, one will see that there are no lorry drivers available to take muck away from sites.  One cannot get a theory test or even apply for a driving licence if one wants to go down that road.  Blocklaying in a rural house in a rural area is gone from &euro;6,000 to &euro;16,000.  The price of timber is gone up by 46%.  I have spoken to the T&aacute;naiste personally about the saga in Ireland but it is not only in Ireland.  Timber is brought in as well and it is a bidding market.  It is not about getting materials or the price of same but it is a question of whether the materials can be got because America and other countries are giving better prices when the boats are on the high seas.<\/p>  <p>  I know the T&aacute;naiste has spoken about apprenticeships before.  We seem to put people who are accountants or whatever on a pedestal, and rightly so, but we do not seem to put the person who is the blocklayer, who is in what I call the wet trades or any apprentice on the same pedestal of people who go down a different road.  Whether we like it or not, if we do not have the people who can drive the digger, lay the pipe, put down the tar, lay the blocks or do the steel structure, we will not have someone doing it with a computer.  I am asking the T&aacute;naiste if he can shed light on this for me because it is like Christy Moore's song; I thought about it for a while and \"The dream turned into a nightmare\" for me when I started asking myself how we will get around all of these obstacles.<\/p>  <p>  The other part of this is that we had the climate action Bill last week.  The Greens, who are delusional in my world, believe we will reduce emissions when we need to build 40,000 houses per year.

I restated that ambition at the weekend and I stand over the fact that I did so.  Back in 2016, we were only building 5,000 to 6,000 homes per year.  We are now up to around 20,000 homes per year, notwithstanding the fact that construction was blighted by the pandemic.  We used to build 80,000 homes per year and I believe that setting the ambition of getting to 40,000 per year is ambitious but realistic.  It is double where we are now and half where we were during the housing boom some time ago.  I am not saying we can do it next year - do not get me wrong on that.  That is certainly not what I said, but I think we can scale up to that target.  We think there will be about 20,000 public and private builds this year and perhaps we can go to 25,000, 30,000, 35,000 and 40,000 or perhaps we can go a bit faster to 27,000, 34,000 and 41,000.  That is the kind of thing we are talking about in the Government as we put together the \"Housing for All\" policy, which is the Government's new housing policy, replacing Rebuilding Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  I see Davy Group suggested in its report today that this is not enough.  It said that we need to build 200,000 new homes in three years.  Unfortunately, I do not believe it is possible to scale up to 60,000 or 70,000 homes per year in such a timeframe.  I take the Deputy's point that if it was easy to do, it would have been done by now.  It is not easy.  We have issues around access to capital, both for the Government and private builders.  We also have issues around a shortage of skilled labour and the availability of serviced land by Irish Water and by local authorities.  We also have issues around the planning process, which takes a long time in this State and often ends up stuck in judicial reviews.  We also have issues around the availability of materials.  Steel is becoming more expensive and less available because of this central bank-fuelled boom around the world.  Central banks have printed &euro;9 trillion and that has driven up the cost of commodities, with a boom happening in China for example.<\/p>  <p>  While they might not say it publicly, everyone in this House privately understands that there is nobody in this House who would not like to see more houses built as quickly as possible but there are lots of constraints that are not always under our control.  We will do our best to deal with them as best we can, however.  That involves increasing Government investment in public housing, of which social housing will be the major part.  It also involves the Government investing in apprenticeships and the Deputy will know what the Minister, Deputy Harris, is doing in that regard.  That is having some real success in getting more people into apprenticeships in line with the target of 10,000 apprenticeships per year.  It will mean the Government trying to make sure that more sites are serviced through programmes such as the local infrastructure housing activation fund and the capital budget of Irish Water.  Beyond that, there will be things outside of our control, such as the availability of materials, one of which the Deputy mentioned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400024#W00400","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1624534200,"counter":295,"content":"<p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste for his answer.

If one were to look at the price of land in the smaller towns or villages, one would get better value for money.  We also need to be sure about the likes of procurement.  What seems to happen in this country is that one big guy applies for permission for 500 or 600 houses.  Many smaller builders would not have the capital to be in that league but would be well capable of building four or five houses.

I agree with the Deputy that every town and village in Ireland should be able to expand.  I do not mean a return to sprawl or to development distant from the major cities, but any town in Ireland should be able to expand and we need to ensure that is reflected in our planning laws.  Smaller builders who can build houses in fours and fives, relatively inexpensively and on relatively small sites, can make a big difference for people.

The first thing that should happen is export bans should stop.  As trade Minister, I have instructed my officials to vote against export bans, and we have.  It is all very well for countries such as the United States to back a TRIPS waiver while banning exports at the same time.  We must get rid of export bans.  The best thing we can do is to work together and with industry to license this intellectual property to the global south and help to build the necessary factories, provide the money and know-how to do these things, and then help them to provide vaccines to their populations.

We also need to bear in mind that there are people who need to rent for one reason or another for a period in their lives, if not for a long period.  I do not like to see some politicians referring to people who live in apartments or people who rent as transients.  I thought that was a very strange comment.  What we need is for people not to oppose every type of housing development because they do not agree with a particular type of housing.  We need more types of housing of all sorts in all places.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400027#Z01300","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1624536000,"counter":335,"content":"<p>In the past week, we have been reminded of the very worrying rise in knife crime across our capital city, following a number of high-profile incidents.

This has been the culmination of nearly a year's work by me and my departmental officials, along with members of the Oireachtas committee, who did much work to get us to this stage.  The Bill has been passed through the Seanad, as Members know, and what is now coming before the D&aacute;il is very important legislation.  It is a major priority for me, as the Minister responsible for housing, to deliver affordable housing for working people and to provide hope for a whole generation that feels it has been locked out of the housing market.  I am very pleased to be here today and I thank Members for their input so far.<\/p>  <p>  At its heart, this Bill is about the State stepping up to provide affordable homes for purchase and rent using all means at its disposal to tackle the housing crisis.  The ongoing affordability crisis has reduced home ownership rates to historic lows.  It has increased the age of the average first-time buyer by almost a decade to just under 36 years of age.  Ireland has plummeted from a world leader to below the EU average rate of home ownership.  For an entire generation, owning a home is slipping through people's fingers as they pay over unprecedented levels of rent or languish in their parents' houses.  A generation is caught in an unaffordable rent trap.<\/p>  <p>  We must put in place the legislative buildings blocks of a new approach to the crisis, one which puts home ownership back on the table for a generation that has been smothered by rising rents and job uncertainty.  This housing crisis is not about one party or the Government but about giving a whole generation hope and investing in the future of our democracy.  The Affordable Housing Bill 2021 is a very important step in rising to that challenge.  It places the legislative foundations for the State to put bricks and mortar on the ground to directly tackle the housing crisis, particularly in the area of affordable rents and purchase.  It is the most comprehensive affordable housing Bill ever published.  It is radical and a clear departure and change from what has been the housing policy.  It is a change that many thousands of our young people are looking for.<\/p>  <p>  I firmly believe home ownership is good for individuals, families, communities and the country.  With this in mind I have put affordability and the chance to own one's own home at the heart of this Government's housing policy.  This Bill and the Land Development Agency Bill 2021 are going through the Oireachtas simultaneously and will work in tandem to give people the opportunity of ownership.  These two landmark pieces of legislation are backed up by the largest housing budget in the history of the State and our most ambitious social housing targets on record.  Combined, this represents a major step change in our housing policy that mobilises both the public and private sector.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill has four key new elements.  There is the first local authority-led direct-build affordable homes on State lands in over a decade.  There is our first ever national cost-rental scheme and an innovative shared equity scheme.  Finally, it will expand Part V provisions to increase the percentage contribution to 20% and to apply it to cost rental as well as social and affordable housing.  These elements of the Part V expansion will be brought to Members for consideration on Committee Stage, following the conclusion of our work with the Attorney General and Cabinet approval last Tuesday.<\/p> <p>The upcoming housing for all plan, which will be published next month, will set out an ambitious range of targets across the country over the coming years.  The roll-out of local authority-led affordable housing will be a central plank of the Government&rsquo;s affordable housing plan.  Homes will broadly range from &euro;160,000 to &euro;310,000.  I have worked with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and am glad that we have agreed a number of significant reforms to the serviced sites fund to ensure it can help local authorities effectively fund major housing delivery, and to get on with the delivery of those affordable homes.<\/p> <p> Shared equity will involve the State bridging the affordability gap by taking an equity stake of up to 20% between an individual&rsquo;s mortgage limits and the price of the home.  It will work in conjunction with the help-to-buy scheme to help to get people into homes this year, starting this year.  It will be one tool in helping to turn generation rent into a generation that can buy and own their own home.<\/p> <p> On shared equity, I want to address some of the concerns and comments that have been raised, and tackle some of the unfounded and opportunistic criticisms around a particular aspect of the Bill, to dispel any uncertainty and directly tackle deliberate misinformation.  Because of the Opposition&rsquo;s hesitancy, in some quarters, to acknowledge that it is broadly supportive of most of the measures contained in the Bill, such as local authority direct build affordable homes, expanding Part V and a new form of tenure in cost rental, a particular and intentionally distracting focus has been paid to the affordable purchase shared equity scheme.  I intend that this scheme will be a short-term, targeted measure as part of a much broader multifaceted approach to increasing housing supply and affordability.  This specific measure on shared equity increase viability and generate supply to provide an immediate boost to first-time buyers for new homes.  It has been developed in very close consultation with relevant Departments, housing delivery partners, international comparator bodies and other key stakeholders.  It will work.  We have examined and assessed the impact of similar schemes, not the same schemes, in other jurisdictions, including in England, learning from experience and developing an Irish scheme that is calibrated for Ireland.  With regard to our nearest neighbour, the English scheme has supported 250,000 home purchases.  An independent assessment conducted by the UK&rsquo;s National Audit Office - the equivalent of Ireland's Comptroller and Auditor General, not the London School of Economics - found that the scheme has met its twin objectives of increasing supply and increasing home ownership.  The office's analysis found it increased supply by 14% and that purchase price or house price inflation rose by approximately 1% on a like-for-like basis.<\/p> <p> Certain elements of the Opposition, but not all, may not want this scheme to provide support to house purchasers.  I believe those needing to buy a home want support.  They deserve support and they need it.  A recent Behaviour &amp;amp; Attitudes survey found that 76% of those expressing a view were in favour of the introduction of a shared equity scheme as a means of making the cost of homes more affordable.  We have a decision on whether we delay further to allow people to continue to pay up to &euro;2,000 a month in rent, or help them to get a mortgage that would be half of that, and help them to get to own their home now.  There should be no more procrastination.  We must get on and do it.<\/p> <p> Nevertheless, taking on board legitimate concerns, safeguards over and above those in place in the UK's scheme are being built in to tailor eligibility to meet individual affordability needs only and to manage prices through area-based price ceilings.  These price ceilings are price caps, not price targets.  The price ceilings are based on real data, which is the CSO-recorded median price of new first-time buyer homes sold in each area.  This means that developers will build homes in the lower half of the price distribution specific to that area.  I am happy to confirm, again, that this will explicitly not be a second mortgage.  It is an equity stake.  It is not a debt-led scheme.  It will not compel homeowners to borrow more than they can afford.  It will not attract exorbitant interest rates, as some have tried to portray earlier in the debate.<\/p> <p> I am pleased that the provision of cost rental has been widely welcomed by a range of political and research groups.  It will see rents that are anticipated to be the region of 25% to 30% lower than comparable market rents, and which will provide greater returns as they mature.  This is an entirely new form of tenure and an exciting departure for housing in Ireland.  Cost rental will cover the cost of developing and managing those developments, and will provide State-backed affordable rents for our people.<\/p> <p> I want to correct any suggestion that the inclusion of a very limited return on equity is equivalent to allowing the private sector to generate large profits in this space.  We want to broaden out and expand cost rental.  The Exchequer will need assistance in doing that.  Where any private providers wish to deliver cost rental homes, for instance large institutional pension funds, or indeed ethical funds, they will of course seek a modest return.  The legislation provides for regulatory-making powers to set a cap on the allowable level of return.   For example, between 3.5% and 5% is permitted under the exemplar Austrian cost rental model of cost rental, which we are seeking to emulate in Ireland.  This allows the delivery of cost rental at scale and a model that is not entirely reliant on State support.  Furthermore, this provision will allow the Land Development Agency, LDA, to deliver cost rental at scale, and to provide for some modest returns in that space to reinvest into further cost rental across the board.  That is for those who are supporting the Land Development Agency Bill 2021, and who support the LDA in building homes.  This will be a very important deliverer in this space with where we start breaking ground this year.<\/p> <p> I will now turn to Part V and first-time buyers.  I have previously confirmed that it is my intention to bring forward further changes to strengthen this Bill on Committee Stage.  This will include expanding Part V provisions of the Planning and Development Act 2000 to increase the percentage contribution and to make it available for the provision of affordable housing by local authorities and approved housing bodies, AHBs.  The provisions, however, will require that the Part V contribution for social housing will be a minimum 10%, which is protected.  In areas where there is no affordable purchase or rental need, which will be very few areas but there may be some, all of the 20% will be applied to social housing provision.<\/p> <p> My Department is also currently working on amendments to create an owner-occupier guarantee.  This will involve enabling local authorities to designate a specified number of houses and duplexes with a predetermined range of at least 0% to 50% in a development for owner-occupiers similar to requirements under Part V.  It will complement the actions taken by the Minister for Finance and me last month on protecting traditional family homes from bulk purchasing.<\/p> <p> We are in the middle of a national housing crisis.  We are taking steps to address that.  Faced with such an emergency we need to use all the tools at our disposal to address this challenge across the private and the public sector.  I am genuinely committed to pragmatism over ideology and real delivery over dogmatism to boost housing supply and open up home ownership to a new generation.  To refuse to use the private sector would be fighting with one hand tied behind our back.  Instead we need to show energy, innovation, flexibility and commitment to get bricks and mortar into the ground, with the State playing a central role.  The State is the biggest builder and biggest investor in housing.  This will remain so through our housing for all plan, which we will publish in the coming weeks.  In this light, the Bill is very important legislation.  It is a major leap forward in housing policy.  It is also a major leap forward into helping people own their own home or to rent their home at an affordable rate.<\/p> <p> I look forward to a debate on the Bill's provisions.  I will seek to respond to any specific questions put forward by Deputies in that regard.  I genuinely look forward to any suggestion on Committee Stage for how this legislation can be improved.  We need this legislation to pass by the summer recess.  It is urgent and important.<\/p> <p>A lot of very detailed work has gone into it.  There was good pre-legislative work done by the Oireachtas joint committee, which was also protracted.  There was good debate in the Seanad throughout all Stages, including amendments.<\/p> <p> I fundamentally put to colleagues, and I say this respectfully, that if they support home ownership for generation rent, they will support and vote for the Bill.  If they support affordable and cost rental, they will vote for the Bill.  If they really want affordable homes on State land for our young people and not so young people to buy, they will vote for the Bill.  If they want every newly granted planning application for new housing estates after the passing of the Bill to include an increased affordable housing provision, they will vote for the Bill.  There are no ifs or buts at this stage.  There is no equivocation and no conditions.  It is now time to start delivering for our people.  This is the basis for delivering affordable housing at scale on private and public land.<\/p> <p> People are watching.  There is great interest in this legislation and this initiative by the Government to deliver real opportunities for people to buy and rent homes at an affordable rate.  Now is the time for Members to decide whether they are for helping generation rent get out of that rent trap and whether they really want to start developing affordable homes for people at scale, through this legislation and separately in the LDA legislation, which are intertwined.<\/p> <p> I am acutely interested to hear views and I have heard views all the way through this.  At the end of the day, Deputies either support these measures or they do not.  I hope we will get as much cross-party and independent support for the measures I am bringing through, in the first year of this Government being in place.  Others have fed into the process and I welcome this.  I welcome the feedback I have received on this.  Now is not the time to allow someone's perfect be the enemy of the good.  We need to get on with delivering affordable homes to rent and to buy for our people.  This is the way forward to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400029#EE00200","speaker":"1561","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624537800,"counter":352,"content":"<p>The Bill has been two and a half years in gestation.  Considerable work on the legislation and the ideas behind it started a year before the previous Government fell.  As I understand it, the working group continued to work on it during the interregnum and modest changes, in my view, have been added by the Government.  This means the legislation before us in fact does not represent the profound change in housing policy the Minister claims.  It is much more a continuation not only of many of the core principles of Rebuilding Ireland but of Deputy Alan Kelly's Social Housing Strategy 2020, which was launched in 2014.<\/p>  <p>  I will go through each of the four principal areas of the Bill to give the Minister my feedback.  As the Minister knows, Sinn F&eacute;in supports the Bill.  It is a qualified support.  There are sections of the Bill the Minister undoubtedly knows we completely oppose.  Even on those sections we broadly support, we believe the Minister could do a much better job and we look forward to engaging with them on these crucial matters on Committee and Report Stages.<\/p>  <p>  All of the elements of the Bill, bar the shared equity loan scheme, are measures on which Sinn F&eacute;in, other Opposition parties and other Government parties have been campaigning and calling for years.  An affordable purchase scheme led by our local authorities is something for which I and the Minister argued throughout the lifetime of the previous Government.  We will support any measure that assists and funds local authorities, AHBs and community housing trusts to deliver genuinely affordable homes for people to buy.<\/p>  <p>  The serviced sites fund model is not a bad model.  There are better ways of doing it and the permanently affordable leasehold model Sinn F&eacute;in has proposed was initially proposed by &Oacute; Cualann.  Unfortunately, the banks would not support it.  It is one that would guarantee not just affordability for the first purchaser but for all subsequent purchasers, to build up a stock of permanently affordable privately-owned tradeable homes into perpetuity.  However, we support the serviced sites fund model at its current level so long as the homes are purchased at prices of &euro;250,000 or less.  It is important to be very clear the purchaser of that home still has to repay the shared equity portion at a later stage but for us the purchase point of &euro;250,000 or less is key.<\/p>  <p>  The difficulty is that the serviced sites fund is being used in other ways and we have some concerns about this, which I will make very clear.  For example, in O'Devaney Gardens, because of the joint venture nature of the development with a private developer the purchase price of a three-bedroom unit would be &euro;310,000 plus the &euro;50,000 shared equity portion to be repayable to the local authority.  This is &euro;360,000.  This is not affordable.  It is the wrong use of the fund and I urge the Minister to examine it.<\/p>  <p>  Likewise, the Department refused under the previous Minister to fund Dublin City Council to buy the glass bottle site to deliver the 15% affordable housing as part of the Poolbeg strategic development zone, and this land is now being bought above the guide price by the Johnny Ronan real estate group and others.  The serviced sites fund, even if it were increased to &euro;100,000, may not and probably will not on its own, deliver genuine affordability.  So far, I am not seeing much evidence of the Minister or the Department assisting Dublin City Council with this.  It is very disappointing that we do not have the regulations with respect to the scheme, and I ask the Minister in his response to let us know where they are at, when he intends to publish them and whether he will consult the Oireachtas housing committee.  Local authorities need this to progress as quickly as possible and we will not stand in the way of it.<\/p>  <p>  With respect to cost rental, it is very disappointing the section is a short number of pages, which means, in fact, the Bill does not deal with the substance of cost rental.  This in itself will be dealt with through regulations.  I make the same point as to when we will see these regulations and whether the Minister will consult, albeit in a time-limited manner, with the Oireachtas housing committee on these.  The key problem, however, with how cost rental has been developed to date is that the entry level rents are too high.  The cost of &euro;1,100, &euro;1,200 and &euro;1,300 for one, two and three-bedroom units is not affordable for the key demographic above the threshold for social housing but unable to afford the private rental market.  The way in which the financing is being structured does not lend itself to bringing down the rents to the kind of levels we see with new cost rental in Germany or Austria, with rents of &euro;700, &euro;800 or &euro;900 a month depending on where they are.  This means the financing model needs to ensure the soft loan component for the State covers at least 30% of the capital costs and the loan, whether from the European Investment Bank, EIB, the Housing Finance Agency, HFA, or elsewhere, is for 30 years or more, after which the soft loan from the State would be repaid.<\/p>  <p>  It is a bizarre idea to separate the primary delivery of cost rental from the primary delivery of social rental.  One of the great values of integrating social and affordable rental into the one provider is when the long-term loans on the cost rental are eventually paid down, the housing provider has a revenue stream to recycle into the management and maintenance of their stock as well as developing new stock.  This idea that the LDA will be primarily involved in cost rental and local authorities primarily involved in social housing is the most short-sighted and ill-conceived element of the Government's approach to cost rental and I urge the Minister to reconsider.  The idea, for example, that St. Teresa's Gardens should be an LDA project rather than a fully funded Dublin City Council project makes no sense.  I am happy it will be 100% public housing similar to St. Michael's Estate but it would be much better if it was being developed as St Michael's Estate is, as opposed to what is essentially a split managed scheme with the local authority buying back the 30% social housing and the LDA ultimately profiting from the cost rental.<\/p>  <p>  I am concerned, notwithstanding the Minister's remarks, about the involvement of private developers in the delivery of affordable cost rental.  I want to be very clear.  If an AHB or local authority or community housing trust wants to access private finance, whether it is equity finance or loan finance, so long as the rates are competitive in comparison with the EIB and the HFA, I have no problem with it.  In fact, Cl&uacute;id Housing recently did a very positive deal with Legal and General to secure the financing of homes but homes it will own at a point in time.  If we allow private developers as opposed to private finance to deliver affordable cost rental, we will never get the return when that stock matures, which is one of the hugely important long-term benefits of this type of tenure.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister clearly misunderstands the arguments many of us are making.  It is not about the level of profit.  Finance always costs something and if the cost of the finance is competitive that is not the problem.  It is that at a point in time in the future, when the principal loans mature and the housing provider generates a revenue surplus, it should not go to the private sector.  It should be recycled into public housing, whether delivered by local authorities, AHBs or other providers.<\/p> <p>On the shared equity loan scheme, the Minister's attempt to disregard very significant concerns from economists, reputable bodies like the ESRI and others is disingenuous.  This is a terrible scheme which will inflate house prices.  We know that is the case because that it what it does everywhere else.  It led to a 6% increase in house prices in London.  The Minister continually and knowingly, in my view, misrepresents the UK's National Audit Office report.  That report does not look at inflation.  Rather, it looks at the house price premium which is a completely different metric.  We have said this to the Minister repeatedly and he keeps misrepresenting it because he thinks it will serve his interests. <br\/><br\/>This is a secondary loan.  If it was purely a shared equity stake there would be no interest rate on it.  The problem with interest rates is that the Minister is right.  They start very low.  If somebody is not in a position to start repaying a loan, in particular when he or she gets to year 15 and onwards, the interest rates will become punitive.  The reason is that the purpose of the interest rate is to incentivise the buyer to repay at an earlier stage or remortgage at year 15 or 20.  Unfortunately, as we learned from the last failed Fianna F&aacute;il shared ownership scheme which had a mortgage interest rate four times higher than mainstream banks after the Celtic tiger collapse in 2008, modest income families at risk of losing income at a future point in time will not be able to refinance and will end up with very heavy housing costs.<br\/><br\/>I would like the Minister, if he could, to confirm in his remarks if the Central Bank has made a formal decision on the inclusion of the banks as co-partners in the scheme.  He seemed to indicate earlier today in another debate that they have.  If that is the case, can he tell us the detail of how much is involved and whether staff from the banks will be seconded into the special purpose vehicle to administer the loans?  That also carries certain risks.  Just as help to buy clearly led to an increase in house prices, and 60% of those availing of it did not need it because they had sufficient mortgage finance and deposit finance to buy a home, this will be the same.  I suspect it will grow and last much longer than the Minister is claiming.<br\/><br\/>I fully welcome the provisions regarding Part V.  The Minister knows he supported a Sinn F&eacute;in Bill to a similar effect during the last Government.  It should never have been reduced to 10%.  It is something Fianna F&aacute;il and Sinn F&eacute;in firmly agree on and the sooner that is introduced the better. <br\/><br\/>On the owner occupiers guarantee, the Minister needs to reconsider having some level of application of the guarantee to apartments.  If we want to have vibrant and sustainable cities and if those cities are, in the main, going to be made up of new apartment developments, we need to give people the option to own those apartments.  Otherwise, what we are saying is that homeownership is something for the suburbs and regions, but not for inner city centres.  That is completely contrary to the national planning framework and good sustainable planning.  I urge the Minister to reconsider that and allow people to own and live in our city centres.<br\/><br\/>Likewise, it should be a provision in the owner occupier guarantee that the figure could be up to 100%.  Planning authorities are best placed to decide the percentage tenure mix of rent or owner occupation in a given location.  I would like to see that addressed.<br\/><br\/>In the few minutes I have before I conclude, I would like to say that legislation does not build houses.  Investment does.  While the Bill provides an important framework for that investment, if it is not followed up by a level of direct capital investment by the State in the delivery of genuinely affordable homes for working people to rent or buy, then all of this will come to very little.  Our problem at the moment is that we know from figures given to the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage by the LDA and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, which are based on the current levels of investment in our local authorities, AHBs and the LDA, that delivery of affordable homes between now and 2025 will be exceptionally modest. <br\/><br\/>The Department has told us that this year 530 units could be delivered, between rental and purchase.  Next year the figure could reach 700.  By 2023 it may get to 1,000, but they are pre-Covid figures.  The LDA will not have delivered a single home until five years after it has been established, in 2023, and even then it will only be a few hundred.  It will be 2025 before it breaches 1,000.  That tells me that unless something changes in budget 2022, the Government will not reach the target of 4,000 affordable homes by 2025.  Obviously, that is the average over a ten-year plan, and I appreciate that, but the Minister can hear the point I am making.<br\/><br\/> My view is very clear.  We need, at a minimum, an annual average target of 8,000 genuinely affordable homes every single year for the next decade.  Half of those should be affordable rental and half should be affordable purchase.  The reason I say that is that is what the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, housing agencies, the ESRI and, more recently, the NTMA, have called on the Government to do.  We need a doubling of direct capital investment in local authorities, AHBs, community housing trusts or whatever other not for profit providers exist to deliver those home. <br\/><br\/>The problem is that Fine Gael does not want to spend that money.  That is why we are having such uncertainty around the future funding of the LDA and the cost rental equity loan was a measly &euro;35 million this year, despite the fact that the Minister's budget ask from his Fine Gael colleagues in the Department of Finance was actually much more significant than that.  That is why we have a cost-rental equity loan, CREL, scheme in the first place rather than an expanded capital advance loan facility.  We need 20,000 public homes, comprising 12,000 social and 8,000 affordable, annually if we are going to make a dent in this crisis.<br\/><br\/>The last points I want to make are about home ownership.  The Minister, as he liked to do in opposition, now says as Minister that he believes in home ownership.  Home ownership started to decline, and declined most rapidly, when the Minister's party was last in government because of the private sector-led policy his party pursued which pushed up house prices and rents and made home ownership difficult for so many.<br\/><br\/>If the Minister is serious and genuinely wants to deliver homes at prices that people can afford, then he needs to radically shift policy.  I have yet to see any evidence of that.  Ultimately, however, the locked out generation, the housing needs of which the Minister and I want to see met, will judge by action and not fine words on the floor of the D&aacute;il or ink on the page of a piece of legislation.  They will judge on how many homes are built and at what price they are delivered year after year. <br\/><br\/>Until we see the level of public investment that everybody, bar the Government, seems to think is needed in the direct delivery of affordable homes to rent or buy, this problem will not be solved.  If the Minister comes out with a great plan in the summer, and takes the advice of Sinn F&eacute;in, NESC and NTA and doubles capital investment in the delivery of public housing in budget 2022, he will have our support.  If not, we will keep coming back and saying that until there is real change, the crisis will get worse and we will continue to advocate what we believe are the necessary solutions to give people the affordable homes that they not only need to but rightly deserve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400031#GG00200","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624538400,"counter":354,"content":"<p>T&aacute; an-&aacute;thas orm go bhfuilim ag labhairt ar an mBille seo.

The programme for Government promised to deliver an affordable housing scheme to help out first-time buyers and, in exceptional circumstances, those who lost their homes in the financial crash as well as those who were forced to sell their homes as a result of a relationship break up.  These are the principle ways to avail of the affordable housing scheme.  However, the Minister's recent announcements as to what constitutes affordability as a maximum of &euro;450,000 for an apartment and &euro;500,000 for a house in Dublin has sent shockwaves to anyone trying to put together a deposit to buy a house or apartment.<\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">  Those buying their first home will need to have saved at least 10% of the house price as a deposit, but preferably up to 20%.  Additional costs would also include the likes of legal fees.  As the Minister<\/font>can see, there is already a heavy financial burden being placed on first-time buyers.  This is clearly a disincentive for many young people looking to get on the property ladder for the first time and will shackle them to long-term renting.  Others will have to continue to live in the family home.<\/p><p>It is a positive move that the Minister proposes to return the Part V take to 20% of any housing development if the development comprises more than nine units.  This should have been done long ago and it is something that we in Sinn F&eacute;in vehemently opposed when it was originally changed to 10%.  It is to be hoped this will happen.  However, it is not clear what proportion of this 20% will go towards affordable housing. <\/p><p>Prior to 2015, the breakdown was 10% social and 10% affordable.  Is it the intention of the Minister to do something similar?  I heard him say that he is talking about that.  He has clarified some of these matters, but further clarity is needed.<\/p> <p> I have a great concern that, among other categories of development that are exempt under Part V, one is where a site is on land of 1,000 sq. m or less.  This has had a detrimental effect on developments that are mainly located in the city centre and where more than nine units are being built.  This exemption is being abused and should be removed.<\/p> <p> It appears that the Minister has set the affordable rental bar too high, which is at approximately &euro;1,300 per month in Dublin on average.  These high rents have two effects: first, they are not affordable for many people; and, second, a great part of many people's incomes goes on paying rents, leaving them with no spare capacity to save for a house deposit.  Even couples in good employment on what would be considered reasonable incomes would struggle to pay such high rents.<\/p> <p> The use of homeless housing assistance payment, HAP, and housing HAP cost the State &euro;422.729 million up to 2019, and the cost is still rising.  More money is given to homeless HAP than housing HAP and local authorities have discretion to exceed the HAP rent limits for homeless households, including people in homeless accommodation.  Local authorities are authorised to uplift HAP amounts by up to 20%.  In the Dublin region, this can rise to 50%.  Large sums of money are being spent by local authorities that could otherwise be used for building sustainable social housing.<\/p> <p> The Minister's plans for a new affordable purchase shared equity scheme whereby the State would take a 20% equity in a purchased property have previously proven unworkable.  Experience of such schemes shows that they have led to inflated house prices and individuals accumulating large and unsustainable debts, forcing them to go from mortgage to rent after having paid their mortgages for many years along with their rent as the schemes entailed.  We are still dealing with the repercussions of these earlier share ownership schemes.  The flaws in the Minister's proposed scheme have been highlighted not just by us, but by economic organisations like the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, and even members of his own party and other Government parties.  I hope that the Minister takes on board our concerns and does not repeat the mistakes of the past.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400032#HH00200","speaker":"1470","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624539000,"counter":356,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for tabling the Bill in the House for debate.  He seems to have shifted on the Bill following the discussion in the Seanad, and there will be more shifts on Committee Stage in terms of Part V developments.  I look forward to further detail on same.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to speak about affordability and what is happening in the market.  House prices are increasing all over the country.  There is a general assumption that this is based on pent-up demand now hitting a market with a low level of supply.  There is a degree of truth in that, but as the Minister knows, I have been paying close attention to the activities of investment funds in the second-hand housing market across the country, particularly the Dublin region, which includes my constituency.  The impact of those activities on prices is disgraceful and is artificially inflating what is already a red-hot housing market.<\/p>  <p>  In recent months, I have been tracking a particular estate in my constituency, which the Minister also represents.  Four houses were put up for sale in the early part of this year.  They were the same type of house and each had an asking price of approximately &euro;300,000, which in the madness of today's Dublin housing market actually seems somewhat affordable.  That is how crazy the market is.  Three of the four houses were sold off market to an investment fund.  The fund offered &euro;20,000 or slightly more above the asking price.  The general public did not know that these three houses were for sale because only the fourth hit the websites and windows of estate agents.  I do not know what the other house went for, but the three bought by the investment fund went for &euro;320,000 or &euro;325,000.  A fifth house of the same type in the estate has now been put up for sale on the open market for approximately &euro;330,000.  That price is not to do with the pent-up demand of first-time buyers, families, people downsizing or whatever.  Rather, it is down to the investment fund setting a price early this year of &euro;320,000 or &euro;325,000 off market.  It is a large estate and I am not sure whether other new houses have been sold in recent weeks or will be put up for sale for investment funds to snap up.  When we hit October or November, we will see asking prices of &euro;350,000.  Block buying apartments and estates like what happened in Kildare, Santry and elsewhere is disgraceful, but what is happening with investment funds in the second-hand market is disgraceful and immoral and it is not getting enough attention.<\/p>  <p>  My example is relevant to the Bill because it raises a question about the extent to which investment funds are skewing asking prices and the impact of that on the calculations that will define affordability based on house prices in particular areas.  As the Minister mentioned, there will be an area-specific ceiling.  That sounds like a good idea, but I will not jump into a discussion on it because I want to hear more detail.  It is scandalous that housing in a particular estate has increased in price by &euro;50,000 because 75% of the purchasers are investment funds that did not buy from the open market.  I would like the Minister to guarantee the D&aacute;il that his Department is aware of this issue, is devising more sophisticated and harsher measures to tackle it and will not allow artificial activity in the second-hand housing market to impact the calculations for affordability, price ceilings and brackets for two-bedroom, three-bedroom or four-bedroom houses.  My concern is that they will be artificially skewed.<\/p>  <p>  When big investors and developers were active in the market previously and driving supply and prices, there was a visibility to it.  We knew what was going on because it was being reported, but what is happening now is insidious and under the radar.  We all need to discuss and tackle it more, but it is ultimately the responsibility of the Minister, his Department and his fellow Ministers where appropriate, for example, the Minister for Finance, to eradicate it from the housing market.  It is taking homes away from people who need them.<\/p>  <p>  I believe it was the Minister who stated that the average age of first-time buyers now was 36 years, or perhaps it was Deputy &Oacute; Broin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400033#JJ00200","speaker":"1564"},{"type":"speech","time":1624539000,"counter":357,"content":"<p>I said it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400033#JJ00300","speaker":"1561"},{"type":"speech","time":1624539000,"counter":358,"content":"<p>It has increased by ten years.
