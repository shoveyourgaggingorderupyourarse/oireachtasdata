The retail area is a sector with high importance for the Department.  That is the reason we ensured in the programme for Government that we have a Minister whose responsibility would include the area of retail to build on the success of the retail forum in recent years.  The past year has been a very difficult one for must businesses, including those in the Irish retail sector.  The impact of both the Covid-19 pandemic and Brexit have posed significant challenges for businesses and it is vital that businesses continue to develop their resilience in the face of these and future challenges.<\/p><p>I thank businesses and their customers for their continued support of the national effort throughout the unprecedented public health crisis.  Many in the retail sector are on the front line, but they still managed to provide an excellent service throughout the pandemic and to reach their customers in many different ways all over the country.  That was handled extremely well, in conjunction with employees, employers and their customers following all the protocols and playing their part to suppress the virus.<\/p><p><b><\/b>As the largest private sector employer, and a key element in providing for the needs of society and indeed other sectors of the economy, it is vital that retail continues to develop capability and remains competitive.  It is important that there is a strong, diverse, and balanced retail business presence across the country which sustains the local and domestic economy and contributes to the export economy, both online and offline.  A long-term goal for the overall retail sector prior to the pandemic was to scale up online offerings to complement physical outlets, but to make sure that we can develop the two.  This goal has been accelerated due to the pandemic, and I want to see the digital development of the sector continue.  My Department has provided specific funding though the Covid-19 online retail scheme and the trading online voucher scheme to assist the retail sector in its efforts.<\/p><p>For many retailers, developing their digital capability and enhancing their physical retail offering with a strong online presence will support them to become more resilient and to be able to continue with that opportunity in the future.  The Department is determined to support that ambition and assist our businesses to increase their digital presence and boost online sales, allowing them to target new and existing customers and shoppers in the online space.<\/p><p><i><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">  Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/font><\/i><\/p><p>It also provides consumers with more opportunities to support local businesses in their community, even when shopping online.<\/p><p>I want the retail sector to continue to develop and to become one of our most innovative and resilient sectors, so that those working in retail can be confident about building a long-term career in retail.<\/p><p>As Minister of State, I will support this by continuing to work collaboratively with the sector and to address issues directly affecting the retail sector.  My Department is undertaking a retail sector study to look at the future of the retail sector.  The study, to be prepared with external experts and stakeholders from the retail sector, will identify and analyse the factors impacting on retailers and their employees, and the likely future trends, opportunities and challenges facing the retail sector.  The study will provide an evidence-based foundation for ongoing engagement with retail sector stakeholders and will identify retail sector policy options for consideration by my Department, working with the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and ultimately by the Government.  The study will also support the work of the retail forum, which I chair, and will support the ongoing engagement that I and my officials have with the representative bodies of the workers and businesses in the retail sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300003#A01400","speaker":"1505"},{"type":"speech","time":1622707200,"counter":19,"content":"<p>Mandate made the call for the establishment of a task force on the future of retail as a matter of urgency following the loss of 500 jobs in The Carphone Warehouse.

I tried to get here in such a hurry that I managed to walk up to the higher level and then had to come back down again.<\/p>  <p>  The WRC is an independent statutory body under the aegis of my Department.  It was established on 1 October 2015 under the Workplace Relations Act 2015.  On its establishment, sanction for 60 labour inspectors was granted.  I understand from Department officials that an agreement with unions existed in 2016 whereby the number of WRC inspectors was to be increased to 90 over time.  However, it predated the establishment of the WRC in October 2015.<\/p>  <p>  The WRC was established as a two-tier employment rights and industrial relations structure to improve the State's employment rights and industrial relations service and reduce the number of industrial relations bodies from five to two, therefore requiring fewer staff.  Staffing levels of WRC inspectorate are currently under active review.  I am advised and satisfied that the service is operating effectively and that no delays are being reported.<\/p>  <p>  WRC inspectors are appointed by the WRC Director General, with the consent of the Minister, and exercise such powers as are conferred upon them by the Workplace Relations Act 2015.<\/p>  <p>  The WRC inspectorate is staffed by civil servants of my Department.  As of 1 May 2021, there has been a total of 53 WRC inspectors.  There are currently 60 sanctioned labour inspector posts.  These comprise 53 executive officer inspectors and seven higher executive officer inspector team managers.  These are supervised by three assistant principals and one chief labour inspector.  In total, there are just under 200 staff in the WRC as a whole.<\/p>  <p>  Currently, there are two competitions ongoing within the Public Appointments Service, and interviews for a higher executive officer inspector team manager competition have been finalised.  The WRC expects two appointments from the competition shortly.  A recruitment drive for inspectors is also under way.  This will create a panel to enable vacancies to be filled.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that during a Topical Issue debate with the Minister of State, Deputy English, in March, Deputy O'Reilly raised the high number of breaches of employment law in meat plants found by WRC inspectors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300004#B00600","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1622707800,"counter":34,"content":"<p>The T&aacute;naiste will get an opportunity to complete his answer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300004#B00700","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1622707800,"counter":35,"content":"<p>Since 2015, over one third of WRC investigations detected breaches of employment law.

Of the investigations, 35.9% found breaches by employers regarding the non-payment of the minimum wage, employment permits, the protection of young persons, annual leave and public holiday entitlements and unpaid wages, in addition to other breaches.  Sectors such as the food and drink, retail, wholesale, hair and beauty, and construction sectors have seen consistent breaches of employment law in recent years.  These figures do not paint a pretty picture but what they do say to me very clearly is that we need more inspectors.  Therefore, I am going to put the question to the T&aacute;naiste again: if the figure is 90, can he outline to us when we are going to reach it?

The capital is internationally recognised as a leader in areas such as digital and Internet services, financial services, international education and life sciences.  However, Covid-19 has had a really negative impact on some businesses, with the pandemic having a hollowing-out effect on the city centre especially.  The plan will be tailored to the needs of Dublin, and will examine how we can help workers adapt and retrain for the jobs of the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300004#B01500","speaker":"1474","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622708400,"counter":44,"content":"<p>I wrote to the T&aacute;naiste a month ago seeking a meeting with all local representatives to discuss the situation in Baldoyle.

As he will be aware, the Government launched its economic recovery plan last Tuesday.  It will restore our public finances to good health through employment and not austerity, by going for growth and not retrenchment, and by aiming for a rapid recovery.  It will help to restore existing jobs and create new ones in areas like construction, climate action and digital transformation.  We have set the target to have 2.5 million people at work in Ireland by 2024, setting a new record.  It is also about building a new economy that is more inclusive and more secure with a move to a living wage, sick pay, occupational pensions for all workers, flexibility in the workplace, remote working and more opportunity for training, education, research and gender equality.  We intend to rebuild sustainable enterprises through targeted financial supports and policies to make enterprises more resilient and productive.  We want to achieve a balanced and inclusive recovery through strategic investment in infrastructure and reforms that enhance our long-term capacity for growth, through balanced regional development and through improvements in living standards.<\/p>  <p>  The measures outlined in the economic recovery plan include an extension of the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, until the end of the year; an extension of the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, until February of next year; a commitment that the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, will run indefinitely; considerable enhancement of both EWSS and CRSS in how they are calculated; an extension of the commercial rates waiver into the third quarter of the year; an extension of the tax debt warehousing scheme to the end of the year, with no interest next year; assistance for the worst affected sectors including aviation, tourism and events as they continue to reopen; an extension of the 9% VAT rate for tourism and hospitality sector until September of next year; and dedicated schemes for the live entertainment and events sector which will be announced later in the month.  I recently announced an expansion of the small business assistance scheme for Covid-19, which now under phase 2 will include eligibility for businesses operating from non-rateable premises and thereby cover those working from home, and a microenterprise fund for those with a turnover of less than &euro;50,000.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300006#D00600","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1622709000,"counter":61,"content":"<p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste.

A key action within the strategy is to extend the mapping and classifications of hubs.  Earlier this week, my colleague, the Minister for Community and Rural Development, Deputy Humphreys, launched the national connected hubs network, which includes a booking platform, brand and remote working hubs.<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased that Youghal was successful in securing &euro;4 million in funding under the Government's Project Ireland 2040 rural regeneration and development fund, RRDF. This funding will transform a derelict site on the main street in Youghal into a new library, incorporating a digital learning suite and community space.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Rural and Community Development is investing in new hubs through further calls under both the RRDF and the town and village renewal scheme.  The &euro;15 million town and village renewal call launched on 30 May 2021.  This will assist in bringing vacant properties in town centres back into use or repurposing existing community or publicly owned buildings as remote working hubs.  The third call for category 2 applications to the RRDF is open and will close on 16 July.  Category 2 funding will enable projects at an early stage to be developed to a high standard and be ready to commence.<\/p>  <p>  To date, my Department has provided funding of &euro;250 million for the establishment of approximately 270 enterprise centres throughout Ireland, administered by Enterprise Ireland, EI, including for Enterprise Youghal Centre, Emmet Place.  This investment has enabled the establishment of physical space for entrepreneurs, start-ups, scaling companies, SMEs and a balance of small scale FDI.

Youghal is a town that suffered greatly from the loss of manufacturing jobs towards the start of the Celtic tiger, unfortunately.  There were 4,000 people working in Youghal in the 1980s and 1990s in manufacturing and low-skill labour.  Many of those jobs were let go because people were working in areas like textiles.  Unfortunately, we never saw any real direct State support going to Youghal following those job losses, which is completely unacceptable.  As the Minister of State can imagine, the loss of jobs to that extent in a small town in rural Ireland decimated the local economy.  Youghal is on the up.  A remote working centre for this town is something our Government should look at providing for the people of Youghal.  It is the least they deserve.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to use this opportunity to call for IDA Ireland to take a greater interest in Youghal.

The meeting had a full agenda, which included debate and draft conclusions on the EU trade policy review, preparations for the World Trade Organization ministerial conference later this year, EU-US trade relations, updates on the EU steel safeguards and the EU Mercosur agreement and progress with the negotiations on an EU international procurement instrument.<\/p>  <p>  We discussed the Union's contribution to the reform of the World Trade Organization and preparations for the next Ministerial Conference, known as MC12.

The restoration of the dispute settlement function is an objective for Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  We debated EU-US trade relations and the prospect for a more positive transatlantic relationship with the new US Biden-Harris administration.  We focused on progress in resolving the transatlantic trade disputes relating to Airbus and Boeing as well as steel and aluminium disputes, which are adversely affecting several sectors in Ireland given our strong trade volumes with the US.  I believe Ireland can act as a bridge between the US and Europe in solving some of these issues.<\/p>  <p>  We held separate discussions with the US trade representative, Katherine Tai, by videoconference and the new WTO Director-General, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, in person.  While held in private, the meetings encouraged me to believe that we are back on a pathway to restoring the WTO to the heart of a multilateral rules based international order when it comes to trade.

As I have said previously, I believe the pandemic has changed the world of work forever.  Many of us will return to work but videoconferences will be more common and travelling for work much less so.  While some people will work full time from the office or from home, many of us will be blended workers, working sometimes from the office and other times from home, or perhaps from a hub or on the go.<\/p>  <p>  The remote working strategy, which I published in January, aims to ensure that remote work is a permanent feature in the Irish workplace of the future in a way that maximises economic, social and environmental benefits.  Among the main actions we will take are mandating that home and remote work should be the norm for 20% of public sector employment; reviewing the treatment of remote working for the purposes of tax and expenditure in the next budget; mapping and investing in a network of remote working hubs across Ireland; legislating for the right to request remote working; developing a code of practice for the right to disconnect; and doing what we can to accelerate the provision of high-speed broadband to all parts of Ireland.  My Department is leading on the implementation of the strategy.<\/p>  <p>  Members will be aware that on 1 April I signed a the code of practice on the right to disconnect, and that a public consultation on the right to request remote working concluded on 7 May.  I am very aware of the importance of infrastructure for the development of remote work.  Under this strategy, significant investment will be made in remote work hubs and infrastructure in underserved areas to underpin the development of the national hub network.<\/p> <p>The Department of Rural and Community Development, under the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, is leading the interdepartmental national hub networking programme, on which my Department is represented.  Recently, it launched a &euro;5 million call for funding for connected hubs.  Earlier this week, the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, launched <i>connectedhubs.ie<\/i>, which will provide a shared booking platform for hubs throughout the country.  It is Ireland's first ever digital hub network and 66 hubs throughout the country are on board and accessible to remote workers via an online map.  The number will rise to 100 by the end of 2021 and the overall target is for 400.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300009#G01600","speaker":"1474","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622711400,"counter":110,"content":"<p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste.  This is great progress.  It is not just about rural communities.  In my town of D&uacute;n Laoghaire, 140,000 people live within ten minutes of a major urban town in the greater Dublin area, 34% of whom are under 30 and want to be in businesses driven by innovation and knowledge.  George's Street, which is the main street, is 1.2 km long and has 264 shopfronts, many of which have been vacant for a very long time.  There is an opportunity for the people of D&uacute;n Laoghaire to be able to work in jobs that have a city centre presence partially from hubs in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, with the support of very good broadband and the creation of these facilities.  There is a very strong climate argument to it.  Instead of creating large corporate hubs around the periphery of Dublin, we will be able to have facilities whereby people can be closer to home and have less travel and driving.  This will involve less creation of new commercial space and the repurposing of existing space.

We have a window of opportunity to grab and I am determined we should grab it and begin the conversation in the workplace about what things will look like when we work from home, not when we have to but when there is a choice.

We tend to talk about this in the context of rural communities and moving away from the old adage there are no jobs there.  This is no longer true.  There are 50,000 remote jobs on offer throughout Europe and they can be anywhere, including anywhere in rural Ireland.  We also have urban streets that have a lot of vacancy.

The climate benefits of this are very real.  When we look at reducing emissions from transport in our cities, it is interesting to note that moving people from cars to trains and buses unfortunately does not make a huge amount of difference because a 5 km or 10 km journey by car versus a 5 km or 10 km journey by a diesel-powered bus or train does not reduce emissions very much.  What really makes a difference is people walking or cycling to work.  This is much more possible if they are able to work near their homes.  This is why our suburban areas and urban towns and villages can present a real opportunity for people being able to work closer to home if we seize this opportunity.<\/p>  <p>  The vacancy above the shop is very tricky for Ireland because generally the access, unlike in other European cities, tends not to be from a door at the side of the big building but through the shop.  It is very hard to turn upstairs into an apartment if it means having to walk through the Spar or the Abrakebabra every time people want to go home.

We are waiting on the audit of the available emergency accommodation for victims of sexual and gender-based domestic violence from Tusla.  I asked about that matter yesterday.  That is not available yet either.  We know all the figures, and we know that the Garda has done its best and that the wonderful Operation Faoiseamh was put in place during the Covid-19 pandemic.  The worry, of course, is whether the resources will be there afterwards.  In addition, the immediate worry is the horrific increase in domestic violence.  The Garda Commissioner's report stated that domestic assaults had risen by 24% compared with the previous year, from 2019 to 2020.  Calls in that regard had gone up by 16%.

An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na received approximately 43,500 calls to respond to domestic abuse incidents in 2020, which was an increase of 17%.  More than 4,000 criminal charges were created in 2020 for breaches of orders under the Domestic Violence Act 2018, which is an increase of 24%.  The Garda received approximately 10,000 calls to respond to domestic abuse incidents in the first quarter of this year, an increase of 7%, and more than 1,000 criminal charges were created in the first quarter of this year for breaches of orders under the Domestic Violence Act 2018.  The increase in reported incidents during the restrictions, together with the proactive approach taken by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, has resulted in more files being referred to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, for prosecution.  This demonstrates that Operation Faoiseamh is working and it reinforces the message that perpetrators cannot act with impunity.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the audit, I expect it to come before me very shortly and I will be discussing the report with the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman.

There are some 60 services throughout the country and we are acutely aware that the housing crisis is placing additional pressures on refuges and is making identifying longer-term services more difficult.

The scheme provided, for the first time, a framework for the employment of non-EEA workers within defined segments of the Irish fishing fleet.  The scheme was welcomed as a solution to the risk of exploitation and to guarantee employment rights and protections to non-EEA fishers availing of the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The scheme commenced in February 2016 and was initially only open to non-EEA crew members who were already working in the fishing industry in Ireland.  From July of that year, all non-EEA workers came under the remit of the programme and the atypical worker permission, which is stamp 1 with conditions from my Department and a visa clearance, if applicable, prior to entering the State applies to these people.  The scheme also provides for the annual renewal of the permission granted and permits the employee to transfer employment within the sector.  However, the permission granted is not transferable to any other employment sector within the State. <\/p>  <p>  Holders of atypical working scheme permits do not meet the eligibility criteria for conversion to a stamp 4 permission under the long-term residency administrative scheme operated by my Department.  Eligibility for long-term residency is restricted to holders of an employment permit from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  It is open to the fishing industry to apply for inclusion in the Department's employment permit scheme and I understand that my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy English, advised them of this at a meeting with industry representatives last week.  Inclusion in the employment permit system would secure stamp 4 status. <\/p>  <p>  Holders of atypical working permits can make an application for a certificate of naturalisation once they meet the residency criteria of five years legal residence in the State.

Unfortunately, processing rates have been impacted by the necessary health and safety related restrictions imposed and we have been unable to hold in-person citizenship ceremonies since March 2020.<\/p> <p>In addition to the Covid-19 disruption, a High Court case in 2019, which was subsequently successfully appealed to the Court of Appeal, also resulted in significant delays and the loss of over six months of processing time.<\/p> <p> There are just over 24,600 applications on hand, almost 22,200 from adults and 2,400 from children.  These applications are at various stages within the system, ranging from those who have just received citizenship to those where a decision has been made but it is not yet possible to issue an invitation to a ceremony.  On 18 January 2021, my Department opened a temporary system that enables applicants to complete their naturalisation process by signing a statutory declaration of loyalty.  Approximately 2,500 people have received their Irish citizenship since then by way of this process.  A further 1,853 people have returned their signed statutory declarations and will receive their certificates of naturalisation in the coming weeks.  By the end of this month, we will have communicated with 6,500 applicants, offering them the opportunity to complete their citizenship through the statutory declaration process.<\/p> <p> To further address the volume of applications on hand, we are assigning additional staff to the citizenship team.  A number of measures have been introduced to increase the digitisation of the process, including the introduction of eTax clearance and eVetting; rolling out online payments; revising the Department's website to make it more user-friendly for customers; and launching the first immigration chatbot, Tara, which has answered more than 12,000 customer queries in a user-friendly way since last November.<\/p> <p> The end result of the digitisation process will be to free up staff resources to focus on processing applications in a timely and efficient manner, to improve services to our customers and to reduce waiting times.  At the end of April, my Department hosted the first virtual citizenship celebration.  We plan to hold another event next month to celebrate everyone who has received their citizenship since then.  The next in-person ceremonies are provisionally scheduled to take place at the beginning of December, subject to the safety of all involved being assured.<\/p> <p> What we are attempting to do here is not only resolve the current backlog that has arisen as the result of a court case and Covid-19 but also to put in place digitisation reform to ensure that the processes are more streamlined, easier and more effectively used for the future.

I will be visiting Burgh Quay in the afternoon and processes are being put in place there to have a simple one-stop application in place where people can apply for information on their processes.

Ireland has the second most expensive naturalisation process in the European Union.  It is topped only by Austria.  We talk about front-line workers in low-paid jobs who would love to apply for citizenship, who have been here for a considerable amount of time, who are wedded to the community and who have provided such service and duty over the last 15 months but they are not in a position to get the money together.  Equally, post Brexit I mention the tens of thousands of British nationals who have been here, in some cases for up to 50 or 60 years or who just happen to have been born in the UK and to have moved here as young children.  They are completely prohibited from taking their citizenship.  They are Irish.

There is another way of looking at it, as set out in a letter sent to the Government and to the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, by 50 consultants from Beaumont Hospital on how front-line workers are being treated.  It is about the stamp 4 system and how one can acquire stamp 4 status.  This is for eligibility for training, which is so important for progressing to consultant status and being able to remain in the country.  We have people who are coming top of their classes who are leaving Ireland because they cannot get the training to continue to progress their careers.  The letter, which I will send to the Minister of State, outlines that clearly.  One can get the stamp 4 status through marriage but not through working in the HSE.  People are coming here, spending hundreds of thousands of euro on their training in our medical schools, from which our medical schools are benefiting.  They are not then eligible for internship.  I appreciate that is a matter for the Department of Health but because of our immigration system and because of the backlog in citizenship, as well as this stamp 4 issue, they are then not eligible to stay and progress their careers for us to benefit from their experience and expertise.

It has called for investment in the region of &euro;4 billion annually.  It states this would deliver 18,000 public homes to meet not just social but affordable housing need for working families.<\/p>  <p>  Of course, Sinn F&eacute;in has been saying this for years.  We have outlined how the Government must double capital expenditure on public housing and embark on the largest investment programme in public housing in the history of the State.  This is the scale of what is required to tackle the crisis we are in.  It is not just us.  Fianna F&aacute;il, the T&aacute;naiste's partners in government, voted in favour of a 2018 D&aacute;il motion from the Raise the Roof campaign.  Raise the Roof is, as he will know, a grassroots civil society-led movement with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions at its front, and supported by almost all of our housing and homelessness organisations and activist groups.  That motion called for a doubling of capital investment in budget 2019 and the delivery of at least 20,000 social and affordable homes that year.  Of course, back in government, Fianna F&aacute;il has done what it does best and abandoned that commitment.  There was no meaningful additional capital spend in the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage's first budget above the commitments already entered into by his predecessor, Eoghan Murphy.  There is only &euro;160 million extra in capital spend for this year - &euro;124 million to deliver an additional 593 social homes and a paltry &euro;35 million to deliver just over 400 affordable cost-rental homes.  I said at the time and say again that that budget was underwhelming, unclear and wholly inadequate.<\/p>  <p>  Fine Gael, the T&aacute;naiste's party, has been in government for ten years and during that period not a single affordable home to rent or buy has been delivered by any central government scheme.  This will be the first year of ten years of Fine Gael government where some affordable homes will be delivered, but how many?  There will be only 90 affordable homes to purchase and just 440 affordable cost-rental homes for renters.  Meanwhile, social housing delivery targets remain low while Government expenditure on rent subsidies, including housing assistance payment, HAP, rental accommodation scheme, RAS, rent supplement and long-term leasing is set to hit a staggering &euro;1 billion this year.<\/p>  <p>  After ten years of failure by the T&aacute;naiste personally, as well as by his party, will he, on foot of this recommendation from the ESRI, give a guarantee that budget 2022 will include a doubling of direct capital investment by the State in the delivery of affordable homes for working people - public homes on public land delivered by local authorities, approved housing bodies and other not-for-profit agencies?  This is what the ESRI is urging the Government to do today.  It is saying this is absolutely necessary if we are going to get a grip on this housing crisis.  Will the Government abandon its failed pro-developer and pro-big investor policies of the past, listen to the expert advice and the advice from Opposition and civil society and put public money into public housing on public land for affordable housing for working people?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300021#T00300","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1622718000,"counter":274,"content":"<p>As is often the case, the best way to respond to the Deputy's rhetoric and ideology is with some facts.  These are the facts.  We have increased Government investment in social housing tenfold.  In 2016, when my party got the brief and Deputy Coveney became the Minister with responsibility for housing, only 600 social homes were built in this county.  By 2020, it was more than 6,000.  These were homes built by local authorities and approved housing bodies with public money.  That is a tenfold increase since 2016.  The budget for housing this year is the biggest ever and more than a third of homes built in the State this year will be built by the State.  One would probably have to go back to the 1980s, 1950s or 1960s to see that level of State involvement in the housing market.<\/p><p>On a <i>per capita<\/i>basis, our investment in social housing is much greater than is the case in Northern Ireland, where Deputy &Oacute; Broin's party has been in government for 20 years and has a very poor record indeed.  It is probably the worst record on this island when it comes to housing policy.  Our current target is that we should build and provide approximately 12,000 new social homes this year and every year into the future and several thousand more in terms of affordable for purchase and cost rental as well.<\/p><p>On the ESRI report, I have not had a chance to read it, though I have seen the headlines.  As I understand it, the ESRI proposes a big increase in capital spending on social and public housing and that we would set a target of approximately 18,000 houses per year.  It would not be easy to get to that overnight but it might well be a good target to aim for over the course of this Government.  However, I have not seen what breakdown the ESRI proposes.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin used the term &quot;public housing&quot; but, as he knows, public housing is much broader than social housing.  If that includes public housing, cost rental and affordable for purchase housing, that may well be doable.  A target of 18,000 may well be the right figure and may well be where we get to.  If it is 18,000 social houses alone, that is a different question.  That would be all on-balance sheet borrowing, which is not recoverable and much harder to do.  We will take a look at the report; we will give it full consideration.  I want to see the breakdown between social and other forms of public housing being recommended by the ESRI.<\/p><p>I note the institute proposes we do this by running a bigger budget deficit of maybe 1.5% of GDP a year to invest in our society, in housing and healthcare.  I agree with that approach, by the way.  I would like to go back to the old orthodoxy whereby borrowing for capital expenditure is more acceptable than borrowing for current expenditure.  I am not sure we can do that but I would like to.  However, we must bear in mind that at the moment we have a deficit of 5%, so we are already borrowing more than the ESRI and the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, think appropriate.  As such, it would have to be explained, or we would have to talk together about how we would manage to get from 5% down to 1.5% and still spend more on housing and other things.  As I said, the Government will reflect on the report and read it.  I notice that most of the recommendations being made by the ESRI are potentially contrary to other recommendations made by the institute and by the IFAC.  It is good to have so many advisory bodies but with so much advice, it is often contradictory.  We will take all that into account as we develop the revised national development plan, NDP, which we hope to have ready for July and the housing for all document which will be the Government's new housing policy to replace and build on the Rebuilding Ireland plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300021#T00400","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1622718000,"counter":275,"content":"<p>I have to say to the T&aacute;naiste that this is no laughing matter.

Yesterday I raised with the Taoiseach the decision of Professor Mary Daly, one of the members of the commission, to appear at an academic event in Oxford, having previously refused to come before the Oireachtas children's committee.  She appeared at the event yesterday.  Devastating revelations and evidence was given about what went on as regards the report and the recommendations from the commission.  There is evidence that survivors' testimony given confidentially was not taken on board.  This was clear to many once the report came out but we have now heard it from one of three people on the commission.  This was discounted for very tenuous legal reasons.<\/p>  <p>  I have a very clear question for the T&aacute;naiste.  Does he accept, based on what we now know, that the report must be repudiated?  As Dr. Maeve O'Rourke of the Clann Project, a supporter of the survivors, said, we cannot accept this report.  It is not valid, fully truthful, a historical record and accurate.  The stories that were told in a confidential fashion by women who went through such suffering, with such a stain on our society and country, were not taken on board.  This is not acceptable.<\/p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste sat beside the former Minister, former Deputy Zappone, but I have no idea what she was at.  It is quite clear the construct of this commission was flawed from the beginning.  These survivors - their lives, stories and honesty - needed to be reflected in the report but they were not.  It is not like people were not asking questions over the years.  In fairness to a former journalist, Mr. Conall &Oacute; F&aacute;tharta, he asked all these questions numerous times over nine years and never got the answers.  The commission did not spend half its budget and it did not, in interim reports, indicate these issues.  It is completely flawed.<\/p>  <p>  I ask these questions on behalf of a number of people who have always been in touch with me on this matter.  Does the T&aacute;naiste accept this report must be repudiated and the work should be done again?  We may be able to use aspects of it but the report must be done again.  Does the T&aacute;naiste accept the construction of this commission was fundamentally flawed from the beginning, limiting the quality, comprehensiveness and accuracy of the report?  Does he accept that Professor Daly appearing at the Oxford event yesterday has essentially retraumatised the survivors?  Will the T&aacute;naiste please stand up to represent those women and families who have been affected and give them hope that we can, as a country, do right by them once and for all?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300022#U01000","speaker":"1610"},{"type":"speech","time":1622718600,"counter":286,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  I want to be careful with my remarks because, as the Deputy said, it is a sensitive issue.  I know many survivors have been very upset by what they read today and yesterday, coming out of this academic seminar in England.<\/p>  <p>  The Government decided we should carry out an investigation into what happened in mother and baby homes and, as the Oireachtas, we united to agree terms of reference for that commission, which has made its report.  To my mind, what happened after that was not acceptable.  Essentially, the report was left on the desks of the Government and Oireachtas Members alike.  The commission's members did not engage with the Oireachtas or the survivors either to explain the report, tell us how they came to their findings or answer any questions.  That was not the correct course of action on the part of commission members.  That has now been compounded by the fact that one of the commission members felt it appropriate to do exactly that in an academic seminar.  That was disrespectful to the Oireachtas and particularly to survivors and their advocates.<\/p>  <p>  It is now necessary for the commission members to come before an Oireachtas committee as they have been asked to do.  They should do so without delay and allow us, as Oireachtas Members, to hear from them why they came to the findings they did and answer appropriate questions.  This should be done in non-adversarial way.  It should happen now.  They should also have a similar engagement with the survivors.  It was done previously for reports of this nature, including the Ryan, Scally and McAleese reports.  Perhaps they did not have the same legal structure but the same essential process was followed that people commissioned to make a report by the Oireachtas were willing to explain that report to the Oireachtas and the people who were the subject of that report, namely, the survivors and those involved.

While this optimism is tinged with caution, it also brings with it a sense of anticipation and a feeling of hope.  This is particularly so for SME&rsquo;s across the country.  These small and medium enterprises, SMEs, will form the backbone of Ireland&rsquo;s recovery from the combined impact of the Covid pandemic and Brexit.  In every corner of Ireland these businesses have shown a remarkable ability to challenge and overcome the obstacles they have faced.  Failure to do so is not an option for them.  The shared strength of every SME is their fierce determination to survive and succeed.<\/p>  <p>  Before this pandemic, 250,000 SMEs were a major source of jobs and enterprises.  A significant number are in retail, hospitality and in the service industry.  They operate small enterprises that collectively support the economy in urban and rural areas.  Their day-to-day running is dependent on the availability of business services.<\/p>  <p>  Since the start of this pandemic, in addition to their inability to trade due to Covid restrictions, several of these businesses have seen the demise of banking services in their local areas.  This was a major blow to many of them who were dependent on daily or weekly dealings with the banks.  This blow was somewhat softened by news that post offices would offer limited banking services.  Now, due to the failure of swift and urgently required action at Government level we learned on Tuesday that the post office network is on the verge of collapse as their appeal for help has gone unheard.<\/p>  <p>  This is not a new story.  This has been roaring down the tracks at us for many months.  Postmasters have been warning of looming closures for a long time.  They have repeatedly cited 1 July as the date by which Government assistance could save them.  They have constantly questioned when the additional range of Government services promised in 2018 would come on stream.  The fact that the provision of offline Government services is still being considered three years later has done nothing to help post offices as they stumble towards disaster.  Now, with less than one month remaining, the writing is on the wall and a crisis is looming.<\/p>  <p>  Of the 920 post offices across the country, 875 are operated by independent postmasters.  From 1 July they face a reduction of an average of 20% in payment rates.  This will render their businesses unsustainable.  This will, in their own words, result in the \"unrestrained closures\" of post offices.  It has now become a battle against the clock for survival.  An emergency meeting of postmasters is likely to sanction work stoppages.<\/p>  <p>  How has this situation been allowed to reach this point?  Why has the post office network been pushed to the wire at a time when the recovery of our State is centre stage?

It is little remarked, but it should be said more often in this House and in other places, that small and medium enterprises account for more than half of all employment in all parts of the State.  More people work in small and medium enterprises in Ireland than in the multinational sector and the public sector combined.  This is why the Government has put so much effort into assisting them through this pandemic in the past year.<\/p>  <p>  The House will be aware that An Post is a commercial State body with statutory responsibility for the postal network and postal services.  Decisions relating to the size, distribution or future of the network are matters for the company.  It is longstanding Government policy that postal services should be delivered by An Post on a commercial basis, or at least a break-even basis, and not be subsidised by the taxpayer.<\/p>  <p>  An Post is continuing to undergo a vital transformation as part of its strategic plan.  To implement this plan, the cost of which is some &euro;150 million, the Government provided a long-term low-interest loan of &euro;30 million to the company in December 2017.  This was to support and protect the renewal of the post office network and the continued fulfilment of the five-day-a-week mail delivery service.  The subsequent deal agreed between An Post and the Irish Postmasters' Union in 2018 centred around a renewed vision for the post office network, a revised postmasters' contract, and an acceptance that new business lines were required with a focus on financial and new government services, along with capital investment for the renewed and existing offices.<\/p>  <p>  The implementation of the plan has been delayed by Covid-19.  As an essential service, An Post and post offices remained trading throughout the pandemic but they have been affected significantly.  Despite the challenges, An Post reports a strong underlying performance in 2020 and is well positioned to deliver on its strategic objectives on 2021 in future years.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, in consultation with NewERA, is now reviewing a proposal for An Post to support the post office network in line with their plan and we expect this process to conclude shortly.  In addition, the Government established the offline services group in March to explore the potential of a one-stop shop approach to the delivery of Government services and to examine the feasibility of directing more businesses to the post office network.

At this time Ireland is ranked fourth lowest in Europe in digitalisation.  Only 19% of small businesses are considered to be highly digitalised.

I have concerns, however, that I will highlight.  I am sure the T&aacute;naiste will agree that it is currently very difficult to get staff in construction, haulage, hospitality and in many other industries.  Surely the apprentice scheme needs to be escalated and a system put in place.  Industries such as haulage have huge concerns around getting drivers into the future, due to the delays at the ports.  It is the same for other industries.<\/p>  <p>  My next concern is around the 2040 plan.<\/p> <p>The 2040 plan was introduced by the T&aacute;naiste's Government in July 2018.  I want the people of Ireland to know the T&aacute;naiste, and Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party, his coalition partners in Government, are now responsible for 33% of the escalating costs for people in rural housing due to the shortage of materials coming into the country.  I want them to know that Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party are responsible for 33% of extra costs.  Imported goods since Christmas, including steel, timber and hardware goods, have risen by between 30% and 40%.  Rather than stating the obvious, such as that the goods are coming from eastern European countries and we cannot control the prices, start with the obvious.  For example, simplify the process in Dublin Port when bulk goods arrive into Ireland.  There are huge delays in the docks getting general cargo through.  There are four systems that must be dealt with, namely, customs, agriculture, the HSE and Revenue.  None of their systems speak to each other.  Huge delays in the docks cost thousands of euro per day.  Everything is chock-a-block there.  This needs to be looked at as a matter of urgency.  I have spoken on many occasions about the bureaucracy caused by Brexit.  Surely, six months in, we would think there would be a better system in place.<\/p> <p> In his remarks to another Deputy, the T&aacute;naiste said more than 50% of the people in Ireland are employed by SMEs and 37% of people live in rural Ireland.  If the T&aacute;naiste was serious about protecting the SMEs and rural areas, he would have accepted the amendment from the Rural Independent Group but Fianna F&aacute;ll, Fine Gael and the Green Party voted against it.  Now the knock-on effect is 33% more costs for people because of the panic in place to try to get applications in because of the 2040 plan.  If the Government had accepted the amendment tabled by the Rural Independent Group it would have helped with the current chaos.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300023#V00600","speaker":"1499","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622719800,"counter":298,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  In a few months time, provided the virus does not surprise us again, we will be in a very different place as an economy and society.  We will see a really rapid recovery in our economy due to Government investment, pent-up demand and deployment of the &euro;12 billion or &euro;14 billion in savings now in our banks above where we were in 2019.  We will find ourselves in a place in a few months time where we will still have hundreds of thousands of people in receipt of welfare payments of working age but at the same time hundreds of thousands of vacancies in the labour market, particularly in areas such as construction where we need to build so much, from houses to public infrastructure, in areas such as care where we need so many more people to work and in areas such as technology, digital, pharmaceuticals and others.  This will be an enormous skills challenge and the Government is wise to it.  We have 10,000 apprenticeships, 10,000 work placement schemes, 50,000 new education opportunities and a new Department driving the agenda and making sure we match people to jobs and that they have the skills necessary.<\/p><p>With regard to the cost of materials, I cannot accept the Deputy's contention that somehow the Government, Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party are to blame for the rising cost of steel, timber and building materials because it is just not true.  It is an international phenomenon.  It is on the front page of international newspapers, including the <i>Financial Times<\/i>.  The cost of all of these materials has increased throughout the world.  Perhaps delays at the port may be contributing to it in some way and I am happy to look into that and see whether we can improve it but this is very much a global phenomenon.  If the Deputy read the international press he would know this.  Why is it happening?  There are many different reasons.  Government spending is rising throughout the world.  Not just this Government but other governments throughout the world are engaging in a construction boom or building infrastructure and this is driving up the cost of materials.  The disruption of the pandemic has resulted in fewer materials being produced in some parts of the world.  As well as this, there are delays in distribution.  Of course, there is also cheap money.  Central banks are printing money and giving out cheap loans to business and government.  When this happens we have inflation and the price of things that cannot be printed, such as steel, property and building materials, increase.  This is what is happening.  Yes, it is a big problem and if there is anything we can do about it in terms of improving matters at the port we will, but to suggest that somehow it is caused by three political parties in Ireland and that we have the power and influence to increase global steel prices really is absurd.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300024#W00200","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1622719800,"counter":299,"content":"<p>The first thing the Government did wrong was the felling licences, the second was the carbon tax and the third was voting against the amendment tabled by the Rural Independent Group on the 2040 plan, which would have delayed the process of houses.

For far too many people, the basic human need of shelter is not being met through absolutely no fault of their own.  However, it is the fault of the ideologies of Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il, which are wedded to the concept of the market.  We want to address that through this Bill.  Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il have demonstrably failed repeatedly to build the housing our citizens need in the right place, at the right price and in the right quantity.<\/p><p>The crisis is touching every demographic, can be felt across the country and has victims numbering in the hundreds of thousands.  Housing has become too costly, too scarce and the ability to buy a home has become the privilege of too few.  The time has come for radical action and in the absence of the Government taking any such action, it is up to others to step in.<\/p> <p>Today the Labour Party is doing just that.  We are taking radical action by introducing a radical Bill.<\/p> <p> This Bill will tackle land hoarding, end speculation on land and reduce the cost of newly built houses by tens of thousands of euro by doing once and for all something for which many of us have called for many years, namely, implementing the central recommendations of the Kenny report of 1973.  This Bill will give the power to local authorities to compulsorily purchase development land at its existing use value plus 25%, rather than at market value.  Based on data from the Society of Chartered Surveyors and the CSO, we estimate that if implemented, this Bill will reduce the cost of a new three-bed semi-detached house built on a greenfield site in the greater Dublin area by circa &euro;30,000.  By finally implementing the Kenny report, which has been blocked by Fiann F&aacute;il and Fine Gael for 48 years - a length of time that is hard to believe - this Bill will effectively eliminate the ability of land speculators to pocket enormous profits.  A senior counsel has given the legal opinion that this Bill is entirely constitutional so any arguments put forward that it is not do not stand up.<\/p> <p> This is the Labour Party's third attempt to enact the recommendations of the Kenny report, the late Gerry O'Sullivan having previously brought forward a Bill in 1990 and former party leader, Eamon Gilmore, having done so in 2003.  Despite boom, bust and boom again in the housing market, the housing needs of an ever-growing number of people are not being met.  The housing system is one of winners and losers.  The winners are landlords, investment funds, REITs, property speculators and developers, while the losers include the homeless, people on low incomes, first-time buyers, tenants and people with special needs.  This radical land Bill - and it is very radical - will knock tens of thousands of euro off the price of a new build and will also be a big help to people trying to save for a home of their own.  It will eliminate speculation on development land and go a long way towards getting more supply on stream, by hitting land hoarders and speculators where it hurts.  It will also aid local authorities in their work. <\/p> <p> That said, this Bill is not a silver bullet and should not be seen as such.  For legal reasons, a grandfather effect must be included, which means the Bill will only apply to land bought after tomorrow, or from when it is implemented.  However, that is no excuse for delay.  To paraphrase a Chinese proverb, the best time to implement the Kenny report was 1973; the second best time is now.  The National Economic and Social Council recently concluded that the core principles of the Kenny report remain as relevant today as they were in 1973.  Blockages on the supply side include the slow release of land for development.  With excess demand, property developers can control prices and secure supernormal profits in a cartel-type situation.  This Bill is not a panacea but it would be a big step in the right direction and would push land hoarders and speculators to build housing on both the greenfield and brownfield sites they have acquired.  That in itself will release more development land and reduce prices.  Giving compulsory purchase powers to local authorities at existing use prices plus a gratuity of 25% will also make a massive difference in reducing the land cost of newly built units.<\/p> <p> The housing crisis is as bad as it is as a result of political decisions, primarily those of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  We also need action from them to protect renters by freezing rents, as well as building tens of thousands of social and affordable housing units and stopping investment funds from gazumping first-time buyers.  These are all political choices the Government could make but it is refusing to do so.  This Bill is no different.  Given how serious the housing situation is, the skyrocketing rents, the endless homeless crisis and all the other dysfunctions in our housing system, surely the time has come for radical action, and that is this Bill.  The time for implementing the Kenny report is now and that is why I am putting this Bill before the House. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300027#Z01300","speaker":"1610","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622722200,"counter":349,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300028#AA00200","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1622722200,"counter":350,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300028#AA00300","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1622722200,"counter":351,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1622722200,"counter":352,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300028#AA00500","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1622722200,"counter":353,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300028#AA00600","speaker":"1610"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1622722200,"counter":354,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1622722200,"counter":355,"content":"<p>Anois beidh sos 40 n&oacute;im&eacute;ad againn, agus &eacute; tuillte againn.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300028#AA00800","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1622722200,"counter":356,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 1.15 p.m. and resumed at 1.55 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Mental Health During and Post Covid-19: Statements","time":1622722800,"counter":357,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300029#EE00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1622722800,"counter":358,"content":"<p>I thank Members for the opportunity to update the House further on mental health services during and post-Covid-19.  At the outset, it is important to acknowledge that although we are, hopefully, past the worst of the pandemic, we are not out of the woods yet.  When we talk about mental health post-Covid-19, therefore, we should acknowledge that the impact of Covid-19 will be felt for some time to come.  It is also important for me to acknowledge the significant impact the cyberattack on the HSE has had, including on mental health services.  I have remained in close contact with the HSE and I know how hard the staff are working to overcome the existing challenges.  I commend all the staff working across the country on their unwavering commitment in continuing to provide vital mental health services.<\/p><p>I have regularly been here to update Members on mental health service provision.  Delivery and development of such services are underpinned by our policies in this area, namely, Sharing the Vision, and, for suicide reduction, Connecting for Life.  Our approach to the continued enhancement of mental health services is also reflected in the HSE national service plan 2021 and in specific commitments under the programme for Government.  Our national policies set out recommendations to improve the mental health outcomes of our population.  All these together represent the broad framework through which we are moving forward, addressing challenges, implementing policies and developing an integrated response to mental health.<\/p><p>Covid-19 has undoubtedly caused considerable upset and disruption to people&rsquo;s lives, and while we do not yet fully understand the extent this will have on people&rsquo;s mental health, it is acknowledged that a range of post-pandemic mental health and psychosocial challenges are likely to arise.  These may persist for months or years, and will likely be compounded by economic impacts.  The Government&rsquo;s overall focus is on keeping Covid-19 case numbers down and reopening our society and economy while ensuring the safe and effective rolling out of the vaccines.  However, the mental health needs of our people remain a priority, particularly for those already vulnerable to or experiencing mental health difficulties.  Stress, anxiety and low mood have become part of many people&rsquo;s lives.  Many of us, at some stage, have experienced emotional difficulties, including grief, sadness and loneliness.<\/p><p>In response to the pandemic, the broad range of mental health services and supports provided by the HSE, and its partner organisations, were significantly expanded to address the additional demand created by Covid-19.  A range of psychosocial responses were introduced, including self-help supports, which promote positive physical and mental health.  The Keep Well campaign continues to provide practical advice and empower people to maintain and improve their overall well-being.  Digital mental health initiatives were rapidly enhanced to enable services to meet not only current demand, but new and emerging needs.  It has enabled us to continue providing much-needed supports where face-to-face service delivery was not possible.  This includes video consultations and signposting to online counselling, self-help initiatives and other supports.  Face-to-face assessments continue to be provided where remote assessment is not possible or appropriate.<\/p><p>We have also expanded our telephone and texting supports.  E-mental health is now embedded and enables us to offer a blended, more up-to-date mental health service offering to meet evolving demands and circumstances.  Digital mental health has aided provision of seven-day tele-mental health supports, including <i>yourmentalhealth.ie<\/i>, the information line 1800 111 888, the crisis textline 50808 and NGO online supports.  These include one-to-one counselling and group and peer supports delivered, for example, through MyMind, Turn2Me and Silvercloud.  MyMind provides free online counselling, in 15 languages, to people in communities nationwide.  It delivers 4,000 counselling and psychotherapy appointments each month, supported by HSE and Sl&aacute;intecare funding, which has been further extended to September 2021.  As online activity has increased, we have increased capacity to allow for an upsurge in demand.<\/p> <p>Early in the pandemic, the HSE moved rapidly, under public health guidelines, to continue community mental health services to the greatest extent possible, with enhanced digital mental health models adopted for service user and staff safety.  Face-to-face supports continue where necessary and high-support residential placements have continued.  Overall, specialist mental health services, in both community and acute settings, have operated at 85% to 90% of pre-pandemic levels. <br\/><br\/>Vaccination of mental health staff and individuals in long-term residential mental health care, who consented, is complete.  In addition, vaccination of people with mental health difficulties in the community who fall under cohort 4, that is those at very high risk, is complete.  Individuals with mental health difficulties who fall under cohort 7, that is those at high risk, continues to be rolled out. <br\/><br\/>While referral rates were initially below normal, the level of appointments offered and waiting times to access all community mental health services have remained consistent with previous years.  This is despite adaptations to service delivery due to the considerable challenges posed by Covid.  In anticipation of a requirement for increased mental health hospital beds, the HSE has worked with private hospitals on additional acute and longer-term beds to free up public capacity.  Dedicated funding of &euro;13.65 million has been allocated for this purpose.<br\/><br\/>As restrictions are easing and we move into summer, HSE mental health services have planned and are prepared for expected levels of service demands.  The HSE psychosocial framework forms part of this, both now and into the future.  The framework builds on existing psychosocial supports and provides a co-ordinated, consistent and collaborative approach to mental health service delivery at national, regional and local levels.  It recognises the impact of Covid on mental health in all areas of society and aims to mitigate longer term effects while sustainably supporting the psychosocial well-being of both the public and healthcare workers during and beyond the pandemic.<br\/><br\/>The HSE social prescribing initiative is an additional route to providing psychosocial and practical support.  In over 30 locations across the country, partners are offering social prescribing opportunities through many local community activities to support people to improve their overall health and well-being.  Just last week, I announced the phased reopening of day care centres for older people which will have a considerable impact on promoting the mental health of this group of people.  A total of 101 day centres are expected to reopen by the week of 5 July.  More centres will resume later in July and August, with any remaining services that require adaptation works reopening before the end of the year.  Funding will be made available for centres that require adaptation works. <br\/><br\/>Youth mental health is a critical issue and I assure the House that this continues to be a priority area for me and the Government.  The pandemic has been hard on our children and young people.  Schooling has been affected and physical, social and mental health difficulties are becoming more apparent.  There are currently 13 Jigsaw sites nationally, with the fourteenth due to open to referrals in Thurles this July.  As a national organisation, with increased capacity across its online supports, the services of Jigsaw can now be accessed from anywhere in the country.  It offers much needed advice and early intervention to our young people and their families. <br\/><br\/>Underlining the Government&rsquo;s commitment to mental health, budget 2021 saw an increase of &euro;50 million bringing the total budget to over &euro;1.1 billion.  This does not take account of additional funding allocated to mental health in other areas of the health system or through other Departments such as Justice, Education and Social Protection.  The new funding allocated this year will allow for implementation of many of the short-term recommendations of Sharing the Vision.  It will fund 153 new staff in community mental health services, including 29 posts for CAMHS teams and tele-health hubs, bereavement counselling, employment supports and crisis resolution teams.  Work is progressing in each of these areas.  Similarly, service improvements are being achieved through investment in the national clinical mental health programmes and models of care, such as perinatal, talking therapies and specialist mental health of intellectual disability services.  I am happy to report that recruitment is progressing successfully for many of the specialist posts.  These programmes and models of care facilitate significant milestones in improving access to and enhancing the quality of mental health supports, ultimately seeking better outcomes for people using our services.<br\/><br\/>I am very aware of the increase in numbers and acuity of people presenting with eating disorders, particularly since the start of the pandemic.  I am fully committed to ensuring that the &euro;3.94 million I secured for the national clinical programme on eating disorders is fully invested in 2021.  This will allow for the completion of the three existing specialist teams and the establishment of three new teams.  Significant work on the recruitment of these specialist posts is progressing.<br\/><br\/>We have achieved much in recent years, through new developments and improvements to existing services.  Our national policy, Sharing the Vision<i>,<\/i>will guide and enable us to enhance provision of mental health services and supports across a broad continuum, from mental health promotion, prevention and early intervention to acute and specialist service delivery.  To drive implementation of Sharing the Vision, I established the national implementation monitoring committee.  In addition, the HSE implementation group held its first meeting in May.  A review of mental health inpatient bed capacity will be completed this year through the work of the committee. <br\/><br\/>It is acknowledged that there are aspects of mental health services that require improvement.  However, I remind the House of the enormous amount of work being undertaken to improve our mental health services.  The National Forensic Mental Health Service will relocate to a new purpose-built facility in Portrane and is scheduled to open in the next month or so, subject to ongoing challenges associated with the recent cyberattack on the HSE.  This is a major step forward in providing a world class service to the highest international standards of quality and excellence and to greater numbers of people who need this care.<br\/><br\/>The Mental Health Act 2001 is undergoing a major overhaul and heads of Bill will be brought to Government for approval before the summer recess.  The draft legislation will\u200b give effect to the recommendations of the expert group on allowing 16 and 17 year olds to consent to mental health treatment; the regulation of mental health community residences and services; the involvement of family members and advocates in a person's care, with the individual&rsquo;s consent; the introduction of a set of guiding principles for the care and treatment of people in mental health services; and enhancements to the right to care plans and information for all people receiving inpatient care.<br\/><br\/>Our services continue to work closely with the Mental Health Commission to improve further inpatient residential settings.  Covid-19 has further impressed upon us the need for single en-suite bedrooms and the importance of infection prevention and control.  The HSE has been upgrading facilities, where feasible, to improve residential environments, creating more private, personalised and dignified settings. <br\/><br\/>Enhanced 24-hour crisis services have been called for.  Sharing the Vision makes recommendations for the enhancement of crisis resolution supports, including the provision of out of hours and urgent mental health assistance, building on services already in place.  This is a critical area of service development to which I am fully committed.  The continued development of tele-psychiatry and tele-health solutions, which are already provided through the 24-hour crisis text line and tele-hubs such as CAMHS Connect in the west of the country, are also recommended.  Further funding is secured for CAMHS Connect this year, along with other identified sites.  <br\/><br\/>A sum of &euro;1.4 million has been allocated for the continued development of the Castlerea hub in 2021.  The hub includes CAMHS Connect and a CAMHS day hospital.  The release of funding is imminent and local services have approval to proceed with developments this year.  In 2020 approximately &euro;400,000 was spent on refurbishment and &euro;400,000 on staffing.  Continued investment and implementation of the national clinical programme for the assessment and management of patients presenting to emergency departments following self-harm will also be provided for.<br\/><br\/>As we face continued challenges from the pandemic and its impacts on mental health and well-being, it is important for us to recognise that the majority of people will be able to manage many of the difficulties that they may experience in the short-to-medium term through low-level supports.  However, some will experience distress over a longer period after the immediate crisis has passed and a minority will require more specialist input.  To address this, we will continue to provide sustained psychosocial responses to effectively manage the overall well-being, resilience and mental health of our population.<\/p> <p>I wish to repeat my thanks to the House for keeping us focused on our citizens' mental health and well-being during and post Covid, and for reminding us of the first class service everyone deserves, and for which we continue to strive to deliver.  I also want to thank again the many front-line workers, healthcare workers and voluntary partners, whose tireless dedication and commitment have helped us reach where we are today, on the cusp of reopening our society and economy.<\/p> <p> While a range of post-pandemic mental health and psychosocial challenges are likely to arise, a negative mental health outcome for our population from the pandemic is preventable if we respond to the challenge in a cohesive manner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300029#EE00200","speaker":"1614","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622723700,"counter":361,"content":"<p>Last night the Government rushed through legislation that will impinge on people's civil liberties.  I was waiting to speak on amendments I put down that would repeal Part 5 of the Mental Health Act 2001, which allows mental health tribunals to be reduced to one-member, paper-based tribunals.  This legislation was introduced to reduce the amount of personal interaction between relevant persons in order to prevent the spread of Covid-19.  Since this legislation was introduced there have been 755 mental health tribunals and not one of these tribunals has had to use the emergency powers.  There was no need to extend these emergency powers and all the evidence suggests that they are not being used at all.<\/p>  <p>  At the recent Joint Committee on Health meeting, Mental Health Reform stated that the legislation is an infringement of service users' rights.  The Government should be focusing on substantially increasing investment in our mental health services and supports to address the challenges of the pandemic and its aftermath.  Last night's debate was one of the most undemocratic processes I have ever been involved in.  The debate was guillotined, which took away the opportunity for me to ask the questions I had.  For example, what input did the Minister of State's Department have in this decision and why does she think that extending these extraordinary powers was warranted?<\/p>  <p>  We also had an informative meeting of the Sub-Committee on Mental Health this week where we met representatives of the LGBTI+ community.  This is Pride month and I want to send a message of support and solidarity to all members of the LGBTI+ community.  We received a comprehensive report that stated that 93% of LGBTI+ young people were struggling with anxiety, stress or depression during Covid-19.  This was in comparison with 53% of the general population.  These findings are really stark and we need to put in place measures that will positively impact on their mental health and physical well-being.  I ask that the Minister of State read the report and implement the appropriate measures outlined.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State mentioned in her statement that current legislation around the age of consent in accessing or refusing mental health treatment represent barriers to all our young people.  However, there is a specific barrier in which only those aged 18 and over can consent or refuse treatment.  This poses a significant barrier to LGBTI community again.  I acknowledge the Minister of State's commitment to amending the Mental Health Act 2001.  On mental health, this creates circumstances for LGBTI young people wherein their access to mental health services is dependent on their willingness to share their needs with their parents or guardians.  As research has demonstrated, many LGBTI+ young people are not supported in their home environments because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.  This can become a barrier to them obtaining the proper supports.<\/p>  <p>  What really concerned me is that young people in the LGBTI community are still being subjected to conversion therapy as they do not have the legislative right to refuse this draconian practice.  Deputy Mythen and I have introduced legislation to the Bills Office.  The Mental Health (Amendment) Act 2018 might supersede this but our Bill will enable 16 and 17-year-olds to both consent to and access mental health treatment on parity with physical healthcare.  This so called conversion therapy has no place in our society.  It is harmful and destructive and has been condemned and discredited worldwide by institutions such as the UN Committee Against Torture, the European Parliament and the Irish Council for Psychotherapy.  It is plain and simply wrong.  My colleague, Senator Warfield, introduced the Prohibition of Conversion Therapies Bill in 2018.  I call on the Government to act on this legislation to ensure it becomes a reality and to protect LGBTI people of all ages from this harmful practice.  There can be no more delays.<\/p>  <p>  The Sinn F&eacute;in motion that was unanimously passed in this House recently called for an increase in investment in talk therapies.  We called for the removal of the medical card barrier and for additional resources to be supplied to our community-based services to provide this treatment.  I have read the Minister of State's 76-page Model of Care Adults Accessing Talk Therapies report and I have to say it is not worth the paper it is written on.  It is more a staff induction handout pack than a comprehensive report into appropriate access to talk therapies.  The latest figures I have state that there are still over 10,000 people waiting on a primary care psychology appointment.  The vast majority of these are children.  We all know that early intervention is key to people progressing and to stop them from regressing in their mental health.  Of the 10,000 people waiting on primary care psychology appointments, 5,500 are waiting over a year for an appointment.  This is just not good enough.  Can the Minister of State imagine the regression in people&rsquo;s mental health that can happen in a year?  Can the Minister of State imagine the impact this can have on a family over a year?  At the launch of the document in April the Minister of State said the therapies would be accessible and would ensure that everyone gets the right supports in a timely manner.  Over a year is not a timely manner.  We do not need another box ticking exercise.  We need to have the appropriate service in the right place.<\/p>  <p>  Covid-19 has shone a light on the frailties of the mental health services and we have heard that the shortfalls in access to appropriate services have impacted all members of society.  We were in a mental health emergency before Covid and we are now in a mental health crisis.  I acknowledge that the Minister of State inherited problems but she is coming up to a year in office and people are not seeing any significant progress in how mental health supports are provided.  I urge the Minister of State to introduce the three Rs: resource; rebuild; and reform our mental health services.  The Minister of State has a unique opportunity to be able to do this.  She can do the following: allocate substantial investment in our mental health services and supports; create a dedicated lead for mental health within the HSE who reports directly to the CEO; and increase staffing in the HSE adult community mental health teams and in CAMHS to address the unacceptable waiting lists.<\/p>  <p>  There is another thing I would like the Minister of State to do.  She can also mental health-proof decisions made at the Cabinet table.  Every decision that is made has an impact on people's mental health.  If the Government can address the challenges of inadequate income, employment and housing then this would have the biggest impact on positive mental health and quality of life.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300031#GG00200","speaker":"1469"},{"type":"speech","time":1622723700,"counter":362,"content":"<p>The pandemic has had a huge effect on the mental health of our older people.  Over the last year I have spoken to many of the groups that represent and advocate for our older people.  The stories they have told me are shocking.  Our older people have been left behind by this Government.  One older person described their time during Covid as looking out the window waiting to die.<\/p>  <p>  Too much is being left to charities and non-Government groups with little funding offered to them.  The little that is made available can only be accessed by jumping through hoops and wading through red tape.  Many of the groups only exist because of the failure of the Government to provide the vital and lifesaving services that these groups are providing.  I commend the work of groups like Hope(D) in Newbridge which is doing great work with little funding.  The HSE refers people to this group but does not provide funding.  We have spoken about this on many occasions.  Only an hour ago I spoke to Terry in Hope(D) and she tells me that funding is urgently needed for core support.  I ask the Minister of State to even meet these people to talk to them.<\/p>  <p>  I am a member of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight and we heard last week that the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has concerns over the roll out of Sl&aacute;intecare.  This needs to be addressed immediately to make up for lost time.  We need to prioritise in-home care and I appreciate that the Minister of State has mentioned that, which is important.  Increased funding for the home help scheme must be delivered for all older people and we need to simplify the process for our older people to apply for assistance.  I mention forms like the carers allowance application form.  It is 40 pages long.  It needs to be simplified.  It is an onerous task to fill in and it must change.  People cannot fill it out, particularly our elderly people.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to speak about a sensitive matter.  I will not discuss the details here but the Minister of State will know of the case I refer to and I commend Andrew McGinley for his bravery in discussing the matter.  He is calling for a particular change which is a long overdue reform recommendation of a mental health working group from five or six years ago.  Action is needed to allow for patient advocacy.  A family member or a friend who is aware of a person&rsquo;s mental ill health, their full treatment plan and medication can assist the person in coping with the difficulties that this presents.<\/p> <p>I urge the Minister of State to meet with Mr. McGinley, Ms Una Butler and other families to ensure we see a change in this area as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300031#GG00300","speaker":"1588","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622724300,"counter":364,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.  Our mental health service capacity was in crisis before Covid-19 first arrived on our shores.  The pandemic has only further exposed the gaps that exist in our mental health system.  As it stands, more than 2,500 children are waiting for access to child and adolescent mental health services and over 10,000 people are waiting for a psychology appointment through our primary care service.  Can we set an ambition to dramatically impact those waiting lists by the end of the year?  It would be helpful if the Minister of State would outline the Government's plans to change those figures, if nothing else, to ensure that we are not back in the same situation at Christmas.<\/p>  <p>  We are often bombarded with statistics when it comes to waiting lists in our health service.  The numbers are stark but behind them are children and young people who are struggling with anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts, eating disorders and many other health challenges.  There are many stigmas attached to mental health.  I have spoken to a number of young people in recent months.  In some cases I have done so off my own bat and, in other cases, I have been asked to do so.  It is a difficult situation.  Mental health issues often become quite pronounced before a person reaches out to a doctor or someone else for help.  It is good when they reach out and it is the beginning of a process.<\/p>  <p>  In this House, we all know the sheer number of hoops young people need to jump through in order to access services.  We should not be putting bureaucratic or cost barriers in the way of people's mental distress.  It should not matter what door a person walks through, as I have said previously.  They should not have to worry about the convoluted way in which they have to access services, they should simply be able to access them.  The mental health service should be seamlessly integrated and allow different providers to refer patients to the most appropriate service in a timely manner.<\/p>  <p>  In a report into the impact of Covid-19 on the mental health services in Ireland, leading Irish psychiatrists, including the HSE national clinical lead on psychosis, Dr. Karen O'Connor, warned that a \"tsunami of mental health need\" will arise some time after the peak of the initial pandemic.  The report stated the tsunami will persist for months, if not years, and will be compounded by the economic impact of the pandemic.  That is awful.  It is terrifying to think about but Dr. O'Connor is summarising what we all knew at the back of our heads.  We collectively need to plan for this tsunami.  The service is already under strain so one can imagine what lies ahead.<\/p>  <p>  Covid-19 has had a profound impact on the collective mental health of the nation.  I have spoken about that in the past, particularly of its impact on the elderly.  I have two elderly parents and know all about the issue.  It is a very difficult period.  As a nation, we have been experiencing grief since March 2020.  We have lost loved ones.  Friends have been unable to meet one another.  Loved ones have been unable to meet.  We have been unable to mourn properly, something I have experienced.  We have been unable to visit the people we love and I have experienced that.  Our very way of life has changed.<\/p>  <p>  According to research published by the Irish Youth Foundation on Tuesday, 73% of young workers believe that the pandemic will cause serious damage to the long-term mental health of young people in their communities.  The economic impact of the pandemic on those who are already in precarious economic situations has been recognised as something that will impact significantly on mental health.  The Institute for Fiscal Studies has stated that the economic downturn will have significant consequences for people's mental health outcomes in the short term and the longer term.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE clinical lead in psychiatry is warning that a tsunami is coming.  Youth workers are concerned and Mental Health Reform has also outlined its concerns about the impact future strains of the virus could have on our services.  The Minister of State has been warned.  We have had at least four debates on mental health since January in this House.  We cannot keep going around and around here.  We must match our words with action.  It is not good enough that our spending on mental health is only 5.1% of the entire health budget.  I hope the Minister of State will fight in that regard.  She has the capacity to fight to improve that allocation.  Our neighbours in France, Germany, Sweden and the UK allocate between 10% and 13% of health spending to mental health.  Increasing spending will allow for more staff on mental health teams and help to reduce unacceptable waiting lists.  We also need to fund new services that go beyond talk therapies and truly focus on a person-led approach which works far better.<\/p>  <p>  We know what needs to be done to tackle the pressures that exist within the system. We know that the will is there from the health professionals.  Many of us on this side of House are agreed on what needs to be done.  It is time for the Minister of State and the Government to step up to the mark.<\/p>  <p>  I would appreciate it if the Minister of State, in her reply, will give an update on Jigsaw services in my own county.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300032#HH00200","speaker":"1610"},{"type":"speech","time":1622724300,"counter":365,"content":"<p>Those services will be available in July.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300032#HH00300","speaker":"1614"},{"type":"speech","time":1622724300,"counter":366,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for confirming that.

We have a lack of consultants in the area and limited appointments, assessments and treatments.  It is a worry.  I understand that the pandemic has had a big part to play in those limitations but it has also highlighted that these services are urgent and essential.  The Minister of State spoke about funding, which is a big issue.<\/p>  <p>  We must look after our older people.  I am aware that is one of the priorities of the Minister of State and it is important.  We also need funding for our younger people.  Is there a plan to put a programme in place for children and young adults in order to teach them the life skills they will need?  That is important.<\/p>  <p>  If anything, the pandemic has changed the way I see things.  It has affected people.  Surveys have been done that reflect an increase in the numbers of people reporting symptoms of stress, anxiety and depression caused by the pandemic.  What extra supports can we provide for people?  Anxiety, depression and stress are understandably affecting people.  <\/p>  <p>  A campaign, Hello Carlow, launched last week.  It is all about connecting with each other and asking others the simple question, \"How are you?\"  I have spoken to the Minister of State and know how dedicated she is to working on different programmes.  It is important to ask others, \"How are you?\" and get that communication out there.  People should talk and they should know they can go somewhere to talk.  Talking is a part of healing.  I ask that we promote more campaigns like the one in Carlow.  It was great, and I compliment all the volunteers who were involved.  I understand they might look at rolling out the campaign nationally next year.  Will the Minister of State put a programme together to fund national campaigns to encourage people to say, \"Hello, how are you?\" to each other?  Perhaps the Minister of State will come back to me on that.  I know we need to look at funding.<\/p>  <p>  I am concerned that we are going to see a fall-out from the pandemic for years to come.  What can the Minister of State do?  What can Deputies do, working in our areas and working with young people, perhaps through schools?  It is important that talks are delivered in schools.  However, we need something stronger.  Every county needs to put more resources into examining what more we can do to help.  I have no problem volunteering.  We have to be able to talk.  We have to know that we can go into schools or other areas where we can talk.  We can see what we can do.  Perhaps we should work with professionals on that.  <\/p>  <p>  I know how hard the Minister of State is working.  I encourage her to ensure that funding is not going to be an issue for services, going forward, and that we will not be getting phone calls from people telling us they cannot access services.  We must make sure of funding.  Mental health must be a priority in general but especially after a pandemic.  We must put more funding into the mental health sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300032#HH00500","speaker":"1511"},{"type":"speech","time":1622724300,"counter":368,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for being here to have a conversation with us on the issue of mental health.<\/p> <p>I have said it many times before but, as the youngest member of the Oireachtas, I will say this is obviously a very important issue to many younger people across society.<\/p> <p> First, I commend the Minister of State on the work she is doing on her own portfolio.  It has not been easy to deal with that in the midst of a global pandemic and to handle also issues with older people.  Perhaps that is where I will begin; it is an interesting combination.<\/p> <p> I hear an awful lot about the issue of rural isolation from people living across rural Ireland, and it particularly affects many older people in our communities.  Many people also tell me they have a desire to move into urban areas and have access to accommodation, whether rental accommodation or by selling their family homes or, perhaps, if they are living on their own, by selling where they are living and moving into urban areas to be around village communities.  I am talking about places like Cill An Oir in County Cork or Portlaw in County Waterford, in the Minister of State's constituency.  People want to move into those settings to be with other people and tackle the issue of isolation, which is obviously very important across rural Ireland.<\/p> <p> I want to come into the House with suggestions.  I heard much negativity today from the Opposition about the performance of this Government but the reality is that we are dealing with the biggest challenge that has faced this State since its foundation.  We have done a relatively decent job of protecting people's health, livelihoods and their families' incomes.  I am glad the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, is the person in this particular role of dealing with the enormous challenges in front of us.  I know she will do her very best in this area.<\/p> <p> I would love to see a focus being put on people who are hoping to move location from rural Ireland into more urban settings where they will be around the support services in our villages and towns.  The Minister of State could champion this.  It is specific to both areas within her Department as somebody who works on issues facing older people and also on mental health.  Of course, rural isolation comes very much into that.<\/p> <p> Another very important issue is the effect of social media, which can take an awful toll on the mental health of young people.  I grew up in a generation where every young person in the country had access to a mobile telephone or smartphone and social media.  I am probably part of the first generation that was really raised with it from a young age.  It is doing enormous damage to young people's confidence in themselves.  Online bullying is a major contributor to people developing serious mental health issues and, unfortunately, also to suicide.<\/p> <p> It is completely unacceptable that in the year 2021, decades after social media came into play in people's lives, we still have not grappled globally, never mind in Ireland, with how to take on the issue of online bullying with tech giants.  We should work very closely with many of the companies located here to find ways to make social media a safer space for younger people, and deal with the confidence issues many younger people experience because of the pressures of social media.  They are extraordinarily large issues, which cannot be underestimated.  At a European level, the European Commission also needs to show leadership.  The more states that work together on this particular issue, the more progress we will achieve together.<\/p> <p> One interesting point raised by many Deputies, of which my colleague, Deputy P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan, is very much supportive, is the ability to bring people who are working in areas such as sports - many of our famous sports stars, for instance - into schools to give motivational talks to students to help boost their self-confidence in those very early years of their secondary education and throughout.  That is often when people become much more self-aware in terms of their growth and development.  It is also quite a vulnerable age for many students going on to third level.<\/p> <p> Finally, it is important for Government to take up the following message.  I am going to be 24 years old this month; I am 23 now.  Many people I know are wrapping up their higher education at the moment.  The effect of the pandemic on many people's ability to communicate with others or meet up with friends and on their social lives by not being in their traditional educational setting, whether they are in university or in further education, has been hugely damaging.  A major priority of this Government should be to make sure that we can get our students back into lecture theatres and into their tutorials, in person, so they can get the interpersonal experience that third level education is supposed to be in people's lives.  I would be absolutely delighted if we could just get that goal sorted out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300032#HH00600","speaker":"1516","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622724900,"counter":370,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy O'Connor.

She stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tOur mental health system was and is not capable of coping with a surge.  Our system was struggling and close to breaking point long before the pandemic hit.<br \/><br \/>[...]<br \/><br \/>Covid-19 [now] underlines the need to reconfigure mental health services.  We ... [need to finally] put service users at the centre of design and delivery. <\/blockquote>  <p>The World Health Organization recommends that each state spends 12% of its health budget on mental healthcare.  In Ireland, however, it is less than 7%.  Not only has the pandemic caused a whole range of mental health issues, it has revealed the inadequacies of our system.  To be clear, I know that is a system inherited by the Minister of State and not one she created.  In response, though, we need to not only put in place the necessary staffing and infrastructure over the long term, but we also need a temporary investment to deal with the current surge in mental health concerns.<\/p><p>The psychological impact of Covid-19 is intersectional.  People with pre-existing mental health difficulties, healthcare workers, women, young people, people in precarious work or those who are experiencing homelessness are all more likely to have negative effects. <\/p><p>The Irish Youth Foundation&rsquo;s report, Generation Pandemic: Futures Are on the Line, highlights that the pandemic will have a profound long-term impact on the mental health of the young people in disadvantaged communities.  It also points out the knock-on effect that mental health takes on all other aspects of life, including education and employment.<\/p><p>Almost 9,000 children are currently waiting to get access to psychological services in the HSE and more than 2,700 young people are waiting to get access to child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, of whom 98% have been waiting for more than a year.  The impacts of these delays are significant for young people and their families and they require immediate intervention.<\/p><p>Women, especially those in low-paid jobs, have been disproportionately affected.  They have had increased home and childcare responsibilities throughout the pandemic, incidents of domestic violence have risen significantly and the distress of ongoing restrictions in maternity hospitals has taken its toll.  Specific and targeted interventions are needed for the groups most affected.  We need considerably more funding that goes into front-line services to offer targeted and preventative measures.<\/p><p>I really want to raise with the Minister of State the mental health of people with disabilities, which has been under-discussed during the pandemic and in general.  The cessation of many services last year, and ongoing restrictions, have significant negative effects on people with disabilities.  Research carried out by Inclusion Ireland last summer shows increases in loneliness and anxiety for people with intellectual disabilities, as well as an erosion of independence and developmental progress.  In particular, young people with disabilities need structured and dedicated interventions, and studies to assess and respond to their mental health needs as a result of the pandemic.<\/p><p>People with intellectual disabilities often feel invisible and poorly treated by mental health services.  A Vision for Change, which was launched in 2006, set out targets for mental health services.  Almost 15 years later, however, services for people with intellectual disabilities remain at 33% for adults and 12% for children.<\/p><p>I am highlighting disability because the reality is that disabled people and their families are too often neglected by the State.  Ireland was the last country in all of Europe to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  Appallingly, we have yet to ratify the optional protocol, which would enable people to hold the State to account for its failure to realise these rights.<\/p><p>I sit on the Joint Committee on Disability Matters and the reports we have received from Departments have been beyond appalling.  They were so disappointing and unsatisfactory that I barely have the words.  They lacked basic sufficient detail to understand the issues on different scales and to provide accountability.  One Department actually considered a single page response to the committee to be sufficient.  This is indicative of the way the State views its obligations to people with disabilities.  This requires a fundamental change in the way people with disabilities are treated, not only in terms of mental healthcare services but in all services across all Departments.<\/p><p>Our mental health services need sustained strategic development.  We need to bring spending up to the levels required and to tackle the surge in issues raised by the pandemic.  Simultaneously, the Government needs to address many of the underlying causes of mental distress.<\/p><p>Mr. Martin Rogan CEO Mental Health Ireland highlighted that the pandemic has revealed:<\/p><p>... underlying tensions and ... fragility that ... [many Irish people] live with ... strained social bonds, overstretched families ... insecure housing ... long commutes, inadequate childcare provision, drug and alcohol misuse and financial uncertainty.<\/p><p>To tackle the mental health crisis, we require proper State interventions that provide fully funded mental healthcare as well as sufficient housing, funded childcare and workers' rights.  Only then can families and communities be assured the Government is taking mental health seriously.<\/p><p>Finally, I would appreciate if the Minister of State could give an update on the disgracefully low number of inpatient beds for people with eating disorders.  There are currently only three HSE beds for such patients.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300033#JJ00300","speaker":"1525"},{"type":"speech","time":1622725500,"counter":372,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy O'Donnell.  I echo the sentiments of Deputy O'Connor that there is nobody better placed than the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, to take up the challenge in regard to mental health.  She has a great track record on these issues and I hope, in the years to come, she can put her stamp on the Department.  As she said in her opening statement, we are not yet fully aware of the true extent of the impacts of the Covid crisis on our mental health as a society.  Different people have been affected in different ways and people have different resilience thresholds.  The true impacts might not be felt for years to come.  Nevertheless, we all recognise the glaring difficulties Covid has put before us.  There is a whole host of challenges that need to be met.<\/p>  <p>  In a recent Am&aacute;rach Research poll, 80% of the youth workers polled confirmed that the pandemic is having profound long-term effects on the mental health of young people.  For second level students who are doing the leaving certificate and other examinations, for example, the added stress of the pandemic is clearly demonstrable and a cause for concern.  The same is true for third level students, who have also faced many challenges.  They have not had a conventional third level experience and that needs to be considered when we are devising appropriate responses for that sector.<\/p>  <p>  As a member of the Oireachtas education committee, I am aware of the issue of bullying, including cyberbullying, to which a number of speakers referred.  The Ombudsman for Children and other representative bodies called recently for the presence of psychotherapists in schools.  It is not necessarily the case that a psychotherapist would need to be assigned full-time to every school.  We could have a system where, in the different regions, a number of professionals would be identified to go into a number of schools and meet the most vulnerable and at-risk students and seek to address their needs.  This is something on which the Government really needs to focus.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy O'Connor mentioned the technology giants, including social media companies, and the role they can play in addressing cyberbullying.  Many multinational companies in this country are very good at this type of engagement in the various industries in which they operate.  They play a large role in terms of corporate responsibility and giving back to the communities in which they are located.  The Government should look to engage with Facebook, Twitter and other companies in regard to their corporate responsibilities.  Cyberbullying is increasing at a dramatic rate and everybody in this Chamber has suffered abuse on social media at one time or another.  That type of bullying is very prevalent among younger people.  Speaking on a personal level and in a local context, I have seen the ill effects of cyberbullying on younger people in a school setting.  Unfortunately, in some cases, it can have the gravest of consequences by contributing to people self-harming and taking their own lives.  We need to put a challenge down to the social media companies and other technology giants that they have a corporate responsibility role to play in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  My final point concerns the mental health of older people, which is part of the Minister of State's brief.  I want to raise a specific issue on which she may be able to work with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  Throughout the country, there are elderly people living in large houses who may not want to go into any type of service, but want to downsize and live in a community with other older people.  A number of people in my constituency are currently involved in a couple of planning applications to provide that type of accommodation.  However, they are facing difficulty because of An Bord Plean&aacute;la's density thresholds.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la is suggesting they need to comply with the same density requirements that apply for regular housing units.  That baffles me.  We are talking about purpose-built retirement settings and the people involved should not be held to the same standard as house builders and developers.  I would appreciate if the Minister of State would take that issue into consideration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300034#KK00100","speaker":"1521"},{"type":"speech","time":1622725500,"counter":373,"content":"<p>I spoke on this subject a number of weeks ago and I asked to speak on it again today because it will be a hugely important issue into the future.  We probably will be living with Covid indefinitely.  It is like no other pandemic that has gone before.  Covid is going to be on the horizon in some shape or form, possibly for the rest of our lifetimes.  Lockdowns will potentially be required at different times.  Life is not going to be as we once knew it.<\/p>  <p>  When it comes to mental health services, there must be a basic trust that an adequate level of service will provided, but the service also has to be Covid-proofed.  I have a number of questions for the Minister of State in this regard.  Is the national mental health policy document, Sharing the Vision, Covid-proofed?  I understand a national implementation monitoring committee has been established to oversee the putting in place of measures set out in the document.  However, people need to sit down and think about what else is needed in a world where we have ongoing lockdowns, with people unable to attend day care centres, for instance, or schools and colleges.  I prefer to talk about mental well-being as distinct from mental health.  Sharing the Vision is the blueprint for mental health services delivery and it must be Covid-proofed.  The implementation monitoring committee should be involved in that effort, just as it is key in ensuring national policy is implemented.  The HSE's Covid-19 psychosocial response framework will also form part of this work.<\/p>  <p>  As a Deputy for Limerick city, I have seen the impact of Covid across all age groups and sectors.  I have seen it at first hand in my own family, as we all have.  It has affected people in college and school, in particular, as well as elderly people living on their own.  We need to have different dimensions to our response.  Sharing the Vision is the founding document in terms of how we are going to shape the future of mental health services delivery in this country.  I ask the Minister of State to set up a policy group to ensure it is Covid-proofed.  Everything we do from now on must recognise that we are living in a world with Covid.  It is now generally acknowledged that stamping the virus out completely may not be on the horizon for a long time, if ever.  We need to adapt to the Covid world in which we live and that brings different dimensions with it.  For people working from home, for example, a lack of social interaction may be an issue.  As I said, I would not even regard this as an issue of mental health but, rather, one of mental well-being.  Many employers are now telling their staff they are not to work in their bedrooms and must dedicate another room in the house for working.<\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, I have a very straightforward request for the Minister of State.  Sharing the Vision, the national mental health policy document, and everything else to do with mental health services provision within the HSE and the Department of Health must be Covid-proofed.  I would like a commitment from her that this work will get under way and we will see a revised policy document published.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300034#KK00200","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speech","time":1622725500,"counter":374,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy Martin Kenny.  When Covid struck, the country went into firefighting mode because we were battling a threat about which very little was known.  Decisions were made and restrictions imposed that have affected every man, woman and child, with impacts on emotional, mental and physical health.  While it is understandable that very difficult choices had to be made, it is regrettable that so few measures to address the impacts of the restrictions were put in place.  With a reduction in services, existing gaps in the system were made even wider and many people found themselves falling through them.  Now that society is in a position to reopen gradually, the job ahead of us is to look at the impacts the restrictions have had on people and how to address them.<\/p>  <p>  Throughout the crisis, Sinn F&eacute;in has warned that measures needed to be put in place to deal with the impacts of the restrictions on people's physical and emotional well-being.  In many instances, the Government failed to do this.<\/p> <p>In the months since the restrictions began, I have regularly brought to the attention of the D&aacute;il, the HSE and Government Departments issues of particular concern that members of the public have contacted me about.  Children and adults with special and complex needs were particularly affected.  Many of their routines were broken and social outlets were cut off for many.  This caused regression in some people and distress for their families but the response was slow and inadequate.  We had to fight for the introduction of the summer provision last year, yet when it was finally introduced it did not get to everybody.  For many, the challenges they were already facing have become even more challenging and much work is going to have to be done to address the regression that has taken place.<\/p> <p> Only recently I raised one particular situation in which a young man with special needs from County Tipperary found himself suffering because he could not access the day centres that were so important to him.  He was also affected by the cancellation of local sporting activities which were a very important outlet for him.  His mental and emotional welfare suffered considerably but the reduction in services, coupled with already long waiting lists, have meant that over four months after his family started seeking a psychology assessment he is still waiting.  Despite attempts from the Opposition, contingency plans to deal with the fallout of the restrictions and the anxieties that were increased due to Covid were not thought out properly.<\/p> <p> All people, no matter their background, who have found themselves in situations where their mental health needs were put on hold are now going to need greater attention and more accessible supports.  Similarly, this applies to people who have lost loved ones in the course of the pandemic and were unable to grieve properly.  Many people whose businesses were affected or who were in a grim financial situation are going to need help.  Domestic violence increased.  Many people are likely to have found their ability to escape abuse has been limited because Covid has limited their options so much.  This week, the Irish Youth Foundation shed light on how investment in youth services is important in providing counselling and enhanced intervention supports.  Extended absences from school and long periods of isolation and a lack of structure are a particular concern for the long-term mental health of young people and must be addressed.<\/p> <p> Earlier this week, I welcomed the planned reopening of day centres for older people.  It is an important milestone for those who suffered considerable isolation.  We now need certainty that the physical and emotional needs that have built up since the onset of the pandemic will be recognised and provided for.  It is therefore crucial that funding for the adaptation of centres is accompanied by increased availability of mental health staff, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and other support workers our older people will need in order to address their mental and physical health needs.<\/p> <p> The WHO has said that 14% of a country's health budget should be set aside for mental health.  At 5.2%, we fall way short of this and the 10% minimum pledged under Sl&aacute;intecare does not live up to that standard.  The Government must meet this standard because Covid will be with us for some time and so will the impacts of the measures needed to deal with it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300034#KK00300","speaker":"1613","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622726100,"counter":376,"content":"<p>We are all very conscious of the mental health services and the poor provision in place before Covid even came along.  Very many people were struggling to get assessments and services and to have a sense of continuance and a sense that services was going to be there for them in the future.  That is a legacy the Minister of State has inherited.  I know she is doing her best to try to cope with it under difficult circumstances.  I have spoken to her about CAMHS in counties Sligo and Leitrim and some improvements have happened there.  There has been recruitment and I acknowledge there has been progress made, which is very welcome.  However, there are a whole lot of other services where there is a similar absence of ensuring people are looked after.<\/p>  <p>  I recently spoke to the mother of a young man who has very serious difficulties with drug addiction and addiction problems in general.  He has been diagnosed with mental health issues which are probably a consequence of his past drug abuse.  When he goes into the service, he gets looked after for a short period of time and then he is put back into the community in a rural house in the middle of nowhere.  He has no backup there.  There is a little piece missing here in the service.  That piece is to provide for people like that, who probably do not need to be in a long-term psychiatric institution but, at the same time, are not well enough to go out and live on their own in the community.  I am referring to a type of sheltered accommodation that was available in the past, up to 15 or 20 years ago.  However, with the drive to put everyone out into the community, that was taken away.  That has been a real problem and needs to be re-examined.  Not just where I am in the north west, in Sligo and north Leitrim, but across the country I am sure one will hear similar reports of people who unfortunately find themselves in this gap where there is no service for them, other than perhaps a mental health nurse calling once or twice a week.  That is just not enough, given the state of mind people in this situation may be in.  They have families who are very concerned and worried about them.  I ask the Minister of State to look at that issue in particular.<\/p>  <p>  On the question of what needs to be done around positive mental health, I am thinking of the responsibility of the social media platforms from which many young people get their lead in life and where they do much of their communication.  What we would normally have done in the past by getting together and talking to people, they now do online on their phones.  While that may be a negative in some senses, perhaps we can try to find a way of turning it into a positive.  There could be messages going out through those platforms which would reinforce people's positive mental health and do something to reaffirm their value in the world and in life in general.  We must examine how the Government can work with these platforms which have got very bad press, and deservedly so in many cases.  There is an opportunity here for them to do something to redress that.  The Government should try to engage with them and try to make progress in respect of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300035#LL00200","speaker":"1607"},{"type":"speech","time":1622726100,"counter":377,"content":"<p>I want to focus on children and young people in the context of the public health emergency we have gone through.  It has had a terrible effect on that cohort.  This week's report from the Irish Youth Foundation, Generation Pandemic, paints quite a stark picture of disadvantaged children and the pandemic.  One aspect of the report relates to children and young people who have fallen out of the school system and probably fallen out of groups they would have had.  Usually when that happens - not always but sometimes - they fall in with darker forces in society.  Those darker forces will educate them, but in a different way.  They will use them, abuse them and normally use them for criminal enterprises.  That is obviously compounded by the fact that the things young people gravitate towards were generally suspended over the pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  Social inequality is one of the greatest detriments, if not the greatest detriment, to anybody's mental health.  If a person who lives in poor housing is in a situation where inequality is compounded, it can be extremely difficult for their well-being and health.  That is one thing we must address.<\/p>  <p>  Since 2010, the cuts to youth services have been enormous although they have been addressed over the last couple of years.  That has had a hugely detrimental effect on communities that engage with young people.  It is important not to malign or alienate young people.  We must be very proactive with them.  We must be positive with them because sometimes society is very negative about young people.  It makes it seem like young people are the cause of everything.  We were all young people at one time and we all did certain stupid things we probably regretted in later years but that is the whole idea of growing up.  It is important we give the positive aspects of well-being.  There is an issue around young people who fall through the cracks.  All the systems they have are gone.  It is really important for the Government to address that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300035#LL00300","speaker":"1565"},{"type":"speech","time":1622726100,"counter":378,"content":"<p>The leaving certificate exams begin next Wednesday.  This is the most stressful set of exams done by second level students, by young adults, anywhere in Europe.  I challenge any Deputy in the House to dispute that assertion.  It is all the more difficult when young people have been forced to prepare for those exams, and now sit them, during a global pandemic.  I am certain there are hundreds of students who are only going to be able to get through the stress of these exams thanks to medication and I would not be at all surprised if the real figure was in the thousands.  That is not the way young people should be prepared for leaving school and going out into society.  The Studyclix survey of 2019 polled nearly 3,000 students and found 75% of them reporting severe stress over the course of the leaving certificate cycle, with 35% suffering insomnia and 28% suffering depression.<\/p> <p>The Government decision not to release exam results this year until 3 September does not help and it is not conducive to students making calm choices about college courses.

Since being first elected to the D&aacute;il in 2016, this is something I have fought hard for.  At that time, Deputy Helen McEntee was the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health and we were told we would have the facility in a couple of months.  As with the changes to the fair deal scheme that the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, introduced to the D&aacute;il a couple of weeks ago, she has delivered again with this project.  I know she has put much work into it and I appreciate that this service will open in July for referrals.<\/p>  <p>  Early intervention is absolutely essential when dealing with mental health and the Jigsaw project in Tipperary is a cornerstone in building mental health services in my county. I appreciate the work of the Minister of State and the officials in getting this delivered.  We had many hiccups along the way and Covid-19 did not help in trying to meet targets.  However, we are there now and we look forward to Jigsaw playing a key part in a mental health strategy for Tipperary.<\/p>  <p>  We have a centre for Thurles but we will now look for hubs to open in both Nenagh and Clonmel.  It is an essential part of the Jigsaw service that should be around Tipperary, which is a very large inland county.  We need hubs in both Clonmel and Nenagh so services can be readily available to all our young people.  I know the Minister of State will deliver on this and I very much look forward to that.<\/p>  <p>  The size of my county leads me to my next point, which is the lack of psychiatric hospital beds in Tipperary.  There are no such beds in a county of our size.  I have spoken about this many times in the D&aacute;il but, unfortunately, we are being blanked by the HSE.  We are told there are sufficient beds in the south east or mid west, depending on whether a person is in the north or south of the county.  We are told by the HSE that the ratio of mental health hospital beds for the areas is sufficient but there are no beds in Tipperary.  When treating people with mental health issues, it is essential they are close to their families.  People in the north of the county would have to travel to Ennis while people in the south would have to travel to Kilkenny and it is not possible to have the interaction they need with families to help bring about a good outcome for mental health problems.<\/p>  <p>  I earnestly ask the Minister of State to get the HSE to re-examine this matter.  We are not asking for a huge number of beds.  We want a small number of psychiatric beds to cover north and south Tipperary.  If we are to have a proper mental health service in Tipperary, psychiatric beds must be a cornerstone.  The Minister of State has delivered Jigsaw for us in Tipperary and I earnestly ask for her to deliver those psychiatric beds for us as well.<\/p>  <p>  I will speak about third level students, and I am thankful they will return to campuses in September.  The leaving certificate results will come out in the first week of September and pupils will probably be two or three weeks later going to university.  They have had a very hard time with Covid-19 and the availability of services to them on campuses this year will be extremely important.<\/p>  <p>  We must have major investment in mental health supports in third level institutions right across the country.  There are students in third level institutions in my county who have spent the past year studying from home.  From dealing with student unions, the message is clear that they need far more counselling services on university and third level campuses, especially in-person counselling services.  Face-to-face counselling is absolutely essential to these young people.  They have sacrificed much during the pandemic and the past year and a half has had a major impact on them.  I hope there will be extra resources for this area as they will pay dividends in the long run.  Getting in with early intervention for these students could prevent major mental health problems for people in future.<\/p>  <p>  I will also speak about people who have experienced mental health difficulties through the pandemic.  Unfortunately, many people, through no fault of their own, have suffered financial difficulties and they are suffering mental health issues because they are under extreme pressure.  We must get the message to them to seek counselling or seek help.  Many people have been very successful in hospitality or tourism areas, or the many other sectors that have been badly affected, such as taxi drivers or track bookmakers - the list goes on - and they had their livelihood taken from them because of Covid-19.  It was nobody's fault but as a result, people's mental health is under much pressure.<\/p>  <p>  These are people who never knew what it was not to have resources to pay bills coming in through the door.  For the past year and a half they have not had any income to meet outgoings, and this has put them under major pressure.  We must get a message to these people that there is help and counselling available.  They should go their local GP to get access to those services.  It is a very important message to get out.<\/p>  <p>  We have spoken about loneliness in older people who have had to self-isolate.  Unfortunately, this is not just confined to rural areas and we saw the same in urban areas as well.  The pandemic has compounded loneliness for many people.  Older people need access to services and help.  Loneliness is a major issue and after cocooning, there must be an effort to get people into the habit of going to day care services or meeting people.  Older people can go into themselves so it is very important to get them to avail of the services for them.  Work must be done to ensure there are day care and other services for older people so we can get them participating in society again.  They have had a year and a half of sitting at home and insecurity may have set in with many of these older people, meaning that going out again takes effort.  We must help them do that and these services are so beneficial to them.<\/p>  <p>  There has been no way to have a traditional Irish funeral or an ability to mourn.  Unfortunately, many older people have lost partners in the past year and a half and a lack of social interaction, including meeting family and friends, has had a great impact on people.  That will bring its own mental health challenges as well.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State has delivered for Tipperary and my home town of Thurles.  I recognise that and welcome it most heartily.  Nevertheless, there is still much to do in Tipperary.  We lack mental health services in the county and as I have said many times previously in the House, we need psychiatric treatment beds.  We do not want the HSE telling us we meet ratio requirements for the mid west or the south east.  We want those beds in our own county.  For people to get the best benefit from mental health services, it is essential that they stay close to their family.  That cannot happen in Ennis or Kilkenny for the psychiatric patients from Tipperary.  I know the Minister of State will do her best for us in Tipperary and I appreciate that but these psychiatric treatment beds are very important to us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300036#MM00200","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speech","time":1622726700,"counter":381,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her statement and I will focus my contribution on the e-mental health hub in Castlerea in my constituency, which replaced the former Rosalie dementia care unit for older people.  I raised the funding issue in this Chamber three weeks ago after replies from the HSE to me confirmed funding for the e-mental health hub in Castlerea was not provided this year.  I have confirmed this with the head of mental health services, who indicated that funding was provided last year to recruit four staff members but this year funding was not given either to keep those four posts or fill the remaining posts.  Funding at no stage was given for the psychiatry of later life element of the service.<\/p>  <p>I welcome that the Minister of State has acknowledged that &euro;1.4 million will be allocated for the continued development of the Castlerea hub.  The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, has said that the release of funding for this is imminent and I would really like to know when this funding will be made available and what exactly will the funding cover.  I hope the Minister of State will acknowledge that it is shame it has come to this.  This funding should have been put in place last June.  I appreciate that works had to be carried out but I wonder why funding was provided for four posts last year and not be continued to pay for those posts this year.  They have not been funded at all.  We are now into the month of June.<\/p> <p> The Minister of State referred to a child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, Connect service and a CAMHS day hospital, but made no reference to the psychiatry of later life, which is a key element given what was lost with the closure of the Rosalie unit.  Older people who called it their home were moved from here to there and to different nursing homes across Roscommon and Galway, even though a Government commitment was made that those residents would be allowed to see out the rest of their days in that home.  This was a really devastating and cruel blow to the people of Castlerea, to the people who called the Rosalie unit their home, and to their families.  Added to that blow was the fact that it has been replaced by a service that has not been funded.  One year later we are now talking about &euro;1.4 million half way into the year.  There is no excuse.  This was hailed as really transformative for mental health for young people and for older people, which is a really key demographic in counties such as Roscommon where we have an older population.  It is especially key given that, sadly, dementia is a growing issue.<\/p> <p> On the &euro;400,000 given for staffing expenditure last year, to which the Minister of State referred, why was that funding not retained this year?  I cannot understand that.  It is disappointing.  The service was hailed and opened with great fanfare - I was at the opening - and was a fantastic project.  It was really well done, but when it is not funded it is no good at all.  It has not served people the way it should have.<\/p> <p> Mental health services for young people and for older people are absolutely critical and they are as much needed in counties such as Roscommon and Galway as they are anywhere else.  Will the Minister of State please confirm, in writing or otherwise, when this &euro;1.4 million will be allocated and what it will actually cover?  Will she also tell the House about the psychiatry of later life element?  This is very important, given the loss of the Rosalie home to the people of Castlerea and to the County of Roscommon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300036#MM00300","speaker":"1604","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622727300,"counter":383,"content":"<p>Covid-19 has wreaked havoc on the psychological well-being of many in our society.  In many cases it has been indiscriminate to age, gender or financial standing.  We have all had to accept the necessity of business restrictions and lockdowns at the early stages of the pandemic but the effects of constant isolation, financial pressures, sickness, and loss has taken a significant toll on many of our population.  As we try to navigate our way out of this pandemic the resulting full psychological impacts are only starting to become apparent now.<\/p>  <p>  Pre-Covid Ireland had an acknowledged deficit in many areas of psychological assessment.  One of the most topical remains the psychological assessment of children with early learning disabilities.  Sadly, that deficit is also extending to adult evaluations.  We do not have, nor did we ever have, adequate psychological and counselling supports in the public system to cater for or meet that need.  Where the services exist they do not have the capacity to cater for the more serious psychological problems that now exhibit far more frequently.<\/p>  <p>  Parents are trying to access onward learning and disability services and they are waiting months and years for psychological assessments and for approvals to enter learning disability care pathways.  The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth continues to not recognise private psychological evaluations for learning spectrum disorders, which can be provided within weeks.  Instead, we force patients to wait to access the public list even though waiting times can extend up to two years.  This fundamental deficit must be challenged and changed radically in the State, given the extraordinary moneys we are currently spending in Covid support in other areas.<\/p>  <p>  Psychiatric services are also at breaking point.  In my city of Waterford, the Minister of State will be aware that there is no seven day psychiatric access and no on-call service at weekends in University Hospital Waterford, UHW, and the only possible admittance at weekends to the psychiatric department is via the emergency department with a referral.  Even with this we have no child psychiatry services or beds available at UHW.  This requires child patients to transfer to Cork, which adds to the trauma for many parents and children arriving into their local hospital after some psychological event.<\/p>  <p>  Staff recruitment and retention in the psychiatric services has long been a problem, both in UHW and nationally.  It is exacerbated by the increased clinical waiting lists, the extended workloads, the lack of available follow-on beds, and the recurring nature of psychiatric illness.  We are also seeing significant amounts of anxiety and depression in our older age cohorts who have been forced to isolate away from family and friends for months on end.  Those currently in hospital still suffer restrictions on family visiting times.  This is despite the fact that nearly all hospital staff are now vaccinated.  Despite the opportunities of identifying possible infection risks by using antigen testing in hospitals to screen visitor infection, the HSE continues to avoid any implementation of antigen testing that could resolve this issue.  This remains a dark stain on the reputations of many of those charged with leading our national medical response to Covid.<\/p>  <p>  We are also seeing a dramatic rise in the number of people who are becoming overwhelmed by the financial pressures due to Covid, which is leading to increased anxiety, depression and suicide.  There is a significant body of people, most privately or self-employed in the State, who have fallen through the cracks in terms of receiving adequate or any State support to preserve their businesses and occupations, as restrictions have forced them to cease operations.  If ever there was an example of disparity between the public and private sector pay divide, it is now most clearly evident in the treatment of the situation that many in the private sector find themselves, when their livelihood and financial reserves have been wiped out.  Meanwhile, they look at those of us publicly employed who have suffered no disruption to our income because of Covid.  Such inequity does much to harbour rage and anxiety, and it challenges self-esteem, which leads to chronic depression and mental trauma.<\/p>  <p>  The rise in social media activity is also creating esteem and addiction issues.  Consider the recent evidence of post-traumatic stress being suffered by social media moderators.  The rise in online gambling is destroying family incomes.  Image and body shaming narratives are polluting young and vulnerable minds, leading to a lack of self worth, eating disorders, suicidal ideation and sometimes suicidal acts.<\/p>  <p>  If Covid has taught us anything it is the need for people to be with other people.  It demonstrates the brittleness of the consumer society we have been building for many years, which has left so many people isolated and alone in its wake.  We are not out of Covid yet, but we must begin a new national conversation that seeks to enhance life in all its stages, that seeks to include all differentiation, that seeks to value that which we had forgotten and have only recently rediscovered, namely, the understanding that we are all vulnerable yet invaluable, and that we are all in this together.  For our society and people to prosper, all must be included and all must be supported.  Community must be at the heart of the future political decisions we take as we try to heal and rebuild from Covid-19.<\/p>  <p>  On the new public strategies and reopening from Covid, we have not mentioned resilience anywhere in the back-to-work schemes in the context of new business improvements.  We need to look at this and build a resilience component across all Department policies over the coming months as we try to frame a narrative to leave this pandemic behind us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300037#NN00200","speaker":"1616"},{"type":"speech","time":1622727300,"counter":384,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for the work she and her Department are doing in dealing with the whole challenge around mental health services.  It is important to pay tribute to all the staff in all our facilities in the State for their dedication and commitment during this particularly difficult time due to Covid-19, and their ongoing work in dealing with the new demands.<\/p>  <p>  We are coming from a situation where over the period from 2012 to 2020, the budget for mental health increased by 46%.  It shows that we were coming from a very low base.<\/p> <p>A lot of work is still to be done in this area.  The number of people working in this area has increased, with more than 10,400 whole-time equivalents now.  It needs supports and the increase in staff needs to continue.  The CAMHS programme is extremely important in dealing with young people.  It is also about having a team effort.  If one part of the team is missing, it is very difficult to operate.  In Cork, one element of a CAMHS team was missing and young people were not able to gain access to the care they needed.<\/p> <p> In 2018 and 2019, a number of facilities were identified by the Mental Health Commission as having major challenges.  These were St. Loman's in Mullingar, a facility in Drogheda and Carraig M&oacute;r in Cork.  What I find disappointing with regard to Carraig M&oacute;r in Cork is that on 1 May there was a District Court hearing.  The HSE is challenging the Mental Health Commission's requirements.  It is wrong that we are spending money in a court process challenging the Mental Health Commission on the clear set of advice it set out on what needs to be done.  It is wrong that taxpayers' money is being used in this way.  There are 18 patients in the facility.  It is outdated and it should be about trying to find a solution rather than going through a court process.  I ask the Minister of State for the issue to be taken on board mutually to make sure all facilities are brought up to the standards required.<\/p> <p> I know of a facility, which is not in Cork, where during the pandemic there were 27 patients.  There were six residents per room and nine of the 27 people died in a two-week period.  This caused a huge challenge for staff, management and everyone involved because the facility is out of date.  It is important that we prioritise updating the facilities and making sure we have an adequate number of staff and that they have adequate facilities to work in.<\/p> <p> With regard to people working generally in the HSE, we need to put in place additional supports.  Many staff working in the hospital sector have had a very difficult time over the past 18 months.  We need additional supports for them to make sure we do not have people having to opt out of the healthcare system because they do not have the adequate supports they need to deal with the many difficulties they had during Covid-19.  I ask that this is taken on board.  I thank the Minister of State and her staff and everyone working in healthcare for their work over the past year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300037#NN00300","speaker":"1523","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622727900,"counter":386,"content":"<p>A number of months ago, I was contacted by a GP in Wicklow who wanted to let me know about the difficulties she was experiencing in trying to refer patients for mental health services.  Following this contact, I organised a meeting with a representative group of GPs in Wicklow.  Across the board, all of the GPs expressed the same concerns to me on the availability of psychiatry and psychology services in Wicklow across the cohort of services for adults, children and people with intellectual disabilities.  Each one of them spoke about referring child and adult patients that had come to them.  People who were referred were not seen or there were massive delays.  Patients returned to GP surgeries having not been seen with a condition that had worsened.  This was very worrying for the doctors and we can understand this.  They are limited in what they can do in referring people to these services.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware this situation predates Covid and it predates the Minister of State taking up her role and I do not blame her for it.  However, it is a very serious situation.  I have no doubt that during the past 18 months more pressure has been put on these services and on GPs.  Huge pressure has been placed on every aspect of the HSE.  I have listened to Deputies relay stories from their constituencies and I can see it is an issue throughout the country.  One of the questions I asked the GPs at the meeting was whether they thought it was a systemic failure or a failure in Wicklow.  They did not know the answer.  I wondered whether it was an issue in CHO 6 and CHO 7.  I contacted the Department on this issue.  I acknowledge that the Minister of State and I have had a number of conversations about this.  I also acknowledge her office put together a comprehensive report on the queries I had raised with regard to Wicklow.  I accept the difficulties experienced because of the cyberattack.  I thank the Minister of State for the time she has given me on this.  I look forward to receiving the report.<\/p>  <p>  I look forward to being able to go back to the GPs in Wicklow and say that the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, is on top of it and knows what needs to be done.  I understand she has had a number of meetings.  I look forward to being able to return and say there is a solution to this, whether it is recruitment in psychiatric and psychology services to clear the backlog, and then have a system that functions properly whereby people will be seen in a timely manner.  As we know, with every medical condition, whether mental or physical health, timely and early interventions give a better outcome.  The longer we leave something run, as people are experiencing on these very long waiting lists, the less likely there will be a good outcome.  I thank the Minister of State and I wish her luck with her work.  I ask her to pass on my thanks and gratitude to all of her staff and the HSE for the work they have done over the past 18 months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300038#OO00200","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1622727900,"counter":387,"content":"<p>In 2006, the HSE published A Vision for Change for immediate implementation.

The unit should be broken down into 20-bed units, with 24-hour health community teams that work weekends as a backup to the crisis team.  This would mean a fully operational 24-hour crisis unit.<\/p><p>I pay particular tribute to our volunteers who work on Limerick Suicide Watch and the Limerick rescue group.

This year's budgeting being only 5.2%, we face a major crisis - a deeper crisis than we realise.  I acknowledge the fantastic work done by so many organisations which are trying to plug the gap left by the HSE.<\/p>  <p>  We have to get the HSE services up to standard.  They are really lacking and of a very poor standard.  There are not enough mental health services run through the HSE and we need to make sure that we see more Government initiatives in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  Jigsaw is fantastic.  Also, accessible counselling, a new counselling service in Tullamore in my constituency in Offaly, run and developed by Mr. James O'Connor, who was one of only five community heroes chosen by Axa which is an outstanding achievement, is doing fantastic work.  Were it not for these great community leaders we would be in an even worse state than we are at present.<\/p>  <p>  I am very concerned about people self-harming.  I put parliamentary questions in to the Minister for Justice and I was shocked to learn that more than 14,000 people have been engaging in self-harm or harming others due to mental illness since 2018.  That is a shocking figure.  In 2020, I believe the figure was 5,750.  It shows the scale of the problem we face.  Rather than let it get into a worse state, we need to put measures in place.  Certainly, funding has to be increased.  We have to see the HSE rolling out better services and more psychologists and psychiatrists available to people.  It is serious.<\/p>  <p>  I will end on a positive note.

PCRS staff cannot see the status of cards and they do not have any indication of when this will be accessible again.<\/p><p>This morning, I mentioned this on Questions on Promised Legislation.  I raised this issue with the T&aacute;naiste and welcomed his confirmation that GPs can apply for medical cards to be renewed through their offices.  The T&aacute;naiste said though that it &quot;is not something we particularly encourage&quot;, but admitted that these are exceptional times.  The T&aacute;naiste said he would raise the matter with the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, and that a circular would be sent around to GPs to remind them.  Many GPs do not even know that they can do this.  It would be interesting to know whether there needs to be a communications campaign around that.  GPs are overworked but we must ensure blockages in the process are cleared.  My office was advised in relation to emergency medical cards that GPs can do them through their system.

That is the reason I am using this time but it is directly related to mental health.<\/p>  <p>  According to the Health Service Executive website, all existing panels for psychologist staff will expire on the go-live date of the panel created on foot of the new recruitment campaign.  This is a considerable change to the panel system that was there.  Panels existed in theory for a year but often they were extended for three years.<\/p>  <p>  The issue is that the people on the existing panel have not been notified of this change.  Of course, the HSE is saying that the cyberattack is the reason for not notifying people.  As a result, many psychologists on existing panels do not know that they need to apply for the new panel.  This is the point.  It is time sensitive, as the deadline for applications for the new panel is Tuesday next, 8 June.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, due to the cyberattack, only hard copies of applications will be accepted.

Improving the provision of Traveller-specific accommodation is something which I, as Minister of State, and my Department are taking very seriously.<\/p> <p>The State's response to the provision of Traveller accommodation must be improved.  Since being appointed to this role, I have been fully committed to taking all necessary actions to deliver those much-needed improvements.  As the Minister of State with responsibility for Traveller accommodation, and as a father of two young children, I want children and families to have access to good-quality and sustainable accommodation as a basic human right.  I was pleased to see that local authorities made use of all funding available for Traveller accommodation in 2020.  This was the first time in six years that the budget was fully spent, showing the drive and commitment in the Department to ensure that resources were both allocated and spent in this regard.<\/p> <p> I will briefly outline the structures in place for the provision of Traveller accommodation.  In accordance with the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998, our 31 local authorities have statutory responsibility for assessing the accommodation needs of Travellers and the preparation, adoption and implementation of multi-annual Traveller accommodation programmes, TAPs, in their areas.  The Department's role is to ensure that adequate structures and supports are in place to assist local authorities in providing such accommodation, including a national framework of policies, legislation and funding.  I have identified some local authority areas where spending remained low in 2020 and I have raised concerns in this regard with the relevant chief executives.  It is accepted that more work needs to be done to increase the provision of Traveller-specific accommodation and I have made local authorities aware of the &euro;15.5 million in capital funding available in 2021 to support this.  In addition to that capital funding, my Department provides funding to local authorities for specific Traveller accommodation-related supports, such as social workers' salaries and the management and maintenance of halting sites and group housing schemes.  We pay 75% of the salaries of caretakers employed by local authorities to maintain halting sites and group housing schemes, and 90% of the salaries of local authority social workers whose work is dedicated to supporting Travellers in obtaining accommodation.  In 2021, &euro;5.8 million has been made available for these types of support.<\/p> <p> In recent years, the process of assessing capital funding has been simplified for local authorities through the removal of the allocation system.  Instead, local authorities can apply to officials in the Department's Traveller accommodation support unit for funding on a case-by-case basis as needs are identified.<\/p> <p> Accommodation for Travellers is provided through a range of options, including standard local authority housing, which is financed from the Department's capital allocation for social housing, and Traveller-specific accommodation, which is funded by means of 100% capital funding from the Department.  Accommodation is also provided through private housing assisted by local authorities or voluntary organisations, private rented accommodation and own resources.  Travellers can opt for any form of accommodation and local authority TAPs that are intended to reflect these preferences.<\/p> <p> The assessment of housing needs carried out by local authorities points to a general preference among Travellers for standard social housing rather than Traveller-specific housing and halting sites.  The results of the 2020 social housing needs assessment revealed that 1.7% of households had a requirement for Traveller-specific accommodation.  It is anticipated that this requirement will be addressed in the TAPs, which cover the five-year period from 2019 to 2024.  This preference is also noted in the findings and recommendations of the expert group's report, which are being considered currently.<\/p> <p> In specific circumstances, the Department is open to funding the acquisition of standard housing for Traveller families using the Traveller-specific capital provision.  Approval for the purchase of these homes must be obtained from the Department's Traveller accommodation support unit prior to any purchase.  Certain criteria apply to applications of this type, including clearly identified needs and an outline of what alternatives were considered and why they were deemed unacceptable.  These applications are considered on a case-by-case basis, but I assure the House that all reasonable acquisition proposals will be approved.<\/p> <p> Each year, local authorities undertake the annual estimate of accommodation of Travellers, formally the annual count, on the last Friday of November.  It provides a useful indicator of the housing situation of Traveller families and can be used to track changes in the position year on year.  It is important for the Department and local authorities to have this information.  Due to level 5 Covid restrictions still being in place at the end of last November, the count was instead carried out on the first Friday of December.  The latest data available from the 2019 annual estimate identified 5%, or 529 families, living on unauthorised sites; 17%, or 1,804 families, living in authorised Traveller-specific accommodation, that being, 9%, 952 families, living on halting sites and 8%, or 852 families, living in group housing; and 18%, or 1,919 families, living in private rented accommodation, representing a decrease of 246 Traveller families compared with 2018.  A total of 45%, or 4,934 families, were known to be accommodated in standard local authority housing provided by or with assistance from local authorities or approved housing bodies.  A total of 933 families, or 9%, shared accommodation in overcrowded situations.  The 2019 estimate identified that 6% of Traveller households provided accommodation from their own resources.<\/p> <p> Before coming to the steps that my Department and I have taken in recent months regarding Traveller accommodation, it would be remiss of me not to mention the disproportionate negative impacts that Covid-19 has had on many vulnerable people in our society, including members of the Traveller community.  Since the start of the emergency, the Department has worked closely with local authorities in an effort to implement preventative measures on all Traveller sites, both official and unofficial, regardless of their designation.  In doing so, local authorities have put together a number of temporary arrangements to provide, for example, services to previously non-serviced sites, facilitating better sanitation and social distancing.  Additional measures being funded by my Department for the duration of the Covid emergency include extra toilets, running water, additional mobile accommodation, space where there is overcrowding, extra refuse collection, access and egress on sites and additional units, either mobiles on site or houses elsewhere, that will allow for self-isolation and quarantining.  These measures will remain in place for the duration of the emergency at all times.  Local authorities have been advised to utilise all necessary resources to make sites as safe as possible.  Post pandemic, local authorities will be asked to provide permanent facilities where possible to replace temporary facilities supplied during the emergency.<\/p> <p> In addition to these measures, and working in conjunction with the HSE and local authorities, a Covid-19 preparedness checklist was developed to strengthen preparedness and infection prevention and control in authorised and unauthorised Traveller halting sites and local authority Traveller-specific group housing schemes.  The checklist was intended to be a toolkit for local authority action by identifying areas that may require additional supports during the pandemic.  Just over 250 halting sites were audited for Covid preparedness and a list of deficiencies and a checklist of works were prepared for each individual site.  This resulted in an investment of over &euro;4 million in improvements to site conditions last year.  My Department will continue to make funding for improvements available to local authorities throughout 2021 to make conditions on sites safer regardless of the sites' official designations.<\/p> <p> I wish to outline some initiatives that I have taken in recent months.  I received my delegation order last November.  It specified that I would have responsibility for Traveller accommodation.  Since then, I have been working hard to identify and implement key measures that I believe will effect real change in the short to medium term.<\/p> <p> First, I am pleased to confirm that we have received sanction from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to proceed with the revised caravan loan scheme, which we will roll out on a pilot basis to four local authorities.  This scheme has the potential to make a difference to the living conditions faced by Traveller families.<\/p> <p> Second, with effect from January of this year, the funding that I have made available to local authorities for the management and maintenance of halting site bays has been increased by 50% per bay per annum.  This is a long-overdue increase, as I understand that there has been no change in the amount that local authorities could recoup since 1997.  This significant budget increase means that local authorities will be able to increase substantially the work that they carry out on sites to ensure that resources are available when needed.<\/p> <p> Third, the review of local authority social workers and personnel employed to assist Travellers with their accommodation needs was published recently.  It is an important piece of research and has been sought for many years.  I am considering the report and the recommendations therein.  The Department funds 90% the salaries and expenses of social workers who are employed in each local authority to work and assist Travellers in moving from unauthorised sites to Traveller-specific accommodation or to support them in securing sustainable tenancies.  It is important that Travellers be supported directly from the ground up by local authorities.  Local authority social workers act as a point of contact to carry out this vital role.<\/p> <p> I will outline the most important measure that I have activated since taking on my role, that being, the Traveller accommodation programme board.  The 2016 programme for Government committed to the establishment of a special working group to audit the delivery and implementation of local authorities' TAPs and consult with stakeholders on key areas of concern.<\/p> <p>The commitment was underpinned in a 2016 housing policy statement, Rebuilding Ireland.  The Housing Agency commissioned a report on behalf of the Department.  This report was known as the TAP review and was an independent review of capital and current funding for Traveller-specific accommodation for the period 2000-2016.<\/p> <p> On foot of the publication of the review in 2017, the national Traveller accommodation consultative committee, NTACC, advised the Minister to establish an independent expert group to review the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998 and other legislation that impacts on the provision of delivery of Traveller accommodation.  The terms of reference for the Traveller accommodation expert group were drawn up in consultation with the NTACC.  The then Minister of State tasked the expert group with putting forward recommendations and proposed actions to improve the delivery of Traveller accommodation.<\/p> <p> The expert group completed a comprehensive review and a report was published on the Rebuilding Ireland website in July 2019 and contained 32 recommendations.  Delivery and implementation will require input from several areas within my Department, as well as other Departments, local authorities and external stakeholders.  Extensive stakeholder engagement formed part of the major work of the expert group and included consultation with Traveller representative groups, local authority officials, councillors and other relevant interest groups, including the Irish Council for Social Housing, the Housing Executive in Northern Ireland and the Traveller-led culturally appropriate approved housing body CENA.  Therefore, the recommendations have been reached through significant research, debate and agreement from all stakeholders with significant hands-on experience in the field.  I am keen to make full use of the expert review and have already been able to establish some recommendations.  For example, a review has been concluded regarding the arrangements in place within the Department for the provision of the refurbishment of Traveller-specific accommodation.  A new process is now in place.<\/p> <p> The Department is working with CENA, which is the approved housing body dedicated to providing Traveller specific solutions.  For the first time, the capital assistance scheme, CAS, funding stream is being used by CENA for Traveller-specific accommodation.  The CAS funding scheme is available to approved housing bodies whereby they can avail of 100% of funding.  The Department has also consulted with the CSO and is offering assistance to ensure Travellers will properly be represented in the next census, which has been postponed due to the Covid-19 pandemic.<\/p> <p> To ensure this report is utilised and the maximum number of recommendations are implemented, I have established a programme board to oversee this.  The programme board consists of representatives from national Traveller organisations, local authorities and my Department.  The programme board has agreed and adopted its own work programme for 2021.  Some 11 projects have been established under the board and it will consider 18 of the 32 recommendations contained in the report this year.  Eoin O&rsquo;Sullivan is chair of the programme board.  I have attended meetings and signed off proposals that emanate from the board.  This programme board will be a key vehicle to deliver change.  We are basing our work on the excellent research, we have a list of recommendations, we have relevant stakeholders at the table, and we are working constructively to implement as many recommendations as possible.<\/p> <p> This week, for instance, we signed off on the submission to include a Traveller identifier on social housing forms.  I have advised members of the programme board that I operate an open-door policy.  If they feel their issues are not being addressed or if there are any barriers to achieving the explicit aims of the board, I am happy to discuss these issues and action them where necessary, in consultation with the board.<\/p> <p> In relation to the No End in Site report recently published by the Ombudsman for Children's Office, OCO, officials from my Department are in ongoing communication with the relevant local authority to provide the necessary supports and that the OCO&rsquo;s recommendations are implemented in timely manner.  Regular meetings have been taking place since 2020 between the local authority and my Department officials.  In response to the report, I have requested a full report from the local authority in question outlining its implementation plan, and I expect this imminently.  I will follow up with an in-person meeting on site with the local authority upon receipt of this plan.<\/p> <p> The conditions reported on this site, which I accept are replicated to some extent on a number of sites throughout this country, are absolutely unacceptable.  I assure the House that this is receiving my full attention and that of my Department, and that it is prioritised within the Department.  I was shocked to read about toddlers and children living in such terrible conditions, to the point that their environment was damaging both their physical and mental health, through no fault of their own.  As a Minister of State, as a Deputy, as a father and as a member of society, I cannot condone or allow this.  I will make every effort to ensure these specific actions are taken to address the report.  The onus is on all of us as stakeholders to improve the conditions.  This can be achieved through goodwill and working with the Department and the programme board.<\/p> <p> In conclusion, I reiterate my absolute commitment to improving the supply and the standard of Traveller accommodation in this country where necessary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300039#PP00800","speaker":"1595","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622729700,"counter":398,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, for his opening remarks.  The failure of the State, both local and central, for decades, if not for generations, to adequately meet the needs of our Traveller community is a scandal.  It is probably the worst and most scandalous element of our failing housing system.  In every county and constituency there are Traveller-specific sites which can only be described as Dickensian in terms of the conditions adults and children are forced to live in every day.  Likewise, the increased difficulty Traveller families who want to access private rental or general social housing have in accessing that accommodation is disproportionately worse for them than it is for other sections of society.<\/p>  <p>  Nobody should be shocked by the contents of the Ombudsman for Children&rsquo;s report, No End in Site.  That does not mean we should not be appalled and outraged.  There is nothing in the report that those of us who make it our business to go to Traveller sites in our constituencies do not see regularly.  In fact, only a number of years ago a collective complaint was taken against the State to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.  The State was found to be in clear breach of Article 16 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  In a recent update from a month ago, the European Committee on Social Rights confirmed that the State still has not rectified that breach.<\/p>  <p>  I have always argued that we must deal with this on a cross-party basis.  I acknowledge the good work done by the Minister of State, Deputy English, when he was in the same position as the Minister of State, Deputy Burke.  He worked well with the Opposition and the Oireachtas housing committee, and I hope that continues.  However, what is frustrating many of us, and I suspect the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, shares this frustration, is the incredibly slow pace of the review process.  The Department commissioned a review by Michelle Norris, which was published in 2017 on foot of, among many things, the appalling deaths of ten adults and children in Carrickmines the previous year.  This led to the expert group with its 32 recommendations, but that was in 2019 which was two years later.  It is two years on from this in 2021 that the programme board has been established.  None of that is a criticism of the current Minister of State, I want to make that clear, but it is an indication of the slow pace of change.<\/p>  <p>  We do not have a dedicated principal officer in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, driving the work of the programme board, and that is a fundamental flaw.  I appeal to the Minister of State to make the case for a dedicated stand-alone principal officer to this work.  I also appeal to him to publish the quarterly updates on the implementation of the programme board&rsquo;s work on the Department&rsquo;s website, as well as sending it to the House, so we can track how progress is made quarter-on-quarter.<\/p>  <p>  What I did not hear from the Minister of State - perhaps he will come back to it in his concluding remarks - are the things that remain with the Minister.  They are the very significant emergency legislative requirements that the expert group outlined.  It has recommended clear changes, albeit temporarily, to deal with Part 8 planning permissions in local authorities and section 183 land transfers.  Until we see those changes in legislation enacted, I do not believe the substantive issue of increased provision of new, good quality and culturally appropriate accommodation for Traveller families will be addressed. <\/p>  <p>  There will need to be legislative change whereby we can add an addendum to the Traveller accommodation programmes that were approved by local authorities in 2019, so that they will have a legally binding implementation timeline in order for us to see, year-on-year, what is and is not being done.  We must have an oversight mechanism, notwithstanding the changes to Part 8 and section 183 that the expert group recommended.  In the case of a manager refusing to fulfil her or his statutory responsibilities, we must have an independent oversight to step in and fix the problem.  Whether that will be the responsibility of the Office of the Planning Regulator or some other section, we will wait and see.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the fact that last year, as the Minister of State said, was the first time in seven years that the full budget was spent.  Much of that money was spent on Covid-19 emergency measures, and that was necessary, but I also urge him to do something I urged the Minister of State, Deputy English, to do.  Alongside the quarterly social housing pipeline reports, which show us what is happening with social housing quarter-on-quarter, we should include an addendum in the report, so that we have a Traveller-specific accommodation pipeline report quarter-on-quarter.   I assure the Minister of State that the Opposition will work with him on this, just as we did with his predecessor.  We are an ally in implementing those recommendations, but all of us must speed up the pace of change.  If he does that, he will certainly have an ally in our party.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300041#RR00200","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1622730300,"counter":399,"content":"<p>Last week, the Ombudsman for Children published a scathing 72-page report into the conditions in which children are living at the Spring Lane site in the heart of my constituency.  It is a site with which I am familiar and I have tried to do a lot of work on this issue in the past.  Spring Lane was originally opened in 1989 as a ten-bay halting site but it was overcrowded from day one as 16 families originally moved in there.  This goes to the heart of Cork City Council&rsquo;s mismanagement of the site from the very beginning, as it allowed it to expand rapidly to the point that there are now 38 families with 66 children living there.  Around 140 people share toilet and washing facilities designed for 40.  Eoin English published a detailed article in the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>this week on the various actions and reports that have been undertaken on Spring Lane.  I commend the work of people like him and journalists in <i>The Echo<\/i>, who alongside the Traveller Visibility Group in Cork have highlighted the issues on this site time and again over the last number of years.<\/p><p>This issue not only affects the residents of the site but the mismanagement of the Spring Lane site affects the entire community and people right across Ballyvolane.  In 2011, Cork City Council recognised that something needed to be done.  Instead of working with Traveller representative groups, residents of the site and the local community, it brought forward a proposal to expand the site into Ellis&rsquo; Yard.  This was opposed by everyone, including the local community, Traveller representative organisations and the Travellers living on the site.  It would have led to increased segregation and would not have resolved the structural issues with the site.  An engineering report in 2012 found that drainage issues led to the formation of a large lagoon made up of water, raw sewage and human excrement that could be seen clearly at the edges.  The report stated that this not only posed a risk to residents' well-being and health but was hazardous as people could drown in it.  In 2013, an extensive independent review was published with a comprehensive roadmap for improvement which would have seen the site closed by now.  However, that report has lain idle since its publication.  In 2014, Joe Horan published 21 recommendations to improve the site.  Ultimately this too led to few improvements, with Louise Harrington from the Cork Traveller Women&rsquo;s Network saying the report failed because of a lack of outcomes.  The European Committee on Social Rights has also highlighted concerns over conditions on the site as a result of legal action taken by Pavee Point and local residents in conjunction with the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC.<\/p><p>Alongside these reports, residents on the site have worked to highlight the conditions in which they are living.  The residents won the Traveller Pride community work award in 2016 for their campaigns on the site and for launching their own manifesto for improvement.  It is clear that the residents of this site, and the wider local community, have been failed time and again.  Instead of working to build relationships and reduce stigma, Cork City Council has left residents living in squalor by failing to maintain and manage the site correctly.  This has led to increased tensions within the community and surrounding areas.  It has also negatively impacted those living on the site and created divisions between residents and the wider community.  The blame for this lies solely on those who have either worked against, or looked away from, efforts to make improvements.  Children have described rats running up walls and being unable to make friends in school because they were always dirty due to the unkempt walkways and passageway on which they had to travel.<\/p><p>I spoke with Cork City Council&rsquo;s chief executive on Monday and discussed the recommendations in the report with her.  She has given a commitment to implement them.  The Ombudsman for Children has also said he will follow up on these recommendations.  There is much more I could say about this site and the failures but the one point I want to make is that every child in this State is equal and it is not acceptable for any child to live in these conditions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300042#SS00100","speaker":"1453"},{"type":"speech","time":1622730300,"counter":400,"content":"<p>I will pick up on the final point Deputy &Oacute; Broin raised, which was the spend of central funding moneys for Traveller accommodation.  It took a unique global event such as this pandemic for the full allocation of central funding to be spent.  This disease impacts the old, the vulnerable, the poor and those who live in the most cramped conditions and because of that, the money was spent.  However, in 2019, 14 local authorities drew down zero central funding for Traveller accommodation.  In 2018, there was an overall underspend of 48% by local authorities on Traveller accommodation.  While there was a full drawdown last year, let us see what happens this year, next year and the years after.  Will we have changed as a political body, at national and local level, and shown we really care about solving the crisis in Traveller accommodation?<\/p>  <p>  It is a crisis.  The word \"squalor\" is not being used frivolously here.  Deputy Gould mentioned the reports in the media over the last few days about the site run by Cork City Council.  From 2019 up to when I was elected to this House, I was chair of the Traveller accommodation committee in Fingal County Council and visited sites myself.  Some were official and some unofficial but they were all sites that housed people and were homes for them.  The conditions in some were absolutely appalling.  It is hard to reflect that in any article, descriptively written as they may be.  Experiencing the conditions in which citizens in our State are living is something that has to be done in the first person and it is something one will never forget.  Those conditions have to change.<\/p>  <p>  Today we have dedicated 100 minutes to statements on Traveller accommodation.  We are not discussing legislation or actual, real change.  We are making statements, setting out a few positions and saying what we would like to see but what we would like to see is real change.  We need leadership in this House and across parties, because it is a cross-party issue.  We need leadership at local council level as well.  We need leadership when it comes to developing county development plans and identifying sites.  We need leaders in the local community to stand up to ensure we identify sites that are more than adequate - are good - and that they follow through with good plans for sufficient and safe housing that is culturally appropriate for the community.  We need leaders within our local authorities and I have worked with leaders within our local authorities who want to see that happen.  We need leaders in both in the Traveller and settled communities to fight for this change, believe in it and tackle prejudices because we all know the pressures that are applied when any plans for Traveller housing emerge, be they real plans or part of a county development plan coming down the line.  As public representatives, we have to stand up and be counted, whether that is in a local authority, a county or city council or, indeed, in this House.  Deputies cannot come in here and say one thing and then put out leaflets and make representations saying the opposite.  We have to stand up to be counted for those who are most vulnerable and who are living in the worst conditions in this State. <\/p> <p>We will move on from media inquiries.  If we ever resolve this issue, there will be national inquiries, given the levels of deprivation in which people in our State are living.  There is no excuse for this situation, apart from a lack of political will and leadership at all levels.  That must change at all levels and across all parties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300042#SS00200","speaker":"1564","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622730900,"counter":402,"content":"<p>&quot;It&rsquo;s like an abandoned place that people forgot about, it&rsquo;s like we&rsquo;re forgotten, we feel like garbage.&quot;  That was the testimonial of a 12-year-old girl interviewed for the recent No End in Site report published by the Ombudsman for Children's Office.  What struck me most when reading the report was not so much its shocking content, but just how familiar it all sounded.  Indeed, it could have been one of many possible sites across the country.  In 2015, I attended the funerals of some of the victims of the Carrickmines fire tragedy.  The heartbreaking grief was utterly overwhelming.  The 2016 report from the chief fire officer stated that conditions on the site referred to in the report of the Ombudsman for Children's Office posed an &quot;unacceptable risk to life due to the proximity of the homes and an overloaded electrical system&quot;.<\/p><p>I honestly believed at the time that those ten lives lost in Carrickmines would shock us all into finally dealing with the dangerous living conditions that many Travellers endure.  As the calls for action and investment dissipated, however, and the media attention waned, so too did that sense of urgency.  It is now time to bring back that sense of urgency.  Unhealthy and dangerous accommodation is a material risk to the lives, health and well-being of Traveller families in Ireland today.  This much we know.  However, if we are to address this problem, as I know the Government is committed to doing, we must recognise that the issue of Traveller accommodation cannot be viewed in isolation.  It is part of a wider suite of challenges faced by the Traveller community and we must look at the whole picture and not just one piece.  While accommodation is a key part of this issue, the full picture also involves life expectancy, mental health, women's health, child welfare, educational attainment and job prospects.  Part of this picture as well are systematic discrimination and racism, culture and unique heritage and the diminishment and loss of those things over generations.<\/p><p>For the Traveller families I know in my community and for Traveller friends, there is a weary acceptance that little, if anything, will ever change.  That is a narrative which has been passed down through generations.  Every now and again there is a breakthrough, like when we celebrate a Traveller woman going on to earn a doctorate.  However, these events are all too rare.  We have the opportunity to change this narrative, but first mindsets must be changed, mindsets that can be entrenched in outdated ways of evaluating outcomes, outdated practices which have simply failed and outdated thinking that sometimes views the Traveller problem as just that, a problem.<\/p><p>Much of the ongoing accommodation, social, health and economic crisis within the Traveller community has its origins in the report produced by the Commission on Itinerancy in 1963, which considered Travellers as &quot;people of no fixed abode, [who] habitually wandered from place to place&quot;.  The commission's objective was to assimilate Travellers into the settled community so that they would eventually disappear from our roadsides and then our collective consciousness.  The commission concluded that all Travellers should settle and that &quot;absorption [was] the only real solution&quot;.  The subsequent Housing Act 1966 set out a 20-year legal duty for the State to provide accommodation for Travellers.<\/p><p>Restricting their room to roam and nomadism contributed to a loss of culture, identity, heart, head and soul.  The report of the Travelling People Review Body in 1984 gave due recognition and consideration to nomadism, but conceded that the element of habitual wandering had largely disappeared.  However, as is the case with all ethnic minorities globally, such interpretations and subsequent policies fail all of society.  Alienating and marginalising a group of people creates a &quot;them&quot; and &quot;us&quot; binary which serves nobody.  Isolation engenders intergenerational resentment and hurt and over time becomes normalised and acceptable to most.<\/p><p>The programme for Government commits us to ensuring that the housing needs of the Traveller community are met by local authorities and that existing funding is fully drawn down and utilised, among other measures.  I commend my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, for his commitment to improving the provision of good standard Traveller-specific accommodation.  I commend him and all those involved in the effort to ensure that local authorities made full use of the funding available for Traveller accommodation in 2020.  That was the first time in six years that the budget was fully spent.  I thank the Minister of State as well for his work in making &euro;15.5 million in capital funding and &euro;5.8 million in supports available in 2021.  I also commend my colleagues, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, for their work in addressing accommodation issues and in helping to support vulnerable families throughout the pandemic.<\/p><p>Officials in my Department worked hard to put in place a range of supports to alleviate overcrowding and get families through the worst of the crisis.  A recent call by my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for communities, Deputy Joe O'Brien, for new community development projects and his ongoing commitment to participation based on community development principles is a welcome step forward towards animating Traveller organisations to work at an autonomous level.  The Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, is working closely with Traveller development organisations towards furthering initiatives concerning social inclusion and a human rights-based approach to addressing inequality and discrimination.<\/p><p>For my own part, as someone who has worked closely with Traveller families and organisations over many years, I was always mindful that we were not telling the full story of the Travelling people and that young Traveller boys and girls may be losing part of their identity through shame or generational loss of the oral tradition.  Traveller culture is steeped in folk traditions, including in music, song, storytelling, language and crafts, which are distinctive to Travellers but also part of our tradition and heritage.  We would have lost many of our songs and tunes were it not for the Doherty, Rainey, Furey and Doran families, as well as other families.  The craft of tinsmithing is slowly dying out, with just a few practitioners remaining in the trade.  I am proud to have some of James Collins's handcrafted mugs in my office.  This heritage should be celebrated and not hidden.<\/p><p>I was delighted to work with the Heritage Council late last year to advance the idea of a Traveller heritage officer as part of the wider heritage officer programme.  Our Department supported the initiative through the addition of funding in budget 2021.  I am delighted to be able to say that the inclusive heritage officer post will soon be filled.  Part of the remit for the holder of that post will be to work with the Traveller community to promote, archive and pass on its rich traditions, and also to foster a wider understanding and appreciation among the whole community.  We will see some of the flavour of this endeavour during Heritage Week 2021.<\/p><p>It is my belief that we collectively as a nation must engage in meaningful dialogue between settled and Travelling people.  Recognition by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann of Travellers as a distinct ethnic minority with its own culture, values, language and ways was an important first step, but we must complete that work.  First, it should be utterly unacceptable to force families to live in squalor, to live with rats and in cold damp trailers, where children must trawl through mud to get to school.  Meeting the basic needs of families and children must be a priority for all of us.  After that must come a clear commitment from the Departments of government and agencies to invest in addressing the root causes of discrimination, low employment levels, poor educational attainment and poor health outcomes, including in mental health, women's health and well-being.  Programmes and measures must be co-designed with Traveller organisations.<\/p><p>This debate today is significant.  It is sending out a message that collectively we are determined to address the myriad issues impacting on the rights of Travellers to live fulfilled and happy lives.  Dr. Anna Visser's Oireachtas Library and Research Service <i>Spotlight<\/i>report in 2018 on Traveller accommodation concludes by stating:<\/p> <blockquote> \tMeeting the accommodation needs of the Traveller community has proved a persistent and intransigent policy problem for the Irish State.  Despite some success, official data and numerous comments and reports reveal that accommodation remains a central concern for the Traveller community. <\/blockquote>  <p>Dr. Visser also states in her conclusion that in order &quot;to move away from &lsquo;symbolic implementation&rsquo; towards stronger implementation&quot;, the four principles of resources, power, contextual conditions and coalition strength must be considered in order to change the story.  This Government is determined and committed to working with the Traveller community to move from symbolic towards stronger implementation.  Deputies heard the comments of my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, in that regard.  The view in some quarters that the living conditions highlighted in the report of the Ombudsman for Children's Office are somehow acceptable where a temporary halting site means 30 years or that it can be politically acceptable to allow such conditions to persist must be challenged.  That challenge must occur not just through investment in housing but by investment in people and the restoration of dignity.  This process must be about Travellers feeling proud of their heritage and a situation where we all celebrate their culture and accept that to address the all too often fraught relationship between Traveller and settled people we must collectively address the root cause of alienation of and discrimination against this proud community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300043#TT00200","speaker":"1512"},{"type":"speech","time":1622730900,"counter":403,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this topic.  I am a member of the Joint Committee on Key Issues Affecting the Traveller Community and we engaged with Pavee Point, the Irish Traveller Movement and the National Traveller Women's Forum on Tuesday.  The experiences recounted by those organisations are concerning, but not surprising.  Traveller accommodation is something that politicians do not get right.  We heard promises of a sea change in 2015 after the tragic fire at the halting site in Carrickmines.  At the time, we were told that the State would do more and that work was ongoing to make halting sites safe.  This has not happened and that is a disgrace.<\/p>  <p>  Most councils are not drawing down the budgets available for providing appropriate accommodation.  Why?  Either the Minister of State must become solely responsible for delivering Traveller accommodation or we need a State body to be given the power.  The recent report from the Ombudsman for Children's Office, which found that Cork City Council was violating the rights of Traveller children, is shocking.  The report was scathing of the failures of that council.<\/p> <p>The council left children in what were described as filthy, overcrowded, rat-infested, unsafe, cold and damp living conditions.  Would this happen to any other section of Irish society?

There can be no more delays.  <\/p> <p> For far too long we have discriminated against Travellers across all areas of society including employment, education and, in particular, accommodation.  We have failed to deliver the necessary supports to deal with these and related issues.  I was very proud to be in the Chamber on the day the former Taoiseach Enda Kenny got to his feet and recognised Travellers as an ethnic minority.  The objective of that recognition was to provide rights and protections that had been previously denied to Travellers but that has not happened.

A 12-year-old girl said, &ldquo;Walking up to school you see all the rats ... they would be running up and down the walls of the trailer&rdquo;.  A 14-year-old girl said, &ldquo;People ask why I&rsquo;m dirty, but I&rsquo;d be ashamed to say.  I don&rsquo;t want to say it was from walking out of the site&rdquo;.  A boy aged seven said, &quot;We only play in puddles&quot; while a 16-year-old girl said, &ldquo;When you put your hands out of the bed in the mornings, the blankets are all wet&rdquo;.  A girl aged seven said, &quot;Sometimes the electric goes off and then it's black&quot;.  This, sadly, is not the first report on poor conditions in Traveller accommodation and on halting sites.  Reports have been published over many years and the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, correctly critiqued the 1963 report which did not include Traveller voices and tried to push a policy of assimilation.  Even that report, with all of its faults and limitations, recommended that local authorities &quot;should be required as soon as possible to ascertain the number of [Traveller] families regularly in their areas and decide whether they are in a position to consider them for housing within a short period&quot;.  The 1963 report goes on to say that if they cannot provide housing within a short period, they should provide suitable halting sites and the sites &quot;should have hard-topped surfaces properly drained, and be provided with a piped water supply, sanitary arrangements and an electricity supply&quot;.  These are all very basic requirements for people's basic human rights and dignity but almost 60 years on, as a State, we are still failing in that regard.  We are failing children in particular, who are growing up in conditions that do not meet their most basic needs.<\/p><p>A 2012 report into Spring Lane found that there was raw sewage on the site and the communal toilets were being used by 140 residents.  An engineer's report from 2012 highlighted faults with the site's drainage system and said it created a very large lagoon of water and raw sewage up to 80 cm deep, with human excrement clearly visible at its edges.  The report said it posed a danger to the health and well-being of residents and could also pose a drowning risk.  A 2012 report from the public health nurse focused on high infection rates among children, including upper respiratory tract, lower urinary tract and skin infections.  It found that there was a high percentage of children with special needs, speech and language and learning difficulties.  The HSE environmental health officer found that the site was not fit for human habitation.  All of this was reported almost ten years ago.  The Ombudsman for Children's report should not have been needed.<\/p><p>In 2015, ten Travellers died in a fire in Carrickmines and a review following that incident found that separation distances between Traveller units was a matter of concern in 50% of sites inspected.  This is a particular cause for concern in Spring Lane.  Last week, Ms Bridget McCarthy from Spring Lane told <i>The Irish Times <\/i>that she fears a fire there.  She said, &quot;The caravans are really close to each other.  If one went on fire they would all go on fire&quot;.  She added that she would be happy to show the Taoiseach, Miche&aacute;l Martin, around Spring Lane to see for himself.  She said she would &quot;like him to see how we live.  Waking up every morning in the cold and the damp.  It is hell.  The kids are getting sick from the cold and the germs.&rdquo;  Another resident, Ms Michelle Delaney, told <i>The Irish Times<\/i>that electricity wires have been chewed by rats.  She said, &quot;I could be electrocuted here, as could my child.&quot;  The report from the Ombudsman for Children found the danger of fire spread has not been addressed and that the site is grossly overcrowded.  <\/p><p>We all have a political responsibility here.  Ten years ago councillors voted against a proposal from Cork City Council to rezone land to extend the chronically overcrowded site at Spring Lane.  Under-investment in Traveller-specific housing and in social housing has had a disproportionate effect on Travellers.  Between 2008 and 2013 the Traveller accommodation budget under Fianna F&aacute;il, the Green Party, Fine Gael and the Labour Party was cut by 90%, from &euro;40 million down to &euro;4 million.  <\/p><p>I acknowledge the commitment of the Minister of State and assure him that in terms of cross-party support for his work on this, I am strongly committed to that approach.  Indeed, that is the best approach to take.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300044#UU00200","speaker":"1550"},{"type":"speech","time":1622731500,"counter":406,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  We are discussing a very important issue that can be cut down to essential human rights and human dignity.  Travellers in Ireland suffer through the intersection of poverty, social exclusion, poor access to education, poor health outcomes, high levels of homelessness and higher levels of mental health difficulties and suicide.  All of these interact with each other in very difficult and complex ways, creating huge problems for the community.  We must acknowledge the role of this House in contributing to the problem and not providing enough solutions.  Ultimately, what is at the root of many of these issues is poor accommodation and the failure to provide proper accommodation as a basic human right.  Proper accommodation is the basic standard above which other issues and concerns can be addressed by an active community looking to better itself, which is what the Traveller community is doing.<\/p>  <p>  Earlier this week a number of Traveller representatives contributed to a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Key Issues affecting the Traveller Community.  They spoke with passion about the injustices faced in the context of accommodation.  These issues are well known.  Several years ago \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\" highlighted the fact that the Traveller community represents 1% of the population of Ireland but 8% of homeless adults and 12% of homeless children.  A more recent figure from Pavee Point in 2019 indicates that 13.5% of Travellers are effectively homeless.  We are continually failing to meet the basic needs of the Traveller community, which impacts on the other things I mentioned like poverty, higher rates of suicide and a disturbingly low life expectancy.  All of these things combine but this is not a new problem.  <\/p>  <p>  As other Deputies said, we have seen numerous reports over the years highlighting the struggles of this community.<\/p> <p>Yet here we are with many Deputies still talking about the struggles of this community.  If one takes the years from 2008 to 2019, &euro;72 million in funding to provide Traveller accommodation was unspent.  The effect of that is that the families all these Deputies have been talking about and the children who Deputy Cian O'Callaghan quoted are still living in those dire conditions.<br\/><br\/>One of the things I want to talk about is my constituency.  In Labre Park in my constituency we have seen a long struggle by the community there for redevelopment.  Time and again its hopes are dashed and delays are put in place.  The community there is still fighting for the redevelopment.  It is fighting against cramped and overcrowded conditions.  The<i>Dublin Inquirer<\/i>reported that there was one woman who shares a caravan with ten members of her extended family.  These are cramped and overcrowded conditions.  Since 2016, when funding was initially promised, little has happened.<br\/><br\/>While that is one specific issue within my constituency, we also need to pull out to a broader issue.  One of the things in my head are the words of the judge when the O'Reilly family in Limerick brought the State to court on the provision of proper accommodation.  They felt they had a right to housing and they were seeking to have that right vindicated.  The judge in the case felt there was no right to housing in the Constitution and told the family they were better off seeking a solution in Leinster House than in the courts.  Here we are in Leinster House and it is up to us to provide the solution.<br\/><br\/>One of the things I welcome is the inclusion in the programme for Government of a referendum on a right to housing.  This was something the Green Party had campaigned on and something we pushed during the negotiations.  I am glad to see our partners in government taking it on and supporting it.  We need to ensure there is a right to housing inserted into Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann so that families that have been abandoned by the State, such as those members of the Travelling community living in these cramped and overcrowded conditions, about whom Deputy after Deputy has talked and about whom representatives of the community have lobbied and campaigned against, have another route to seek vindication of what should be a basic human right.  This is a basic need to address the multifaceted problems we have all been talking about and dealing with in the Committee on Key Issues affecting the Traveller Community.<br\/><br\/>I welcome the work that is being done.  I welcome the fact that we have a programme board on the expert review group on Traveller accommodation.  I would urge that work is expedited so that we can make up for lost time, not just due to Covid but due to the years and years of underinvestment in this area where it is much needed.  I thank the Minister of State for his time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300044#UU00300","speaker":"1570","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622732100,"counter":408,"content":"<p>There has been a crisis in housing for many years.  This is something I have spoken about and raised on many occasions in the D&aacute;il.  For many in the general community, waiting to be allocated an apartment or house has often proved to be both frustrating and demoralising as they linger on housing waiting lists for many years before they are even close to being considered for accommodation.  How much more difficult and frustrating must it be for those in the Traveller community looking for accommodation?<\/p>  <p>  The Traveller community faces discrimination across many areas of society on a daily basis.  Members of the Traveller community are, for the most part, accommodated in what are termed as halting sites.  Some of these sites are inadequate and are not suitable places in which to raise a family as they are often overcrowded and devoid of basic facilities.<\/p>  <p>  In my constituency, for example, there are a number of Traveller sites, such as St. Margaret's Park halting site in Ballymun, which is severely overcrowded.  A plan was put in place more than five years ago for this site, which would have increased the amount of housing on the site but it has never been implemented.  There was a considerable amount of consultation with representatives of the Traveller community, local residents, Dublin City Council and local politicians, including myself.  The Villa Park site in Finglas is also overcrowded.  Three additional bungalows were promised to be built a number of years ago on the sight to help alleviate the overcrowding but they have yet to be built.  At St. Joseph's Park site on Dunsink Lane, there are 14 families living in poor conditions and for a long period they did not even have proper access to clean water and basic sanitary facilities.  The bungalow site on Ratoath Road, where up to 15 people are resident, has been without running water for over a month.  Fingal County Council has been supplying this site with water tanks.  This situation is simply not tenable and poses a serious health risk, particularly in light of the pandemic.  I am aware that the majority of residents at the site have also had Covid.  I have written to both the Minister of State and Irish Water and I have spoken to the HSE on the matter.  The director of public health for the area has written to the HSE expressing her concerns and asking that a water supply be provided for the residents as there are children and elderly residents on this site who have no water for toilets, bathing, drinking and hand hygiene etc.  This poses a serious and ongoing risk to public health.<\/p>  <p>  Additionally, local authorities need to be held to account for any underspend in funding for Traveller specific projects.  We need an oversight body to ensure such moneys are spent and penalties should be imposed on those local authorities that fail to do so.  I would also ask that additional funding be provided for the provision of Traveller accommodation as the current spend is not sufficient to meet the ever-increasing demands for housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300045#VV00200","speaker":"1470"},{"type":"speech","time":1622732100,"counter":409,"content":"<p>Apologies from Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith who was originally due to be here and wanted to be here to speak.  She is our representative on the Oireachtas Committee on Key Issues affecting the Traveller Community but she is tied up with the climate change Bill.<\/p>  <p>  The housing crisis we are talking about and the particular crises facing the Traveller community is one reflection of the gross State and societal racism, discrimination and oppression they face.  It is one gross and horrific aspect of it but it is clearly part of a wider process of racism and discrimination.  The consequences of that racism and discrimination are plain for anyone to see in the conditions in which people are forced to live and in other respects.  For example, accommodation is one of they key determinants of health, which contributes to Traveller children being 3.6 times more vulnerable to not surviving the first year of life.  Some 50% of Travellers are not expected to live beyond 40 and the rates of Traveller homelessness have been already mentioned.  In some counties, Travellers would make up 1% of the population but make up 50% of those who are homeless.<\/p>  <p>  Every crisis that affects our society as a whole bears down particularly upon groups which are oppressed and discriminated against and the Traveller community is number one on that list in Ireland.  If one takes the example of Covid, it bore down on the Traveller community harder than those in the settled community.  They were extremely vulnerable because of the living conditions which made it impossible to comply with public health guidelines, particularly the need to self-isolate.  Add to that the absence of access for many to fresh and clean water.<\/p>  <p>  The money that was allocated to deal with Covid in terms of the Traveller community was not spent.  We will come back to the story of money being allocated and not being spent again and again when it comes to the Traveller community in a way that does not seem to happen in other areas.<\/p> <p>As of November 2020, only approximately &euro;90,000 of an allocated &euro;2.5 million was drawn down.<\/p> <p> Housing is now emerging again as the key political focus.  The danger is that the Traveller community will, at best, be forgotten or, unfortunately more likely, will be consciously ignored and have a blind eye turned to it and the Government will not deal with what needs to be dealt with to address the housing crisis.  All the solutions will likely, and inadequately, focus on the needs of those in the settled community.<\/p> <p> We must call out the living conditions that exist as a humanitarian crisis facing many Travellers.  There have been many fine and good words and analyses of what is happening in this House but we must also examine why this crisis is taking place.  We do not need more reports.  Everybody knows why the crisis is taking place.  It is a blunt and obvious thing when a bunch of money is allocated to local authorities for Traveller accommodation and only a tiny fraction of it is spent.  More than &euro;72 million was unspent by local authorities between 2008 and 2019.  In 2020, only 16 new units of Traveller-specific accommodation were built, comprising seven houses, nine welfare units and no additional bays.  Why is that?  It is a reflection of general State and societal racism.  Politicians clearly have an important role to play.  The truth, which we must call out, is that there are very many local authority politicians, many of them members of establishment political parties, who play a race card against Travellers and block Traveller accommodation.  That is the truth.  A Minister of State in this Government described spending money on Traveller accommodation in a particular area as a waste of valuable resources.  That is what needs to be challenged if we are going to try to assist and deal with this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300045#VV00300","speaker":"1628","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622732700,"counter":411,"content":"<p>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to contribute a statement on this topic.  I acknowledge the Minister of State's speech, his work in this area and the considerable progress he has made since coming into office.  I thank Pavee Point nationally and, more locally in my own area, Southside Travellers Action Group, for their engagement with me over the past year in my role as equality spokesperson for Fine Gael and as a representative of D&uacute;n Laoghaire.<\/p>  <p>  While I have had the opportunity to speak several times about education strategy, the impact of Covid-19 and other matters of concern to Travellers, I want to acknowledge that this is the first occasion on which I have been able to contribute a statement on an issue dedicated to Traveller accommodation.  The first thing I want to do, therefore, with the permission of the House, is to pay my respects as a new Deputy for the D&uacute;n Laoghaire constituency to the people who lost their lives on 10 October 2015 in a halting site on the edge of my constituency in Carrickmines when a fire broke out.  Ten Travellers, including a young mother who was pregnant, lost their lives.  If I may, I would like to take the opportunity, as a representative of a constituency on the edge of the location of that event, to name them again in this House.  We should never forget the victims of the fire.  They were Tara Gilbert and her partner, Willie Lynch; their daughters, Jodie and Kelsey; Jimmy Lynch; Thomas Connors and his wife Sylvia; and their children, Jimmy, Christy and Mary.  In January 2019, the Dublin Coroner's Court returned a verdict of death by misadventure in the case of these ten tragic deaths.<\/p>  <p>  The report published by the Ombudsman for Children last week highlighted a specific issue with Cork County Council but the read-across from the report on broader, systemic issues is of importance.  The Office of the Ombudsman for Children has recommended that local authorities engage with HSE social inclusion units, Tusla youth services and local schools to improve the lives of children living on that site.  These are not new challenges, ideas or recommendations.  We still do not have an implemented national Traveller health action plan or a national Traveller education strategy.  I am pleased that the Government is committed to the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021, but we need to see action from the different Departments, particularly the Department of Education, on the national Traveller education strategy, which is persistently highlighted by Pavee Point and others, including me and many other Deputies in this House.<\/p>  <p>  The issues in accommodation that were highlighted by the Ombudsman for Children and those I am highlighting on education impact vulnerable children more than anybody else.  Their health and well-being and access to education were particularly compromised during the pandemic and the switch to remote learning.  Their experiences of racism and discrimination are all contributors to further exclusion and damage.  The Government must implement its own strategies and there is an opportunity for real momentum behind the national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy but evidence of that will be seeing the education strategy and the full implementation of the independent expert group on Traveller accommodation.  If the Government cannot deliver the implementation of those different strategies through its agencies and Departments, we will have to look at alternative models for delivery.<\/p>  <p>  Last week, I saw a young Traveller boy and his father have a small altercation of words with a man at his home in my constituency.  I do not pretend to know what the dispute was between the two gentlemen or what had gone before.  It does not matter too much and I was not concentrating on that because I was just watching the boy.  Whatever had happened before, what this boy saw was a man openly disrespecting his father.  I was watching the boy watching this scene and I wondered how many times it had happened before and how that had been absorbed, or not, by that boy.  Of course, I thought of my own boy, slightly younger, and how he had never seen his father disrespected in front of him.  I thought of those two boys and the different challenges they faced, including, at their core, confidence and the impact that moment of conflict had on that young boy's psychosocial development.  <\/p>  <p>  We talk about inclusion and stamping out racism because we know it has been a persistent feature of Irish life for many years and because conflict between communities never helps anybody.  I look then at Traveller accommodation in my council area.  Despite the challenges of the past, I acknowledge the dedicated work that has been done by D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council in recent years.  It is the only council in the greater Dublin area to have drawn down more than its allocation over the past four years and, on a cumulative basis, over the past ten years.  I have spoken to Ms Geraldine Dunne of the Southside Travellers Action Group on the status of Traveller accommodation in my own area and she has given me permission to attribute comments to her today.  In her view, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council has made extremely good progress due to what she says is a great team in that section.  She described that team as dedicated and respectful.  She said that these dedicated and respectful staff have made a simply huge difference.  I told her that I would faithfully report whatever she said about how things are going and it was heartening to hear that there are good local authority staff who have made a difference.  I thank them and the chief executive for the emphasis they have placed on this issue.  However, there is still more to do and there is a still a shortage of Traveller units, though Ms Dunne did observe that if the pace of redevelopment of sites and refurbishments continues, she would expect a positive outcome for Travellers in our area within five to ten years.  That is still quite a long time.  On the other hand, we are not sure that we have enough units in train for the younger generation.  We estimate that another 40 to 50 young families will seek to avail of the next Traveller accommodation programme, TAP.  Those are families who were not accounted for in the most recent TAP, although I am, of course, aware that the council wanted to sort out the immediate and serious issues. <\/p>  <p>  It makes a difference if staff are dedicated and respectful.  Those staff are actively putting in applications for funding and engaging in development and redevelopment.  They have also held themselves to dedicated targets and timelines.  They have put a timeline on their refurbishment programme and stuck to it.  I acknowledge that the pandemic has created difficulties, as it has for everything else.  Redevelopment has been good and a move forward.  I look forward to visiting all of these developments in my area with Ms Dunne as soon as it is appropriate from a Covid perspective.  I thank her for her continued work.  I also thank Ms Ronnie Fay and Mr. Martin Collins from Pavee Point for their ongoing work and engagement with me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300046#WW00200","speaker":"1480"},{"type":"speech","time":1622732700,"counter":412,"content":"<p>I will raise a number of issues relating to Traveller accommodation in my constituency of Dublin West.  Prior to the outbreak of Covid-19, I visited a substantial number of Traveller accommodation areas in and around the Dublin West area.  Sadly, I was not surprised by what I saw because I have worked with the Travelling community for a number of years in Coolock and Darndale.  None of the sites I visited could, in anyone's language, be described as acceptable.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge the significant work by Fingal County Council's housing department in putting together the Traveller accommodation programme with representatives of the Travelling community.  The proof will be if that programme is completely actioned.  Will the situation for Travellers be the same in 2024?  From speaking to the Travelling community right across Dublin West, there is scepticism that accommodation will be provided for them.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge Ms Anne Marie Farrelly and Ms Colette Spears from the Blanchardstown Traveller Development Group who have been supportive in helping me and my colleague, Councillor Breda Hanaphy.  We visited as many sites as we could and I look forward to visiting the number of sites we did not get to before Covid-19 hit us.<\/p> <p>Every single community I visited had very severe infrastructural, housing and facility deficits.  Some were minor and others were the most dangerous situations I have seen.  The only phrase I can use to convey fully how dangerous they where is, \"Carrickmines waiting to happen\".  The worst was the result of severe overcrowding on the site, with caravans cheek by jowl, metres from each other, with extremely dangerous ESB connections.  The issues we need to address are overcrowding.<\/p> <p> One site at St. Brigid's Lawn has seen the family outgrow the site, leading to such severe overcrowding.  This site was semi-rural with very little housing 27 years ago.  It is now prime development land within the Kellystown local area plan.  There is a plan to increase this estate by only one bay.  The entire sewerage system and electricity system are in dire need of replacement, and this needs to happen really quickly.  After 27 years, surely this family deserves more than one unit.  Thousands of units are planned in Kellystown.  The strategy for this family needs to reflect the housing needs not just of the family now but into the future.<\/p> <p> I believe all of us - members of the Travelling community, the council, public representatives and local communities - must and should work together to build a new future and a new, inclusive community.  It is not one group or organisation.  This is about what type of society we aspire to be.  As has been mentioned earlier, it is incredibly important that we come together and challenge those who use racism within our society to block any attempt to build Traveller accommodation in Dublin 15 or in any place within the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300046#WW00300","speaker":"1476","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622733300,"counter":414,"content":"<p>I have carried out a good bit of research over the last number of months on funding for Traveller accommodation.  The responses I received to my parliamentary questions are absolutely shocking.  Unbelievable information has come back in the last couple of weeks.<\/p>  <p>  In 2017, local authorities drew down &euro;4.8 million from an allocation of &euro;9 million.  In 2018, local authorities drew down &euro;8.6 million from an allocation of &euro;13 million.  In 2020, all of the &euro;14.4 million in funding was drawn down but no breakdown was given on what counties actually drew it down.  This system was changed.  Some counties could, therefore, have drawn all of that down and many other counties could have taken none.  I believe the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, is one of the most capable ministers ever at altering, moving or hiding statistics from public view.<\/p>  <p>  In 2019, Donegal County Council was allocated &euro;161,000 funding specifically for Traveller accommodation.  It did not draw down a cent of that funding.  In Leitrim County Council in 2019, nothing was drawn down despite an allocation of &euro;178,000.  In the same year, Monaghan County Council withdrew not a cent of the &euro;100,000 that was available.  Wicklow County Council was the same; &euro;104,000 was available but it was untouched in 2019.<\/p>  <p>  In 2018, Carlow County Council was offered funding of &euro;167,000 but refused to draw it down.  Likewise, Cork County Council was given &euro;250,000 but did not withdraw any of it.  In Galway city that year, the allocation was &euro;176,000 and it remained untouched.  In Westmeath, &euro;150,000 was made available but nothing was sought.  Wexford County Council saw a significant allocation of &euro;500,000 for Traveller accommodation but it did not withdraw any funding.  In 2017, Galway County Council withdrew none of the &euro;625,000 available.<\/p>  <p>  That is stunning information.  I cannot think of funding for any other section of Irish society that would stay on the dusty shelf and be ignored in the jaws of a housing crisis, and in a situation where Traveller accommodation throughout the State is in shocking condition.  The topic of Traveller accommodation is avoided at local political level in many cases.  It is absolutely shameful that many county and city councils around the country have returned funding, which was allocated to the construction and maintenance of housing.  They returned it to Dublin in the middle of a housing crisis.<\/p>  <p>  In total, &euro;15.7 million, which the Government offered to local authorities for housing in the last five years, has remained untouched.  That fact speaks for itself.  It is an astonishing figure.  While one might argue that this is not a Government problem but a local authority problem, I would argue that the political parties in charge of the D&aacute;il are also typically in charge of the local authorities around the country.  At local level, I would also argue that an anti-Traveller attitude is leading, in some cases, to these decisions.<\/p>  <p>  That said, there are definitely people within the establishment parties, such as Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v from County Galway, who is very strong with regard to Traveller accommodation.  Indeed, he was the first to give out about the shocking burning of a house designated for a Traveller couple in Galway.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v stood up for that couple, for which I know the Travelling community was very grateful.<\/p>  <p>  Every single day, my office, and those of Aont&uacute; representatives around the country, are contacted about families in homelessness.  These figures are a slap in the face to each of those families.  In my county, there is a site called St. Patrick's Park.  I must pay respect to Meath County Council for the massive work it has done in the last six months on trying to house many of the families living on that site.<\/p>  <p>  Up until that period, however, the accommodation was incredible.  A person would not believe it unless he or she saw it.  Again, caravans and mobile homes were sitting on top of each other.  Electric wires were hanging from one caravan to another and water pipes were running all over the place.  In a situation that had echoes of Carrickmines, a trailer went on fire.  A fire engine and ambulance had massive difficulty in getting to it simply because the road was blocked with low-hanging electric wires.  The emergency services simply could not go up to the site.  Given the fact that we had such a horrendous tragedy in Carrickmines, that this was allowed to occur at a time when funding was available throughout the country is absolutely wrong.<\/p>  <p>  I read the report produced yesterday on homelessness and mortality.  It is shocking.  Some 79 people died in homelessness last year in the city of Dublin alone.  There have been in excess of 40 deaths this year so far.  Think about that; 40 people have died in homelessness in Dublin alone this year.<\/p>  <p>  I asked the Minister to investigate homelessness last year.  It is interesting that he started to investigate it but, of course, he finished his investigation after the temperatures had started to rise in the city.  In the legacy of the former Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Eoghan Murphy, he started to question the figures.  He said that some of these people might have actually died from car accidents while they were homeless.  This was an actual comment made by the Minister with responsibility for housing to a journalist on the matter.<\/p>  <p>  Major spin is happening here from the Government.  I have a difficulty; the Government and some of the Opposition are a mirror image of each other.  Both are using their ideological bias to prevent real housing solutions happening.  We need to build for everybody in society.  We need to make sure, however, that the funding available for Travellers around the country to have decent accommodation is used.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300047#XX00200","speaker":"1504"},{"type":"speech","time":1622733300,"counter":415,"content":"<p>Cuireann s&eacute; &aacute;thas orm deis a bheith agam labhairt ar an &aacute;bhar seo mar is &aacute;bhar thar a bheith tromch&uacute;iseach &eacute; agus caithfear rud &eacute;igin a dh&eacute;anamh.<\/p><p>One of the issues that has come up in the Oireachtas Committee on Key Issues affecting the Traveller Community, of which I am a member, is that we have all the statistics.  We have an idea of the scale of the problem.<\/p> <p>However, what we, and, more importantly, the Traveller community, need are solutions to the bottlenecks.<\/p> <p> It is fair to say there has been a huge problem in persuading local authorities to spend money and take action in regard to Traveller accommodation.  The problem is not confined to local authorities in the area in which I live, although they are not exempt from it either, particularly the city council.  We must seriously question community attitudes to Travellers.  It was very interesting to read the latest volume of M&iacute;che&aacute;l MacGr&eacute;il's work on prejudices and intolerance within this State.  It is a massive tome for which I had the great pleasure of writing the foreword.  Mr. MacGr&eacute;il compared many different groups in our society and different nationalities from across the world in terms of whether we accept or do not accept them.  It is a study of who we like and do not like.  I am sad to say that at the very bottom of the list in terms of our tolerance and Christian attitude towards them were Travellers, our fellow Irish people.<\/p> <p> Mr. MacGr&eacute;il's research is scientific work, involving proper sociological study.  Nobody since has been able to disprove what he found.  The findings are interesting in respect of South Dublin County Council, where there was an extraordinary manager, now called a CEO, in place for many years.  The council tackled its problems in this area and showed an amazing improvement in the relationship between the settled and Traveller communities.  Now we have problems feeding on problems.  Homelessness and the failure to tackle the housing issue are feeding all of the other problems.  The solution must be holistic and it has to include housing.<\/p> <p> Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n made reference to a house that was bought for a Traveller family in my constituency.  It was burnt down in the middle of the night and, as I understand, the evidence is that it did not happen accidentally.  Last summer, people were marching for Black Lives Matter.  We were outraged by attitudes in faraway places to people of a different race or colour.  Yet, we have serious attitudinal or racial problems within this country.  On top of that, I notice recently that the opposition to Traveller housing is feeding into an opposition to social housing in general.  Much of this opposition is very clever.  The people opposing it would never be so foolish as to say they do not want X or Y for racial or ethnic reasons.  Instead, they say a house is too big or too small, a site is too big or too small, or there is a snail or something else on it.<\/p> <p> That brings me to one of the major challenges we have.  From my dealings with Galway City Council, for example, it is clear that the staff are very sympathetic to the people concerned because they know them.  They know they are decent people.  They know there is an utterly disproportionate number of decent families in homelessness and on the housing list, the best of people and friends of mine, who happen to belong to the Traveller community.  These are people with excellent records of tenancies but who cannot get accommodation under the housing assistance payment,HAP, scheme.  Many of them cannot afford that accommodation because the rents are too high, but many landlords will not rent to them under the HAP scheme in any case.  Whoever thought that scheme was going to be a permanent solution for housing knows nothing about the aspirations of most people on the social housing list.  They want good, old-fashioned local authority housing, even in preference to housing provided by voluntary housing bodies.<\/p> <p> It is time to make up our minds on this issue.  One of the greatest logjams at the moments relates to applications under Part 8 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, as amended.  When proposals for Traveller-specific housing under that provision come before local authorities, councillors do not pass them.  I am a great champion of democracy.  Many times in this House, I have opposed the removal of powers from democratically elected Members and their handing over to unelected bodies.  I stand by that except in this case, where politicians are not willing to face up to their legal responsibilities and provide what they are legally obliged to provide, namely, housing and other necessary things.  I am talking about people not fulfilling their legal obligation.  I am disappointed that many local authority CEOs, who have the power in an emergency to make an executive decision, do not make such decisions.  As a result, we get the significant underspends that have been reported by a number of colleagues here today.<\/p> <p> I believe local authorities should be given six months to start passing Part 8 applications.  Thereafter, if local authority members continue to fail to deal with planning issues, the applications should go straight to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for decision.  I would be the last person in the normal way to recommend that powers be taken away from local authority members and given to An Bord Plean&aacute;la but, in this case, it may be necessary to do so.  The money for Traveller accommodation was not spent back in the 2000s, it was not spent over the past decade and it looks as if we are heading the same way in this decade.  That cannot go on.  Unfortunately, if powers in this regard are taken away from local authorities, there is nobody to blame but the people who would not face up to their legal responsibilities to provide housing for those who need it and particularly for those who are most in need of it.<\/p> <p> There are many other points I would like to make but my time is up.  Please God, I will get an opportunity to make them some other day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300047#XX00300","speaker":"1575","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622733900,"counter":417,"content":"<p>There is somewhere close to 40,000 people in the Traveller community, making it a significant indigenous ethnic group.  Since 1996, its population has grown by 185%.  The trajectory is upwards, certainly more so than for the general population, although there have been highs and lows in growth.  In Limerick, for instance, the Traveller population has increased by 250% over the past 20 years.<\/p>  <p>  The majority of Travellers live in rental accommodation, including private and local authority housing stock, with 12% living in either a caravan or mobile home.  The goal should be to have no person living in a caravan or mobile home.  Some 5% of the Traveller community live in roadside units, which is of huge concern both to themselves and to road users.  Do we need to take the responsibility for the provision of Traveller accommodation away from the local authorities and give it to a statutory agency?  That question arises because, for some unexplained reason, there has been a continuous underspend across the Traveller accommodation programme.  Funds allocated were not drawn down, with an underspend of &euro;14 million between 2014 and 2018.  There appears to be significant funding available but its implementation seems to be an issue.<\/p>  <p>  As the Traveller community is such a significant grouping, is there not the possibility of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na recruiting some person from within the ranks of the community who could become a liaison officer within the force, as is the case with other groupings and ethnic minorities?<\/p> <p>This would help in all aspects.<\/p> <p> I grew up on a family farm in County Limerick.  My father was a lot older than me; he was born in 1911.  The stories he told me about the Travelling community go back to the culture of the first such communities.  They were the finest tradespeople and tinsmiths in the country.  They used to come to the farm maybe twice a year and do whatever repairs my father would have.  That culture has changed throughout the years, like all our cultures have, and every different culture grows.  There are some fantastic Traveller families in this country.  I know and am friendly with a lot of them.  Many of them are still tradespeople.  One of them even plastered walls in my own house a number of years ago.  They are fine tradespeople.  However, as in all other groups in Ireland, there is a minority - we have seen how minorities seem to get all the press and all the bad news.  We saw the tragedy that happened to the families in Carrickmines.  No family should have to go through that.  If the local authority cannot do that job, let us take the responsibility away from it and set up an organisation that can.<\/p> <p> There should not be anybody who is homeless: there should be nobody living in a caravan now.  It is 2021 and we have people homeless, people living in caravans and people living in mobile homes.  All of our cultures must change.  With all respect to everyone, we must change with that and understand all the different cultures.  I am into vintage myself and I love our history and I love our culture and I have to move with that.  It is about time we all worked together to get a solution to do this and ensure the likes of the underspending that has been happening to date does not happen going forward.  Everyone deserves to have a roof over their head, to have their life, to live and build from that.  People from all walks of life must also be respectful.  People must stop painting a picture of a minority of people who cause problems and let us look at the bigger picture of the people who actually contribute to our society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300048#YY00300","speaker":"1499","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622734500,"counter":419,"content":"<p>According to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, based on its latest available data which are from 2019, there were 10,809 families from the Travelling community throughout the country in need of accommodation.  Given other Travellers may have no engagement with a local authority or do not self-identify for the purposes of data collection, the true population is likely much larger.  Many of these people are living in inadequate, unsafe and impermanent conditions.  These conditions erode their health, life expectancy, education and employment opportunities and are well below the basic human rights standard.  Those rights to health, life expectancy and education cannot be properly vindicated unless the human right to housing is vindicated.  An additional disadvantage is that only a very small proportion of social housing and private rental stock consists of large dwellings suitable to accommodating larger families.  The average family size is 5.3 according to the 2016 census.  There are 2,800 Travellers living on unofficial sites.  It is outrageous.  The oversight of Traveller accommodation delivery rests with the Traveller accommodation unit of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage so it is this Government's responsibility.<\/p>  <p>  What do we need to do?  We must repeal section 24 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2002 prohibiting nomadism, a core element of Traveller culture and their way of life.  We must have provision of a network of transient halting sites in each local authority area for short stays that would be exempted under section 4 of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  We need Traveller-specific accommodation to be provided under the single-stage planning process.  We call for an amendment to Part 8 of the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016 to prevent political interference in Traveller-specific developments.  There is a need for full and speedy implementation of the 32 recommendations from the Traveller accommodation expert group.  We also need an oversight body to ensure those 32 recommendations are implemented.  I was at the committee on key issues affecting the Travelling community on Tuesday.  Members called for an independent national Traveller accommodation authority with the authority to plan and implement housing and accommodation for the Travelling community.

I listen to those who say \"Nothing about us without us\" so I reached out to a Traveller woman named Anne from Cork to get input from the community most affected by recent reports.<\/p>  <p>  On 24 May the Ombudsman for Children published a scathing report on conditions at a site in Cork.  After three years of investigative work, the Ombudsman for Children found Cork County Council failed to maintain the site, failed to maintain the toilet and showering facilities, failed to ensure that there was consistent waste management and pest control and failed to provide a clear and safe passage to school, or play areas for children.  Anne told me that she found the Taoiseach&rsquo;s response to the Ombudsman for Children's No End in Site report \"disappointing\".  Anne says, and I agree, that human rights and Traveller children's human rights are indivisible.  Anne asked that I call for an immediate intervention by the relevant Departments and the Department of the Taoiseach with Cork City Council to address the findings as a matter of urgency.  That needs to be done, and indeed it could be done with every local authority in the country because they are all failing, and the reason they are failing is that local authority members will not step up to the mark.<\/p>  <p>  Anne asked that I highlight the complete dysfunctionality of what the Government calls its Framework for Traveller Accommodation, which the ESRI also found to be \"dysfunctional\" in 2017, and that I call for the immediate implementation of the recommendations of the Expert Group on Traveller Accommodation, which has been awaiting implementation for the last two years.  As such, it is not only local authorities that are dragging their heels.  Anne wants a review of Traveller accommodation, namely, group housing and halting sites both official and unofficial, across the country and for the rights of Traveller children to be looked at.<\/p>  <p>  There are issues with Traveller accommodation right across the country, not just in Cork.  As Senator Eileen Flynn said, following the release of the report, \"It&rsquo;s a damning report which tells an all too familiar story when it comes to Traveller accommodation.\"  It is heartbreaking to see what the children said in the report.  A 12-year-old girl said: \"It&rsquo;s like an abandoned place that people forgot about, it&rsquo;s like we&rsquo;re forgotten, we feel like garbage.\"  A 7-year-old boy said: \"We only play in puddles.\"  A 13-year-old girl said: \"It takes two or three hours to heat up a bath.\"  Some sites do not even have water to allow people to have a bath.<\/p>  <p>  Local authorities and Government should absolutely be held accountable for their despicable failings.  I would also like to give a final shout out to brilliant Minc&eacute;ir beoirs like Rosemarie Maughan, Anne Marie Quilligan and many others who are speaking out, educating us and holding the Irish public to account.

It is a technical Bill that establishes in domestic law the framework of different maritime zones of national jurisdiction recognised by international law.  Within those zones a coastal state is entitled to regulate human activity only to the extent permitted by international law.  Within each zone states have different sets of rights, which I will explain shortly.  It is important to emphasise at this stage, however, that the purpose of the Bill is simply to provide for those zones and their limits in domestic law.  Separate legislation regulates different activities within those zones, depending on the activity concerned, and that is not the purpose of the Bill.<\/p><p>The regulation by states of human activity at sea is governed in the first instance by the international law of the sea and, as I have said, a state may only regulate an activity at sea to the extent permitted by international law.  The oceans and seas are shared spaces in which different interests of states compete.  Unsurprisingly, coastal states may wish to exclusively control activity in their coastal waters while all states have an interest in preserving freedom of navigation and other freedoms of the seas.  International law seeks to balance these different interests.<\/p><p>The development of international law in this field has been greatly influenced by advances in technology.  These advances have led to enormous increases in both the scope and scale of human activity at sea. During the last century, the age-old division of the seas between, on the one hand, a narrow territorial sea to which the sovereignty of the coastal state extended and, on the other, the high seas beyond the territorial sea came to be regarded as inadequate to deal with this increased activity.  A number of efforts were made to develop international law, beginning with the 1930 Hague Conference under the auspices of the old League of Nations and culminating in the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, which met for ten years from 1973.  That conference adopted the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which established a comprehensive framework within which all activity in, on and under the seas can be regulated.  The convention was ratified by Ireland in 1996 and currently has 168 state parties.<\/p><p>The 1982 convention recognises five different maritime zones of national jurisdiction within which the coastal state has the exclusive right to regulate activity to different extents.  In general, the closer the zone to the coastal state's land territory, the more control it may exercise over activity within that zone.  The zones of national jurisdiction are the internal waters, the territorial sea that may extend to a maximum distance of 12 nautical miles, the contiguous zone, the exclusive economic zone that may extend to a maximum distance of 200 nautical miles and the continental shelf, comprising the seabed below and, in some cases, beyond the exclusive economic zone.<\/p><p>Beyond these zones are the high seas and the &quot;area&quot;, which is the deep seabed beyond the continental shelves of states.  A different legal regime applies within each zone and so a coastal state has a different suite of rights and duties within each zone.  What activities a state may regulate will depend on the zone in which they are carried out.  In general, the international law of the sea seeks to strike a balance between the jurisdiction of the coastal state to regulate activity in its coastal waters and the jurisdiction of the flag state over the vessel from which that activity is being carried out.  A coastal state may not assume for itself greater jurisdiction than has been recognised by the convention without intruding on the jurisdiction recognised as belonging to the flag state.  The purposes of the Maritime Jurisdiction Bill, therefore, are to provide in domestic law for the establishment and delineation of each maritime zone and to clarify the State's rights within each one.<\/p><p>The Oireachtas first made provision for the maritime jurisdiction of the state in the Maritime Jurisdiction Act 1959.  That Act established the outer limit of the territorial sea at three nautical miles and made provision for a straight baseline system.  It was amended in 1964 and again in 1988 to reflect relevant developments in international law.  Subsequently an attempt to consolidate this legislation was made in Part 3 of the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006, which also established the State's exclusive economic zone.  Separately the Continental Shelf Act 1968 conferred power on the Government to designate as Irish the continental shelf seabed beyond the territorial sea.<\/p><p>This Bill is being brought forward now for a number of reasons.  First, the Bill will bring the State's maritime jurisdiction law up to date, reflecting in particular developments in international law and practice in recent years.  The Bill sets out in detail the sovereign rights and jurisdiction the State may exercise on the continental shelf and within the exclusive economic zone, in accordance with international law.  As Deputies will be aware, it is expected that increased levels of activity and development will take place in the exclusive economic zone in coming years, in particular with the production of offshore renewable energy from floating installations.<\/p><p>Second, the Bill will consolidate the State's maritime jurisdiction legislation in one accessible, stand-alone enactment.  This is particularly important in the context of the new national marine planning framework and the forthcoming marine planning and development management Bill.  Third, the Bill will ensure the exercise of order-making powers is guided by policies and principles linked to the detailed rules set out in the 1982 convention.<\/p><p>The Bill consists of 33 sections and two Schedules.  Many of these provisions re-enact, with updates, provisions of the 1968 and 2006 Acts.  I draw particular attention to the following provisions.  Section 6 of the Bill deals with the baseline and replaces and builds on section 85 of the 2006 Act.  It establishes the low water mark along the coast as the normal baseline from which the breadth of the State's maritime zones is measured and clarifies for completeness that this includes the straight line across the mouth of a river where that river flows directly into the sea.  It also provides a power enabling the Government to prescribe by order straight baselines and bay closing lines in accordance with the relevant provisions of the 1982 convention and preserves the existing straight baselines and bay closing line orders.<\/p><p>Section 7 defines the State's territorial sea.  The 1959 Act and subsequent legislation used the term &quot;territorial seas&quot; but the singular 'sea', as used by the 1982 convention and other instruments of international law, is now employed.  A power to prescribe by order boundaries in the territorial sea is also introduced.  Section 9 is a new provision and clarifies for the avoidance of doubt both that the sovereignty of the State extends to the territorial sea and that the State owns the seabed of the territorial sea, as well as the mineral and other non-living natural resources located there and all forms of potential energy in, on, under and above the territorial sea.<\/p><p>Section 10 extends the State's criminal jurisdiction to cover offences committed on or by foreign vessels in the territorial sea and section 11 sets out the procedure to apply in prosecutions of such offences.  Section 12 defines the State's contiguous zone, which is the zone within which a coastal state may enforce its customs, immigration and fiscal rules and where it has jurisdiction to protect historic wrecks and archaeological objects.  It lies outside the territorial sea and may extend to a maximum distance of 24 nautical miles from the baseline.  Section 13 defines the State's exclusive economic zone, providing a power enabling the Government to prescribe by order the boundaries of the zone in accordance with the 1982 convention and preserves the existing boundaries order.<\/p><p>Section 14 sets out the sovereign rights and jurisdiction enjoyed by the State within the exclusive economic zone.  As part of the compromise reached at the Third United Nations conference, coastal states do not enjoy sovereignty within the exclusive economic zone, as they do within the territorial seas.  Instead they have a more limited set of sovereign and jurisdictional rights relating to the exploitation of natural resources and the protection of the marine environment.  However, these sovereign and jurisdictional rights are exclusive and cannot be exercised by any other state.  This more limited set of sovereign and jurisdictional rights enables the preservation of many of the freedoms of the high seas within the exclusive economic zone, in particular the freedom of navigation for the vessels of all states.<\/p><p>Section 15 clarifies the criminal and civil jurisdiction of the State in the exclusive economic zone.  Sections 16 to 19, inclusive, replace sections 2 and 3 of the Continental Shelf Act 1968, which will be repealed.  Section 16 defines the continental shelf in accordance with the convention and sets out how the outer limit of the continental shelf is to be determined.<\/p><p>Section 17 provides a power enabling the Government by order to designate seabed within the outer limit as Irish continental shelf and preserves the existing designation orders.  Section 18 sets out the sovereign and jurisdictional rights enjoyed by the State on, in and under the continental shelf in accordance with the convention.<\/p> <p>The legal regime of the continental shelf is concerned mainly with the exploitation of the non-living natural resources located there, in particular the oil, gas and other mineral reserves.  Section 19 clarifies the criminal and civil jurisdiction of the State on the continental shelf.<\/p> <p> Section 22 makes it an offence to commit on board an Irish vessel beyond the territorial sea any act which would be an offence if committed within the State.  A number of enactments already provide for this in respect of specific offences, such as offences under the Cluster Munitions and Anti-Personnel Mines Act 2008 and the Biological Weapons Act 2011.  However, given that the primary jurisdiction over any ship is the jurisdiction of the flag state, the opportunity is being taken now to extend the criminal jurisdiction of the State to all Irish vessels in respect of any act committed outside the State which, if committed inside the State, would be a criminal offence.  This is already the position with offences committed on board Irish registered aircraft under section 2 of the Air Navigation and Transport Act 1973.<\/p> <p> Section 24 provides that proceedings for an offence under the Bill may be taken in any place in the State.  Sections 25 to 33 make technical amendments to a number of enactments to reflect changes that will be effected by the present Bill.<\/p> <p> The Schedule 1 to the Bill sets out the texts of relevant parts of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.  These are: Part II, which deals with the territorial sea and the contiguous zone; Part V, which deals with the exclusive economic zone; and Part VI, which deals with the continental shelf.  Schedule 2 is a table of consequential amendments of other enactments.<\/p> <p> As I said, the Bill will consolidate and update the State's maritime jurisdiction law, as well as making it more accessible in one stand-alone enactment.  I thank Deputies for their consideration and I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300050#AAA00200","speaker":"1573","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622735700,"counter":425,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.  I acknowledge that this Bill is being presented as an opportunity to tidy up existing legislation under a single enactment.  I welcome the consolidation of existing legislation in one place.  I further acknowledge that the Bill sets out Ireland&rsquo;s maritime rights under international law and the law of the sea.  I must question, however, the willingness and capacity of the Government to assert Ireland&rsquo;s rights under international law.  I and my party have concerns that the responsibilities Ireland has towards our sovereign waters and the marine will not be properly exercised.<\/p><p>We, as a nation, have further responsibilities that go beyond that of the law.  These responsibilities relate to our moral duty, our duty of stewardship, and of the guardianship of our maritime resources for our future generations.  These responsibilities are intertwined and place a particular onus of responsibility on the Government of our island.<\/p><p>The area of fisheries demands further scrutiny.  The Irish fishing industry is of immense economic, strategic and social value to the State.  It is estimated that the fishing industry contributes more than &euro;700 million annually.  Varying estimates suggest that between 11,000 and 14,000 workers are employed in the industry.  At a strategic level, be it rightly or wrongly as things turned out, there is no doubt that various Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael Governments have leveraged Ireland's fisheries in multilateral trade agreements, particularly within the EU.  The treatment of our fishing communities by the Government stands comparison with the tenacious bargaining campaign by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Charlie McConalogue, with his European counterparts on behalf of the wealthy farmers of this country when he essentially collapsed the CAP negotiations to maintain the <i>status quo <\/i>that suits the rich farmers.  It is a fact that of the astronomical amount of fish taken from Irish waters annually, only 42% or so is taken by Irish trawlers.  Very few European states make such a gift of their natural resources to their fellow EU member states.<\/p><p>On the north and west coast of this island the fishing industry has a particular social impact above and beyond the financial contribution that can be measured within the industry alone.  The reliance of our coastal communities on the fishing industry is immense, especially when we recognise that the majority of these communities do not possess any natural resources other than the sea.  A whole host of service industries have grown around fishing.  The fishing industry has provided social cohesion, identity and heritage for communities, and in many instances it is the only alternative to the emigration of the past.<\/p><p>We must consider also Ireland's responsibility to police the 200-mile economic zone that surrounds our coast.  Our failure in this and our inability to secure our own sovereign waters has been called out.  The European Commission has instituted a formal administrative inquiry into Ireland's ability to enforce EU fishing and environmental regulations in Irish waters.  It was a Fine Gael Government that not that long ago campaigned on securing back our sovereignty, which had been sold out by its coalition partners in Fianna F&aacute;il.  We are now dependent on the assistance of our EU partners to conduct naval patrols in sovereign Irish waters because, as a consequence of Government policy, we lack the naval power to do so ourselves.  This is a shocking indictment of this Government.<\/p><p>So far in 2021, one third of the Naval Service fisheries' patrols have had to be cancelled for a variety of reasons.  In many instances it was because the Naval Service lacked the personnel to staff the vessels.  In other instances it was because the Naval Service lacked the qualified personnel to keep the vessels seaworthy.  I have spoken many times in this House on the failure of the Government to resolve the issue of staffing in the Defence Forces.  This is an ongoing issue of the Government that is alarming, scandalous, and a stain on the record of this and preceding Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael Governments.  In the past year 2,700 fishing vessels were inspected in Irish waters.  While this figure may seem high, consider the number of vessels that escaped inspection due to the failure of the Irish Government to put a fully resourced Naval Service to sea.<\/p><p>In conjunction with this legislation there is a serious need to examine the damage that super trawlers are allowed to wreak in Irish waters.  They are hoovering up our fish stocks, they are devastating the ocean bed, and they are responsible for releasing carbon back into the atmosphere, which had been stored naturally in the ocean bed.  Devastating and irreversible damage is being done to the ocean beds by deep sea trawling.  Much of the damage being done cannot even be quantified as these depths remain unexplored.  The damage can never be undone.  Maritime species yet to be discovered may be rendered extinct without us ever knowing that they existed.  The record of our stewardship stands in shame.<\/p><p>The north-west coast is now, and will become, even more important in terms of the Naval Service's responsibility towards our national security.  It is a site of important communications cables.  If we have learned anything at all in the past while it is the vulnerability of our State's cybersecurity.<\/p><p>Last summer I commented on the presence of a British Royal Navy warship in the waters off the coast of Donegal.  This is just one of many foreign warships that use Irish waters for manoeuvres.  It is a matter of fact that when conducting anti-submarine warfare drills in British sovereign waters, the Royal Navy is required by law to consult with environmental groups and abide by strict requirements that prevent harm or injury to marine life such as whales, dolphins and porpoises.  The Royal Navy, however, is not subject to any such laws or requirements in Irish waters.<\/p><p>I put it to the Minister of State that this is totally unacceptable.  There are numerous recorded instances of the stranding of whales and dolphins around our coast as a direct result of the activities of foreign navies.<\/p> <p>We know they are responsible as the Irish Naval Service does not possess anti-submarine warfare capacity.  There is a real need that steps be taken to protect Irish marine life.<\/p> <p> I also want to mention the issue of the disputed jurisdiction of Rockall.  Lying off the Irish coast, it is an area contested by Britain, Denmark and Iceland.  It is valuable in terms of the natural resources that lie in its vicinity and its rich fishing grounds form an important hunting ground for Irish trawlers, which have a long history of association with the area.  Since the British withdrawal from the EU under Brexit, the rights of Irish trawlers to fish there have been curtailed.  We have had instances of Irish trawlers being forced out of the area, out of Irish waters, by British warships.  The question must be asked as to why.  It is because the Irish Government, for whatever reason, has failed to assert the sovereignty of the Irish people over Irish waters.<\/p> <p> The British have made claims on Rockall going back as far as 1955.  In 1988, the Irish Government conceded that a large part of Rockall was under British jurisdiction.  In 1988, Eamon Gilmore made a further agreement with the British, which was concluded on the basis of EU membership and commitments under the EU Common Fisheries Policy.  This agreement has been rendered null and void as a consequence of Brexit.  The Government needs to revisit this agreement.  In the post-Brexit world, in the interests of the nation, the Government needs to restate Ireland's claim to Rockall, in order to allow Ireland to continue to pursue its EU fishing quota under the Common Fisheries Policy and under the principle of equal conditions of access in British waters.<\/p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in will not support the Bill on the grounds the Government is rushing it through and not discussing it with key stakeholders or allowing it to be scrutinised by them, most especially, the Irish fishing sector.  Our approach will depend on how the Minister of State and his colleagues in government approach the amendments that will be tabled.  I sincerely hope, given the concerns I have outlined and the feedback we have received from many NGOs and academics, that the Government will approach this in a spirit of goodwill and take on board the amendments we plan to table on Committee Stage to strengthen the legislation, to ensure it is fit for purpose, to improve it and, most importantly, to ensure it protects our sovereign rights over all our waters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300051#BBB00200","speaker":"1625","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622736300,"counter":427,"content":"<p>We all understand what the Bill is supposed to be trying to do, which is to bring together and consolidate into one Act various pieces of legislation on maritime law.  The truth is that for most people, living on an island is something they very seldom think about or have any knowledge of.  However, it is something that can have severe repercussions for us as an island nation if we do not get it right.  This is why it is important that the Bill is taken at a proper pace and that the Government considers it properly, consults widely and ensures it has the action right when it considers the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  For many people, the issue is about fishing and those who use the sea as a means of making their livelihood.  Many of those in the fishing industry have grave concerns about what the repercussions of the law might be and how they might affect them and their industry and the future of people who live in coastal communities who depend on the fishing industry.<\/p>  <p>  It always strikes me that people who live in our coastal communities have a huge gripe.  Many of them are small fishermen with small boats.  They are inshore fishermen who cannot make a living or get a quota.  They always find themselves foul of laws made in faraway places, which are supposed to be to protect the environment but they see the environment around them being ravaged by big fishing vessels that are simply there to make maximum profit from the sea while they and their communities suffer and cannot make a living.  This is the chasm that exists between what laws set out to do and what they actually achieve, which frustrates and annoys many people.<\/p>  <p>  We need to look very carefully at this legislation as we move forward with it.  The issues we have, particularly regarding the sea and what lies beneath it, and the damage being done to it through fishing and other industries, is something on which we have to have very tight laws.  Geological surveys are continually being carried out for all kinds of activity, mainly in the search for minerals and carbon in industries such as coal, oil and gas.  We are told we are supposed to be moving away from these and leaving them behind and that we are switching to sustainable and new industries, and yet we find all of these geological surveys are being carried out around our coastline and every coastline in the world and they are damaging the seabed so much and the ecology there.  One of the 17 sustainable development goals of the United Nations is about life under water and life under the sea and how we make sure we preserve it.  We are committed to doing this but so much of the activity that happens from an industrial perspective in our waters flies directly in the face of it.<\/p>  <p>  We need to rethink much of what we are doing.  There needs to be an emphasis on ensuring we deliver for the people who make their living from the sea so they can see this is about protecting their livelihoods and protecting this natural resource and making sure we do not destroy it for future generations.  The ecology of the ocean is as much a part of making sure we protect ourselves from climate change and everything else as what we do on land, and perhaps it is even more important.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of Rockall and its jurisdiction has also been raised.  Ireland had always considered it to be part of the Irish nation but we find that while Britain claims it other jurisdictions also seek to claim it, including Denmark and Iceland.  The fact it was simply sold away in the past by a previous Government is something we should reconsider.  I suggest the Bill should examine whether we can reaffirm our rights for all of our island.  Only 10% of the Irish nation is above sea level and the rest of it is underwater.  While they may be European waters as part of the EU, at the same time we as an Irish nation have a right to defend our jurisdiction and we should do everything we possibly can to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300052#CCC00200","speaker":"1607"},{"type":"speech","time":1622736300,"counter":428,"content":"<p>I am very pleased to have an opportunity to speak on the Maritime Jurisdiction Bill presented by the Minister of State.  As the Minister of State has indicated, this is a consolidation Bill to set out the legal framework for Ireland's maritime jurisdiction.  As the Minister of State explained section by section, it is quite a technical Bill not only consolidating enactments going back a very long time but also, in essence, an enabling Bill for the State to set out its jurisdiction over maritime areas in clear legal framework terms.<\/p>  <p>  The national maritime framework has been discussed in the House.  In truth, very limited discussion took place on it and most Members who spoke were very critical of the amount of time the matter received.  There will be further significant legislation that will address many of the issues the maritime framework has touched upon in operational terms.<\/p>  <p>  Unlike land planning, much of what can be regulated at sea is subject to international law.  Treaties are negotiated over time.  The Minister of State probably instanced the most important of these, which is the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, which was concluded in 1982.  This important legislation determined international territorial waters, for example, the 12 mile nautical limit.  Prior to that, various limits existed, with some claiming territorial limits of 12 miles and others claiming territorial limits of 200 miles.<\/p> <p>It was agreed that would be, as the Minister of State has explained also, an economic zone with different rights accruing to the sovereign state than the extensive rights that accrue to our territorial waters.<\/p> <p> No doubt there is renewed focus on the marine environment right now.  The fact that there are enactments and various debates before this House underscores that.  It has not always been the case.  Quite often, despite the fact that we are an island nation, we have turned our back to the sea and focused more on terrestrial activities to our great detriment but we now need to focus differently not only on our waters, but on the oceans in general.  We need to look at it from an environmental perspective, from a fisheries perspective, from an energy perspective and from a transport perspective.  I hope to touch upon all of those in the few minutes that I have because each of those areas of important activity is critical to us as an island nation.<\/p> <p> The first principle in claiming to have legal rights over any space, be it territorial or maritime, is dependent on our ability to map that space, to know what is in it and to know that we have the capacity to protect and defend the legal rights that we assert.  This legislation gives to the Oireachtas and the Government the capacity to set out what our sovereign territorial areas in our maritime coasts are but it is meaningless if we do not have the capacity to vindicate those rights.<\/p> <p> The Naval Service was strengthened with four new modern vessels in recent years and in the worst of times, the resources were found to provide that level of capital investment which is absolutely critical.  There is now never a greater need than since Brexit for a strong and independently sustainable Naval Service.  However, we have an enduring and wholly unacceptable crisis in the Defence Forces generally, but particularly among that skill set we need to keep our ships at sea and our aircraft in the air.  Ships, over the past year, have remained tied up in port for want of specialist crew.  This follows a previous decision to take ships out of operations and to disperse their crews in a desperate effort to provide adequate ships company to keep at least some of our naval vessels on patrol at sea.  The flight of skilled people from all branches of our military continues despite commitments to address and resolve this crisis given repeatedly in this House.  The root causes have long been identified.  In a report, Workplace Climate in the Defences Forces, the Defence Forces personnel themselves underscored what was required.  They addressed the key issues of pay and living conditions, career management and performance management, culture and stress and the process of recruitment and training.  I will not go into all these matters.  I have not the time.  That particular report, among others, set out the recommendations and the specific actions needed to resolve these difficulties.  There has been endless discussion and the reality of loss of personnel and gross under-staffing remains.  That poses a real threat to the security of the State, our capacity to intercept illegal cargoes including drugs and our capacity to carry out our legal commitments to fulfil our undertakings to our EU partners to protect our fishing waters and our fishing resources.  It also impacts on our capacity to safeguard the very marine areas that this Bill gives the Oireachtas and the Government the powers to designate.<\/p> <p> This issue has become a matter of national embarrassment, quite frankly, as we depend now on others to vindicate Ireland's sovereignty.  We cherish Ireland's sovereignty.  We celebrate its vindication and its acquiring but we are betraying that sovereignty if we have not the capacity to ensure that our waters are properly protected.<\/p> <p> In the air, too, the Air Corps was promised the replacement of the CASA maritime patrol aircraft.  Those particular two aircraft have been in active service since 1994.  It was agreed some years ago that they would be replaced by two new Airbus C295 aircraft.  Those were ordered in 2019 but they are not due to arrive until 2023.  I cannot understand any level of procurement that would take years to come about because I understand that the Czech airforce at the same time placed an order for two aircraft that are being delivered this year.  All of this is a cause of deep worry and I hope something that will now finally be resolved and addressed because it makes a nonsense of setting out our sovereign territorial rights if we simply do not have the capacity to enforce them.<\/p> <p> I want to talk about the areas that I have set out.  The first area I want to focus on briefly is energy.<\/p> <p> The Government energy strategy is to reach zero carbon and is hugely dependent on offshore wind as a significant component of the generation of electricity to meet that target.  It is clear that this energy will be developed in two phases with fixed turbines in the shallower waters off our east coast being developed first in phase one and the more technologically challenging floating turbines which will be required to harness the enormous potential of wind off our west coast to follow in a second phase as the technology evolves and is developed.  Each of these huge investments - absolutely required if we are to have energy sustainability for ourselves and to decarbonise as we promised - will need to be serviced.  The decision on which port will service each of these major developments on the east coast and on the west coast is urgently awaited.  Certainly, a decision to decide which port will service east coast wind - I have spoken to the companies which want to invest in the development of this wind potential - is urgently required now.  There is no guarantee that enormous capacity will be serviced from a port in the Republic of Ireland.  The ports of Liverpool and Pembroke are clearly in the running.  It would be an enormous failure of the State if we lost to a British port the capacity to service offshore wind off our own coast and that is potentially to happen.  I understand that there is a huge reluctance in Government to pick a champion and say this is the right port.  Obviously, I will advocate for the port of Rosslare.  Rosslare Europort will make its own case.  It is commonsense in terms of its location and capacity and it already has been used as the port to do the pilot work for the Arklow Bank turbines that are already in place.<\/p> <p>It will make its own case and stand on its own merits, but it needs investment.  There is a notion that the Government is reluctant, be that down to a shyness over state aid rules or some other reason, to decide that we need to have a port within the Republic that can do this work and that we will support it in its bid to do so.  Let me be crystal clear - if we do not champion a port and instead leave this to the marketplace, we will lose this business to one of the ports I have mentioned or another port outside our jurisdiction.  That would be a crying shame.  I hope the Minister of State will take note of what I have said and bring it back to his Government colleagues, as we need to determine a champion.  State aid rules will not apply in Liverpool, Pembroke and so on.  The Welsh and English Governments will be willing to ensure their ports have the capacity to make this bid.  I will be watching the matter with extraordinary interest.<\/p> <p> I wish to discuss fisheries.  There is a genuine and understandable sense in the fishing industry of being let down at the deal struck on Brexit insofar as it impacted on that sector.  The Government has acknowledged this.  It is not an acceptable or good deal for the fishing industry.  In the negotiations, the State had many clear objectives.  The House set objectives for the Government, foremost among which was maintaining European solidarity as well as a border-free island of Ireland post Brexit.  The latter was an essential objective, one that skilled negotiation and the holding of solidarity among the EU 27 achieved for us, but I am afraid it was done at a cost.  Part of that cost is now being paid by the fishing sector.  In truth, this is compounding the long-held and strong view of our fishing industry, one that is difficult to argue against, that from the outset of our EU membership, which by and large has been very positive for the State, our economy, our people and our development, the industry was sacrificed in our initial EEC negotiations to safeguard other interests that were regarded as more important at the time.  We must not compound that view now.  I ask that we seek again to rebalance the agreement so as to ensure the significant advances we have made in developing a fishing industry with markets all over the world.  I was privileged in a former role as Minister to present sea products from my own constituency and across the island of Ireland at fairs in Japan and China, where there are large markets and considerable potential.  However, we must ensure the industry has the capacity to continue operating.<\/p> <p> Regarding transport, direct connectivity from this island is essential.  We have long depended on the UK land bridge for the bulk of our exports to continental Europe.  The situation has changed substantially, though.  Since 1 January, the number of direct sailings from Rosslare Europort to continental Europe have increased by more than 400%.  This is a remarkable change.  I had the pleasure of chairing the economic committee of the British-Ireland Parliamentary Assembly last week where submissions made by interested parties indicated that the increase was likely to be a permanent change.  We need to ensure this direct connectivity is maintained, we seek other ports and, through the Irish Maritime Development Office and the Department of Transport, we drive more connectivity so that we are not dependent on the land bridge.  Of course the land bridge will continue to operate, but if we can get our goods directly to markets through direct ferry links between this country and continental Europe, we should be developing those new markets.  I am not referring just to the traditional ports in France and new ones that have come on stream since 1 January, but also other connections through Spain, the Netherlands and further afield.  We need to connect Ireland in a maritime sense in the same way as we have connected Ireland by air to places over the past 20 years without the old dependence on transiting through London if we wanted to go anywhere.  We have changed that dependence over the past 20 years and we now need to have same mindset when it comes to the maritime sector and have many more ports connecting this country to markets across Europe and further afield.<\/p> <p> The marine environment is important.  There is no point in us talking about claiming sovereignty if we do not live up to our responsibilities to maintain a pristine environment.  We have fallen down in terms of sewage discharge and the level of investment in treatment plants.  Significant capital investment is still required.  The dependence of Irish Water on being in the same queue as schools, hospitals and health centres for money to undertake this vital work is a great disadvantage.  I hope that we can find some mechanism for it to be able to borrow off balance sheet in the same was as the ESB has done so that it might provide an infrastructure that ensures that our waters are pristine and we as a nation are not contributing to the pollution of the seas.<\/p> <p> This is important legislation, if largely technical.  When the other Bill, which is not a Department of Foreign Affairs measure, is before the House, we will have an opportunity to deal in more detail with some of the issues that I have set out.  In general terms, though, a consolidation of our capacity to set out our jurisdiction is something that I welcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300052#CCC00300","speaker":"1620","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622737500,"counter":431,"content":"<p>Like other Deputies, I have reservations about what underscores this Bill and the bestowing upon the Minister of potentially sweeping powers by means of a simple statutory instrument.  It is impossible to support the Bill without substantial amendment, which we in Sinn F&eacute;in intend to do.  We believe that the Bill's fast-tracking without proper due diligence is not good governance, given that the Bill will have major economic and social implications for our country and, importantly, future generations for years to come.<\/p>  <p>  Perhaps the Minister of State will respond to my first question.  Were this legislation to pass, would it be possible for a Minister to create maritime areas that would include tax incentives and free economic zones controlled entirely or partly by other jurisdictions?  How much of this would be done through a mere statutory instrument and without full Oireachtas scrutiny?<\/p>  <p>  So far, there have been limited consultations on the Bill with fishers, the tourism industry and coastal communities.  Fishers in my area of Wexford are already facing the fallout of Brexit and the recent slashing of quotas.  They feel abandoned by Government policies that directly put their industry under economic threat.  We can add the small charter boat industry to that.  To think that the livelihoods of those involved could depend on the stroke of a Minister's pen is unbelievable.  They should also be consulted when legislation like this is being proposed by the Government.  Let us consider the example of wind farms.  We know how urgent it is that we move to renewable energy.  Unfortunately, it seems that not everyone is on board with the prime principle of a fair and just transition.  I am concerned about the management and impact of this essential infrastructure on small businesses and nearby communities that make their living from our waters and seas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060300054#EEE00200","speaker":"1621"}]
