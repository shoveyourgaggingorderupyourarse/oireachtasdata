The NBP will ensure that in all such cases a future proofed high speed broadband network will be built to serve these premises and work to deliver on this is underway.  <\/p>  <p>  I am advised by National Broadband Ireland (NBI) that, as of 31 January, almost 296,000 premises have been surveyed or have survey underway, with over 154,000 premises constructed or under construction across all counties. NBI has also advised that premises are connected in 16 counties; Carlow, Cavan, Clare, Cork, Galway, Kerry, Kildare, Laois, Limerick, Louth, Monaghan, Roscommon, Sligo, Tipperary, Wexford and Wicklow and over 54,500 premises are available to order and pre-order across 21 counties.  In County Tipperary surveying is underway in the Deployment Area of Cahir, surveying is complete in the Deployment Areas of Nenagh and Mullinahone, pre works are underway in the Deployment Areas of Cashel and Roscrea and main works are ongoing in the Deployment Areas of Tipperary and Clonmel.

Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. NBI has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to the challenges to the delivery of the NBP due to the Covid-19 pandemic, NBI has faced a range of other challenges due to the sheer scale and complexity of rolling out fibre to the home in a rural environment. These include significant tree trimming to ensure cable can be placed on overhead poles, remediation of ducting that has been in place for many decades, the co-ordination of hundreds of contracting crews and addressing the many issues arising week on week which could not have been foreseen until the build crews commenced work on the ground. My Department has worked closely with NBI to put in place a remedial plan under the Contract. This plan addresses delays experienced by NBI, primarily arising as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, and re-baselines milestones for 2021. Work is underway to re-baseline milestones for 2022 and beyond. This has resulted in some changes to timeframes for connection for end users.  <\/p>  <p>  Given the scale and complexity of delivery of the new high speed broadband network under the NBP, I am advised that any dates provided by NBI on its website are based on the best available information at the time and may be subject to change. NBI has recently published details of its full deployment schedule on its website, www.nbi.ie, which enables all premises within the intervention area to have an anticipated service activation date range.  <\/p>  <p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network.

Ireland has a progressive income tax system which is structured such that the more income you have, the more tax you pay. As a person&rsquo;s income increases, they move up through the various rates and bands and, as a result, while the levels of take home pay increase overall, the amount of tax they pay also increases. <\/p><p>However, if the issue behind the Deputy's question is whether the current tax treatment of private landlords is a factor that is driving rent price increases, I would note that tax changes in this space in recent years have been aimed at encouraging supply through a relatively modest reduction in the burden of taxation on such persons.  Essentially, they involved the implementation of two of the short-term options presented in the <i>Report of the Working Group on the Tax and Fiscal Treatment of Rental Accommodation Providers<\/i>(2017).  The first related to allowing deductibility for pre-letting expenditure for previously vacant properties (extended recently in Finance Act 2021).

The tax provisions are intended to create a tax neutral regime for bona-fide securitisation and structured finance purposes.  The section 110 regime enables noteholders to invest through one structured vehicle, without giving rise to an additional layer of tax as compared to a direct investment in the underlying assets.<\/p><p>Securitisation allows banks to raise capital and to share risk and, by providing a repackaging and resale market for corporate debt, it lowers the cost of debt financing.  It is accepted that having the option for more diversified sources of financing is good for investment and business.  It is also important for financial stability in the economy, as the ability to securitise loan books plays an important role in allowing banks to meet their capital requirement obligations and to continue lending to businesses and individuals.<\/p><p>To come within the section 110 regime, a company must be a &ldquo;qualifying company&rdquo; and fulfil a number of conditions, including in relation to the type of assets that the company can hold and in turn the nature of activities that may be undertaken by the company. To be a qualifying company, section 110 TCA 1997 requires (among other things) that:<\/p><p>(1) The company is tax resident in Ireland and carries on the business of holding or managing &quot;<i>qualifying assets<\/i>&quot;.  Generally speaking, qualifying assets are assets in respect of which securitisation transactions are undertaken.  This includes a broad range of financial and other assets including shares, bonds, derivatives, loans, deposits, commodities, plant and machinery and invoices and other types of receivable. <\/p><p>(2) The value of qualifying assets is at least &euro;10 million at the time they were acquired by the section 110 company.<\/p><p>(3) Apart from the holding or managing of the qualifying assets, the company is not carrying on any other activities. <\/p><p>Department of Finance officials, together with officials in Revenue, monitor the sector and the operation of section 110 on an ongoing basis, with a view to taking action should it be deemed necessary. <\/p><p>For example, in 2019 Department officials prepared a report on Real Estate Investment Trusts, Irish Real Estate Funds and section 110 companies as they invest in the Irish property market. This report was presented to the Tax Strategy Group in July 2019 and informed the amendments to the section 110 regime introduced in Finance Act 2019. These amendments strengthened the significant restrictions to the deductions which a section 110 company can claim for payment of profit participating notes to a specified person. The amendments also placed the section&rsquo;s main purpose test on an objective basis, which enables Revenue to more effectively challenge abuse of the legislation. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020900064#WRC03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","counter":91,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020900064#WRC03800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Office of Public Works","counter":90,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020900064#WRC03700"},{"type":"question","counter":91,"qnumday":59,"qnumall":"[6948\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020900064#WRC03800","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he plans to replace the current commissioner structure at the Office of Public Works with a new assistant secretary level senior management team given OPW&rsquo;s recent appointment in this regard;

that some persons are waiting extremely long periods and others receive passports in a couple of days; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1499","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":157,"content":"<p>The Passport Service is currently processing 45% of adult online renewal application in one working day, while 99% of online child renewal passports are issued within the advertised processing time of 15 working days. The processing times for these standard online renewal passport applications compare very favourably to processing times internationally in countries such as the UK, United States, Canada and Australia.<\/p>  <p>  The Passport Service is currently experiencing high demand for first time passports, particularly for children. First time passport applications do take longer to process and there are a number of reasons for this: <\/p>  <p>- It is important to check the applicant&rsquo;s identity and their entitlement to Irish citizenship. The Irish passport was recently ranked 5th   in the Henley Global Passport Index as it provides our citizens with visa-free access to 187 countries. This is something we can all be proud of. However, in order to maintain this ranking and to protect the integrity of the Irish passport, the Passport Service must validate the true identity of the applicant and take measures to confirm the applicant&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship. Accordingly, a rigorous analysis process is in place to verify the identity and citizenship status of first time applicants<\/p>  <p>  - In the case of children, it is essential that the Passport Service verifies the consent of the child&rsquo;s guardians before a passport can issue. This ensures that the Passport Service protects the rights of the child and their guardians.<\/p>  <p>  - Due to the intensive analysis and extra measures undertaken by highly trained and experienced staff, first time applications take 40 working days to process. <\/p>  <p>  While there is a very high volume of applications in the system, this does not represent a backlog. Figures show that there are currently 76,000 (53%) applications that are fully complete and are being processed by the Passport Service. There are also 67,000 applications (47%) in the system where the Passport Service is waiting for the customer to complete the application. In these cases, the onus is on the customer to submit the required documents to the Service. <\/p>  <p>  In the case of children's passports, recent Passport Service figures show that in the case of 77% of incomplete children's first time and renewal applications, parents have completed the online registration process but have not yet submitted the witnessed identity and consent form or important documents such as the child's birth certificate. In these cases, the Passport Service simply cannot move the application forward until the required documentation is received and the processing time will take longer. The Passport Service makes every effort to contact applicants in such circumstances. However, their experience is that many applicants take weeks and sometimes months to send in the necessary documents.<\/p>  <p>  The current turnaround time for An Post&rsquo;s mail-in &ldquo;Passport Express&rdquo; service is 8 weeks. Proposed turnaround times for 2022 aim to reduce this processing time. Passport Online is the priority channel for applications as there are many efficiencies built into the system for both the applicant and the Passport Service. The Passport Online Service is four times quicker than paper-based applications for adult and child renewal applications and is the fastest, easiest and safest way to apply for a passport. Over 90% of applicants now apply online compared to 47% of applications received online in 2019.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has been pro-actively planning to ensure the necessary resources are in place to meet the current and expected level of demand in 2022. The Passport Service is currently implementing a number of measures that will positively impact the current turnaround times and improve customer service including the allocation of additional staff, intensive training of new staff and upskilling of existing staff and the prioritisation of first time applications. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, a new document management process is being put in place that allows for a much quicker turnaround time when an applicant is asked to submit additional documents. Once these documents are received, they will be prioritised and complete applications will be processed in 3 weeks. This will greatly reduce the waiting time for applicants who are missing documents in their initial application. <\/p>  <p>  I strongly urge anyone who is considering travelling overseas this year, particularly families with young children, to check the validity of their passports before booking travel and to apply for their passports online in plenty of time.<\/p>  <p>  Passport Online can be accessed by all first time applicants, irrespective of age, both children and adults, in Ireland, Northern Ireland, Great Britain, Europe, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the USA.

Government accounting rules require that any additional Appropriations in Aid received, above the estimate, must be surrendered to the Exchequer. In addition, any amount of the budget allocation not fully expended must also be surrendered.<\/p><p>Expenditure under the Army Pensions Vote is essentially demand-driven and non-discretionary. In any given year, it is very difficult to predict accurately the exact number of voluntary early retirements from the Defence Forces with entitlement to immediate payment of retirement benefits and as a result, there can be an underspend or a requirement for additional funding. Such additional funding is met through the Supplementary Estimate process. In 2018, an additional &euro;3.5 million was required and in 2019, an additional &euro;1.9 million was needed. These amounts were met from savings in the Defence Vote.<\/p><p>In relation to the Defence Vote, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, any savings arising in the Vote, when not utilised to meet requirements in the Army Pensions Vote, are normally reallocated to address spending pressures elsewhere in the Defence Vote.  However in 2021, similar to many other Public Service organisations, the impact of Covid-19 and supply chain difficulties limited the extent to which my Department was able to re-direct these savings.<\/p><p>The tables below show the Net Exchequer Surrender and its constituent elements, including the total underspend for both Votes.<\/p><p><b>Table 1 &ndash; Vote 35 Army Pensions<\/b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Vote 35 Army Pensions <\/th>       <th>Net Exchequer Surrender (&euro;m)<\/th>       <th>Additional A-in-As Received (&euro;m)<\/th>       <th>Underspend (&euro;m)<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2018 <\/td>       <td>&euro;0.5<\/td>       <td>&euro;0.2<\/td>       <td>&euro;0.3<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2019 <\/td>       <td>&euro;0.2<\/td>       <td>&euro;0.1<\/td>       <td>&euro;0.1<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 <\/td>       <td>&euro;8.1<\/td>       <td>&euro;0 <\/td>       <td>&euro;8.1<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2021* <\/td>       <td>&euro;2.7<\/td>       <td>&euro;0 <\/td>       <td>&euro;2.7<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>*provisional figures<\/p><p><b>Table 2 &ndash; Vote 36 Defence<\/b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Vote 36 Defence <\/th>       <th>Net Exchequer Surrender (&euro;m)<\/th>       <th>Additional A-in-As Received (&euro;m)<\/th>       <th>Amount Reallocated for Vote 35 Supplementary Estimate (&euro;m)<\/th>       <th>Underspend (&euro;m)<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2018 <\/td>       <td>&euro;17.0<\/td>       <td>&euro;11.1<\/td>       <td>&euro;3.5<\/td>       <td>&euro;2.4<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2019 <\/td>       <td>&euro;11.4<\/td>       <td>&euro;9.4<\/td>       <td>&euro;1.9<\/td>       <td>&euro;0.1<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 <\/td>       <td>&euro;6.2<\/td>       <td>&euro;6.1<\/td>       <td>n\/a<\/td>       <td>&euro;0.1<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2021* <\/td>       <td>&euro;29.1<\/td>       <td>&euro;6.1<\/td>       <td>n\/a<\/td>       <td>&euro;23.0 <\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>*provisional figures<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020900066#WRE01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces","counter":161,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020900066#WRE01600"},{"type":"question","counter":162,"qnumday":83,"qnumall":"[6928\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020900066#WRE01700","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the breakdown of the infrastructural development plan for the Defence Forces; the total amount allocated; the amount allocated to each barracks and training centre; the timeframe involved in the plan; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1564","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":163,"content":"<p>The Defence Forces built infrastructure programme (IDP) as published in January 2020 provides a blueprint for investment in the Defence Forces built infrastructure over a multi annual timeframe.

This was acknowledged in the Comprehensive Review of the Special Needs Assistant Scheme (SNAs) published by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) in 2018. <\/p>  <p>  The Review made a number of recommendations regarding SNAs including the training needs of SNAs.  In this regard, the NCSE recommended that a new national training programme at Level 5 of the National Qualification Framework be developed for existing SNAs who do not have the requisite level of training and for new SNAs on appointment.  The NCSE also recommended that training tailored to the complex needs of some students would also be provided. <\/p>  <p>  The policy advice has been considered by my Department. It was decided that priority would be given to the development of a training programme for SNAs who may not have had a recent opportunity to access a training programme tailored to their role. <\/p>  <p>  The first national training programme for SNAs is now in place and it aims to enhance the knowledge, skills and expertise of SNAs whose work is central to the inclusion of students with additional care and complex needs in school life. The programme is fully funded by my Department and delivered at no cost to the SNA. <\/p>  <p>  There are 3,500 places available on the online programme over 4 years.  Each phase of the programme has been fully subscribed to date. 500 have completed the programme and a new cohort of 1,000 commenced the programme last September.<\/p>  <p>  As this is the first programme, it is appropriate to take the time to review outcomes and this will inform the future approach to ongoing training and professional development of SNAs. Part of that consideration will include accreditation.<\/p>  <p>  Raising the minimum qualification for appointment as a special needs assistant has been raised by the FORSA union and has been referred to the Workplace Relations Commission.  My Department is engaging in that process.<\/p>  <p>  The recruitment and appointment of Special Needs Assistants is a matter for each individual school authority. In addition, the actual requirements for a post will vary depending on the specific needs of the children and the school to which the SNA is to be appointed. My Department does not believe that the existing minimum qualifications has impacted on the calibre of person appointed and it is also the case that people with experience and\/or higher qualifications than the minimum are often the successful candidate in competitions held by schools.<\/p>  <p>  However, having considered the claim and, in particular, the period of time since they were set, my Department is open to reviewing the entry requirements for SNAs. My Department has also agreed to a review of the SNA contract which was agreed as part of the Building Momentum national pay agreement.   My Department is prioritising the contract review and this will be followed by a review of the entry qualifications. <\/p>  <p>  II am satisfied that the approach outlined fully recognises the important place of SNAs in our schools.

This spans the curriculum in schools, culture and environment, quality of teaching, learning and assessment, student support and pastoral care, guidance counselling and the provision of professional development for teachers.   <\/p>  <p>  The Department&rsquo;s Wellbeing Policy Statement and Framework for Practice which was first published in 2018 and refreshed in 2019 describes how schools can best promote wellbeing through the provision of a whole-school, multi-component and preventative approach.<\/p>  <p>  The approach in the Wellbeing Policy is founded on research and best international practice in relation to how schools can best support the wellbeing and mental health of children and young people.  The approach proposed is a whole school and preventative approach which has multiple components that include:<\/p>  <p>  -  Providing children and young people with opportunities to build core social and emotional skills and competencies<\/p>  <p>      -  Providing children and young people with opportunities to experience supportive relationships within the school setting and to learn through those relationships <\/p>  <p>  - Providing children and young people with opportunities to be part of a school environment and culture that feels both physically and psychologically safe, an environment in which children and young people feel a sense of belonging and connectedness, in which they feel their voice is heard, and they feel supported.  <\/p>  <p>  - Schools are encouraged to use a reflective, school self-evaluation approach to identify and prioritise the needs of its own school community in relation to the promotion of wellbeing and mental health, and to respond to meeting those needs. <\/p>  <p>  NEPS provides a comprehensive, school-based psychological service to all primary and post primary schools through the application of psychological theory and practice to support the wellbeing, academic, social and emotional development of all learners. NEPS recognise the importance of whole-school, compassionate and trauma-informed approaches in building safe and connected schools. <\/p>  <p>  NEPS provides a casework service to schools through the assigned NEPS psychologist, Individual casework service involves a high level of psychologist collaboration with teachers and parents, often also working directly with the child\/young person.  NEPS may become involved with supporting individual students where the school&rsquo;s SET team or Student Support Team (in post-primary) feels that the involvement of the psychologist is needed. Psychologists may provide consultation in relation to therapeutic informed approaches to be delivered in the school setting and engage in direct work with an individual student as appropriate. In the event that the need for a more targeted counselling or a specialised intervention is identified by the NEPS psychologist, a referral is made to an outside agency for evaluation and ongoing support.  The NEPS psychologist can identify the most appropriate referral pathway and supports school with the onward referral to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Team (CAMHS), HSE Primary Care\/Community Psychology teams, or an identified local community based specialist mental health service.<\/p>  <p>  NEPS&rsquo; Support and Development work involves the provision of applied psychology services for teachers and school communities to build and maximise their capacity to respond to the needs of all students and those with particular needs. This includes trauma informed education. <\/p>  <p>  As part of this support and development work NEPS has developed a series of Wellbeing and Resilience in schools webinars, exploring the use of whole-school, compassionate and trauma-informed approaches to build safe and connected schools. Part 1, is called &lsquo;The Stress factor - Getting the balance right&rsquo; a webinar for all school staff. This will be followed by a series of special interest modules using the Department&rsquo;s e- learning platform. The approaches outlined in the workshops are based on research findings, on the experience of experts in their fields and on the experience of practising psychologists working in schools. The focus of the workshops is on exploring and understanding the sources and impact of stress on children and young people including attachment, trauma and adverse experiences. The emphasis will be on creating environments to reduce stress and on developing skills all children and young people need to better manage in school. The training will also cover the influences of stress on school staff and how to best to manage this. It is intended that staff will find the content useful in supporting their own wellbeing. The workshops will be available to build the capability of school staff in both primary and post-primary settings. The workshops are for all staff and all students including those with SEN or those children impacted by trauma and adverse experiences. NEPS psychologists will be available to support implementation in schools.<\/p>  <p>  NEPS psychologists have engaged in extensive national training in the area of trauma in recent years with Karen Treisman and Dr David Trickey to inform their practice and inform their development of CPD for school staff.  NEPS has been participating in the 5 Nations ACEs Network for a number of years. This Network includes delegates from government departments, public health bodies, social services and education from the Republic of Ireland, Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales and the United Kingdom.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020900067#WRF01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Examinations","counter":206,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020900067#WRF01500"},{"type":"question","counter":207,"qnumday":98,"qnumall":"[7112\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020900067#WRF01600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if her attention has been drawn to the stress and upset students are experiencing since the announcement of the leaving certificate exams reverting back to written; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1499","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":208,"content":"<p>I am very aware of the disruption and stress experienced by students who are due to take their Leaving Certificate examinations this year.

I have been given Government approval to bring forward legislation on the basis of the agreed proposals for the Scheme and my officials are working on drafting a General Scheme of a Bill as a matter of a priority. As previously stated, I will seek priority drafting of the Bill when submitting the General Scheme to Government to ensure that the Bill can be introduced to the Houses of the Oireachtas as soon as possible thereafter, subject also to any pre-legislative scrutiny process which may take place. Once the legislation has been passed by the Oireachtas and the administrative infrastructure required to deliver the Scheme has been established, the Scheme will be open for applications. I hope that this will be possible by the end of 2022.<\/p><p>The Deputy has asked about an interim payment scheme for older survivors.  My focus is on delivering the Scheme itself as quickly as possible. Once the Scheme is open for applications, it is intended that priority will be given to those who are elderly, and any other categories deemed appropriate for prioritisation.  As the design of the scheme is predicated on a single payment based on evidence of residency, it is not clear how any interim arrangement could be designed more quickly than the scheme itself.  This is because the same administrative infrastructure must be established to receive applications and make payments on this scale, regardless of whether this would be done by way of interim arrangement or through the scheme itself.  Similarly, a legislative basis is needed to govern access to records confirming residency and to provide for eligibility for an enhanced medical card, as well as to ensure that any payments received will be disregarded for the purposes of establishing social welfare entitlements or tax liabilities.  <\/p><p>The proposals for the Scheme are centred on a non-adversarial approach which will be as straightforward as possible for applicants. As the Deputy will be aware, it is intended that an Executive Office will be established in my Department to administer the Scheme. The staff of the Executive Office will be trained to support survivors in completing their applications. Applicants will also be entitled to financial support, subject to agreed limits, to avail of independent legal advice at the point of signing a waiver and should an affidavit be required to support their application.<\/p><p>In terms of eligibility, the Scheme will encompass the 14 Mother and Baby Institutions investigated by the Commission of Investigation and all County Home Institutions. The agreed proposals set out that a person will be eligible for a General Payment if they were either:<\/p><p>a) A pregnant or unmarried mother who was resident in a Mother and Baby or County Home Institution for any period of time, including when under 18 years of age at the time of being pregnant.<\/p><p>b) A person who was resident as a child in a Mother and Baby or County Home Institution for a period of six months or more (and who did not receive redress under the Residential Institutions Redress Scheme).<\/p><p>It is also important to note that the Government's comprehensive <i>Action Plan for Survivors and Former Residents of Mother and Baby and County Home Institutions<\/i>will cater for the needs of all those who are affected by Ireland's complex legacy in this area. In particular, I would reiterate that the overwhelming priority need which has been expressed to me by people who, as children, were adopted or otherwise separated from their birth family, is access to records concerning their birth and early life information. Action 4 of the Action Plan provides for this through the Birth Information and Tracing Bill and the investment which has been made available to support implementation of this legislation, which has recently completed Second Stage in the Dail.<\/p><p>I trust this information in relation to the proposals for the Mother and Baby Institutions Payment Scheme and the broader Action Plan is helpful.

Neither Minister McEntee nor I have a role in these independent functions. <\/p>  <p>  Minister McEntee is regularly kept appraised on matters under the Commissioner's remit by Commissioner Harris and his management team, including on matters related to violent crime.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, I established an Expert Forum on Anti-Social Behaviour (ASB) last year. This forum is considering the effectiveness of existing legislation and looking at proposals for new ways forward, including whether new powers for Garda&iacute; and additional interventions to support parenting of offenders are needed. Members of the Forum, which I chair, include An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Government Departments, community groups, business community members and NGOs. <\/p>  <p>  The Forum is examining a broad range of issues with a focus on developing measures which will counteract the negative impact of ASB on community morale and quality of life. This has included two subgroups established to consider the specific issues of knife crime and the misuse of scramblers and quad bikes. Other subgroups may be established to tackle additional specific issues as required.<\/p>  <p>  The knife crime subgroup is assessing available evidence to inform policy on knife crime, with particular reference to effectiveness of proposals, to inform both legislation and community safety policies, programmes and practices. The work of this subgroup is ongoing and is expected to conclude in Q1 2022.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, there is a comprehensive and robust legal framework in place in Ireland with respect to knife crime including heavy penalties for breaches of the laws concerned. Indeed, the maximum penalty in the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act 1990 for a conviction for possessing a knife in a public place without good reason or lawful authority was increased from one to five years in an amendment introduced via the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.<\/p>  <p>  Legislative responses alone will not provide a ready solution and evidence from other jurisdictions indicate that simply adopting harsher penalties will not lead to a reduction in the incidence of these crimes. Our existing five year sentence for knife possession is longer than in the UK, for example, where a four year penalty applies.

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The NHSS covers the cost of the standard components of long-term residential care which are: <\/p>  <p>  - Nursing and personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the person <\/p>  <p>  - Bed and board <\/p>  <p>  - Basic aids and appliances necessary to assist a person with the activities of daily living <\/p>  <p>  - Laundry service<\/p>  <p>  A person's eligibility for other schemes, such as the medical card scheme or the drugs payment scheme, is unaffected by participation in the NHSS or residence in a nursing home.  In determining the services covered by the NHSS it was considered very important that the care recipient and the taxpayer would be protected and would not end up paying for the same services twice. For this reason, medications and aids that are already prescribed for individuals under an existing scheme are not included in the services covered by the NHSS, as this would involve effectively paying twice for the same service.<\/p>  <p>  Although the NHSS covers core living expenses, residents can still incur some costs in a nursing home, such as social programmes, newspapers or hairdressing. In recognition of this, anyone in receipt of financial support under the NHSS retains at least 20% of their income. The minimum amount that is retained is the equivalent of 20% of the State Pension (Non-Contributory). An operator should not seek payment from residents for items which are covered by the NHSS, the medical card or any other existing scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Part 7 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013 stipulates that the registered provider of the nursing home must agree a contract in writing with each resident on their admission to the nursing home. This contract must include details of the services to be provided to that resident and the fees to be charged. Residents should never be charged fees which are not set out in the contract. The Department of Health and the HSE are not a party to such contracts which are concluded between each resident and their nursing home.<\/p>  <p>  Registered providers of nursing home care are obliged to provide an accessible and effective complaints procedure.  Concerns about additional charges should in the first instance be taken up with the nursing home provider.  The Office of the Ombudsman can examine complaints about the actions of a range of public bodies and, from 24 August 2015, complaints relating to the administrative actions of private nursing homes. The Office of the Ombudsman normally only deals with a complaint once the individual has already gone through the complaints procedure of the private nursing home concerned.<\/p>  <p>  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) is an independent statutory body with a dual mandate to enforce competition and consumer protection law in Ireland. CCPC&rsquo;s mission is to promote competition and enhance consumer welfare. The CCPC has published consumer protection guidelines for contracts of care in long-term residential care services for older people. The guidelines set out the obligations and responsibilities that providers must adhere to under consumer protection law and are aimed at providing greater transparency, clarity and certainty for consumers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020900068#WRG03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services","counter":269,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020900068#WRG03400"},{"type":"question","counter":270,"qnumday":120,"qnumall":"[6771\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020900068#WRG03500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 1719 of 19 January 2022, the population size of the North Lee and South Lee catchments served by a new adult mental health rehabilitation consultant psychiatrist in County Cork; if there will be a full multidisciplinary team working alongside them; the time frame for their recruitment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1559","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":271,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020900068#WRG03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff","counter":272,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020900068#WRG03700"},{"type":"question","counter":273,"qnumday":121,"qnumall":"[6775\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020900068#WRG03800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he plans to carry out an investigation into the treatment of a person (details supplied) and the circumstances which led to them resigning from the HSE; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1567","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":274,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020900068#WRG03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Services","counter":275,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020900068#WRG04000"},{"type":"question","counter":276,"qnumday":122,"qnumall":"[6776\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020900068#WRG04100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of children on waiting lists for early intervention services by CHO, age category and time waiting in tabular form.","asker":"1567","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":277,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020900068#WRG04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1484"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":279,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020900069#WRH00200"},{"type":"question","counter":280,"qnumday":123,"qnumall":"[6777\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020900069#WRH00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will respond to correspondence from a group (details supplied); and if he will agree to its request for a meeting.","asker":"1567","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":281,"content":"<p>I acknowledge that waiting times for many hospital procedures and appointments are unacceptably long.

I remain committed to working to reduce waiting times for patients.<\/p>  <p>  Children with a range of needs rely on the orthopaedic service of Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland, for example children with Spina Bifida, hip deformity, and other orthopaedic needs. The complex patient needs of these children remains at the forefront of service provision.<\/p>  <p>  I remain acutely aware of the need to improve access to orthopaedic patients, particularly for those patients with acute medical needs.  On the 7th February 2022, I met with senior officials of Children&rsquo;s Heath Ireland (CHI) and the HSE, as well as senior orthopaedic clinicians from Temple Street, Crumlin and Cappagh, to discuss increased orthopaedic activity at CHI and additional activity levels which will work to reduce the number of children waiting for spinal orthopaedic procedures including Spina Bifida, by year end. <\/p>  <p>  My Department continues to work with the HSE and Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland to deliver improved paediatric orthopaedic services. In 2018 Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland was provided with an additional &euro;9 million in funding to address paediatric orthopaedic waiting lists, including the provision of scoliosis services. This funding is recurring and has been provided in the base HSE allocation each year since 2018. The additional funding supported the recruitment of approximately 60 WTEs in 2018 and 2019 to enable the expansion of paediatric orthopaedic services. The posts relate to the multi-disciplinary team at diagnosis, pre-assessment, during surgery in theatre, and post operatively.<\/p>  <p>  More specifically, in order to tackle waiting lists for scoliosis, and orthopaedic paediatric surgery more broadly, an additional &euro;5 million has recently been committed to improve access, including through additional theatre and diagnostic capacity to be brought on stream this year.<\/p>  <p>  Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland continue to examine new and innovative ways to improve access to orthopaedic services. &ldquo;Cappagh Kids&rdquo; at the National Orthopaedic Hospital at Cappagh provides additional theatre capacity for non-complex, age appropriate, orthopaedic procedures, freeing up much needed space at central CHI sites for children with complex, multi-disciplinary needs. Additional orthopaedic outpatient sessions are also now held at Cappagh, providing additional capacity to see and assess children on the outpatient waiting list.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, a new fast-track orthopaedic pathway has been developed as part of outpatient reduction plans. Paediatric Active Clinical Triage has already been introduced for the longest waiters (over 12 months) on the paediatric outpatient list.<\/p>  <p>  More broadly, improving waiting times for hospital appointments and procedures remains a commitment of this Government.

These are: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide. <\/p>  <p>  Under the Scheme, patients receive drugs, medicines, and medical and surgical appliances directly related to the treatment of their illness, free of charge. <\/p>  <p>  There are currently no plans to make specific provision for Crohn&rsquo;s disease under any new or existing health scheme.

The payment of &euro;1,000 will not be subject to income tax, USC, or PRSI. The measure will be ring fenced to staff ordinarily onsite in COVID-19 exposed healthcare environments within the period between 1 March 2020 and 30 June 2021. <\/p>  <p>  Those public sector frontline healthcare workers eligible for the payment will be directly employed public health sector staff working in clinical settings. A pro-rata arrangement will apply for eligible part time staff \/ equivalents and supernumerary students who were required to perform training in clinical sites.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health will also introduce a measure for making a similar payment to staff in private sector nursing homes and hospices that were affected by Covid-19.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to assure the Deputy that work is underway to ensure fairness in the application of this measure as the Government intended.  <\/p>  <p>  The cost of providing a recognition payment of &euro;1,000 to all eligible public servants working in the health and ambulance services depends on the number of staff who are eligible for the payment. If there were 100,000 WTE deemed eligible, the estimated cost would be approximately &euro;100 million. This figure of 100,000 WTE represents approximately 75% of the HSE\/Section 38 workforce and would be the minimum expected to be eligible for this recognition payment.  <\/p>  <p>  Similarly, the cost of providing an equivalent recognition payment to relevant staff in private sector nursing homes and hospices affected by Covid-19 depends on the number of staff deemed eligible for the payment. The estimated cost set out above does not include the cost in respect of nursing homes and Defence Forces staff. This measure will exclude all private sector health workers except those working in nursing homes and hospices affected by Covid-19.  This measure, including costings, will be progressed by the Department of Health. <\/p>  <p>  The Department and the HSE are currently engaging in finalising arrangements to give effect to the Government announcement concerning the Recognition Payment. Full particulars, eligibility and terms and conditions that apply to this payment shall be made available shortly. It is important that this measure is applied fairly as intended and I welcome the work that is ongoing to ensure this is so.<\/p>  <p>  I am also mindful of other workers who played their own part during this difficult period in sustaining our health service but did not work in such exposed areas. It is tough to draw a line on this matter, but the Government based its decision on the risks which frontline healthcare workers faced.<\/p>  <p>  Finally I would like to thank the Deputy for raising this matter however you will understand that the Department of Health cannot comment on individual cases.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020900072#WRL01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Emergency Departments","counter":433,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020900072#WRL01700"},{"type":"question","counter":434,"qnumday":174,"qnumall":"[7101\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020900072#WRL01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of public and private patients presenting to the emergency department at University Hospital Limerick for each week in January 2022; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1509","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":435,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020900072#WRL01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services","counter":436,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020900072#WRL02000"},{"type":"question","counter":437,"qnumday":175,"qnumall":"[7111\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020900072#WRL02100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of persons waiting for mental health services in County Limerick; the length of time they have been waiting; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1499","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":438,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020900072#WRL02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","counter":440,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020900072#WRL02400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Measures","counter":439,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020900072#WRL02300"},{"type":"question","counter":440,"qnumday":176,"qnumall":"[6795\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020900072#WRL02400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will examine a series of matters (details supplied) raised in relation to the Animal Health and Welfare and Forestry (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2021; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1487","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":441,"content":"<p>The Animal Health and Welfare and Forestry (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2021 that is currently going through the legislative process, will provide for the statutory prohibition of fur farming.

The existing Council sets its own priorities and has a number of working groups which provide advice on a wide range of areas including climate change, forest genetics resources, ecosystem services and timber forecasting.<\/p>  <p>  The COFORD Wood Mobilisation and Wood Forecasting Group during this Council term was tasked with projecting timber production from 2021 out to 2040. This forecast is now complete which projects that the annual potential roundwood supply will increase from 4.5 million cubic metres in 2022 to over 6 million cubic metres in 2030. This is a significant increase in timber production and will provide many opportunities for forest owners in the sale of timber.  <\/p>  <p>  The Central Statistic Office has started collecting information on the amount of wood harvested and removed from Irish forest and published figures for the first time in 2021. They will continue to collect statistics in relation timber harvested and will publish annual returns. <\/p>  <p>  My Department and the COFORD Council working group will monitor closely the potential volume of timber forecasted and compare it to the volume of timber actually removed from Irish forests. This tracking is important to ensure that the licences issued are at the required level to ensure timber is harvested in line with the forecast. The CSO estimated that in 2020 there were approximately 3.91 million cubic metres of timber removed from Irish forests which matches the COFORD projected forecast for the same year. Figures are not yet available for 2021. This demonstrates that timber is being harvested at a sustainable rate nationally.
