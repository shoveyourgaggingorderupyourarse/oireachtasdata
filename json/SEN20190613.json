I have a very important issue that I would like to speak to her about.<\/p> <p>Last month the Department issued the news that 800 new special needs assistants were to be allocated to schools from September.  The reason given was that there was a record number of children in mainstream schools who required support.  While I welcome the early announcement as it will eliminate the usual uncertainty among schools, the SNA allocations are not happening fast enough for the children who need them and the staff who provide such assistance.  A total of 110.6 posts have been allocated to Carlow schools for September.  There will be reductions in some schools and increases in others, but there will be no increase in Ballinabranna national school, despite the fact that with the new intake of children in September, four children will need SNA support.  I will not name the children or identify their specific needs to protect their privacy, but, in some cases, they need constant supervision, which will be impossible as they cross all classes and ages.  Last week I was contacted by parents who were suffering from anxiety because of the allocation.  The allocation for the school will not serve the well-being of any of the children in need of this support and I have serious concerns about the morale of SNAs.<\/p> <p>Ballinabranna national school is a mixed school that has almost 200 pupils.  It was allocated a total of 46.05 hours, but it has only one SNA post.  The parents of the children have been at pains to highlight the great support they receive from the SNA, the staff and the principal, but they believe the Department has let the down with its allocation.  In terms of the number of hours allocated, I am concerned that one SNA will be required to work these hours.  The parents asked for help; the school applied for support and contact was made with special educational needs organiser, yet this September, according to the Department's allocation, four children will have to share a resource that can only be described as overstretched.<\/p> <p>When considering whether to make an application for the support of a special needs assistant, it is important that a balance be struck between providing the necessary care support and the right of a child to acquire personal independence skills.  In the case of Ballinabranna national school, each of the four children requires constant care support to be independent.  When faced with the prospect that their child will need medical assistance and supervision at all times during the school day, the parents believe they might have to be on-call throughout in case their child needs an intervention to administer medication or support a medical need while the SNA is attending to another child.  It does not offer independence to a child when a parent must swoop in on a regular basis and does not assist the parent to live a full life while the child is at school.<\/p> <p>The duties of special needs assistants sanctioned by the Department are non-teaching.  Teachers cannot be required to administer medication or supervise a child who could have a serious medical need while they go about their work.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jennifer Murnane O'Connor:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2470\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2470&amp;amp;pid=JenniferMurnaneOConnor&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->SNAs provide these children with the tools they need in order to go to school and participate with their peers.  Without this support, these children would be unfairly discriminated against and SNAs will be pulled in all sorts of directions.  In addition, a child needing help may feel isolated because he or she requires something he or she cannot access because the system does not allow it.  It is not acceptable that four children with individual needs must share one SNA.  What happens if the SNA is off site with one child on, for example, a school tour?  What should the other three do?<\/p><p>When a child begins primary school, we try to ensure that he or she is included.  If a child comes from a preschool setting with full SNA access to a school where the SNA has three other children to deal with and is in a different part of the building, he or she will not feel included.  I want the Minister of State to look at the allocation for the school to which I refer in particular and to listen to what the parents, the school, the SNA and myself are saying.  This is a very important issue.  These families and their children are being neglected.  I am asking for an additional SNA because having four children with one SNA is not acceptable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019061300002#A00600","speaker":"1395","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560418200,"counter":12,"content":"<p>As the House knows, I am the Minister of State in charge of higher education-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019061300002#B00200","speaker":"1247"},{"type":"speech","time":1560418200,"counter":13,"content":"<p>As a teacher, the Minister of State would have been-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019061300002#B00300","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"speech","time":1560418200,"counter":14,"content":"<p>Please allow the Minister of State to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019061300002#B00400","speaker":"1390"},{"type":"speech","time":1560418200,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister, Deputy McHugh.  As a former school principal, and I am not just saying this, I pay tribute to the wonderful work being done by SNAs everywhere to support children.  I thank SNAs, of whom there will be 15,950 by the end of the year, for their efforts.<\/p> <p>I understand the Senator's frustration because what she outlined has happened in my constituency and schools there have contacted me.  I assure the House that the education of children with special needs remains a key priority.  The Government will invest in the region of &euro;560 million in the SNA scheme as part of a &euro;1.9 billion investment in special educational needs overall this year.  As already stated, there will be 15,950 SNAs working in our schools, providing support for approximately 37,500 pupils, by the end of this year.  This is a 51% increase on 2011, when the number of SNAs stood at 10,575.<\/p> <p>The SNA scheme has been a major factor in the successful integration and participation, which is so important, of children with special needs in mainstream education and in specialist settings, for example, special classes or special schools.  The Department&rsquo;s policy is to ensure that every child who is assessed as qualifying for SNA support will receive access to such support.  The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, which, I stress, is an independent agency, is responsible, through its network of local special educational needs organisers, SENOs, for allocating SNA support to schools in accordance with published criteria.  The Department is not involved in making decisions in respect of individual cases.<\/p> <p>In considering applications for SNA support for individual pupils, SENOs take account of pupils' needs and consider the resources already available to the school to identify whether additional resources are needed or whether the school might reasonably be expected to meet the needs of pupils from its current level of resources.  SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school-based resource.  It is important that this House is aware that each school&rsquo;s allocation of SNA support can change from year to year in line with the changing student profile, for example, when students with special educational needs leave a school and are not replaced by others with a similar level of need, or when new students with significant needs enrol in a school.  In addition, an individual student&rsquo;s needs may change over time.  In each case, the SNA allocation would be reviewed and adjusted, as required.<\/p> <p>The NCSE has an appeals process and the advice I am giving to this school and to schools in my constituency is that they need to appeal very strongly.  The appeals process may be invoked by a parent or a school where it is considered that a child was not granted access to SNA support on the grounds that the requirements of the SNA scheme are not met.  Schools may also appeal a decision where the school considers that the NCSE has not allocated the appropriate level of SNA support to the school to meet the care needs of the children concerned as outlined in the Department&rsquo;s circular.<\/p> <p>I understand from the NCSE that it has received an appeal from Ballinabranna school and this will be dealt with in accordance with the formal appeals process.  The Department is not involved in this process, nor is the Minister.  The NCSE is available to support schools through advice and professional development where this is necessary.  The council advises the Department on policy matters relating to meeting the needs of children with special needs.<\/p> <p>On behalf of the Minister, I take this opportunity to assure the House that schools that have enrolled children who qualify for support from an SNA will continue to be allocated such support in a manner appropriate to their needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019061300002#B00500","speaker":"1247"},{"type":"speech","time":1560418200,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for reply.

The Department of Education and Skills and the Minister announced that these extra 800 special needs assistants were coming yet we are now fighting a battle to get an extra SNA, which is all we want.  I will follow this up.  I ask that the Minister of State would bring this to the attention of the Minister on my behalf.  There will be more cases like this.  It is a very serious situation.

The standard of primary education provided by teachers in Carrick-on-Shannon is second to none.  Children attend Scoil Mhuire from all social classes and the town has become home to children of many nationalities.  However, it is very evident that we must assist Carrick-on-Shannon, as a growing town, to address the urgent need for the provision of a more modern, fit-for-purpose school for the primary education of its young people.<\/p> <p>I want to give the Minister of State some background context.  Scoil Mhuire, located on the Dublin Road in the town, is the new name for school following the amalgamation of two schools, St. Mary's boys school and the Marist Convent primary school.  The amalgamation took place in 2013 and both school buildings are used and are referred to as campus 1 and campus 2.  There is a staff of 25 teachers, with a principal and five SNAs.  The amalgamated school currently has more than 460 pupils, with numbers predicted to grow as the town population continues to grow.  The existing buildings were constructed in the 1950s and 1960s, with additional prefabs at both locations.  Unfortunately, because of the increasing capacity problems, a space designated as a play area has been now been used to accompany prefabs for the necessary provision of classrooms.  Funding is continually needed to upgrade facilities and pay for repairs to these old buildings.  Maintenance poses significant challenges every year.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Frank Feighan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2014\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2014&amp;amp;pid=FrankFeighan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->These two main schools are 500 m apart and there is a one-way system on the road which leads to much frustration when parents try to collect the children from both locations at the same time.

I commend my colleague, Councillor Finola Armstrong-McGuire, in Carrick-on-Shannon on highlighting the issues.  It is time for the necessary funding to be allocated to progress a new school development.  This is what our children deserve.  There are a umber of options for sites around the town which could be suitable for development and I understand that the HSE has looked at two options for a new St. Patrick's Hospital development, one of which it has selected.  I would be interested to know the position regarding the one it rejected.  I know the question must be put to the HSE but the site could be suitable for the location of a new primary school.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019061300002#B00800","speaker":"1424","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560418200,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I am taking this Commencement matter on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, who is currently out of the country.

As a former school principal, I congratulate the people responsible on amalgamating the two schools, which can be fraught with tension.  There are a lot of logistics and I say &quot;well done&quot; to the two principals, the staff, the parents and the children.<\/p><p>As the Senator is aware, the Department will invest &euro;8.4 billion in school buildings over the lifetime of Project Ireland 2040.  This investment will see a 70% increase in the school building budget which will be targeted at delivering on the twin objectives of catering for the continued increase in demographics and a greater focus on the refurbishment and upgrade of existing school stock.  The Government remains committed to delivering on existing projects on the school building programme as soon as possible.  In time, we want to see physical education halls to ensure children get the best experience from primary and post-primary schools.<\/p><p>Scoil Mhuire is a co-educational school under Catholic patronage and 457 pupils are enrolled in the school.  The Department&rsquo;s planning and building unit received an application from Scoil Mhuire seeking funding for a new school on a greenfield site on 5 June and this application will be considered in the context of competing demands on the Department&rsquo;s budget.  The immediate priority of the Department is to provide 20,000 new and replacement school places each year to ensure that every child has a school place.  In the interim, it is open to Scoil Mhuire national school to submit an application under the Department&rsquo;s additional school accommodation scheme, ASA, to address any immediate deficits of accommodation that the school may have.

That is not something unique or special I have thought up.  I am a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government.  Yesterday morning, representatives of Focus Ireland, the Mercy Law Resource Centre, the National Children's Alliance and the Ombudsman for Children addressed us.  Central to all their presentations was the desire and need for statutory legislation to provide for an independent inspectorate for what we call emergency accommodation or family hubs.  It is reasonable and fair.<\/p> <p>I will not reiterate everything stated at the meeting because it has been published on the Oireachtas website.  We heard harrowing personal stories of families and children.  The Minister of State will be aware that Dr. Niall Muldoon is the Ombudsman for Children.  He has two principle statutory functions, namely, to promote the rights and welfare of those under 18 years of age and to examine and investigate complaints made by or on behalf of children about the administration or actions of public bodies, schools and voluntary organisations in respect of the adverse effect there may be on children.  In his statement to the committee, he strongly argued for a statutory independent review and inspectorate for family hubs and emergency accommodation.  I have always taken a keen interest in the rights and welfare of children and their experiences interfacing with homelessness agencies, and I will continue to do so.  It is right, proper and reasonable for the State to have an independent inspectorate to administer such matters.<\/p> <p>The No Place Like Home document, drafted by the ombudsman, gives an account of children's personal experiences through graphics, art, drawings and script.  The other witnesses before the committee echoed the need for some sort of independent inspectorate, because there are major issues.  I would like to hear the Government's proposals.  Is it the intention to give the matter serious consideration?  As I said, the agencies I outlined, all of which are involved in the welfare and protection of children, and especially the Ombudsman for Children, have made the call.  I would like the Government to give serious consideration to the proposal and to indicate a timeframe to give it the necessary legal and statutory effect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019061300002#D00500","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1560418200,"counter":35,"content":"<p>I apologise for the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, on whose behalf I am taking the question.  The Minister and his Department consider all the issues raised in the Seanad.<\/p> <p>Statutory responsibility for the provision of accommodation and related services for homeless households rests with individual housing authorities.  The responsibility of housing authorities includes that of ensuring that contracted services are delivered in a professional manner, in line with any service level agreement in place.  Supporting individuals and families experiencing homelessness is a priority for the Government.  To promote high standards of service delivery, the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, DRHE, has developed a national quality standards framework on behalf of the Department to ensure a more consistent approach in how local authorities and service providers respond to the needs of those experiencing homelessness, about which the Senator asked.  The objective of the framework is to ensure that services for people experiencing hornlessness are well organised, co-ordinated, integrated and focused on moving people out of homelessness, as quickly as possible, into long-term sustainable housing, which we all want.  This will be done by promoting safe and effective service provision to households experiencing homelessness, supporting the objectives of the national homelessness policy and establishing consistency in how households experiencing homelessness are responded to in different regions and models of service delivery, which addresses another of the Senator's points.  The framework was implemented on a phased basis in Dublin, with site visits commencing in February this year.  The experience gained from the recent completion of the roll-out in Dublin and the commencement of site visits has allowed the DRHE to evaluate how the framework should be implemented nationally and to advise the Department accordingly.  Last month, the Department wrote to all local authorities to instruct them on the process for the implementation of the framework on a nationwide basis over 12 months, commencing on 1 July 2019.  Upon completion of the implementation phase, local authorities will commence site visits to ensure compliance with the framework.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Patrick O'Donovan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2316\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2316&amp;amp;pid=PatrickODonovan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Management of these site visits will be a matter for each of the local authorities.  The implementation of the national quality standards framework will ensure the State provides safe and effective services to households experiencing homelessness.  It will ensure that services are delivered consistently across all regions of the State, with a focus on ensuring that households experiencing homelessness are enabled to access and sustain housing with appropriate levels of support.  The implementation of the framework will also promote stronger governance and monitoring of third party delivery through the integration of the standards contained in the framework.  While the Department has no plans at present to introduce an alternative inspection regime the implementation of the framework will be kept under ongoing review by the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019061300002#D00600","speaker":"1267","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560418200,"counter":37,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for the report but it is exceptionally disappointing.

I raise an issue raised a number of times.  However, it is important we continue to highlight it on foot of a debate yesterday in the Lower House and, indeed, this being national carers' week, which commenced on 10 June.  Yesterday during Leaders' Questions the Taoiseach stated that an extra &euro;30 million is being budgeted for help and home care this year.  He said it would provide 18.3 million hours in home support, an increase of 800,000 on last year.  A company called Tyco is involved and home help staff are now being paid for travelling time.  That fact has only come to his attention and he is still trying to get to the bottom of the matter.  It seems much of the money is being swallowed up.  I think the HSE rate is &euro;13.50 an hour while the Tyco rate is &euro;23.50 an hour.  We are not really getting a lot of value for this extra money.  It would seem to be rather inefficient.<\/p><p>Councillor Martin Baker and Councillor Michael Clarke of Sligo County Council have highlighted the fact that some people have been given lists of private contractors that they can hire themselves if they want.  It is a bit insulting that people are not given the help they require.  It is important we appreciate that people who remain at home save the State enormous amounts of money by not being in institutions, whether old people's homes, respite care facilities or hospitals.  Home care costs a fraction of the cost of residing in an institution.<\/p><p>It does not look good for the Minister for Health or the Taoiseach to say we are spending all this extra money but there is no great value being delivered, the price is twice as high, and the extra provision does not cover much more.  The people who need the care are experiencing huge delays and as many as 6,000 people await home care support.  I ask the Leader to bring in the Minister for Health so that he can explain to us what is going on with home care.<\/p><p>The Leader might ask the Minister for Health to come in, perhaps on a separate occasion, to discuss an article by Pat Leahy in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>today.  He said that we are going to need another bailout of several hundred million euro before the end of the year to deal with another health overrun.  It was said that a 6% increased had already been factored in for this year but it is now 9%.  Effectively, that is a 50% increase on expected health spending even though a fairly substantial increase had been forecasted.  The rate of the spending increase in May was a third ahead of the anticipated growth for the year.  Since 2010, as many as 20 of the 23 major capital projects in health have ended up costing more than the agreed price.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Gerry Horkan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2476\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2476&amp;amp;pid=GerryHorkan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is concerning that 90% of the capital projects in health are coming in over budget.

The topic this morning is the home help service in the context of capital project overruns and the general overrun in the health budget.

As the Leader will be aware, having been very much part of the process, as was the Leas-Chathaoirleach, the Seanad prepared a comprehensive report on SMEs, for which many thanks go to Ms Bridget Doody and her team.  I am keen that we execute the findings of the report at this stage.  Many people put an awful lot of work into it.  The Leader is committed to the report and stated previously that he is open to having the Minister come to the House for full and proper debate on SMEs.<\/p> <p>The report makes a couple of key requests and a number of recommendations.  The main recommendation is to appoint a Minister or Minister of State with responsibility for SMEs.  The current approach to SMEs is totally disjointed and we need joined up thinking and engagement with SMEs.<\/p> <p>Last night, I introduced the Leader to members of the board of the Entrepreneur of the Year programme who were here for a meeting with me.  They are absolutely passionate about delivering and supporting the mentoring and support of small and medium size businesses in Ireland.  There is a great goodwill towards supporting SMEs.<\/p> <p>We will make a submission to the Minister to make changes on capital gains tax to create a proper environmentally friendly investment focus for people to invest in small and medium size businesses and encourage and increase opportunities for females to be involved in SMEs.  Ireland falls below the European average in this area, although the number of women involved in SMEs here has increased significantly in the past six or seven years.  That needs to be considered and appreciated.<\/p> <p>The unintended consequences of legislation is a serious issue for SMEs.  When debating legislation, we should consider the direct and indirect effects it may have on SMEs.

We need an immediate debate on the issue and for the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Jim Daly, to hear the concerns of Senators from all areas as to how the current shortfall will impact on the most vulnerable in society.  We need to make provision before this crisis worsens.<\/p> <p>There are 6,000 waiting for home care supports.  My Fianna F&aacute;il colleague stated this does not look good for the Government.  It certainly does not look good for the Government and it did not look good for Fianna F&aacute;il when a previous Government cut 32,000 hours in County Mayo in one year alone.  The issue does not look any better now, several years later.<\/p> <p>There is a problem with recruitment and retention in home care caused by social welfare restrictions.  If somebody does, say, one hour of home help in a day, all of his or her social welfare payments for that day are cut off.  The Minister needs to examine arrangements that would allow home care workers to be able to provide care without being pushed further into poverty.  They cannot take up this work because to do so would leave them worse off. <\/p> <p>News that cuts lie ahead and that health spending is set to overrun again this year is causing considerable anxiety in my community and in communities across the country.  It is hard to believe that yesterday we were here discussing a rainy-day fund to deal with exceptional circumstances.  Surely a looming crisis in how we care for those who need an extra bit of help should allow us to dip into that fund.  When the rainy-day fund legislation is back before the House, Senator Kieran O'Donnell will have a chance to accept amendments from Sinn F&eacute;in to allow moneys from the fund to be spent when crises such as this one arise.<\/p> <p>It costs the State &euro;6,000 per week to accommodate somebody in an acute bed, whereas it costs &euro;160 per week for a home care support package.  Surely to God somebody must ask how we can save money here.  Money saved in the health service could be used to fund other vital parts of the service.  The figures are cited show that there are huge inefficiencies.  We have had entire debates in this House about inefficiencies and waste in health.  It makes no sense that patients who are medically discharged are unable to return home because of the blunt instrument by which the HSE states it has run out of funding and can no longer provide home care supports for them.  We need to hear from the Government that it understands the scale of the problem and an indication that it will not allow the list for those waiting for home help hours to grow further.  Reassurance and forward planning are needed to avert a completely unnecessary problem.  While the problem was created by Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael does not need to continue to do the same.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019061300002#H00600","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speech","time":1560418200,"counter":71,"content":"<p>On 13 February this year, a motion in my name was put to the House concerning the tragic death of Shane O'Farrell.

As Members know, it costs between &euro;1,000 and &euro;1,200 to keep someone in a nursing home for one week.  Some &euro;100 would keep a person in his or her home with home care packages.  It costs &euro;862 to keep someone in an acute hospital for one day.  That is the equivalent of 60 hours of home care packages.  Clearly we have a crisis in my particular part of the world.

I am formally requesting that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine come before the House at the earliest opportunity to address the matter.  Members will recall that earlier this year we debated the Sea-Fisheries (Amendment) Act 2019, which sought to give UK-registered vessels access to Irish fisheries right up to the shoreline.  It was a very controversial piece of legislation.  It was pushed through the Seanad and the D&aacute;il by the Government under the premise that it would build relations concerning access to fishing waters after Brexit.  That was the argument put to the fishing organisations and the Opposition parties.<\/p> <p>The fishing representatives are now asking serious questions about when correspondence from the Scottish Government to the Irish Government threatening to enforce a 12-mile limit around Rockall started.  When did that correspondence start?  Was it taking place as this legislation was being put through?  If so, why were the Opposition parties and the fishing representative organisations not made aware of it? <\/p> <p>Moreover, it is critical that the Minister comes before this House to clarify the 2013 agreement which has now come to public attention.  Everybody was puzzled as to why a usually prudent Scottish National Party Government in Scotland is taking these measures.  It turns out they are based on a 2013 agreement signed by then T&aacute;naiste, Eamon Gilmore, on behalf of the Government in which the Leader's colleague, Deputy Simon Coveney, who is now T&aacute;naiste, was the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  This agreement formally recognised the Rockall area as part of an exclusive UK economic zone.  This was done in disagreement with Iceland.  In other words, in 2013 senior Government representatives vindicated the British claim to the fisheries around Rockall and gave the Scottish Government the legal basis to threaten to remove Irish boats.  None of this was made clear in debates on the Sea-Fisheries (Amendment) Act 2019.  This is very serious.  I am now formally requesting the Minister, Deputy Creed, to come before this House and make a statement clarifying when the correspondence from the Scottish Government commenced.  Was it during the period when this legislation was going through this House?  Furthermore, has the Irish Government, without any consultation with the Irish fishing community, signed an agreement with the British Government which basically hands Rockall fishing rights over to it?  This is serious and we need urgent clarification.  We need the Minister to make a statement before this House as soon as possible.

We need to constantly remind ourselves of the constitutional right to free primary education which has not been vindicated over the years of this State.  The Labour Party has published Bills to abolish the practice of voluntary contributions.  We have been told by certain school managers that filling the gap would cost the State &euro;45 million.  The reason the capitation payment needs to be increased is that parents are filling that gap through fundraising.  Progressive minded people in Europe, particularly in Scandinavian countries, find it mind-boggling that a parents' group would have to fundraise for the basic provision of school or educational activities, particularly in primary school.  We have also suggested that we should have a free book scheme in the Republic of Ireland, as they have in the North of Ireland.<\/p> <p>I ask the Leader to facilitate a discussion with the Minister for Education and Skills on how we can access funding to vindicate the right to free primary school education; ensure parents do not have to fundraise; raise the capitation to such a level that schools can be properly funded; and ensure we have services in the Republic that are taken as a right and taken for granted in the North of Ireland.  We have an education budget of approximately &euro;11 billion.  If a free primary school book scheme would cost &euro;20 million, and that the shortfall in funding through voluntary contributions to the capitation funding would cost &euro;45 million, it would surely be worth providing the total amount required to vindicate that right.  This would ensure that the parental and student relationship with a school is not a financial one but is one based purely on education, growth and development.

Yes, there can be delays and there are undue delays but a health service is being provided.  We are now talking about the new children's hospital.  Day in, day out, there is nothing but negative coverage.  We have gone through 22 Ministers for Health who have spoken about building a hospital.  We are actually building it and will deliver on it.  Fianna F&aacute;il's spokesperson on health, Deputy Donnelly, is criticising an aspect of it with regard to what is being provided for consultants.  We cannot get consultants unless we provide the back-up support for them and that is part of their contract.

They were not here to stand up for women in whatever way because I know the Government has problems with this Bill and is trying very hard to strike a balance.

Many of us are trying to come to some kind of conclusion where people can have the right to knowledge of who or what they are and their tribe.

They should have argued with their party that this was a good time to be here and even make an argument because when if one wants to talk about women, one must talk about equality across everything and not just on issues where they are whipped and issues where they are not whipped.

Our departing Oireachtas colleague, Deputy Clare Daly, also attended the protest along with a number of others.  It was a very good occasion.  I want to raise what is happening with President Trump with regard to Huawei because it really brings home the damage this president is doing.  Analog Devices in Limerick, which supplies semi conductors to the Huawei plant, is facing a shutdown next month.  We are talking about 1,200 of the best jobs in Limerick.  These are unionised good-quality jobs at one of the longest standing employers in the region - an excellent employer.  As a direct result of the blacklisting of Huawei by the US Government, according to a report in the <i>Limerick Leader<\/i>this morning, we are facing a shutdown next month with the loss of 1,200 jobs.  I have friends in that plant because of my contacts with the union and I can tell the House that there is real concern.  These are some of best jobs in Limerick city.  I am trying to put this question in an non-adverserial way.  What is our Government doing?  I heard the T&aacute;naiste admit that there was no evidence presented against Huawei with regard to these charges of spying but we need to do more than that.  We need the backbone to stand up to the US bullying coming from President Trump not just because it is morally wrong but because it is economically wrong.  It is damaging.  It could cause significant damage.  If this blacklist continues, the consequences for those 1,200 workers in Analog Devices could be very serious.  Where is the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation?  Why are we not hearing from her?  What are we doing at European level to say with one clear voice that this nonsense of blacklisting Huawei and the bullying attitude by President Trump must end?  I know we all want to be friends with the US but our Government is incredibly subservient when it comes to this administration.  We have seen it with regard to Palestine in particular.  It is time we heard from the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation with regard to this issue.

The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Jim Daly, the senior Minister, Deputy Harris, and the Government are committed to ensuring that the HSE will deliver its service plan commitments for 2019.  We have more home help hours than ever and more people are availing of home help hours than ever before.  We have a growing elderly population and that poses a significant challenge for us.  People are living longer and their needs are becoming more complex.  This year alone, an extra 800,000 home help hours will be used by the HSE.  In the first quarter of this year, 4,411 more people commenced home help hour services.  In the past four years, there has been an increase of &euro;140 million in the budget to 246 million.  In the 2019 HSE service plan, 18 million support hours are available and being availed of by 53,000 people.  I accept that a need exists.  As has been stated, people staying at home and living in their communities are not in hospital and, as a result, they do not prevent others from accessing beds.  An intensive home care package is provided that is aimed at keeping people at home.  The Minister of State, is working with the HSE and the Department of Health on developing a statutory home help support scheme, the aim of which will be to improve access to home care packages and services on an affordable and sustainable basis.

There is no basis for excluding Irish fishing vessels from the waters around Rockall, particularly as they are there to legitimately pursue fishing opportunities under EU law.  As Senator Feighan indicated, 31% of our fish are caught in UK waters.  I am open to correction on this.  A number of Members of the Lower House tabled a Topical Issue on the matter this week.

We were in the Seanad antechamber because then, as now, the Chamber was subject to a significant renovation process.  The day after Enniskillen, I remember John Robb coming into the Seanad, solemnly walking up to the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s desk and placing a red poppy on it.  In defiance of Standing Orders but in accordance with the wish of the Irish people, the then Cathaoirleach, Charlie McDonald, took up the poppy and placed it in his lapel.  That was a most moving and dignified commemoration of the tragic events in Enniskillen.<\/p> <p>John Robb was from Ballymoney, an important fact because he was following in the great Presbyterian tradition of independent thinkers like the extraordinary J. B. Armour of Ballymoney.  I think John Robb would have been happy to be placed in that tradition.  He was one of a string of northern representatives who were appointed to the Seanad.  This is good and healthy for Ireland.  We not only had John Robb but we had Gordon Wilson, and, now, I am glad to say, we have Senator Marshall from the unionist tradition in the North of Ireland.<\/p> <p>John Robb was educated at Rockport Preparatory School in Holywood, County Down, and Merchiston Castle School in Edinburgh.  He then studied medicine in Queen's University Belfast.  Like his father, he was a distinguished surgeon.  His son, William, is carrying on the family tradition by being a surgeon in Beaumont Hospital.<\/p> <p>When the Troubles started, John Robb was a consultant in the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast.  He was noted because he treated the bomber and the bomber&rsquo;s victim with equal compassion and equal professionalism in the medical services he provided.  He founded the New Ireland Movement in 1972 and the New Ireland Group in 1982 to promote dialogue, consensus and reconciliation.  I was on the board of the Peace Train which ran a train between Dublin and Belfast to highlight the inadequacies of the Sinn F&eacute;in position of uniting Ireland by blowing up the main rail link between Dublin and Belfast.  We thought that left a little to be desired.  He was supportive of that.<\/p> <p>He was nominated to the 16th Seanad by Charlie Haughey in 1982.  Interestingly, he was renominated by Garret FitzGerald to the 17th Seanad and renominated by Charlie Haughey to the 18th Seanad.  That is an interesting reflection on John Robb&rsquo;s character.  The two leaders of the opposing parties both saw him as an appropriate person to be nominated to Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  It has been remarked on the way in which he would conscientiously do his medical rounds in Ballymoney before he came down to the Seanad.  He would start off at 6 a.m. but he would also check up on his patients.  On one occasion he had a patient who was pretty unwell.  On his way to Dublin, he checked in to see how his patient was doing to learn his condition deteriorated.  He turned around and went back up to administer to his patient.  That is characteristic of the man.<\/p> <p>He was not only concerned with northern issues, just as Senator Marshall is not just concerned with northern or farming issues but speaks on a great deal of matters.  John Robb objected to the United States arming the Contra forces in Nicaragua and the clandestine arming of the Iranian forces during the Iran-Iraq war.  He was passionate about the Irish language.  He did not see it as exclusively the prerogative of the nationalist or republican people to have access to the Irish language.  I understand he learned some Irish.<\/p> <p>My best conclusion is to quote from the tribute paid to John Robb by President Michael D. Higgins.  He said: \"John Robb was a voice not only for peace but for reconciliation, for recognising all traditions and beliefs on the island of Ireland, and the making of a future in which all in Ireland could share.\"  One could not but be impressed by his deep humanity, and his unstinting efforts to encourage new thinking in politics. At a personal level, he was a joy to meet, always optimistic, an all-islander in the best sense.<\/p> <p>To have known him as a friend and regular correspondent was a privilege.<\/p> <p>Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019061300002#P00200","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1560418200,"counter":216,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, I welcome John Robb&rsquo;s son, William and his wife, and daughter, Martha, to the Seanad and to pay tribute to him.  Obviously, I did not serve with him but he was an extraordinary human being by any measure, not just in Ireland but globally.<\/p> <p>The fact he was appointed, as Senator Norris pointed out, by the then Taoiseach, Charlie Haughey, to the 16th Seanad was not only controversial in Fianna F&aacute;il but also in Northern Ireland.  That he accepted the offer showed the character of the man and that he knew there had to be a different way.  The fact he was reappointed by Fine Gael shows the character of Garret FitzGerald at a time when politics was not as accommodating and was far more combative in this House and the other House.  He was reappointed by Charlie Haughey to the 18th Seanad.  The fact he accepted the appointment during the most trying of times in Northern Ireland and in southern politics says much about how he was a man willing to reach out.<\/p> <p>The ideas that he is now being honoured for are being talked about again.  There is talk again about a new vision for a new Ireland and island.  He pioneered those terms when nobody else would even speak about them.  That says much about his vision.<\/p> <p>He came from a tradition of helping those most in need.  His father had been a battlefield surgeon, the worst medical position in which to be involved.  That tells one that they have been through more trying times than being appointed to the Seanad.  The fact that one has to sit through a battle and help people, many of them drawing their last breaths, tells us he was able to put up with the most trying of circumstances.<\/p> <p>As Senator Norris pointed out, not only did he come to do his work here three days a week but he also did his rounds.

As we know in politics, the family often suffers more.  Priorities, in terms of patients when it came to his work as a surgeon but also in terms of trying to bring an end to the Troubles, were taking up a lot of his time, which I am sure the family would have appreciated.  However, the fact that the President, who served in this and the other House, and obviously kept in contact with him, stated that he was an all-islander in the best sense of the word shows that in the words that he used in his time here, and which were new - the idea of a new vision, a new way of doing things other than the slaughter that was happening in Northern Ireland at the time - he was ahead of his time.  We could do with him again now, notwithstanding Senator Marshall's election.  That we would elect someone from Northern Ireland to this House would show how far we have come.<\/p><p>John Robb was a pioneer and a visionary in trying to bring people together when it was much easier to stay apart.

It is an absolute privilege and a pleasure to be part of this today to remember a man who certainly was a great ambassador for Northern Ireland.  It is lovely to have the opportunity to pay tribute to someone who was charismatic, who was confident and, obviously, a very considered individual.  He was a visionary and he certainly was an ambassador for the province and for Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.<\/p> <p>He was a man I never had the fortune to meet but I have learned about him from colleagues, from people who worked with him, from people who served with him who have given testimonies to him, and some of what I have read about him, and people who touched briefly with him in social gatherings.  He certainly has left his mark on everyone.<\/p> <p>Interestingly, John Robb was, like myself, a Protestant - a Presbyterian from Northern Ireland.  He challenged many of those stereotypes and many of the preconceptions about who he was.  He was a man certainly defined by his career as a very successful surgeon through a horrible dark time in Northern Ireland's history and by his service and his contribution to this House.  Interestingly, and something which I have great admiration for, as an adult, as a mature male, he learned Irish.  I am still struggling with English and I take my hat off to someone who could do that late in life because it certainly gets more difficult as one gets older.<\/p> <p>As fellow Senators have said, he was nominated by successful Taoisigh, who obviously saw a quality and something unique in this man.  John Robb was a man who presented no threat to these Houses or to Northern Ireland.  In fact, quite the opposite, John Robb was a man who was completely comfortable with his own identity and his culture and who was prepared to challenge and to establish the thinking and to further the ambitions that he firmly believed in.  Interestingly, we all need to learn and understand this because many think they understand people and culture and they actually do not.  It is about respect and about not believing the preconceptions one has and not believing often what one learned about people.  I found in this House that when one sits down and talks to and engages with people, nine times out of ten they will say, \"We did not think you thought that.  We did not think you had that opinion.\"  That is the reality.  It is about sitting down and learning about other people.<\/p> <p>It has been a privilege and a pleasure for me to serve in this House and to follow such a man as Dr. John Robb.  Sometimes we need to take calculated risks and be able to see the bigger picture.  This was an individual who definitely saw that bigger picture.  Often a prophet is never recognised in his own land, and Dr. John Robb was one of those prophets.  He certainly had a vision and it is still alive today.  It is as relevant today as it was in the 1980s when John Robb was here.<\/p> <p>He was here when Northern Ireland was going through very difficult times.  Hopefully, we have left those times behind.  Hopefully, we will never go back to those times.  I would urge everyone, in this House today, and especially the leadership in Northern Ireland politics, to reflect on John Robb's contribution to this House, to this country, to Northern Ireland and to the Republic of Ireland, and to learn and take inspiration from him.  If we look at an example of leadership, if we are to be leaders and if we are in a position to lead, it needs to come with the thinking that one will take and embrace calculated, measured risks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019061300002#Q00200","speaker":"1439"},{"type":"speech","time":1560418200,"counter":219,"content":"<p>I welcome John Robb's son, William, his wife, Niamh, and his daughter, Martha.

This House facilitates the whole of the island and the discussion and it brings something really positive to the table.  The exchange of ideas and learning across the island is to the benefit of everybody who is represented in this House.<\/p> <p>John Robb was a pioneer in his working and political life.  As a medical doctor, he sponsored new and innovative ideas and served the public, especially those who were hurt in the conflict and in need of urgent medical attention in hospitals.  His diligence to those hurt in the conflict was reflected in his approach to politics.  With others, he set up the New Ireland Group and the New Ireland Movement.  I note \"New Ireland\" in the name of both organisations.  That is what John Robb wanted to achieve.<\/p> <p>He was a new islander.  In the tradition of another north Antrim man, and a liberal Presbyterian, the Rev. J. B. Armour, who campaigned for Home Rule before partition, John Robb grew to love the Irish language, learned it and spoke it.  He brought his refined and sharp mind to the need for a new and agreed Ireland and he was a man of peace.<\/p> <p>He was dedicated to reconciling the people of this island in the most difficult days of the conflict, and when \"peace\" was a word that was rarely heard or used.  He was often in the company of republicans and was very relaxed advocating his vision for a new Ireland.  He did that in the Seanad when he was a Seanad&oacute;ir here from 1982 to 1989.  His vision of a new Ireland based on respecting and uniting the two main traditions on this island undoubtedly influenced those he met and those he spoke with.  With others, he helped to lay the foundations for the peace we enjoy today and for the working relationship, however fraught, between unionists and nationalists.<\/p> <p>He was an original thinker and he made an invaluable contribution to peace and reconciliation for a new island and for that, we are all grateful.

Let us look at what happened.  He was able to articulate a Northern Ireland unionist voice in a Chamber that many saw as probably hostile to Northern Ireland.  It is exactly what is happening here today.  One has Senator Marshall who has a unionist perspective - the Senator is very welcome.  He brings a voice to this Chamber.  I see Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile from Belfast as well, who brings a republican nationalist perspective.  That is very important.  John Robb would have very much favoured that discourse within this Parliament.  There is a great need now to extend those type of parliaments.

It is something most people do not even know about.  It was only when I was talking to his grandson that he told me about those aspects of these people.  I am trying to say that we do not realise the power of relationships and relationship building that has happened in this Seanad since the foundation of the State.<\/p><p>We need many more voices from Northern Ireland in the Seanad because they are very welcome.  They challenge a narrative, as John Robb challenged that narrative back in 1982.  It was probably a cold house for him to come down to in Dublin in the height of the Troubles.  He was a man of principle, a man of peace and a man of huge intellect who was able to overcome the boundaries.  People in his community were probably asking him what he was doing selling out and coming down here and recognising this Parliament.  At the time, he was also coming into a State that was dominated by the Catholic Church.  We did not have the enlightened, pluralist society that we have now.  That was important.<\/p><p>Maybe it is time to look at a Northern Ireland senate, to have a second senate like a citizens' assembly.  It would provide that space for businessmen and people from all walks of life without having to go through a general election.  There is a huge opportunity there.  I have seen what has happened and, as I said, I was in Westminster on Monday night.  There is a huge generosity on the island of Ireland and there is a huge generosity in the United Kingdom towards Ireland.  That could be a second space - an upper house.  I know Scotland and Wales only have one chamber but maybe there is an opportunity there to bring people in who would normally not get involved in politics.

From reading about his life, I know that at the time he came to Seanad &Eacute;ireann he was a trauma surgeon from the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast and he knew exactly the country he was dealing with and exactly the conflict that was going on in his part of the country.  He took the brave step of sitting in this Parliament.  I recently had some friends from Northern Ireland in this House who were from the Orange tradition.  One of them said to me at the gates of Leinster House as he left that when he came down here he thought that when he walked in he would burst into flames.

I welcome and thank the members of the Robb family who are here today and I thank Senator Norris for ensuring we had the opportunity to reflect on the life of former Senator John Robb.  Like other Members, I did not know him personally, but as has been reflected adequately today, we all feel his legacy and his input as a result of our presence in this Chamber.  It is not just Senator Marshall or I, but all of us.  We all benefit from what he brought to politics and, in particular, to this House because the great strength of Seanad &Eacute;ireann is that at times it has been and, as Senator Feighan said, it can be reflective and representative of &Eacute;ire and I hope it has been so today.  It can be reflective and representative of all of us and our complex and layered diversity in the wonderful tapestry, to be recognised, appreciated, celebrated and loved by people, such as John Robb when they come to a place such as this to argue for dialogue, peace and, as Senator Marshall said, for risk taking, which is always necessary, whether in the midst of conflict or indeed emerging from that conflict.<\/p> <p>From what I understand, John Robb was not afraid to take risks, and that was not just in terms of entering this institution but, as Senator Conway-Walsh said, he was comfortable and engaged in the company of republicans at a time when it was not easy.  He was among a small band of people from within the unionist, Protestant and loyalist tradition who reached out and equally accepted an invitation to engage and listen to republicans.  If we do John Robb a service today, it is not just to remember and reflect and if we are to pay real tribute to his legacy, it is to continue to think, challenge and engage.<\/p> <p>In that spirit, I say very respectfully that I appreciate the fact that John Robb and others like him have been Members of this institution over the years and I celebrate and welcome the fact our colleague, Senator Marshall, from the unionist tradition is here because that is the kind of Ireland I want.  I want a kind of republic that will ultimately represent and reflect all our traditions, whether new or more established.

We can celebrate Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile and Senator Marshall being here without really making much of it.  John Robb was appointed to the Seanad at a time of great conflict in our country.  What he did and what he stood for should never be forgotten in the history of this House or the history of Ireland.  I do not say that lightly.  As Senator Mark Daly rightly said, we remember his acceptance of the invitation to become a Member of Seanad &Eacute;ireann and what that represented and stood for at a time of great uncertainty in our country.  He had a professional career, a personal life and a political life.  He married these together and wove them into a life that had a vision of peace and reconciliation, and of all of us coexisting without being worried about whether we wore a green, orange or white jersey, what our religious hue or background was or where we came from.  The work he did as a medical man, the people he met and how he met them shaped his life and his vision.  We should always remember and reflect on history so that we can learn from it for the future.  Today, all of us on this island have an obligation to the legacy of John Robb to remember what he did, his dialogue and engagement, and what he represented.  Mary McAleese spoke about building bridges but we could argue that it was Dr. John Robb who began the bridge-building, opening of minds and the changing of a cultural attitude, be it through the peace train or whatever.  We remember him and are grateful for his service in this House.  We thank him for accepting the invitations of two Taoisigh.  <\/p> <p>When we look at the New Ireland Forum report and what has thankfully happened in our country, we are lucky and privileged to be in a position as Members of this House to express our gratitude to John Robb and his family for the sacrifices he made, his ability to reach out and for the promotion of a new type of Ireland which we have today, an inclusive one.  I thank his family for being here.  I thank Senator Norris and other Members of the House for organising the visit and the tributes today.

The House will be aware that the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 was enacted in the wake of the barbaric murder by the Real IRA of 29 innocent people in Omagh in August 1998.  That act of depravity was an affront to humanity and democracy, and it lingers long in our memory.  This legislation is a robust and proportionate response to those who choose the bullet over the ballot box.  Section 18 of the 1998 Act provides that certain sections must be renewed by the Oireachtas at specified intervals if they are to remain in force.  By virtue of resolutions passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas in June 2018, these sections were continued in force for a period of 12 months.<\/p> <p>Prior to moving any motion for renewal, the Act requires that I lay before the Oireachtas a report on the operation of the relevant provisions.  The current report covers the period from 1 June 2018 to 31 May 2019 and was laid before the Houses on 10 June 2019.  It includes a table showing usage figures for each of the years since the Act came into operation.  The report also indicates that a number of sections, namely, sections 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12 and 17, were not used during the reporting period in question.  However, it should not be inferred from this that these provisions are in some way redundant or unnecessary because the usage of the different sections can and does vary from year to year.<\/p> <p>While I have no doubt that every one of us in this House looks forward to a time when these provisions will no longer be required, as Minister for Justice and Equality I must at all times take into account the reality of the current situation.  In that regard, I appreciate that some Senators are concerned about the role of the Special Criminal Court in the criminal justice system.  One of the most important traits of a democratic society is a justice system that operates free from interference by anyone seeking to wrongfully influence outcomes.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Charles Flanagan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=414\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=414&amp;amp;pid=CharlesFlanagan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We all agree that trial by jury must be preserved to the greatest extent possible.  However, none of us can be blind to the threat posed to the criminal justice process by individuals, terrorist groups and organised criminal groups that seek to subvert the system through the intimidation of citizens.  We cannot allow that to happen.  We are obliged to make the hard decision that in certain limited circumstances trial by jury is simply not possible.<\/p><p>I respectfully disagree with those who assert that the Special Criminal Court operates contrary to fundamental rights.  The court operates without a jury for sound reason but trials there involve three judges.  Anyone tried in that court has the full range of procedural protections available to him or her, including access to the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court.  We all look forward to the day when the Special Criminal Court is no longer needed but, regrettably, we are not there yet.  The Garda assessment is that there remains a real and persistent threat from republican paramilitary groups on this island - the so called dissidents.  The threat level in Northern Ireland from these groups is regarded as severe.  We know that these groups vehemently oppose peace and democracy and, regrettably, they remain wedded to brutality and criminality.  They remain very active here carrying out fundraising and planning and preparatory activities to support attacks in Northern Ireland.  Their callous disregard for democracy, the rule of law and human life was all too clearly illustrated with the posting of incendiary devices to addresses in the UK in March and their continuing attempts to murder and maim police officers, including the recent planting of a viable bomb under a PSNI officer's car. Of course, we can never forget the callous and appalling murder of Lyra McKee in Derry last April, an innocent woman contributing much to society.  It shows the morally vacant nature of these dissident groups and their direct opposition to the democratic wishes of the majority on this island.  I am determined that they will not succeed.  I am also determined that the bullet will not triumph over the ballot box.  I am sure everyone in this House shares my determination.<\/p><p>Of course, many provisions of the Offences against the State Acts could have application to the international terrorist threat.  While, thankfully, Ireland has been spared the kinds of jihadist-type attacks we have seen in other European countries targeting innocent people going about their daily lives, such attacks are a stark reminder of the vulnerability of all open democracies to this ongoing threat.  As an open democracy, Ireland is not immune.  Our security authorities are alive to the potential threat we face and continue to work closely with their international counterparts in identifying and responding to that threat.  I pay tribute to the women and men of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who work tirelessly in countering the threat from paramilitary organisations.  The Garda authorities co-operate very closely with the Police Service of Northern Ireland in this regard and this is a key relationship in protecting communities across the island.  It is the clear view of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that the Act continues to be a most important tool in its ongoing efforts in the fight against terrorism.  The Garda authorities have stated that the provisions of the Act are used regularly, which is evident from the report that I have laid before the House.  As already stated, terrorist groups remain a threat to the people on this island.   They are opposed to the benefits that have flowed from the peace process and are determined to undermine it.  The State must retain in its laws the capacity to defeat them and we have a duty as legislators to ensure that is so.  On the basis of the information set out in the report and on the advice of the Garda authorities, I propose that the House approve the continued operation of the relevant provisions of the 1998 Act to remain in operation for a further 12 months commencing on 30 June 2019.<\/p><p>I turn now to section 8 of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009, which is also the subject of a motion before the House.  It refers to four serious organised crime offences that are set out in Part 7 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006.  Section 8 of the 2009 Act makes these offences scheduled offences for the purposes of Part V of the Offences Against the State Act 1939.  That is to say, trials for these offences are to be heard in the Special Criminal Court subject to the power of the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, to direct that the offences be tried in the ordinary courts.  This discretion for the DPP maintains an essential balance in deciding which cases are appropriate to be tried in the Special Criminal Court.  The legislation requires me to prepare a report, which shall be laid before both Houses, on the operation of the section in the period under report.  That report, covering the period from 1 June 2018 to 31 May 2019, was laid before the House on 10 June.<\/p><p>Organised crime continues to present a significant problem.  There is, unfortunately, stark evidence of the willingness of these gangs to engage in murder, armed robbery, kidnapping, drug smuggling, counterfeiting and other serious offences.  Dublin in particular has seen a litany of murders, with three callous and cold-blooded murders carried out in the space of a week in recent times.  What is clear is that these gangs have no respect for the laws of this land nor the safety of its citizens.  They are a scourge on this society and by their behaviour demonstrate a callous disregard for everything that a stable and democratic society stands for.  Their nefarious dealings are a cancer that has resulted in the devastation of many lives but nobody is above the law.<\/p><p>Although the provision has been in place since 2009 and while there have been arrests under the relevant offences, 2018 was the first time that convictions in respect of offences under section 72 were secured in the Special Criminal Court.  This highlights the considered approach of the DPP in using her discretion to direct that cases would be tried in the ordinary courts where it is possible to do so.  The Garda authorities have made clear that this provision continues to be required.  As Minister, I must at all times have the utmost regard for the views of the Garda authorities.<\/p><p>The House will share my view that trial by jury must be preserved to the greatest extent possible.  However, none of us can ignore the threat posed to the criminal process by individuals, terrorist groups and organised criminal groups that seek to intimidate jurors or potential jurors.  Their aim is to subvert the criminal justice system and we cannot allow that to happen.  Therefore, we must take appropriate and proportionate measures to prevent this interference.  In all the circumstances, I consider that it is necessary to continue section 8 in operation for a further period of 12 months beginning on 30 June 2019.  I commend the motions to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019061300002#U00400","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560418200,"counter":236,"content":"<p>We will support the motions.

The Minister referred in his remarks to the tragic loss of Lyra McKee.  I have not had an opportunity to reflect on that since the return of the House so I take the opportunity to again convey my own personal sympathies and solidarity with Lyra's partner and her family and also those of my party.  I knew Lyra McKee primarily through her journalistic writing and through the occasional engagement on social media, but I did once share a platform with her at a F&eacute;ile an Phobail event in west Belfast a number of years ago.  It was a talk-back discussion with young people from across the city.  What struck me about Lyra McKee was that, as we now know was her nature, while we were there to answer questions she was as inquisitive as the young people in the audience.  She asked them their views and it was clear that she was very enthusiastic about encouraging them to be active in their communities and within their own spheres.  Given the Minister's reference, I wanted to take the opportunity to convey our sympathies to Lyra McKee's family.<\/p> <p>As the Minister is aware, we have a difference of opinion on the legislation.  I have outlined it every year since entering this House as the Sinn F&eacute;in spokesperson on justice in the Seanad.  I say respectfully to the Minister, the prevalence and viciousness of gang-related violence in this State is one of the biggest challenges we collectively face.  Not remotely enough is being done to come to terms with it.  It has become a living nightmare for the communities who have to live with it.  People are terrorised and have lost hope that it will come to an end.  There is a climate of fear, violence, intimidation, drug running and other forms of criminality that goes along with such gangsterism.  As a result, there has been a devastating impact on communities.<\/p> <p>There have been six gang-related murders so far this year, with three in one week, and several more foiled by the work of the Garda.  There were 77 homicides in 2018, 185 arrests for possession of firearms and 89 charges of discharging a firearm.  Between 2016 and 2017 a total of 22 people died in gang-related killings.  The response from the Government has been totally inadequate.  It is still the case that the majority of Garda stations are either at or below their 2014 level.  In real terms, Dublin has lost 512 garda&iacute; since 2009.  Prior to the recent reactions to crime, Coolock and Drogheda were among the stations that saw a reduction in Garda numbers.  Since 2011, Coolock Garda station lost 14 full-time garda&iacute;, while the local anti-drugs unit lost 13 of its 32 personnel.  The problem has gone on and on and the violence continues to spiral out of control.  More will die as it continues.  More families will be bereaved and communities will continue to live in fear.  That is not only my assessment, all of the Garda representative organisations, the Garda Representative Association, GRA, and the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, AGSI, as well as recent Garda Commissioners, have stated repeatedly that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is \"decades\" behind other police forces in terms of numbers, equipment, training and resources.  Privately, GRA members have expressed their view that the Government has been complacent about the increase in gang crime.  I was astonished at the decision not to take on the full complement of Garda recruits this year.  If that is repeated next year, I question whether the Minister will reach his target of 15,000 sworn members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by 2021.

In any event, I am of the view that this is far too modest, and that we should be aiming for in excess of 16,000 garda&iacute;.  In the last four months of 2018 there was an embargo on overtime in the Garda.  We have seen a 40% reduction in community policing.  The South has one of the lowest police-to-population ratios in Europe with 278 garda&iacute; per 100,000 citizens, which is 40 fewer than the EU average.<\/p><p>I recognise that the front-line members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, are doing all within their power to confront this problem.  I note the actions of the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, in recent days, and I note also that countless operations by garda&iacute; have stopped crime and killings, and I pay tribute to them for that.  However, the Government is not putting in place the resources they need.  According to Seamus Boland of the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau, the Garda is targeting &quot;in the region of 20 groups&quot; at any one time.  Some of the groups, such as the Kinahan gang, could have hundreds of people linked to it.  That is the scale of the challenge.<\/p><p>Last year, my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire, called for &quot;a comprehensive review of the emergency legislation in advance of its renewal next year&quot; &ndash; that is now - which would focus on how to modernise the criminal justice system to make it responsive to the needs of Ireland in 2019.  However, that has not happened.  Sinn F&eacute;in believes we need new legislation to repeal the outdated emergency Acts currently in place and to replace them with strengthened legislation providing for new courts to deal with such cases.  The reality is that the Garda and the courts are facing 21st century challenges with 20th century legislation.  The current outdated criminal justice system does not act as a deterrent to organised crime.  It is in fact exploited by it.  Sinn F&eacute;in recognises that there are certain criminal cases which are more difficult to prosecute given the nature of organised crime today.  The opportunity for well organised and well-funded criminal enterprises to influence juries, tamper with evidence or intimidate witnesses is greater than in the vast majority of criminal cases.  While always supporting, defending and promoting the judicial norms of the right to a jury trial, only in very special circumstances should we deviate from that in order to protect the judicial process.  Currently, hearings at the Family Court are held <i>in camera<\/i>while the drug treatment court is a specialised court operating within the legal system.  Therefore, Sinn F&eacute;in does not oppose special courts and court procedures to deal with the very specific circumstances of violent, organised criminal gangs which present serious threats to the security of the State and communities when the ordinary courts are prevented from securing the effective administration of justice.  The Constitution provides for that.<\/p><p>The manner in which we try cases involving serious crime is not adequate, and we must offer greater protections to jurors and witnesses to ensure greater success in putting criminals away.  The kind of legislative change required has been debated, some of which has been considered by bodies such as the Law Reform Commission.  We believe there is a need to create a specific offence for tampering with a jury.  We also believe there is a need to increase penalties for intimidation of jurors under section 41 of the Criminal Justice Act 1999.  There are undoubtedly circumstances where it will be appropriate, necessary and proportionate to provide for the anonymisation of juries and witnesses.  The Government has, rightly, provided that for witnesses recently in the Domestic Violence Act and it could be provided for here as well.  It could be done via screens in a court room or in very particular circumstances, remote location of jurors with a video link to the court room.  We should take all steps necessary to ensure the safety of jurors and witnesses, but the Government has not even considered these matters.  Such legislation could have an inbuilt independent review of legislation to ensure its effectiveness and that it is rights proofed.  That is something the Commission on the Future of Policing has recommended, and I expect the Minister to implement it.<\/p><p>I could say much more but I am stuck for time.  My Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues have articulated our long-stated view on the matter and the Minister is aware of it.  We want to get this right and to approach it in a human rights compliant way that ensures the right outcome for all of us.  We do not shy away from challenging criminal gangs and we do not shy away from so-called dissidents, North or South, who are more likely to challenge people like me on a daily basis and to threaten members of my party than anyone else.  We do not shy away from that.  We must ensure the emergency legislation is fit for the 21st century rather than an outdated 20th century piece of work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019061300002#W00500","speaker":"1413"},{"type":"speech","time":1560418200,"counter":243,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister back to the House.

Like other colleagues, I have spoken many times in this House on the debate as to renewal.  Last night in the D&aacute;il, my colleague, Deputy Sherlock, spoke on amendments to the motions.  In light of what ensued in the D&aacute;il, I do not propose to press the amendments.  However, as Deputy Sherlock said, there is a question for us in the Oireachtas to determine in respect of these renewal motions.<\/p> <p>I should also add my voice to that of other colleagues in acknowledging the context in which the Government is putting forward the motion, in particular the tragic and horrific death of Lyra McKee in Derry.  I want to express my utter condemnation of that appalling murder and my sympathy to her family, her friends and her community.  Of course, that reminded us of the ongoing threat of dissident republican and paramilitary violence, about which the Minister has spoken.  I share with others the condemnation of organised crime and the impact it is having on so many communities, notably, and most recently, in north inner city Dublin.  I acknowledge that context in which we are debating the renewal of these motions.<\/p> <p>As Deputy Sherlock said last night, as legislators, we must always remember the provisions we are scrutinising are subject to annual scrutiny precisely because they represent an interference with due process rights of the accused and with the normal standards of criminal justice, and the Minister has very fairly acknowledged this.  We need to ensure we are complying with our required functions under the Constitution and legislation.  Article 38.3.1&deg; of the Constitution states that in order for specified offences to be tried in non-jury courts, the inadequacy of the ordinary courts to administer justice must be determined in accordance with law.  Deputy Sherlock spoke about what that means and about the need, therefore, for the Houses of the Oireachtas to consider annually whether the ordinary courts are inadequate to administer justice in these cases, in order for the requirements of the legislation to be complied with.<\/p> <p>The Oireachtas has delegated to the D&aacute;il and the Seanad the decision to be taken annually as to whether the courts remain inadequate, and that is the basis on which these motions are passed every year.  The difficulty for us is that the statutory report which the Minister furnishes to both Houses annually always gives the number of times each offence has been prosecuted, the arrests made under each provision and so on, but what it does not give us in any detail is consideration as to the adequacy of the ordinary courts to administer justice and why the Government is saying the ordinary courts are inadequate to administer justice.  That is the point which was the kernel of the proposed amendments that were debated in the D&aacute;il last night by Deputy Sherlock.<\/p> <p>As I have said in previous years, as well as scrutinising the basis on which the motions are put forward and the basis on which the Government is saying the ordinary courts are inadequate, we also need to take cognisance of the pattern of usage and, indeed, non-usage of the different provisions.  I note in respect of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act that there are a number of sections which have not been used at all in the past year.  Indeed, when one looks back, there is a pattern non-usage of certain provisions under sections 3, 6, 8, 9, 12 and 17.  It is similar with the Criminal Justice Act where, again, we see no arrests made under section 71A in the last year, which is the provision on directing the activities of a criminal organisation.  Where we see a pattern of non-usage, as legislators, we need to inquire as to whether it is necessary every year to renew those specific provisions.  It is not just the general issue as to whether or not the ordinary courts are inadequate but also the continuance in operation of specific provisions where there is a pattern of non-usage.<\/p> <p>I put these issues forward.  As I said, I do not propose to press a vote on the issue today and I acknowledge the ongoing threat of dissident republican activity in the North and the threat of organised crime.  However, where we are providing for a non-jury courts on this exceptional basis, where we are saying that under the Constitution the ordinary courts are inadequate, we need, and we will be requiring in future years, a higher level of evidence to be offered to us by the Government as to why it is said the ordinary courts are inadequate to administer justice in these specific instances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019061300002#X00200","speaker":"1402"},{"type":"speech","time":1560418200,"counter":246,"content":"<p>I am grateful to the House for its consideration of these two motions.

To those in the House who have argued that the Special Criminal Court is no longer needed, that its use is unjustified, or even, as has been said not on this occasion but on other occasions in the House, that it has been in some way partisan, I respectfully and firmly disagree with these assertions.  I reiterate my belief that juries should be used as much as possible.  The Constitution guarantees individuals the right to trial by jury in respect of serious offences.  However, the Constitution also recognises the reality that there may be offences which cannot be properly adjudicated upon by a jury because of the threat posed to the State and to individual jurors.<\/p> <p>The Special Criminal Court continues to be a necessary response to such threats faced by the State.  As I have previously stated for the record, its judges have performed courageous public service in presiding in court without fear or favour over the prosecution of some of the most dangerous terrorists and ruthless criminals in the State.  The court has proved its value over the years and it continues to do so.  The very real threat to our society that comes from dissident republican paramilitary groups and the brutality of ruthless crime gangs needs an effective and particular response from the criminal justice system.  As parliamentarians, we have a duty to support the Garda and the justice system in tackling these threats.  I am committed to providing the necessary resources and legislative supports to combat those who seek to undermine the law and to damage lives and communities in doing so.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Charles Flanagan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=414\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=414&amp;amp;pid=CharlesFlanagan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I will comment briefly on the points raised by Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile in respect of Garda resources.  There has been unprecedented investment in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in recent years, in support of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement and provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  The resources provided by the Government to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have reached unprecedented levels, with an allocation for 2019 of &euro;1.76 billion.  This represents an increase of over 6% over the initial allocation for 2018.<\/p><p>The programme for Government commits to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement and provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  In July 2016 the Government agreed an overall vision for the Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021, to include 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Garda Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  This Government is on target for this goal and, while the Senator mentioned a change to recruitment figures for this year, he omitted to mention the resolve on the part of the Garda Commissioner to ensure an influx of civilian workers into An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019061300002#X00300","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560418200,"counter":248,"content":"<p>I support that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019061300002#Y00200","speaker":"1413"},{"type":"speech","time":1560418200,"counter":249,"content":"<p>The renewal of section 8 of the 2009 Act is a contribution to the overall framework of measures in seeking to tackle organised crime.
